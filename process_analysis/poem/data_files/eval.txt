There Is A Place From Our Childhood; We Like To Visit Now And Then, To Recapture Our Youth, Through The Years That Has Slipped Away. A Place That Has A Magic Touch, Even Through The Years It Has Changed. A Place Where Sunshine, Still Dances On The Water Of Rippling Waves. Where The Wildlife Still Gather, Free From Harm. A Place Of Solitude, Where You Can Find A Little Peace Of Mind. A Place Within A City That Has Not Been Strangled By Any Human Hand. Somewhere You Can While Time Away, With Dreams Of Another Day.
We Shall Not Ever Meet Them Bearded In Heaven Nor Sunning Themselves Among The Bald Of Hell; If Anywhere, In The Deserted Schoolyard At Twilight, Forming A Ring, Perhaps, Or Joining Hands In Games Whose Very Names We Have Forgotten. Come Memory, Let Us Seek Them There In The Shadows.

Ruthlessly The Judgement Was Pronounced A Shameful Death Sentence To Be Carried Out At The Place Of A Skull For All To See And Mock Him Despite His Innocence, Clearly Proved Beyond All Doubt Despite His Goodness To All And Sundry Despite His Love To Everyone This Judgement Was Upheld By All But With Joy In His Heart He Embraced His Death So That The Will Of He, Who Sent Him, May Be Fulfilled So That All, Including His Execusioners, Will Be Reconcilled To The Creator So That No Soul Will Be Lost This Is A Sacrifice That Is Beyond All Sacrifice A Sacrifice Of Life Which Was Exceptional Lord Jesus Christ, Thanks For Your Sacrifice.
I Started Out Long Ago With A Handful Of Dreams, But Through The Years, Every One Of Them Vanished Or So It Seemed To Me. They Say That Chance Plays A Big Part In Our Lives, And It Was By Chance Someone Recognised Me From An Old Photograph Now My Dreams Have Returned And Slowly Each Are Coming True. Just As I Turned Away From The Road A Head, I Have Turned Back To Greater Things. Once I Abandoned My Life, Felt It Was Going Nowhere. Thanks To Chance I Have Found Myself Again And A Brighter Future Somewhere. 10 April 2008.

She Is So Sorry. She Has Not Seen Love There.
Closeted I Stare At This Red Door. Ajar, But As Open To Me As A Vault. My Nightmare Is My Salvation. Silence Now Awakening, Keeping Me Distraught. Reaching Out, I Wonder, Am I Within A Dream? Surreal, Languid, And Impatient Is My Eternity. Crying Effortlessly, I Grasp What Is Not Real. Abrupt Realization That I Can No Longer See. Starving, I Face A Feast Of Emotion Turning Green With Mold And Decay. Wondering If Yesterday Is My Tomorrow, Or If My Tomorrow Is Tortured Delay. Fuming With My Desires So Depleted. My Song Bursts Into Dirges For Peace. A Warrior Facing The Last Battle. The Rose In Winter Can Never Be Me. Alone With My Red Door With Keys In Each Hand. Twisting, Turning, Yet No Key Fits Inside. Silent Indignation Of My Caged Facade. Pain Beyond Redemption Walks At My Side. Copyright 2006 A.j. Mckinley.

Chinese Wedding Two Red Candles Burn Though The Night Wax Sizzles, Drips, Drips With Our Red Hot Passion For Each Other Drips, Drips Fluidly Down The Bar The Whole Night Drips, Drips, With Each Pause Of Our Desire Each Hug Of Our Affirmation For Each Other Drips, Drips With Our Thirst For Each Other Drips, Drips And Clings To The Bar, Warm As Our Bosoms Drips, Drips Solidifying The Night Into Our Assurance For Each Other Drips Drips Till The Morning Turning The Night Into An Ecstatic Tour De Force, A Union Crystallising In A Mass Of Bliss Resting Quiet On The Base Of Two Exhaust Candles.
I Have Bright Red Angry Screams. Not Within The Voice Of Me. But In The Cuts On My Arms. I Cut And Cut. Now My Scream Is Out And Free. My Screams Are Nasty Red Cuts. Angrier By The Day.

If I Gave 5 Birds Each 4 Eyes I Would Be Blind Unto The 3rd Generation, If I Gave No One A Word For A Day And Let The Day Grow Into A Week And The Week Sleep Until It Was Half Of My Life Could I Come Home To My Father One Dark Night? On Sundays An Odd Light Grows On The Bed Where I Have Lived This Half Of My Life Alight That Begins With The Eyes Blinding First One And Then Both Until At Last Even The Worn Candles In The Flower Box Lay Down Their Heads. Therefore I Have Come To This Red Shirt With Its Faultless Row Of Dark Buttons, 7 By My Count, As Dark As Blood That Poured Over My Lips When The First Word Of Hope Jumped And Became A Cry Of Birds Calling For Their Wings, A Cry Of New Birds. This Is The Red Shirt Adam Gave To The Angel Of Death When He Asked For A Son, This Is The Flag Moses Waved 5 Times Above His Head As He Stumbled Down The Waves Of The Mountainous Sea Bearing The Tables Of 10, This Is The Small Cloth Mother Put In My Lunch Box With Bread And Water. This Is My Red Shirt In Which I Go To Meet You, Father Of The Sea, In Which I Will Say The Poem I Learned From The Mice. A Row Of Faultless Buttons, Each One 10 Years And The Eye Of The Bird That Beheld The First World And The Last, A Field Of Great Rocks Weeping, And No One To See Me Alone, Day After Day, In My Red Shirt.
I Like Red It Dances For Me Rolling Down My Fingers So Pretty Red The Way She Dances So Pretty The Red Makes It Better The Floor Shiny With Red In Patterns I Can See Them Like Butterflies Or Faces Dancing Across The Patterns Making New Patterns She Makes Them Singing Red So Happy With The Singing And Dancing The Red Dances With Her Like The Rain On My Window Red So Much Red My Whole World Red My Hands Red Her Pretty Dress Red The Floor And Walls Red Redredred So Happy And Red She Sang From The Red On Her Throat Like A Flute Or A Fountain So Red Red Red Red Dancing Spasms To Music On The Floor And In My Head Red Whole World Red Redredred.
Across The Red Sky Two Birds Flying, Flying With Drooping Wings. Silent And Solitary Their Ominous Flight. All Day The Triumphant Sun With Yellow Banners Warred And Warred With The Earth, And When She Yielded Stabbed Her Heart, Gathered Her Blood In A Chalice, Spilling It Over The Evening Sky. When The Dark Plumaged Birds Go Flying, Flying, Quiet Lies The Earth Wrapt In Her Mournful Shadow, Her Sightless Eyes Turned To The Red Sky And The Restlessly Seeking Birds.
Red Flags The Reason For Pretty Flags. And Ribbons. Ribbons Of Flags And Wearing Material Reason For Wearing Material. Give Pleasure. Can You Give Me The Regions. The Regions And The Land. The Regions And Wheels. All Wheels Are Perfect. Enthusiasm.
A Single Red Rose Lays On A Grave, For Someone Buried There. It Spoke Of Love, That Would Always Remain Strong, Even Though The Loved One Was Now Gone. It Spoke Of Something Lasting, Beyond Our Living Days. Tells The Story About Love That Never Ever Fades Away. The Love That Seeds Devotion, Even After Death. That Single Red Rose Spoke To Me, Of All The Things, We Cherish Most, And How Much Each Of Us. Would Like To Have That Loving Care, With A Single Red Rose For All To See And Share. 14 June 2007.

A Child Abused A Gift From God Refused, Insanity At Its Peak, Makes Young And Vulnerable Weak. Beyond The Scene Of Laughter A Murky Cry Of Torture. It Pains To See, A Child Humbled And Scared, With Pain In The Eyes, Unspoken Fear Of Shame, And A Broken Pride. A Gloom Of Darkness Around Him Spreads, Afraid To Trust And, Mind Never At Rest, Shadow Of Torture Tears His Being, All His Life He Sees Himself Dieing. A Childhood Thus, Pain Imprints In Mind, What Ever Happened, To That Glorious Smile.? A Child Gift Of God, A Blessing For Parents, A Laughter In The Home, Dont Lose Him, To The Darkness Of Fate Take Care Of Him, It Is Never Too Late.
Am I Evil, For Having These Thoughts In My Head.? Am I Evil, For Thinking Things Of Dread? Am I Evil, For Not Believing What You Do? Am I Evil, For Ripping People In Two? Am I Evil, For Simply Speaking My Mind? Am I Evil, For Leaving You Behind? Am I Evil, For Trying To Do Things Right? Am I Evil, For Giving You A Fright? Am I Evil, For Leaving You Alone In Life? Am I Evil, For Not Wanting To Be Your Wife? Am I Evil, For Doing The Things I Do? Am I Evil, Hang On, Why Am I Asking You?.
I Am An Angel. I Am Of No Good. Im An Angel But More Like A Parasite. I Feed On Your Fears. I Pray On Your Insecureities. I Feed On Your Despare. I Am Your Demon Angel. I Live To Make Your Life Hell. It Is A Story Left Unsaid. I And Only I No. I Am Here To Destroy You. I Hate You. For I Am The Angel Of Depression. And I Will Eat Away At You Day By Day. One Day I Will Destroy You.

So Innocence Is Just A Lie Born, Broken, We Die And Why Did Evil Enter This World Wearing My Face? Chaos, Wind, Love, All Forming But Not Formed Blood Star, Leaking Children Eating Sunlight, Vomiting Night For Pities Sake Turn On The Light For Pities Sake Turn On The Light.
I Hear The Tap . . . , Tap . . . , Tap . . . , Of The Tropical Rain, Way Down South . . . Further Than The Rio Grande. I Can Hear It, Deep In My Mind, From Way Back In My Native Land, Back Where I Was Born . . . When I Was There. And The Tap . . . , Tap . . . , Tap . . . , Fading Away Through Dancing Droplets On The Ground, I Will Always Hear, Until I Arrive At The Place, Where Forevermore, I Will Abide.

Comes From The Dark Cloud That Makes A Noise Loud Rain, Cold Rain Tinkles So Softly Like A Slow Moving Train Rain, Happy Rain Enriched The Dry Land With Many A Soft Hand Rain, Shining Rain Like The Clumps Of Water Pearls That Comes Again And Again Rain, Heavy Rain Relieving The Overpowering Heat Whether A Hill Or A Plain Rain, Dumping Rain Filling The Street With Water Turning It Into The Overflowing Drain Rain, Drizzling Rain Making The Children Cheerful Forgetting All Their Pain.
Rain Rain Rain, Up Above From The Skies Youu Come, As Drops Of Joy As Drops Of Sorrow As A Shower Of Blessing From The Heavens.

Let The Rain Kiss You Let The Rain Beat Upon Your Head With Silver Liquid Drops Let The Rain Sing You A Lullaby The Rain Makes Still Pools On The Sidewalk The Rain Makes Running Pools In The Gutter The Rain Plays A Little Sleep Song On Our Roof At Night And I Love The Rain.
When The Sun Comes After Rain And The Bird Is In The Blue, The Girls Go Down The Lane Two By Two. When The Sun Comes After Shadow And The Singing Of The Showers, The Girls Go Up The Meadow, Fair As Flowers. When The Eve Comes Dusky Red And The Moon Succeeds The Sun, The Girls Go Home To Bed One By One. And When Life Draws To Its Even And The Day Of Man Is Past, They Shall All Go Home To Heaven, Home At Last.
The Moon Still Shines Like That Of Ages Old, Holding Distant Secrets Like A Tale Yet To Be Told, The Sun In All Its Blinding Beauty Continues To Lend Us Its Rays, Enriching Us With Memories Of Those Blisfull Youthspent Days. The Sea Still Massages The Sandy Golden Shores, Passing From The Sea Gods Ever Open Jaws. The Rain Still Travels From Open Blue Skys, Showering The Land As The Sky God Cries. The Wind Whispers Words Of Both Hope And Depair, In Hope It Strokes The Heads Of Ours So Very Fair, The Moon And The Sun And The Sea The Rain And The Wind, Do What They Have Done Since Time Began, Yet Man, Yes Man Has Changed Grown More Hungry, And In Turn Has Robbed The Earth Of Its Enchanting Energy, Man Has Bombed, And Slaughtered, And Destroyed, Man Has Teased And Tested And Toyed. And As I, A Man Am Washed By The Nightly Visit Of Rain, Tears Of Fear Fall In Unsison With The Cloudy Droplets, I Was Not Meant For Times Like These, I Am A Passer By A Silent Hooded Journey Man, Swaying In The Comfort Of The Invisible Breeze. Wanting And Waiting With Poetic Patience, To Be Taken Away On The Wings Of Timeless Words.
Rain On Me, My God Rain On Me. Make Me Naked. Pour Your Rain On My Body In My Soul On And In My Heart And In My Intellect. I Want To Be Wet With You, My God. Rain On Me My God Rain On Me.

I Was A Union Soldier. The Battles Were Long, Bloody And Tiring. I Often Had Streaks Of Blood All Over My Uniform. At Times I Would Feel Down. Really Down And Depressed, Full Of Despair And Gloom. But One Time, This Family Took Me In When I Was Wounded At Gettysburg. They Pretty Much Saved My Life. They Saved Me From Dying On The Road. Their Little Boy Would Look In On Me With His Big Bright Blue Eyes. He Always Shared His Iced Tea With Me. I Would Watch Him Rock Back And Forth On His Wooden Horse, Amazed At How The Years Had Gone By Since My Own Childhood. I Went Back To Visit The Family After The War. I Was Saddened To Find Out That The Little Boy Had Died. Scarlet Fever Just Up And Got Him. A Lump Formed In My Throat, My Heart Felt Like It Had Been Crushed. I Just Cried And Cried. I Felt I Could Almost Drown In All Those Tears. Every Time I Drink Some Cool Iced Tea I Remember That Little Boy.

I Lived My Days Apart, Dreaming Fair Songs For God; By The Glory In My Heart Covered And Crowned And Shod. Now God Is In The Strife, And I Must Seek Him There, Where Death Outnumbers Life, And Fury Smites The Air. I Walk The Secret Way With Anger In My Brain. O Music Through My Clay, When Will You Sound Again?.

The Soldier Fights For The People, The Soldier Fights For Good, The Soldier Fights Against Evil. Evil Fights Against The Soldier, Good Fights With The Soldier, The People Help The Soldier. The Soldier Fights For The Politicians, The Soldier Fights For His Country, The Soldier Fights For His Religion. The Politicians Send Him Of To Fight, The Country Supports His Strength, His Religion Holds Him Back.
I Was Born A Soldier, To Protect Some Place, That Was Never My Own. I Was The Perfect Soldier, Until He Came Along, And Ruined It Forever. He Was My Celestial Soldier, He Was My First True Love.

So In The End I Have Become, My Own Celestial Soldier, For I Can Never Have My Own Again.

I Had No Time To Hate, Because The Grave Would Hinder Me, And Life Was Not So Ample I Could Finish Enmity. Nor Had I Time To Love, But Since Some Industry Must Be, The Little Toil Of Love, I Thought, Was Large Enough For Me.

A Prisoner Of My Own Wish, For Loneliness. My Soul Seperates To Another World, When Myraid Thoughts, Make Entry, Into My Mind. Spearing Through In Fast Speed, An Idea Promptly Developing, Into A Poem. At Other Times, All My Thoughts, Form Into A Knotted Ball, And Fall Into, A Dark Abyss Of Blackness. But When I Climb, The Staircase Of Darkness Suddenly A Light Reveals To Show Me, That I Belong To Another World And A New Poem Is Born.

Families, When A Child Is Born Want It To Be Intelligent. I, Through Intelligence, Having Wrecked My Whole Life, Only Hope The Baby Will Prove Ignorant And Stupid. Then He Will Crown A Tranquil Life By Becoming A Cabinet Minister.
No Religion Will Bring It To You No Merchant Can Supply It. No King May Decree It. No Empire Implores It It Cannot Exist Until They Are Gone It Will Not Be Born Until The Will Of Man Is Broken When Religion Becomes The Tool Of Nature When Merchants Live With The Forest. When Kings Hear The Song Of The Earth When Empires Dance To The Rhythms Of The People It Cannot Live Until All We Know Is Dead It Will Not Know The Light Until The Long Day Is Done. Peace.

She Lay Safe In My Arms Her Eyes Closed In Sleep, I Gazed At Her Beautiful Features To Me They Are Certainly Unique. Her Lovely Long Eye Lashes, Her Complexion Like A Rose, And That Irresistible Cute Shaped Nose. I Bent Over To Kiss Her Soft Velvet Like Skin, The Aroma That Exuded From Her Body Made Me Feel Really Good Within. I Am A Lucky Guy To Have Such A Beauty Lying By My Side. I Drifted Of To Sleep Feeling A Certain Amount Of Pride. I Was Awakened In The Night By An Almighty Yell, It Was My Beauty Crying Like Hell. I Jumped Up Startled, And Looked Around And Found Her Dummy Lying On The Ground.

Like Any Other Changeling She Was Waiting To Transform Waiting For Her Arms To Curl Into Flaps Waiting For Another Set Of Legs To Emerge Standing Before The Mirror Of Transformation With The Decal In The Upper Corner Of The Glass Of A White Winged Unicorn Suddenly The Thought Of Morphing Frightened Her A Bit As She Thought Of The Impossibility Of Being In The Ballet Or Riding On An Airplane To Visit Her Aunt She Crossed Her Fingers Canceling Her Wish To Be A Unicorn She Spun Three Times Before The Magic Mirror And Closed Her Eyes Hoping That When She Opened Them She Would Just Be Herself And Wondering As She Did This Exactly Who Or What She Was.
Im Lost, Ive Been This Way, Ten Years To The Day, I Still Cannot Find What I Am Looking For Until, I Found My Mirror, At First I Overlooked Its Powers, But I Suddenly Saw The Beauty I Saw Hope, Something Save My From My Terror I Grow Excited, I Dance Around, Hoping That I Do Not Break It Hope That Do Not Destroy This Beauty Or Seven Years Of Bad Luck Will Befall Me, But If I Do Not Dance With It, I Also Fear That It Will No Longer Want Me It May Betray And Leave Me Lost Once Again, Lost.
Seeing Is Believing. Whatever Was Thought Or Said, These Persistent, Inexorable Deaths Make Faith As Such Absent, Our Humanness A Question, A Disgust For What We Are. Whatever The Hope, Here It Is Lost. Because We Coveted Our Difference, Here Is The Cost.
Mirrors, Awful Things, Yet Beautiful At The Same Time, They Show You What You Wish To See, Yet Not Always What You May Like, They Show The Truth, The Harrowing Truth, That Leads To Many Deaths, And To Many Futures, Some Great, Some Dire, Some Over Before They Even Begin.
A Mirror Hung Upon A Wall. A Man, Quite Handsome, Also Tall Stepped Up To Look Inside The Glass And Gave Himself The Nod, The Pass. He Saw Exquisite, Handsome Features Superior To All Other Creatures. Black Hair And Pearl White Teeth To Smile Amana Suit Completes The Style. His Nails Were Short And Manicured Flat Stomach Muscles Had Endured So Many Sessions Of The Crunches And, From Inside, Martini Lunches. Two Diamonds Hung From His Sleeves And Maple Golden Rings, Like Leaves Adorned Pink Ears And Looked Expensive His Jewellery Was Quite Extensive And In Addition, On His Arms Two Rolexes, With Loud Alarms. He Stood And Looked From Head To Toes But Did Not Know A Mirror Shows To All The World Just Your Outside What Counts Is All The Things You Hide. For Mahnaz Whose Poem Inspired Me As Much As She Does.
When I Look In The Mirror, What Do I See? A Beautiful Human Being Staring Right Back At Me When I Move Grade To Grade, What Has Been Shown? My Smartness And How Much My Progress Has Grown When I Read A Book, Cover To Cover I Always Go Back To Get Another Some May Ask, How Do I Dress I May Answer, I Dress To Impress When I Go Out I Present Myself With Pride You Can Tell By The Way I Walk, Stride For Stride When You Look In The Mirror, What Do You See? I See A Beautiful Human Being Staring Right Back At Me.
Shades Of Green And Aqua Blue The Sea Painted A Thousand Hues Beneath Thundering Ocean Wave Out Of The Reach Of Mariners Graves A Living Testimony Swims In Majesty Once The Rulers Of The Sea A Whale Song Rings From Beneath The Ocean A Song Of Praise And True Devotion To The God Of Creation And Of The Sea A Sea Being Robbed By Cruel Thieves The Whale Song Drifts Silently Away The Hands Of Man Have Silenced Their Praise As God Looks Down In His Majesty As Tears Trickle Down On The Silent Sea.
The Old Moon Is Tarnished With Smoke Of The Flood, The Dead Leaves Are Varnished With Colour Like Blood. A Treacherous Smiler With Teeth White As Milk, A Savage Beguiler In Sheathings Of Silk The Sea Creeps To Pillage, She Leaps On Her Prey; A Child Of The Village Was Murdered Today. She Came Up To Meet Him In A Smooth Golden Cloak, She Choked Him And Beat Him To Death, For A Joke. Her Bright Locks Were Tangled, She Shouted For Joy With One Hand She Strangled A Strong Little Boy. Now In Silence She Lingers Beside Him All Night To Wash Her Long Fingers In Silvery Light.
White Caped Waves In The Curl Of The Sea Smell Of The Ocean Air On The White Sandy Beach. Colors Of The Sky Roaring Of The Sea Walking In The Wet Sand With My Hair Blowing In The Breeze. Rolling Of The Waves Splashing On The Beach Seagulls Flying Over In The Roaring Sea. Reflections From The Sun Casting Colors Upon The Sea Splashing Of The Waves That Roll Under My Feet.
Who Lay Against The Sea, And Fled, Who Lightly Loved The Wave, Shall Never Know, When He Is Dead, A Cool And Murmurous Grave. But In A Shallow Pit Shall Rest For All Eternity, And Bear The Earth Upon The Breas That Once Had Worn The Sea.

Christmas List And Christmas Wish All Apart Of The Christmas Theme Without Any Of It Its Like There Is No Meaning But Im Here To Tell Im Here To Yell That Christmas Is Not All About You Christmas She Get You In The Spirit For What You Need To Do Help The Poor Help The Needy Help The Ones That Dont Get This Or That Help The Ones That Have That And This Christmas Is Not All About You If I Need To Yell Or Scream To Tell You What Christmas Means I Will I Promise Because Christmas Is Not All About Me Its Not All About You Just What You Need To Do.

Each Of Us Is Reflecting, Blue Carbon Paper, Created To Resemblance.

Watching The Dismal Streets, The Rain Splasing Down, Drip Dropp Drip Drop The Loss Of Life. Watching Friends Play Footie The Silence Of The Body In Which Life Would Have Left For Another. The Silent Solace. Watching, The Eyes Red Tears Extending Their Arms Down The Eyes Slowly. The Joy Lost In Despair. Madness For Life In Turn To Bring It To A Halt And Sort Out The Puzzled Brain.

We Spoke Like Sweet Rivers, Radiant In The Sun And Forever Flowing; Until The Virus Grew Inside Of You, And You Were Swept Away From Me And Now Live In My Dreams, For You Will Never Be Forgotten, My Uncle.

Words Fall Short To Express A Sense Of Loss. It Can Only Be Felt In The Emptiness It Left. In The Longing Of Your Heart, In Some Chamber Of Your Soul, For A Dear One Gone In A Flash, We Are Forever Apart.

With Time The Ache Becomes Dull, And From Time To Time You Find Yourself Awake Tossing, Turning Going Down The Memory Lane, Some Sweet Some Full Of Pain. You Are Never Whole, As Long As There Is A Longing In Your Soul. In Time You Realise You Have To Let Go, And Make Peace And Deal With Grief. Finally When It Does, You Grow Wise Compassionate And Loving, And Gain A New Insight Into Life That Is A Mystery.

The Well, The Strong, Will Never Understand The Sick, The Broken, Till The Great Deomocrat Comes. It Is Easy To Pretend That We Do Not Hear The Cold Wind Because It Is Not Felt Upon Our Necks.

But Even In Defeat This Earth Can Be Sweet And Leaving It No Easy Task.

The Joyous New Year Revellers Were Making Lots Of Noise And At Midnight They Sang And Cheered And Fireworks Lit The Skies But One Teenager With Heaving Guts Perhaps From Too Much Beer Was Spewing On The Side Walk At The Birth Of A New Year. Too Drunk For To Be Merry And Too Sick To Enjoy The New Year Celebrations And To Bid The Old Goodbye Perhaps She Spent Her New Year Hung Over Feeling Fuzzy In The Head With Very Little Energy Recovering In Her Bed. Her Body Had Rejected Some Of The Poison She Had Taken In And She Could Have Chose A Better Way For Her New Year To Begin A Young Woman In Her Late Teens And At The Age Of Choice And For Over Indulgence One Might Say There Is A Price. The Biggest Party Of Any Year For All To Celebrate And Even Strangers Greeted Me With A Happy New Year Mate And Lots Of New Year Revellry And Happiness And Joy And Smiles And Mirth And Laughter Were In Plentiful Supply. But I Saw One Young Woman Quite Oblivious To It All Bent Over On The Side Walk By A Brick Garden Wall With Her Heaving Guts Expelling Some Of The Poison She Had Taken In She Might Have Chosen A More Pleasant Way For Her New Year To Begin.

I Was Thinking About A Lot Of Things Messy Things Like A Pool Of Thread Being Played By The Kitten At The Living Room And The Dogs Were Flying Kites The Mice Are Taking All The Cheese, I Was Thinking About A Lot Of Poems With Gentle Faces Wearing Straw Hats On The Beach, A Lot Of Stories With Eyelashes Curling And Lips Lusciously Biting Each Other, When I Was Sick They Tell Me I Was Sick My Mind Is Sick And I Am Not Aware About The Sensitivity Of The Situation, Which I Always Consider As Nothing But Another Form Of Temporary Sensuality, I Was Thinking About My Favorite Dish And Those Who Dine With Me Their Hands Inside My Pants.

But Why Be Fearful Of Your Slaves, Those You Whip And Beat Treating Like The Dirt From The Doormat Where You Wipe Your Feet.

Peace, My Heart, Let The Time For The Parting Be Sweet. Let It Not Be A Death But Completeness. Let Love Melt Into Memory And Pain Into Songs. Let The Flight Through The Sky End In The Folding Of The Wings Over The Nest. Let The Last Touch Of Your Hands Be Gentle Like The Flower Of The Night. Stand Still, O Beautiful End, For A Moment, And Say Your Last Words In Silence. I Bow To You And Hold Up My Lamp To Light You On Your Way.
There Was A Man Who Lived A Life Of Fire. Even Upon The Fabric Of Time, Where Purple Becomes Orange And Orange Purple, This Life Glowed, A Dire Red Stain, Indelible; Yet When He Was Dead, He Saw That He Had Not Lived.
Fire Never Dies, Just Smoulders, Like Love You Need To Fan It, To Keep The Flame Alive. Like The Smouldering Embers, That Needs Only A Little Attention, To Become A Flame Again. So The Parting Lovers, Need Only To Kiss To Ignite The Flame, And Start The Passion Again.
As I Am Honored With Grace Impassionate That Dazzles In Me And My Innate Grin Glamoured By Setting Rays In The Sky Along The White Clouds As Cohered. That Boost Me Up Like Waves In The Sea With All Its Blues When Being Cuddled In The Spring The Lap Of Tranquil As In Moon. When The Clouds Moves Apart Above It Is The Sun Yet Steeped In Blood Promising Of The Love As Prologued As Twilight Descends Slowly I Do Remember The Thrills Of Passion As Revered By The Bliss Of Love When Reckoning To The Flames Of Fire.
The Boy With Fire In His Eyes Stands There Waiting. It Is His Soul Inside; It Keeps Him Standing. And If Ever The Fire Goes Out, He Will Freeze In The Cold. It Is His Heat And All That Keeps Him Living. Or If It Never Is Put To Use, It Will Consume Him; He Will Burn To The Ground His Ashes Left Behind. But If The Fire Blazes, If Kindled, Kept And Carried, If The Boy With Fire In His Eyes Finds Life Inside That Fire, His Fire Will Light The World, Will Pierce The Mist, A Fire To Drive The Dark Away Forever And Ever More.
I Will Read Ashes For You, If You Ask Me. I Will Look On The Fire And Tell You From The Gray Lashes And Out Of The Red And Black Tongues And Stripes, I Will Tell How Fire Comes And How Fire Runs Far As The Sea.
Turning You Hold Your Arms Up My Eyes Touch Where You Turn The Shouts From The Fire Line Crew And The Collapsing Column Of Smoke The Shape Of Your Look As You Turn Again Nearly Trapped By The Fire Overrunning The West Side Road We Run The Escape Route I Hold Your Face To Me Always Where You Are.
Oh Day Of Fire And Sun, Pure As A Naked Flame, Blue Sea, Blue Sky And Dun Sands Where He Spoke My Name; Laughter And Hearts So High That The Spirit Flew Off Free, Lifting Into The Sky Diving Into The Sea; Oh Day Of Fire And Sun Like A Crystal Burning, Slow Days Go One By One, But You Have No Returning.

Fire Which Gives Us Light Fire Which Is Used For Cooking Fire Which Makes Hot Environment When It Is Cool Fire Which Is Used For Yagna Fire Which Makes To Welding Metals Fire Which Makes You To Achieve Your Goal So, The Fire Which Is Used For Good Cause Other Wise Fire Which Makes You As Ash.
We Come Into This World With Nothing And We Depart With Nothing. You Departed With Nothing. Yet You Took Everything. There Was Something Omnious About That Night, Something Gloomy, Something Fateful. Maybe It Was The Wind And The Rain. Maybe Just A Feeling. I Suppose A Fitting Night To Leave This World As We All Eventually Must. With Nothing. Our Final Flight Wont Be Delayed. Why You Had To Leave I Do Not Know. I Do Not Understand. Maybe It Is Not For Me To Know, Not For Me To Understand. You Where Fire. I Was Ice. You Melted Me. I Soothed You. Alas, A Burning Soul Will Always Leave This World In Flames, As Was Your Fate. Myself? I Returned To My Cold Home In The North Where Ice Belongs, With Nothing. Nothing.
It Was So Fulminating. A Fire Burned Within From Spindly Kindling And A Breath Of Air It Sprang To Life Consuming Obstacles And Dull Objections And Stark Conventions. Iit Jumped All Gaps Yet Was Not Seen By Those Who Could And Bravely Would Rise In Defence In Bold Offence. So Unexpected, Not Wished For Even, It Took On Quickly And Without Mercy A Life Of Egotistic And Autonomic Well, Somewhat Comic And Drooling Presence. So Unprepared So Stunned And Scared Yet Breathing In This Deadly Fragrance And Longing For The Nectar Of A Soul Ordained For Me Alone And Nought Is Left To Say Or Do We Were As Such Simply Because We Had To Be It Was A Law Of Nature One Which Can Not Be Broken By Mere Humans. A Fire Burns So Cleanly When The Darkness Of Our Doubts Is Absent. And As I Float In Saddened Waves Of Smoke And Seek Those Mirrors Which Could Give, Perhaps Be Saviours For Answers From My Soul And Heart My Tortured Mind Does Not Perceive What She Must Know, Perhaps Relieved And Rescued In The Nick Of Love From Devastation. I Miss You So My Heartease Flower But Hope You Will Not Hear Those Words Or Feel The Heat Or Smell The Smoke. And If You See A Distant Fire Be Not Alarmed The Smoke Has Gone.
The Great Chicago Fire, Friends, Will Never Be Forgot; In The History Of Chicago It Will Remain A Darken Spot. It Was A Dreadful Horrid Sight To See That City In Flames; But No Human Aid Could Save It, For All Skill Was Tried In Vain. In The Year Of 1871, In October On The 8th, The People In That City, Then Was Full Of Life, And Great. Less Than Four Days It Lay In Ruins, That Garden City, So Great Lay Smouldering In Ashes, In A Sad And Pitiful State. It Was A Sad, Sad Scene Indeed, To See The Fire Arise, And Hear The Crackling Of The Flames As It Almost Reached The Skies, And Sadder Still, To Hear The Moans, Of People In The Flames Cry For Help, And None Could Get, Ah, Die Where They Remained. To See The People Run For Life; Up And Down The Blazing Streets, To Find Then, Their Escape Cut Off By The Fiery Flaming Sheets, And Others Hunting For Some Friend That Perhaps They Never Found, Such Weeping, Wailing, Never Was Known, For A Thousands Miles Around. Some People Were Very Wealthy On The Morning Of The 10th. But At The Close Of The Evening, Was Poor, But Felt Content, Glad To Escape From Harm With Life With Friends They Loved So Well, Some Will Try To Gain More Wisdom, By The Sad Sight They Beheld. Five Thousand People Were Homeless, Sad Wanderers In The Streets, With No Shelter To Cover Them, And No Food Had They To Eat. They Wandered Down By The Lake Side, Lay Down On The Cold Damp Ground, So Tired And Weary And Homeless, So The Rich, The Poor, Was Found. Mothers With Dear Little Infants, Some Clinging To The Breast.
People Of Every Description All Laid Down There To Rest, With The Sky As Their Covering, Ah, Pillows They Had None. Sad, Oh Sad, It Must Have Been, For Those Poor Homeless Ones. Neighboring Cities Sent Comfort, To The Poor Lone Helpless Ones, And God Will Not Forget Them In All The Years To Come. Now The City Of Chicago Is Built Up Anew Once More, And May It Never Be Visited With Such A Great Fire No More.

Most Days I Feel Like I Am Losing So Much Time Sitting Waiting Hoping For You To Change Never Knowing Quite For Sure If It Is Me Or You That Must Change Always Believed That By Not Moving Making No Decision Is The Same As Making One Wondering If It Is Due To My Lack Of Strength Or No Courage To Take Those Hits That Will Happen If I Choose To Move Now Wish I Knew If This Was Truly My Choice Or One Made Only By Lack Of My Courage.
There Were Many Who Went In Huddled Procession, They Knew Not Whither; But, At Any Rate, Success Or Calamity Would Attend All In Equality. There Was One Who Sought A New Road. He Went Into Direful Thickets, And Ultimately He Died Thus, Alone; But They Said He Had Courage.
I Opened The Door In Answer To A Knock And Seeing Who Stood There Gave Me Quite A Shock For There Stood A Fairy Looking Sad And Forlorn Her Appearance Was Dirty Disheveled And Worn Her Shoes Were All Dusty Her Hair A Tangled Mess She Had Knots In Her Ribbons And Rips In Her Dress Her Face Was Brown Smudged Her Lips Cracked And Dry Her Wings Were So Tattered She No Doubt Could Not Fly. I Welcomed Her In And We Sat Down For Tea This Bedraggled Little Sprite And Still In Shock Me I Asked Her To Tell Me The Tale Of Her Plight She Looked At Me Sadly Tears Made Her Eyes Bright As She Told Me A Story Of Swords, Lords And Knights. Her Beloved Handsome Prince Whom She Loved With All Breath Had Been Wounded Lay Bleeding So Very Near Death Hunched Over His Body While Shouting To The Skies He Grasped Her Hand Tightly Gazed Into Her Eyes He Managed To Whisper With Last Dying Breath Please Go On Without Me In Life Find The Best. As She Finished Her Story I Awoke With A Start To A Knock On My Door And I Felt My Heart Stop I Snuck To The Window And Gave Out A Peek On The Porch Stood A Unicorn With An Ice Cream Cone Horn.

My Love In Dream I See You Thee, Hand In Hand Strolling Beside The Silver Sea Lying On Sand Glowing As Gold Thou Art I Feel Kneeling By My Side I Prayed For Sun Not To Rise And Night To Stay A Little While On The Glowing Silvery Night To Me Once More Thy Foot Steps Tend Following Together Side By Side I Plead With Yearn To Never End For Far And Wide Our Feet Have Traveled Leaving The Marks On My Soul Asif, For Dream Is Dream Just Lie And Bold To Keep The Grip On Hope And Hold.
One Day People Will Touch And Talk Perhaps Easily, And Loving Be Natural As Breathing And Warm As Sunlight, And People Will Untie Themselves, As String Is Unknotted, Unfold And Yawn And Stretch And Spread Their Fingers, Unfurl, Uncurl Like Seaweed Returned To The Sea, And Work Will Be Simple And Swift As A Seagull Flying, And Play Will Be Casual And Quiet As A Seagull Settling, And The Clocks Will Stop, And No One Will Wonder Or Care Or Notice, And People Will Smile Without Reason, Even In Winter, Even In The Rain.
I Am Packing To Go To The Airport But Somehow I Am Never Packed. I Keep Remembering More Things I Keep Forgetting. Secretly The Clock Is Bolting Forward Ten Minutes At A Click Instead Of One. Each Time I Look Away, It Jumps. Now I Remember I Have To Find The Cats. I Have Four Cats Even When I Am Asleep. One Is On The Bed And I Slip Her Into The Suitcase. One Is Under The Sofa. I Drag Him Out. But The Tabby In The Suitcase Has Vanished. Now My Tickets Have Run Away. Maybe The Cat Has My Tickets. I Can Only Find One Cat. My Purse Has Gone Into Hiding. Now It Is Time To Get Packed. I Take The Suitcase Down. There Is A Cat In It But No Clothes. My Tickets Are Floating In The Bath Tub Full Of Water. I Dry Them. One Cat Is In My Purse But My Wallet Has Dissolved. The Tickets Are Still Dripping. I Look At The Clock As It Leaps Forward And See I Have Missed My Plane. My Bed Is Gone Now. There Is One Cat The Size Of A Sofa.
Last Night As I Silently Slept Into My Dreams You Genlty Crept. Recalling Times When You Were There Life Was Breezy Without A Care. Loving You From The Time We Met Walking Together In The Sunset. Knowing Your Warm Tender Embrace Is Something Time Cannot Erase. Pledging Once More My Love To You When I Awoke The Dream Was Through.
Last Night I Drove A Car Not Knowing How To Drive Not Owning A Car I Drove And Knocked Down People I Loved Went 120 Through One Town. I Stopped At Hedgeville And Slept In The Back Seat Excited About My New Life.
Last Night I Dreamed Of Chickens, There Were Chickens Everywhere, They Were Standing On My Stomach, They Were Nesting In My Hair, They Were Pecking At My Pillow, They Were Hopping On My Head, They Were Ruffling Up Their Feathers As They Raced About My Bed. They Were On The Chairs And Tables, They Were On The Chandeliers, They Were Roosting In The Corners, They Were Clucking In My Ears, There Were Chickens, Chickens, Chickens For As Far As I Could See When I Woke Today, I Noticed There Were Eggs On Top Of Me.
You Brothers, Who Are Mine, Poor People, Near And Far, Longing For Every Star, Dream Of Relief From Pain, You, Stumbling Dumb At Night, As Pale Stars Break, Lift Your Thin Hands For Some Hope, And Suffer, And Wake, Poor Muddling Commonplace, You Sailors Who Must Live Unstarred By Hopelessness, We Share A Single Face. Give Me My Welcome Back. Translated By James Wright Submitted By Holt.
Silent, Silent Night, Quench The Holy Light Of Thy Torches Bright; For Possessed Of Day Thousand Spirits Stray That Sweet Joys Betray. Why Should Joys Be Sweet Used With Deceit, Nor With Sorrows Meet? But An Honest Joy Does Itself Destroy For A Harlot Coy.
Now As The Train Bears West, Its Rhythm Rocks The Earth, And From My Pullman Berth I Stare Into The Night While Others Take Their Rest. Bridges Of Iron Lace, A Suddenness Of Trees, A Lap Of Mountain Mist All Cross My Line Of Sight, Then A Bleak Wasted Place, And A Lake Below My Knees. Full On My Neck I Feel The Straining At A Curve; My Muscles Move With Steel, I Wake In Every Nerve. I Watch A Beacon Swing From Dark To Blazing Bright; We Thunder Through Ravines And Gullies Washed With Light. Beyond The Mountain Pass Mist Deepens On The Pane; We Rush Into A Rain That Rattles Double Glass. Wheels Shake The Roadbed Stone, The Pistons Jerk And Shove, I Stay Up Half The Night To See The Land I Love.
April, And The Last Of The Plum Blossoms Scatters On The Black Grass Before Dawn. The Sycamore, The Lime, The Struck Pine Inhale The First Pale Hints Of Sky. An Iron Day, I Think, Yet It Will Come Dazzling, The Light Rise From The Belly Of Leaves And Pour Burning From The Cups Of Poppies. The Mockingbird Squawks From His Perch, Fidgets, And Settles Back. The Snail, Awake For Good, Trembles From His Shell And Sets Sail For China. My Hand Dances In The Memory Of A Million Vanished Stars. A Man Has Every Place To Lay His Head.
Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, Old Age Should Burn And Rave At Close Of Day; Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light. Though Wise Men At Their End Know Dark Is Right, Because Their Words Had Forked No Lightning They Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Good Men, The Last Wave By, Crying How Bright Their Frail Deeds Might Have Danced In A Green Bay, Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light. Wild Men Who Caught And Sang The Sun In Flight, And Learn, Too Late, They Grieved It On Its Way, Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Grave Men, Near Death, Who See With Blinding Sight Blind Eyes Could Blaze Like Meteors And Be Gay, Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light. And You, My Father, There On That Sad Height, Curse, Bless, Me Now With Your Fierce Tears, I Pray. Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.
The Cold Slope Is Standing In Darkness But The South Of The Trees Is Dry To The Touch The Heavy Limbs Climb Into The Moonlight Bearing Feathers I Came To Watch These White Plants Older At Night The Oldest Come First To The Ruins And I Hear Magpies Kept Awake By The Moon The Water Flows Through Its Own Fingers Without End Tonight Once More I Find A Single Prayer And It Is Not For Men.
Above Us, Stars. Beneath Us, Constellations. Five Billion Miles Away, A Galaxy Dies Like A Snowflake Falling On Water. Below Us, Some Farmer, Feeling The Chill Of That Distant Death, Snaps On His Yard Light, Drawing His Sheds And Barn Back Into The Little System Of His Care. All Night, The Cities, Like Shimmering Novas, Tug With Bright Streets At Lonely Lights Like His.

Someone Once Called Me A Failure For The Publications That I Lacked, But I Think They Were Wrong, Success Is Not How Much Money Or Gold That You Earn. Success Is How Many Friends In Your Life Can Hold, For They Are More Precious Than Money Or Gold. Friendship Has No Price Tag, It Cannot Be Bought Or Sold And It Comes From A Heart Of Gold. Therefore, In The Future Any Friends You May Acquire Treat Them With Respect Unless You Wish Their Friendship To Expire. 7 December 2007.
In The Last Analysis It Was Not His Gullibility Because It Could Have Been So Well Learned And The Swindling Avoided As Early As Possible, Frankly Speaking It Was His Greed, And Nothing But His Greed, Which Made The Swindlers Have The Last Laugh Greed Allows Everyone To Come And Take Everything Everything.

As A Drenched, Drowned Bee Hangs Numb And Heavy From A Bending Flower, So Clings To Me My Baby, Her Brown Hair Brushed With Wet Tears And Laid Against Her Cheek; Her Soft White Legs Hanging Heavily Over My Arm Swinging Heavily To My Movements As I Walk. My Sleeping Baby Hangs Upon My Life, Like A Burden She Hangs On Me. She Has Always Seemed So Light, But Now She Is Wet With Tears And Numb With Pain Even Her Floating Hair Sinks Heavily, Reaching Downwards; As The Wings Of A Drenched, Drowned Bee Are A Heaviness, And A Weariness.

The Day Is Dying Its Bright Blood Smeared On The Azure Blanket See Its Light Blinding No More The Orb Resting Its Head On The Horizon Of Salty Diamonds The Clouds Wipe The Blood Screaming To The Heavens As The Birds Moan In Agony Fleeing The Incoming Darkness Of The Murdering Night I Can See The Glowing Smile Of The Moon Her Breath Chilling As She Glares Enviously While A Million Knowing Eyes Watched Silently, Shivering In Fright. The Sun Succumbs To Its Death Drowned By The Rising Tide The Night Howls In Triumph And Covers The Land With Its Sickly Glow And We Surrender To Its Call Close Our Eyes And Wait For The Sun To Return.

The City Makes Me Uneasy, I Want To Wander On The Beach, From This City I Want To Flee, I Want To Vanish By Bus Or Train. Now I Splash In A City Stream, At Times Are In The Open Air, About Freedom I Can Just Dream, From This City I Want To Flee.

Light Has Exposed The Landscape To Its Form. Mood Is Rebuked Of All Its Artifice. Wind Moves Like Winter Through The Naked Trees. I Ask You For A Leaf, But There Is None. Instead, You Offer Me A Weather Coat, Gray As Warm Words Reduced To Whispering. You Tell Me That November Loves Old Bones. Your Frost Accent Is Quite Believable. You Paint A Picture Of Our Private Sky. The Light Falls Faint Upon My Closing Eyes. Held Close Within A Margin Of Rare Words, Stillness Sings Like A Fragile, Yellow Bird. Against The Glass Old Memories Ebb And Flow. A Touch Of Verse Becomes A Touch Of Snow. Our Tiny World Is Slipping Into Space. Only Your Precious Hands Hold It In Place. Copyright,2007, Sandra Fowler.
Your Voices Of Golden Verse Wakes Me Up From Deep Slumber As Coursed From The Dream Heartful Rousing The Warmth Of Love Endeared When Surfing The Beach In A Morning Early Awaiting The Golden Sun To Rise Yet To Delve The Dew From The Depth Of Night Dazzling Across Swaying Of The Grass As Revered By The Mist Of The Night Past. As You Make Your Day Promising Bright And Muse Over Morning To Rave Up The Day Suave And Serene Yet Blazing The Love By Wishes To The Sky For The Blue Moon. Let All Your Prayer Be Blossomed And Be Sparkling With The Fragrance Yet Scattering Like A Rain In Summer Quenching Thirst For Smile To The Green When Each Speckle Of Desire Being Blazed Like Flairs Of A Night In Blue Moon With The Light Of Success In Ascension Being Sheltered And Safe Yet Unreasoned.
Whom Will You Cry To, Heart? More And More Lonely, Your Path Struggles On Through Incomprehensible Mankind. All The More Futile Perhaps For Keeping To Its Direction, Keeping On Toward The Future, Toward What Has Been Lost. Once. You Lamented? What Was It? A Fallen Berry Of Jubilation, Unripe. But Now The Whole Tree Of My Jubilation Is Breaking, In The Storm It Is Breaking, My Slow Tree Of Joy. Loveliest In My Invisible Landscape, You That Made Me More Known To The Invisible Angels. Translated By Stephen Mitchell.
Sorrow Is My Own Yard Where The New Grass Flames As It Has Flamed Often Before But Not With The Cold Fire That Closes Round Me This Year. Thirtyfive Years I Lived With My Husband. The Plumtree Is White Today With Masses Of Flowers. Masses Of Flowers Load The Cherry Branches And Color Some Bushes Yellow And Some Red But The Grief In My Heart Is Stronger Than They For Though They Were My Joy Formerly, Today I Notice Them And Turn Away Forgetting. Today My Son Told Me That In The Meadows, At The Edge Of The Heavy Woods In The Distance, He Saw Trees Of White Flowers. I Feel That I Would Like To Go There And Fall Into Those Flowers And Sink Into The Marsh Near Them.
If We Do Look At Things In History No Kind Of Rescue Comes From History And That Was Just Another Old Story. . Peace, The Government Had Promised Me But To War, To Death They Had Then Sent Me To Set Mankind From All Kinds Of War Free. It Was Bad, I Was Under Sniper Fire Saw Howitzer Guns Open Deadly Fire And We Moved Constantly Did Then Tire. Every Place Looked The Very Same The Weather, The Veldt Just Stayed The Same But To The Generals It Was A Game And Soldiers Were Sacrificed As Mere Pawns In The Hearts Of Great Men Where Evil Spawns.

There Are Lots Of Scars On The Surface Of This Skin, Soft, Thicker Or Thin. The Memories Of The Past Has An Awful Heartbreak Crack. But Love Came With Ease, Stretched And Kissed The Scars; Amazingly, Out Went The Mark And Wiped Off All Shed Tears With An Exchange Of Sweet Spit.
I Blow Your Pictures Up A Lot, So That They Fill My Screen And Stare Into The Pixels; All Of Those Little Brown Dots That Make Such A Wonderful Scene, Like A Green Meadow, An Occasional Thistle Looking So At Home In The Hot Afternoon Breeze, Swaying And Serene. I Can Almost Hear A Kid Whistle In The Distance. Maybe He Forgot That This Was Nothing But A Dream, The Way That I Did, Until I Shrunk Your Picture Back Down And Saw That Your Beautiful Brown Eyes Were Just Pixels On My Cell Phone Screen.

It Is Passion Without It It Is Nothing It Is Feeling Winding Up Running Looking For An Opening And Then If Contained It Bursts It Is An Emoticon Sad, Happy, Exhilarated, Burning, Wriggling Dancing, Wild, Making Love, Resting After Love, Smoking And Gazing Finding A Home Finally In The Silence Of Its Fulfillment. It Is Never Propaganda. Never An Advertisement Not Even An Autobiography Everyone Relates And At The End Begins To Imitate It.
My Eyes Are In Trance Whenever I Am With You, In You. I Float Like A Snowflake And I Hit The Cold Water We Become One I Become None. But Whenever I Think Of You With My Mind, I Am Above You, Far Far Away From The Essence Of You I Swim In The Deep Blue Of The Sky So Enchanting So Ephemeral So Long Lasting The Illusion Of Knowing What Is True. I Must Close My Eyes And Try Very Hard Not To Think But To Feel.
I. Poetry Is Taking A Blind Man And Trying To Describe The Rainbow To Him Using No Adjectives. Ii. The Poet Walks Into A Dark Room And Paints The Air White Or At Least Attempts To While The Whales Eat Him Whole And Recreate Him Again. Ii.

" Or "do You Have A Name?

Yes, Too Forgetful, Inside Her House, I Have No Seat, No Place, No Persian Pillow. Inside Her Heart Is Filled With Love, But She Has None For Me.

The Meeting Was Incisive Lie The Way My Tooth Is Relieved From Pain But He Thought About What I Said Before That Moment When The Glass Was Emptied Of Its Black Contents That Night Inside A Cube Of Ice When What Followed Was The Transparency Of Air When Both Sides Can Be Seen At One Glance When Goodbyes And Hellos Look The Same Like Siamese Twins When One Finally Sees Through A Hole And For A While Glances Like A Window Of Rain Where You Cannot Help But Just Stay As You Do Not Like To Dance And Then He Says That The Universe Is There And It Is Nothing At All.

In The Cascade Gardens From Here Far Away The Lorikeets Chirp In The Bright Sun Of Day And The Male Green Southern Fig Bird I Fancy I Hear The Gray Brown Mottled Female To Him Perched Near. The Song Of The Pied Butcherbird One Cannot Mistake In Spring He Sings In The Early Dawn Before Daybreak And The Unmistakeable White Ibis For Scraps Of Food Scavenge Around With Their Long Bills They Cannot Probe For Slugs In The Sun Hardened Ground.

Memories Of The Cascade Gardens Are Living In Me The Magpie Is Singing On The Wattle Tree The Sun Brightly Shining In The Clear Blue Sky And The Gray Noisy Miners They Chirp As They Fly.
Rolling, Racing Faster And Faster, Voices Singing, Taking Me Along Pathways Of Rhythm So Placid And Soothing. Caressing This Heart, Letting It Beat In Time With Rhythms Being Listened To.

The Golden Conure Is An Extinct Species Of The Conure Family. It Is White Golden In Colour With Green Patches. The Closest Resemblence To Which Is The Sun Conure Or The Jenday Conure According To Me.

You Are The High Hill With Numerous Peaks, That In Summer Looks Magnificent And Cheery, Where I Have Climbed Up To Waterfalls, To Heights, Where I Got A View Of Sun, Beach And Sea, Felt As If In Presence Of God, With Tranquillity With Your Moods You Remind Me Of A Lady. Once I Wandered With A Young Lady On A Twisting Trail Among Your High Peaks To Find Some Inner Peace, Some Tranquillity And She Was Quite Happy And Rather Cheery Gazing Up At The Blue Sky, Down At The Sea From Both Of Those Dazing Heights. Climbing Up To The Sheer Heights Was Like Exploring The Body Of A Lady As If Finding A Secret Kind Of Sea With Beautiful Rising Pointed Peaks And The Experience Was Quite Cheery, Suddenly Leaving An Own Tranquillity. My Privacy Is Invaded By Her Tranquillity As From Far I Still Do Watch Her Heights And Although Feeling Rather Cheery There Is Danger In This Lovely Lady That Beacons Me With Her High Peaks To Look Upon An Endless Open Sea. I Long To Gaze Out Upon The Sea, To Be With Her In Tranquillity, To Wander Among Her Peaks, To Again Explore Her Heights As If To Visit A Dear Kind Old Lady But I Wonder If I Will Find Her Cheery?

Aainon Ko Tootte Dekha Isi Mehfil Mein Hay, Keya Bataoon Aap Ko Keya Mere Is Dil Mein Hay. Hamnasheen Main Tujhko Apna Dil Dikha Sakta Nahin, Dagh Tere Nakhunon Jaisa Bhi Ek Is Dil Mein Hay. Zindagi Ka Lutf To Aaghosh Mein Maujon Ki Hay, Zindagi Woh Zindagi Keya Gharq Jo Sahil Mein Hay. Kaif Woh Jo Justujoo Mein Tha Kahan Per Reh Geya, Aaj Main Kahne Laga Hoon Rakha Keya Manzil Mein Hay. Mere Hone Ya Na Hone Se Bhala Keya Farq Hay, Aap Chup To Khamushi Chai Huyee Mehfil Mein Hay.
Kutch Gham Woh Mile Ke Tadap Uththe, Kutch Aise Mile Jo Sah Bhi Gaye, Chand Aansu Humne Pee Daley Chand Peetey Peetey Bah Bhi Gaye. Toofan Na Jane Kitne Uthe Sab Jhele Humne Chup Hi Rahe, Aankhon Ke Ubalte Ashkon Se Hum Apne Fasane Kah Bhi Gaye. Do Hont Laraz Ke Tham Hi Gaey Woh Bat Zuban Tak Aa Na Saki, Kai Bar Kisi Ke Samne Hum Do Palken Utha Kar Rah Bji Gaye. Armanon Ki Chakki Mein Pis Kar Dil Khoon Huwa Aankhon Se Baha, Is Ek Muhabbat Ki Khatir Hum Lakhon Masaib Sah Bhi Gaye. Paththar Pe Asar Keya Maujon Ka Takra Ke Bikhar Jati Hain Khudhi, Jazbat Ke Sarkash Dharon Mein Hum Tinkon Ki Manind Bah Bhi Gaye. In Jagti Aankhon Ke Sapne Deewana Bana Kar Choren Ge, Woh Nazren Jhukae Aae Yehan Aur Deir Talak Phir Rah Bhi Gaye. Hansti Huwi Chanchal Aankhon Ne Jhuk Jhuk Kar Uthna Seekh Liya, Jo Kah Na Sake They Hum Ab Tak Woh Sari Baten Kah Bhi Gaye.

Jab Aankhein Batien Karne Lagen Khamoshi Achi Lagti Hay, Ab Hosh Ko Rakh Kar Keya Karna Behoshi Achi Lagti Hay. Koi Hosh Urane Wala Ho Aur Aur Toot Ke Chahne Wala Ho, Aur Shanon Pe Zulfein Bikhri Hon Madhoshi Achi Lagti Hay. Koi Dekh Na Le Koi Sun Na Le, Gul Kar Do Sari Shamen Ab, In Narm Achoote Honton Ki Sargoshi Achi Lagti Hay. Zara Dekho Iski Shararat Ko Yeh Har Singhar Ke Barse Phool, Yeh Chadar Kaisi Urhai Hay Gulposhi Achi Lagti Hay. Main Tummei Chupa Tum Mujmein Chupe, Koi Dhoondh Raha, Yeh Chand Hay Aur Yeh Kahta Hay Ruposhi Achi Lagti Hay. Jab Gal Ki Rangat Nikhri Ho Jab Aankhon Mein Masti Utri Ho, Ay Chasme Ghizalan Chalakti Raho May Noshi Achi Lagti Hay. Jab Hont Hon Kaliyon Ki Manind Jab Phool Ke Jaisa Paikar Ho, Bareek Gulabi Libadeh Mein Khushposhi Achi Lagti Hay.

Make Some Music With Your Footfalls On The Road, Milestones That Lie Ahead Would Like To Hear.

Chahat Bhi Keya Jurm Hay Yaro Na Karte To Acha Tha, Jinse Muhabbat Maine Ki Barham Se Hayn Wuhi Sabhi.

Dil Ne Chaha Ke Suna Doon Use Main Bhi Batein, Yad Aane Lageen Guzri Hui Bheegi Ratein. Aaj Chingarian Sholon Mein Badal Jane Do, Aa Bhi Jao, Na Chali Jaen Sulagti Ratein.

Mujhko Pata Chala Hi Nahin Le Gaye Woh Dil, Dil Ke Irade Unse Zara Dillagi Ke They. Thori Si Cher Char Per Roothe They Kistarah, Andaz Thore Thore Zara Berukhi Se They. Ghusse Ki Chadar Orhkar Kab Tak Chupao Ge, Honton Ke Zaviey To Tumhare Hansi Ke They.

Aasmaan Mein Udnewale Parindon Ko Zameen Pr Rengte Kido Ki Shanakht Nahi Milti Ud Jaye Gar Koi Insaan Aasmano Ke Sair Per, Usko Khake Dafan Ki Jagah Nahi Milti, Doobne Wale Ko Tinke Ka Sahara Mil Jata Hai Tairne Wale Ko Aksar Gehraiyon Ki Khabar Nahi Milti.

Jo Guzar Gai Woh Thi Zindigi Jo Guzar Rahi Woh Sawal Hay, Tum Ise Bhi Kahte Ho Zindigi Yeh To Apna Apna Khyal Hay. Ye Hawa Ke Jhonke Kabhi Kabhi Yeh Jo Gugdgudi Si Lagate Hayn, Kabhi Rote Rote Jo Hans Pada In Hawaon Ka Yeh Kamal Hay. Na To Main Raha Na To Tum Rahe Yeh Zamana Kitna Badal Geya, Yeh Jo Phool Humne Khila Diya Yehi Baqi Ek Jamal Hay. Yeh Safar To Sara Hi Kat Geya Jo Bacha Hay Usko Bhi Kat Lein Hum, Zara Kakulon Ko Woh Kham To Do Woh Jo Kabka Inse Nikal Geya, Kabhi Bole Tum Jo Lagao Se To Lohoo Bhi Ruk Geya Ghao Se, Koi Bheegi Aankhen Bhi Hans Padin Koi Ghamzada Bhi Bahal Geya. Kabhi Socha Tumne Jo Paya Hay Kabhi Socho Keya Keya Ganwaya Hay, Koi Uska Dhoondo Jawab Bhi Tum Ke Yeh Zindigi Ka Sawal Hay. Main To Mutmain Hoon Naseeb Se Jo Sila Mila Woh Bahut Mila, Woh Jo Aaj Tak Na Mila Kabhi Mujhe Kutch Na Uska Malal Hay. Mera Mazi Mujhse Bichar Geya Main Use Kabhi Na Bhula Saka, Magar Iska Husn Bhi Kam Nahin Ke Bada Haseen Mera Hal Hay.
Yeh Jo Dhoop Chaon Ka Khel Hay Ise Khelna Hi Hay Zindigi, Kabhi Bheeg Jati Hay Aankh Agar Yeh To Ek Waqti Ubal Hay.
Rat Ke Pardon Mein Sahmi Si Mulaqat Nahin, Ek Muddat Se Woh Mehke Hue Din Rat Nahin. Teri Madhosh Jawani Ki Inayat Nahin, Shokh Nazron Mein Woh Rangeen Isharat Namin. Bat Keya Apni Sunaen Jo Teri Bat Nahin, Woh Tasawar Hi Nahin Ab Woh Kheyalat Nahin. Ab Nahin Waslke Hangamon Mein Lazzat Baqi, Ab Tere Hijr Ke Woh Pehle Se Sadmat Nahin. Dost Hangamae Dunya Mein Hain Hum Tum Uljhe, Fursale Ishq Kise Hay Ke Woh Halat Nahin.
Jo Shaiy Apnon Mein Unqua Hay Who Beganon Mein Milti Hay, Muhabbat Darhaqueequat Sirf Deewanon Mein Milti Hay. Farishta Jurm Karta Hay To Sharminda Nahin Hota, Khataon Per Pasheemani To Insanon Mein Milti Hay. Wh Bholi Bali Aurat Jab Kabhi Kutch Kho Si Jati Hay, To Mere Dil Ke Chote Se Nihan Khaanon Mein Milti Hay. Parishan Zulfon Wali Shan Pariyon Jaisi Teri Hay, Tu Ghqazlon Mein Bhi Dikhti Hay Tu Afsanon Mein Milti Hay. Hay Teri Mamata Chai Hui Sari Khudai Per, Tu Insanon Mein Milti Hay Tu Haiwanon Mein Milti Hay. Who Jiski Chonch Mein Zaitoon Ki Ek Shakh Hoti Thi, Who Zakhmi Fakhta Janon Na Anjanon Mein Milti Hay. Diya Jo Jhonpri Mein Jal Raha Hay Roshni Uski, Na Masjid Na Kalisa Na Sanamkhaanon Mein Milti Hay.

I Silently, Silently The New Morning Awakes And Your Hands Are Crossed Over Your Breast While You Go To The Eternal Rest, And Deeply, Deeply My Heart Aches.

I Have Often Wondered About Grasping Men, I Have Wondered About The Way That The World Goes Under The People That Were Elected To Lead The Way And About Their Desire For Fortune And Fame, About Presidents That Do Not Waver To Tell A Lie, About Leaders That Sent Soldiers Off To War And Wondered If They Do Consider The Consequences Or Is There Something Evil That Besets Each Great Good Man A Corruption That Power Does Always Bring?.

We Live In A World Where War, Disasters And Destruction Are Continually Harassing Us As If Destiny Is Pursuing Us, As If Everything In This World Is Out Of Control, As If The Portals Of Hell Are Standing Wide Open And Sometimes We Become Ill Without Any Chance Of Being Healed And Sometimes We Loose Loved Ones To Death And It Feels As If We Are Living On The Edge Of The Abyss But Still The Hope Remains That Life Will Become Better, That Deliverance Will Come With The New Tomorrow As If A Happier Future Is Only Waiting On Us.

The Eyes Of My Love Shines Like The Sun, Summer Fades, In The Presence Of Her Most Lovely Smile, Autumn Shades Against The Colour Of Her Vibrant Hair, Spring Degrades Against Her Charm And Personality And Vivid She Stays Lingering With Me.
Your Smile, Your Touch, Your Glance Flowers In A Eternal Spring, There Is A Kind Of Radiance That Comes To Everything; Constantly A Hidden, Holy, Message Keeps Whispering While Great Joy You Bring With Your Own Presence, To My Life You Are Bringing The Essence.
There Is A Land Of Endless Light, Where Night Never Does Come, Where Spring And Summer Boundless Stays In That Eternal Home, Where Love And Delight Only True Joys Bring, Where No Fears Roam; In That Bright Place That Brings Eternal Rest, There Is A God, That Selfless Loves Me Best.
Red They Bloom As If Coals From Flaming Hell, They Do Glitter, Are Shivering In The Slight Wind, I Do Sometimes Titter At Their Emblazing Beauty, While Bees Buzz, Birds Do Twitter; God Must Have Made Them To Be So Lovely, They Awake Feelings Of Longing In Me.
We Sat Near The Steps Of The Porch With Your Hand Touching My Own Your Eyes Sparkled Like Those Of A Wildcat; I Have Not Known A Glance As Sweet As A Lingering Kiss, Saw A Small Frown Creasing Your Brow Against The Bright Hot Sun While Just Being With You Were The Greatest Fun.
I Am Grieved At That What You Did Do, Amiss Our Love Have Been Trampled Into The Very Mud, As To Remove That Which Had Close Bonded The Two Of Us; I Disapprove, Calling Upon All That Is Still Holy, As You Are Treating Me Very Lowly.
When I Close My Eyes You Are Right Next To Me, But You Are Gone When I Awake And For Some Long Moments I Am Alone; Daily Your Sweet Company Brings Me Joy, You Are The One Whose Absence Brings The Greatest Kind Of Pain But In My Thoughts You Constantly Remain.
Thinking Of Your Work And Life, A Yearning To Earn Much More; Where Now I Do Lack All Kinds Of Good Things, Where You Deplore Me For My Lack To Breed, Build And To Become Great As Before; Still I Have A Good Sense Of Confidence While My Words Are Reaching For Excellence. Yet With Similar Conviction I Am Still Reaching Out To A World That Is Beyond All Human Sight, Loud You May Shout And Act In Word And Deed Very Harshly And Bring About Great Acts Of Violence And Great Strife While Unseen Forces Of Darkness Wreck My Life; But Hours And Days Of Utter Loneliness Wreaks Their Havoc And Forever Ticking And Running On Is The Old Clock; Wealth And Snobbism Enfolds You Like A Cloak; Running Amok Are The Words And Deeds Of My Enemies While Constantly I Only Long For Peace.
As A Pretty Butterfly That Flutters Along She Came, Rapidly Always Running Up And Down; Nothing Could Tame That Childish Sweet Happy Rushing Spirit; Her Lovely Name Is Not Heard Anymore As She Is Gone, From Life Into Death She Has Moved On. Some Soothing Summer Sunshine Must Be Lost, She Does Not Pass, No Small Shadow Falls Or Lingers At Times; Outside The Grass Is Quite Soft Where Her Small Feet Once Did Tread, Like Clear Bright Glass The Sky Is Clear Without A Single Fleck; From Her I Cannot My Sad Thoughts Direct.
While Loving You I Entered Into A World Unknown Where The Boundaries Are Ever Changing, Where The Things Shown Carries Hidden Messages Of You And Me, Where We Both Own A Kind Of Beauty, Finding Pain And Bliss, The Deepest Kind Of Passion In Each Kiss.
In The Depths Of A Grim Winter When Life Felt Desolate There Was A Fluttering, A Twittering At The Front Gate When Chilly The Wind Rocked The Big Trees. I Could Not Wait To Go To Look And See What Made That Sound And A Little Redbreast Sang To All Around.
The Nearer That I Do Come To Thee, My God, Iniquity I Find More And Much More That Are Present In All Of Me; I Am A Creature Of Sin From My Own Begin, My Sanctity Does Not Exist But In Your Loving Grace, My Painful Scars Are Etched On Your Face.
Quite Indolent Somewhat Like Purple Orchids; A Rich Fragrance Comes As They Do A Nice Fruity Scent Spill; They Draw A Glance As They Hang Jointed, Course And Delicate, Like A Romance That Comes With A Sudden Kind Of Whiff Changing To Certainty From Just An If.
Close To The Waterside Were Daffodils, Hidden By Trees, Some Of Their Seeds Might Have Been Blown Ashore By The Strong Breeze, But Many More Appeared Suddenly They Did Not Freeze, Blossomed In The Icy Winter Snow And Among The Mossy Stones They Did Glow.
Long Before I Had Experienced Strive, A Force Unknown When I Was Young In Life Took My Own Thoughts, Suddenly Grown; Not From Sin Or A Search Of Fame It Came In Words Full Blown As A Constant Companion In My Life, More Cruel And Dear To Me Than Any Wife.
Lord, Never Might I Truly Understand, That God And Man You Are Both, But Your Divine Selfless Love Does Widely Span Through All My Thoughts, Through All What I Do See, Your Godly Plan Brings To My Greatest Iniquities Grace And I Long To See Your Loving Kind Face.
From Your Own Hands I Get My Daily Bread, You Know My Heart, Above Living And Dead You Are Supreme; You Know Each Part Which Makes Me And You Know Everything; In My Own Art You Are Present, Even In Each Dispute; You Make Me Great, Grand, Good And Resolute.
I Wonder If All Men Long For A Girl Who Has Some Stay, Acts At Time As A Harpy, Whore And Mate; As She Portray A Woman Of Utmost Consequence, Every Day An Angel In Her Own Beauty And Wit, And Truly Blessed Is She That Has It.
Without A Song Or Sound It Lays Waiting, Gathering Dust, In The Right Hands It Could Sound Quite Lovely, To Sing It Must, Songs Of Happiness And Of Some Despair, Very Unjust Life Sometimes Is; Death Brought The Great Silence, That Is Now A Lingering Odd Presence.
In Times Of Some Great Kind Of Solitude, The Veldt, The Bush, Catches Me In Living Great Memories, A Tranquil Hush Brings Back A New Kind Of Awakening, In Does Then Rush The Trees, Birds, Bees And Many Wild Flowers, Like Some Thundering Life Bearing Showers.
The Comforting Warmth Of The Sun Falling Through The Window, The Voices Of Many Birds Calling Serene From The Meadow While The New Morning Rushes On Boundless, The Pure Blue Glow Of A Ethereal Sky Does Reminds Me Of The Joys Of Summer, Of Tranquillity.
Quite Romantic An Ancient Ship Passes During Twilight With The Setting Sun Ropes, Cords, Sails Thrum; The Coming Night Rushes In With A Myriad Of Stars And Out Of Sight A Man Stand With A Fist High Against The Wind, To Eternity Rest He Will Not Find.
They Can Be Sharp And Cut Deeply Without A Second Thought, The Soul Can Warp At Mere Words That Are Said Indifferent, Or Like A Harp The Sounds Of Love And Speech Can Be Quite True, Can Bring Happiness In All That They Do.
God Gives Us Life And What We Do With It Is Up To Us, We Can Turn It Into A Wretched Thing And Obvious Live Some Shattered Lives Or It Can Be Quite Prodigious While In Love, Hope And Trust We Go Along, Living As We Must Life Can Be A Song.
Long Before My Birth, My Father Walked, Talked With You And Before Being Substance You Knew All That I Would Do; Nothing Escapes You, You Are Everywhere, You Do Stay True When All Around Me My World Falls Apart, You Do Still Live In The Depths Of My Heart.
I Do Not Pity That Darkness Do Come At End Of Day, Nor Flowers Fading At The End Of Spring, Are Swept Away By The Coming Of The New Summer Fruit, Loose You I May With The Summer Sun In Every Kiss When No Other Love Could Be Just Like This.
How Joyfully Surprised You Made Me On A Week Day As Tears Of Happiness Did Spill And Something Strange Was At Play When Quite Suddenly Your Words And Actions Did Your Thoughts Betray As If You Have Seen Me In A New Light, That Day Was Far Past Lovely, Sunny And Bright.
In The Depths Of A Grim Winter When Life Felt Desolate There Was A Fluttering, A Twittering At The Front Gate When Chilly The Wind Rocked The Big Trees; I Could Not Wait To Go To Look And See What Made That Sound And A Little Weaver Sang To All Around.
Somewhat Solitary Some Flowers Grew In A Little Knot, Looking Gay And They Were Ever Changing, I Found A Lot, They Did Toss, Did In The Stormy Wind Reel Where Other Sorts Rot, They Grew To A Kind Of Sheer Perfection, Glorious Waving In Each Direction.
Sprouting Like Strings Of Purple Morning Glories Our Love Grows Wild; With Vines Reaching, Stretching, Opening; Like A Small Child Believing In The Magic Of The Light, With Nothing Mild Funnels Reach Flaring Blossoms To The Sun While All Kinds Of Barriers Are Overrun.
Although You Think That I Am Different You Know The Things I Do Love And Hate And Do Relate To Happy Tidings, In Your Selfless Love, To My Greatest Dreams, You Give Some Wings, You Love To Walk With Me On Wet Rainy Days And Know Me In Some Very Special Ways.
Continually Surges Break On The Shore By Design, Not Chance, As If It Is Written By Godly Wit. In Every Glance The Beauty Of Nature Does Overflow. In A Balance The Laws Of Nature Are Set Exactly, While Continually Chaos Wants To Break Free.
Stripped Naked To The Most Inner Core As During Winter A Leafless Tree Stood Very Near To Death A Branch Did Splinter; As If Out Of Proportion Drawn, Printed On A Printer; Lonesome My Heart Was There In The Weather, As Nothing Good Could Bring Us Together.
At Times The Thought That You Know Me Too Well Does Unnerve Me As I Do Not Constantly Think About Love, Charity; The Good And Great Things Does At Times Elude My Thoughts, Frankly I Am At Times Full Of The Vilest Sin And Still In My Life You Do Enter In.
Just Touching Your Hand Is Overwhelming, Blazing Passion Runs Through Us Both Like An Electric Stream, The Sheer Emotion Have Depths That To Us Are Always Unknown With Affection That Goes Far Beyond Any Boundaries Set Blazing From The Very Day That We Met.

Hints Of Love As Imparted By Your Touch, Excited Me To Wistful Sweet Extremes, Implanting Deeply These Things In My Dreams; In Fantasy Things Had Always Been Such, When Very Real Everything Then Seems, Like Hints Of Love Imparted By Your Touch, Exciting Me To Wistful Sweet Extremes; Yet Omens And Stars Augur Not So Much For Such A Love, No Doting God Esteems, Not Even By Truth, That Itself Redeems Hints Of Love As Imparted By Your Touch, Exciting Me To Wistful Sweet Extremes, Implanting Deeply These Things In My Dreams.
Madrigal It Is Six In The Morning I Get Down And Move The Car From The Place Reserved For Vans. This The Best Of Times Cooling Before The Heat Begins Only A Few People Out Walking Their Dogs Enjoying The Peace Of A Beginning. I Could Have Parked My Car In The Space Between Two Cars, But I Lose My Nerves, This After 60 Years Of Driving. In The Night The Wind Blew Hard From The Sea Tiring Itself Out, And Me Too I Hate The Wind It Takes My Breath Away Leaves Me A Husk Falling Asleep In Front Of The Tv. Yesterday I Carried Water To The House, The Porter Usually Do This But My Wife Thinks He Takes Too Much Money. Being Able To Carry Bottles Of Water Is Better Than Not Being Able To Carry Water, My Heart Does Not Agree.

My Dreams Are Belated Orioles That Flee The Mournful Mists To Find, In The Heaven Of Thy Soul, The Lost Summer And The Balsam Of All The Fugitive Flowerings. My Dreams Are Dying Flowers, But Ever Their Fragrant Lives Mount Toward The Altar Of Thy Heart In A Soft And Heatless Air Where Indolent Clouds Are Bom. My Dreams Are Olden Songs Sung On A Clouded Evening, That Mount Among The Petals Of Pale And Perfumed Roses Falling At Thy Shadowy Shutters.

May We Not Love As Others Do, Dearest, Because We Love, A Mistress I, A Husband You? Nay, Our Delights Must Prove Either The Double Or The Part Of Those Who Love With Single Heart. Sweet Friend, I Find Not Any Wrong In Your Divided Soul; Nor You, That Mine Should Not Belong Entire To One Control. Let Simple Lovers If They Will Contemn Us, We Outwit Them Still. For Small And Poor And Cold Indeed Is Any Heart That Can Hold But The Measure Of The Need, The Joy, Of Any Man. Both Spare And Prodigal Were We, To Love But You, To Love But Me.

Make My Mouth Yours And Place My Tongue On Your Roof, Better To Form My Words, Before I Speak Them In Poetry. So Take My Thoughts Pressed Hot To Your Ear, So I Can Know Your One My Self, And Make Of Me Your Other. While My Voice, When You Return It, Was Hard Used, For The Better Of We.
She Spun A Line. She Knew He Was Listening To Her. She Spun It And He Took The Fraying Ends. Whatever She Was Saying, It Was Cotton, Then As He Rolled The Thread Between Forefinger And Thumb It Turned To Silk, And As He Took The Needle Up To Thread It The Line She Spun Became Thin Finest Gold. He Knew Not To Believe Her But He Took It Because She Kept On Spinning Like The Truth Was Ravelling From Her Lips; He Watched Her Lips. Cotton, Silk And Gold, She Wanted Him To Take The Line And Sew The Wound Right Up Although She Held The Blade Still In Her Hand Behind Her Back, And It Was Dripping, Steaming. There Under His Left Arm The Gash Lay Open Like A Mouth In Disbelief. And He Believed Her.

I Delve Beneath The News To Probe Underlying Views I Believe Inform Perspectives So Immersed In Adjectives They Cloud Messages In Swathes Of Bromide Passages Paraded As The Gospel Truth On Television And In The Social Media Booth Where Simpletons Devour Poppycock They Lap Up Around The Clock Repeating Fallacies They Elevate To The Level Of Delicacies I Rate Beneath Contempt Regardless Of The Attempt To Disregard The Immutability Of Fact So Long As The Contract Of Tact Leads News Consumers To Graduate Into Verisimilitude Subsumers Capable Of Teasing Fact From Fiction In An Era When Half Truths Fuel Friction Catalyzing Misunderstandings By Ignoring Veracity Underpinnings And Vilifying Social Standings.
In My Country Democracy Has Been Tasted And It Is A Bitter Pill Its Tenets Of Freedom And Liberty Are Grossly Abused And The Dictum Of One Man One Vote A Mockery Of The Fact There Is A Transition And Elections Stare In The Faces Of Citizens But It Appears They Will Never See The Ballot Boxes In Which Their Franchise Will Be Exercised The Road To The Eight Senate Is Murky And Crooked That Prediction Of Perdition Is Becoming Inevitable And We Are Waiting.
I Grew Up With The Promises Sweet, Golden, Yet Never Fulfilled I Worked The Meaneal Jobs For Livin Wages, Only There Wasnt Much To Live On, Merely Exist From Sad Ghetto Windows Hollow, Burned Out I Watched Snow Fall Like Jesus Renewing The Earth For Us To Dirty Felt No Reform In Prison But The Solitude Held The Flag High If No Other Reason Worshipped The Neon Gods Of Night Spilled Into The Ragged Eyes Try, Buy, Something New Only Nothing Is New Only Innocence That We Dirty I Saw Dreamers Killed No Future But The One Wanted Gorged Myself On The Banquets Of Glory Lived On The Crumbs Of Remorse Danced In The Street So Violent As A Matador Each Step As If Fate Held Life, Death And Death Was The Only Certainty.
His Time And Wealth All There For Him, Possessed Just To Enjoy But Hunting Was A Pleasure Where His Shooting Skills He Could Employ. Flew His Plane To The Island At Will, He Shot The Fleeing Birds The Gun Obeyed His Able Hand Only The Sound Of Death Was Heard. One Shot Took Down The Creature Its Partner Gave A Chilling Cry, As Though Its Heart The Bullet Tore Seeing Its Love, Fall There To Die. Around, Around, It Wailed In Anguish A Bird Lamenting The One It Lost It Would Not Leave The Love It Cherished Unmindful Of What It Would Cost. The Man Was Dazed, He Felt Its Pain, It Tormented His Ears With Grief. Shot It Down Where Its Love Had Lain Sealed The Union, Though It Was Brief. That Day He Left, And Never Came Back. Vowed Never More To Kill For Pleasure The Bird Had Shown What He Really Lacked, Real Peace And Concern For Nature. Cynthia Buhain Baello 11.10.12.
I Bumped Into A Guy He Said Watch Out I Said Hi He Pushed Me Out Out Into The Street I Go Honk Honk The Cars Go Bump The Big Truck Hits Me And All The Cars Drive Over Me The Powpow Pulled His Gun Out And Shot The Man On His Mouth And There I Landed Lost My Life Lonely In A Silent Night.

There Are Many Tracks On The Ground, Enemies Could Be Anywhere, The Spoor Does The Tracker Astound, He Looks Carefully Here And There. To Me The Tracks Look All The Same, There Are Many Tracks On The Ground, I Do Not Know From Where They Came, How Enemies Are To Be Found. To The Tracker It Is Renowned, The Way That It Is Set, Its Line There Are Many Tracks On The Ground, To Me Looking Almost As Mine. We Drink Water Under A Tree Find A Booby Trap Tightly Bound That Almost Is Disposing Me, There Are Many Tracks On The Ground.
From This City I Want To Flee, To Find A Place Of Some Solace, Not Again I Want To Return, Where City Lights Sometimes Blind People. I Still Think About How It Was, From This City I Want To Flee, I Cannot Fit In This Anthill, A Bridge To Escape, I Must Find. The City Makes Me Uneasy, I Want To Wander On The Beach, From This City I Want To Flee, I Want To Vanish By Bus Or Train. Now I Splash In A City Stream, At Times Are In The Open Air, About Freedom I Can Just Dream, From This City I Want To Flee.
France Is A Beautiful Place, With So Much History To See, And So Many People To Meet, And So Much Food To Eat. This Is What Makes It Fun Because France Is A Beautiful Place, And Meeting Victor Hugo Would Be Great, And Meeting French Poets Even Greater. The Enlightenment Happened Here, With Montaigne, Rousseau, And Diderot, Since France Is A Beautiful Place, And Alexandre Dumas Would Have Been Proud. Kings And Queens Ruled Here, Until Robespierre Took Control, And Democracy Started, And Ah, France Is A Beautiful Place.

I Long To Be Held Twixt Loving Arms Feeling Warmth And Sensual Charms One Day Soon We Shall Fly Together Raising Our Spirits On High Forever Oh How That Smile Doth Beguile Me From Lips That Whisper I Love Thee.

Its Presence Was Here With A Faint Glow, If It Was A Godly Or Demonic Messenger I Did Not Know And To Act I Was Quite Slow As On This Earth I Am Only A Passenger And Am Alone As Life Goes On. But The Strange Visiting Envoy Is Now Gone.
At A Time I Did Truly Love, As If It Comes From God Above With Something In Every Kiss, Something That I Cannot Explain, And I Longed For You Again, Longed For Happiness And Bliss. Memory Brought Me To This Place To Your Words, To Your Smiling Face The Kisses From Your Glowing Lips And All Of This Comes Back To Me As If I Can Once Again Be Between Your Loving Tender Hips But Life Cannot Be As Before, Time We Cannot Turn Back, Once More And Sometimes We Do Love In Vain And Although We Know To Forgive The Words, All That I Then Did Give, Brought Nothing To Me But Sheer Pain And Time Now Does Move Somewhat On, Years And Some Feelings Are Now Gone And At A Time Love Meant Something, To Some It Stays Through A Lifespan And Now I Am Another Man, Who Finds Life And Love Amazing.

The Religion Game Only One Right Way; There Can Be Only The One. Fear Haunts Such Small Minds Seeing Through Their Broken Glass, Blind Leading The Blind. No Heaven No Hell Can Remove Love From Within; Relax And Just Breathe. The Spirit Indwells Beyond The Understanding. A Whispering Love Whose Strength Surrounds Us, Guides Us Along Each Day; Just What Is It, We Should Fear?.

They See That They Have What Is There May There Be There Also What Is To Be There If They May Care They Care For It Of Course They Care For It. Now Only Think Three Times Roses Green And Blue And Vegetables And Pumpkins And Pansies Too Which They Like As They Are Very Likely Not To Be Reminded That It Is More Than Ever Necessary That They Should Never Be Surprised At Any One Time At Just What They Have Been Given By Taking What They Have Which They Are Very Careful Not To Add With As They May Easily Indulge In The Fragrance Not Only Of Which But By Which They Know That They Tell Them So.

The Pastoral Song February 24, 2020 Moo The Big Cows Bawl The Calves And Bellow The Oxes Bleat The Big Goats, Baa The Babies Bleat The Rams Baa The Babies Neigh The Horses, Bleat The Calves Squeak The Rabbits Suack The Ducks Cluck The Hens; All Day Long Ruffle These At Evening Ends Then The Cattle Take Rest In The Dark Shed.
Her Whisper In The Thorny Bush When She Blooms And Her Fragrance Spread All Over The Pasture. A Shepherd Boy With The Cattle And The Muddy River Flows Monotonously. This Beauty Will Change In Near Future As They Bring The Bulldozer And Caterpillar The Earth Moving Equipment. A Big Project To Establish A Power Plant By The Riverside. The Contrary Is Give The Light To The Country Before The General Election. But Wild Flowers In Agony As They Are Scared To Expose To The Light. Happy Christmas Is Coming, But Where Are You Playing With The Lambs And The Small Children, My Pastoral Love, In Which Hamlet Home Of The Countryside, Lie You Playing?.
