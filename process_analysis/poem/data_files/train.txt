Into the snake's eyes i looked deeply within i saw not hate or evil or any deadly sin i saw fear and terror from a creature that wanted to survive and all that it wanted to do was just to stay alive it curled itself around my arm as though ready to fight but did it do it out of anger or did it do it out of fright as the snake has been cursed since the beginning of time because of a deed of its relative and its father's past crime since that day the snake has been killed and cursed evils and sins of the snake we all have been immersed so once again i looked into that snakes deadly eyes i still couldn't see sin or evil or even a devilish disguise so i released that snake on the ground and it slithered away i wished peace upon it and then for my judging i did pray. randy l. mcclave.
A snake is there, in that cage, the snake tries to go out. the snake is my partner, my friend. but i am not there in the actions of the snake. with the snake i fear my safety. but the snake is there as it is. let the snake go, wherever it likes. but i like the snake should stay in. i believe the snake not in full and i commit the blunder. snake, my dear, come on with all comfort.

Hardly a sound in your world, only the repetitious "s". in your coiled strength, your sliding motion and your suddenness, the pure silk of your pink mouth, the sloughing of a whole skin, and that sparkling newness as you stretch, easy in your new length, cool and supple as a stream's dance. i hear no hiss as your tongue's black tips like a shivering nerve detect that strange warmth, nor hiss of triumph as you swallow whole your prey. hardly a sound in your world, only the echoing "s" in your bold stare belying the true shyness of a snake as you watch me from a safe distance. the "s" contains your whole being which makes you more complete than me, as i have no sound's shape.

The snake crept slowly through the bush until she came upon a hairy tush it was a rabbit eating his food but the snake was in a foul mood. she sniffed, tasted and coiled herself to strike but the rabbit had rehearsed how to handle this fight the snake opened her mouth but the rabbit was gone ran like there was no tomorrow this confrontation was done. c. vergara 04.20.2012.
For more than seven years we are habituated to accept the traitors as as patriot to know the made statments as truth once upon a future we would forget what actually the truth is who actually the patriots are a day would come when the history would search for a shoulder to place it's head and weep finally these lips of ours are blue not for beautification rather we kissed a snake knowingly that she could bite a nation forever she could erase our names from the blackboard of human history.
The wooden been music the snake charmer playing and the melodies breaking, haunting want i, want i to hear and the snakes dancing, swaying to the tune of the been, pumping and puffing from the mouth and rotating and rounding the instrument and the cobras swaying want i, want i to hear. the turbanned and towelled snake charmer clad in dhoti and kurta playing the music, the music of the east, of asia and the dangerous, deadly cobras hissing and dancing, swaying to the tune of the wooden been instrument dancing joyously in sheer delight and the snake charmer taking the name of the snake god and ma manansa, playing the been, pumping and puffing to break the tune, a bag pipe like.
Little garter snake, asleep in the rue, lost in your dreams so sweet. one often wonders at how you do, to cypher your thoughts would be quite a feat. tiny and toothless and without defense, from felines on the prowl. so you'll slither away beneath the fence, wary of felines, and canines, and the feathered fowl. but for now you are content, in your red clay pot, dreams of grasshoppers in your tiny head. serene and peaceful in your personal cot, as visions of six leggers run through your head.
I still have your book and you have my clip now i know why you kept asking if i always get what i want you beat me at my own game i bet on five but you rolled snake eyes thank you for reminding that one shouldn't be cocky and always expect to get what she wants but god loves a drunk and so do i thanks.
A snake in the grass. yesterday i saved a life in the long grass over near yonder lake it lay silent like moss watching us approach sensing my threat but i am old enough now to 6th sense such behaviour i live amidst all manner of felons and i move among them quickly i whistled my dog to me leave it was all i had to say leave it to its life, to its day and we did without fuss with her smiling tongue wagging and my heart peaceful and the beautiful copper creature sliding off into the lake tongue flicking sunset bound.
Beside a pond in main, high and thin sugarcane. under green canes, snake melon vines are their laced skirts. bare face and hands, thorned by its leaves. bare feet and legs, entangled by vines, still looked for melons. in a very hot day in even, searched for a big melon. found objects in a flash, ran to the pond to wash, then took home to share.
A snake is bitten by another snake it is bleeding and leaves and looks for a tree to take some sap for its own cure, a boy sees what the snake is doing waits and when the snake leaves the boy bites the tree to take the sap the boy is cured of its long sickness the tree had long been there near him but it is the snake that points to him the tree that can cure his own malady.
A snake is a snake is a snake he cannot change his scales. hypnotic eyes in a clear blue lake, or out on a rocky trail. beware the vipers, from the pit only one will sound a warning. a temporary lapse, and there's a hit it might be your last morning.
Something moves in the tall forest grass the smooth skin shines in the sun a skin with scales of both brown and yellow the snake scans the ground with lidless unblinking eyes its ears intent hidden by a piece of skin it spots something moving a small frightened mouse hiding in a clump of grass trying to avoid the stare the snake has already eaten but gives the mouse a stare the mouse runs off the snake looks on its tongue flicking in and out now and then the tired snake coils itself up like an old rope and goes to sleep.
The snake has lost his luster, as his venom now i see, though his movements remain graceful they intrigue even me i sit still beside him waiting, for what i am unsure, i could once again be bitten, but he's left me wanting more. for now though he is resting, and i watch with hoe in hand; his strike i know, is sudden but i too could take a stand. dear serpent, rest your eyes don't mind this battered hoe know for you, i've been so loyal; with peaceful sleep i pray you go.
The serpent has mingled with my blood as she devours me, i become her lover half lidded eyes closed with numbness my body tingles from her touch she has me paralyzed she has left me speechless her poison runs through my veins i can feel her all over my body she has become i and i she i can feel myself becoming dead yet alive becoming, soil, water and sky all things and none my soon to be widow lays across my bed and weeping mary, weeps as i leave her for another lover i am afraid to close my eyes.
You stole all my smiles away, there will be no more happiness for me, just tears and sadness all day. you were the snake, that slithered your way into my world, coiled around me, i felt safe in your hold. but you tricked and deceived me, your plan was to use and to leave me, but you couldn't just leave it at that, before you left, you were sure to bite poison straight into my back.

Now what would you think, of a party all pink, with pink iguanas, dressed in pink pyjamas? guests as big as an elephant, their size quite irrelevant, as long as they've the right hue, just remember dyes are taboo. their skin must be real, to join in our meal. the frogs can eat slugs, and all kinds of bugs, like the dragon millipede, which is dangerous indeed. would it be so shocking, when flamingoes come flocking? do you think i'm shallow, to eat only marshmallow? we'll set you a place, if you have a pink face. 'i think, ' said a dolphin called pinky, 'this is all rather stinky. we may look quite bizarre, but colour is not who we are. our skin is only one part, look at others hearts, and get to know their minds, then you'll find, that it's best to be kind. tell everyone alive, they can just arrive, with their own sort of jive. the more different their dance, the better to enhance. teach us something new, follow a different avenue. what might seem strange, can help us to change. a party for all, would be a ball. '.
A posy of pink roses stand on the alter of my church. the roses maybe artificial, but it is what they represent. there is always a welcome for anyone visiting here. they can come to the church for guidance or comfort there. they may come from everywhere and the door is always open to welcome you inside. they can pray a bit, reaching out to our lord, or they can come in for a chat about what is troubling them. for whatever reason they come the door is always open with posy of pink roses on the alter as sign they are welcome there. 9 february 2008.

The pink and orange hues of evening sky, are beautiful yet sad, as all goodbyes. with each breath, i can feel life's fading out, and hear myself, call out your name aloud. an inverted 'v', after a tough day's test; a formation of flock, heading to the nest. each morning glows, then grows to same old night; the reason, my heart sinks at sunset sight. the early morning flight of hope and pride, shall culminate, when tired wings alight.
Palpated her breast, a lump in the throat. the monster that mama and aunty smote. toyed with the pages of a letter she wrote, about the time, she but crossed the moat. devastated and lonely in a bustling world. to nether shores that she was hurled. a rending stream of violating pricks. a heart less journey through so many nicks. handled and mauled by alien hands, her heart and self, now held by bands. the grief and anguish of yet to come. no flames are doused by bottles of rum. just as she stood, a woman in her own. this saga of horror, was at her thrown. how she hated the pitying looks. frantically sought the net and books. with every passing day, the chances grim. no more the charmers to pander a whim. dragged like mom, to the butchers den. so broken she spoke of marcescent men. lost her spirit and her womanliness. the warmth and feel of a loving caress.
A pink bellflower dangling on her strap shouldering pain, blue veins strangling the seeds of desire it's queen heart conspiring for power and gain befitting as the drones die caught in the hem of her gold and emerald attire. mon amant de la mer, your days are martyred in my trust singing my glories to the wind and sea and the cold creatures that lurk below the smooth fluid crust do they also share in your world, in our wilderness of lust? in your folly what have you decreed as the months and years advance and with what treasures will you court your queen in the turbulence of your act? and what great victory shall you stage behind the curtain of carnal pleasure with incessant ship wrecks and delays i still await you as you loiter at your ease. loquacious.

There she sat, head tilted back in elegance pushed by her father in her pink plastic chariot barely two years old with golden multicultural skin a crown of silken shiny curls framed her gorgeous face of regency style, heirs and grace and she knew she was fabulous as she was whooshed past my car window off through the grey sordid concerete as a bright cheery spot pushed by her proud, proud father gracefully picking her tiny button nose.

' she cried more 'you won't understand' 'i won't if you don't say' she took a deep breath and told him straight out 'i love you but you won't give me a chance i want to be more than friends' he finally said 'i do like you but only as a friend' he walked away his words ran through her head the rest of the day the emo in pink couldn't take it anymore she knew he'd find another girl before he gave her a chance so she figured she'd save him the trouble and be away from him he won't have to hear her say 'i love you' or 'i want to be more than friends' he wouldn't care if he ever heard her again and she'd save herself the trouble and forever end her suffering she saw a blade nobody to stop her the blade close to her wrist she couldn't do it. she was too scared she needed a new plan so she took a walk to figure it out it was dark too dark for anyone to see too dark to see the bright pink she wore she was crossing the street and a car came out of nowhere didn't see her until it was too late she was dead she got her wish she no longer suffered he found out and screamed 'why? how could this happen?

I sometimes wear shocking pink underwear. it is my act of rebellion against those who always tell me that i am too pale for bright colours. i wear it under my black dress. with no shoes and a daring glint in my eyes a rebellious spirit, according to the bible, is the same as witchcraft. maybe i am a witch, bewitching you with my black clothes, pale skin, and pink underwear maybe i am an angel, with my bare feet. running circles around your enchanted imagination.
Like a beautiful pink camellia that's how you appear to me that bloom in chilly august on it's dark green mother tree so bright and fresh and pretty in the wintery wind and rain that's how you've always looked to me and that's how you will remain. the beautiful camellia flower that blooms fresh and young today in two or three weeks if that long will have gone into decay for flowers have such a brief span they quickly fade away but in sixty years of living your beauty with you stay. i feel privileged and grateful for to have you as a friend and i will love you and respect you until my life will end you are warm and kind hearted and well loved and well known and it's due to you and to you only that into a better person i have grown. you are wise and quite intelligent and beautiful to behold and you don't have a gray hair on your head and you never will grow old and on your sixtieth birthday you still look beautiful to me like the young and pretty pink flower on the green camellia tree.
We had this priest come and talk to us on the feast day of st. joseph and so strangely he mentioned a girl would know the right guy because he'd be willing to sacrifice his dreams for hers and for god's. not only am i not a god, requiring sacrifice, but my dreams so often don't follow the path i imagine god would dream of. i suppose, at one point, it's him or me. seven deadly pink roses waiting on my windowsill; terrorized in their muted fuchsia, fiery spirit festering and still creeping slow on towards searing, greedy, hot red. as if drinking, in the darkness of lower light and conscious my sleeping breaths morphed you into a grand prophet but i am not goddess, gold idol. are you looking for your god here? i am mud and a whisper of light; without sight and rich with fear. searching for cosmic love, you kiss ornate images of starlight down dripping from heaven's favor into my bored eyes.
A beautiful dozen of pink roses were delivered to our home today. i didn't know who sent them for on the note it didn't say. it was our address, that was what i'd seen but the name for whom it was sent, was for a, mrs. irene. i read the note that was attached in it read a message of friendship, love and hope. 'i hope you 're feeling better dear friend.' this was what the senders note had wrote. i told the delivery man that there must be some mistake. for my name is not, mrs.irene that was the last home owner so here's your flowers back, to take. mrs irene didn't make it, that was what her husband said she had battled cancer, and had fought it well. but i think she sees the pink roses, maybe sent a bit too late and is enjoying the sweetness of their flowers smell.
I stand at watch, this dream caught. issued in, hers, it wiggles, in a gasp, free. disguised the hand, mediums, one portal. the finger, under lip, pinker, sleeps deeper. outside it, below, this dream, flows, reflected from one quick rush, windows paine projector.
Feather light wings that float softly through the air tickled by specks of dust. bright white light inflamed with pink and laced with gold. raising flowers, changing seasons, singing in high pitched voices that only children can hear. little tiny people in little tiny clothes. pink, white and baby blue, only innocent eyes can see. pink nail varnish, pink lipstick, pink eye shadow, pink blusher, pink clothes that reveal too much pink skin. standing on street corners innocent eyes forgotten. long ago were the days when fairies were believed in. lost memories and lost dreams, innocence killed, for a life of nightmares and love ripped at the seams.
Pink flower is beautiful always so much of anything playfully and never dull as it is inside spring tenderly moments to bring on to every summer night until its blossom is gone with beautiful pinkish bright pink flower is like you with all your loving touch so much to make and do if you are in love so much nothing is all like this on to the blue light dark with new spring dawn bliss shades of the petal spark fragrances in the air full of new summer high touching blossom everywhere in the hours going by just like a love to come when love touches heart flowering passion blossom now in these days will start.
I grew even pinker, with each passing verb, she tossed and slung at me. they were bar bless, this crown of thorns, upon her head she tried to wear so well. i bled, but i could not show the harm, flirting is so dangerous, exciting in all honesty, never boring. so pretty misses, if the vines start to bulge, and you turn red instead of pink, stop and please try and reconsider, all the mail, returned to sender as a tease, from all the males.

Two years ago. a spritely human angel in a little pale pink nighty and slippers lean't over the sofa end and kissed my forehead gently whispering 'night kazy, see you in the morning' there was not many mornings left i miss that gentle kiss.
Red lips, are one plan and the fires they light burn too hot..pink lips, cause me too shiver. when seen through transparent windows, and coiled and fresh like the oyster, they are. and black lips shake me too my core, and say things, that i need you to hear me say. front or back, in between they all set me up. and they move me like rain back and forth. the tounge brings me down and your hand brings me up from my knees. that privilege of full lips is not lost on me, it's a simple matter of my pride.

A love so secret, veiled and dark, hidden deep within my heart. yet i think i may be wrong about my heart, my love, my song; is it naught but lustful yearning? a base desire my heart is learning? is it love or is it lust? to find the truth i think i must; search my black and tattered soul, and make the truth my one true goal, until at last my colours show. but, i guess, till then i'll never know.
I have seen the fullness of the glory of the front i am awed my mouth gaped my saliva flowed the heart has no words to say there is marvel in every nerve barbaric in some places setting aside wisdom embracing the moment loving each minute lusting that may last for hours thirst that never satisfies itself with water the hunger that cannot be filled with the wheatness of bread i ask you to make the the turn so i can see the past the fullness of your back the smoothness of that hidden skin the curves that have given me the sense of danger but all these, beauty and desire must prevail there is glory everywhere there are songs in every corner a poem found in every slit there are treasures shown by the maps of every wanting always insatiable always unbearable.

As a lad i set my eyes upon girls with radiant faces. for a kiss? as a youth i cast my eyes on damsels, who had robust busts. for a grab? in my manhood, i was excited by women with sturdy waist. for a bind? growing old, still i was drawn to their smartness and maturity. for a rest? even in my senescence, women matter by vision, voice and words. for a diffusion? birth to death, ever lust persists with the man to feed on women on many phases. 23.07097.
There is no love or lust it is body hunger and must there is nothing like love or attachment it is pure mechanism for adjustment who can define it as pure lust? can any one claim its purest form when he or she is not readily informed? it is purely need that is legally transformed i wish to condemn all on that name we can definitely over come it and rename love or lust grows with time and age we are simply bonded in cage it is fine name given by literary world we simply blow hot and cold let there be open soul search? no one may come forward with his research it is purest form of love if we can understand it may mushroom in any form with wife or husband how do you over come some short comings? that is fine phase with new innings life is nothing new but a bad or good phase we love to play it and still face all possible criticism with no fun fare no one is possible cautious or aware let us not wrap it in beautiful cover it existed before and may remain forever no one has escaped and may not do so in future this fact must be realized for sure we are human beings and may react strongly this is wrost represntation with face so ugly it is pity we ignore the universal fact it may remain forever as matter of fact we may strongly disprove we may try nice point to prove the world may take note of it but remain unmoved the misgivings must at any cost be removed.
Discontented heart and a restless soul, unaware i was of my goals. alcohol, cocaine, hashish and grass transformed me to a creature crass. they pervaded the blood in my veins squandered me to world obscure, where enlightenment was feign. there, euphoria didn't differ from pain. a drizzle felt like deluge, a whisper like roar. where the breeze was a storm, it was a world with no rules no norms. when the monsters exited my veins, my blood burned with fire, bringing me down the spiral melting me into an uninsurable mess. the hallucinatory clouds quickly dissipated bringing to me, numbness i hardly anticipated. such felt the lights glare, i hid from its flair, surrendered myself to darkness and gloom. grappling with questions, i gave in to the temptation. they took me to a world so high far from grievances and sighs. little did i know, my ship struggling to dropp anchor drifted me away from the shore of my life. being a recluse was no longer an excuse. empathy, loath, rebuke, resentment in keeping me company, were all redundant. from my eyes fell tears of blood, for i was drowning in a flood. helpless one day, i found myself on bed. my mother's palm gently stroking my forehead. i was surrounded by moist eyes all of them wearing an honest disguise, making me feel i would still find my light, that my future was shining bright. such intense was my lust for life, then. death was waiting to stake it's claim on my life, when.
The lust we fought for in now just a pile of ash. the lust we fought for was a lie to it's very last. the lust we fought for burns in my memory every night. the kust we fought for wasn't worth it's own right. the lust we fought for seemed so out of control. the lust we fought for only needed us to grab ahold. so the lust we fought for wasn't lust at all. indeed it was love that made our great fall. the lust we fought for keeps me crying at night. the lust we fought for has me praying to turn it right. the lust we fought for makes me miss you more. the lust we fought for broke my heart to it's core. the lust we fought for brings out a million tears. the lust we fought for challenged all of my fears. so the lust we fought for was the pain i deserved to face. indeed it was love from that magically beautiful place. the lust we fought for is now gone up in flames. because i now know that the lust we fought for was real all the same.
Entranced by the jewels of youth when mischief rules our minds, and hormones raging, so uncouth, our eyes upon behinds, i fell for you, in tender storms that swelled, beyond the fly, a promise of what might be, resting on the thigh, and yet as you raised your staff upward, towards the sky, the dawning of my vision cleared, and now i merely question. what was i thinking?.
Eyes the color of gold there is a story that must be told a passionate soul that is true could i be the one for you? within the darkness of night there is a secret i must hide could you be the holder of my pride? through the paleness of life, you will never let me bring down my knife with you buy my side i may never die because i make you form a gentle sigh. you tell me i have no strife but what is the point of immortality if you deny your self the simple pleasures in life the immortality i declare is not the answer so beware.
Each shall have a room, as they are distinct as love is blind, lust has eyes wide open for its games as love is day, lust is the night at the bar as love speaks the truth, lust can just lay silent looking for the tasty froth love need not be beautiful but lust makes it a requisite love may abstain, but lust cannot by its nature it thrives in banquets love is pure but lust goes to mud in all wild wrestling for what it desires i can love you without lust but you may not like it after all i love and lust you and in you love and lust shall hold hands, kiss tight, hiss all the night love and lust the two becoming one to both of us so this union may last this communion of souls.
In my mind i capture and seduce you with the inevitable blashphemy dreams of sex lust at our sight dominating our control of the prudent mind, it's so clear of what this can lead to next your eyes gazing at me lost at the sight of my plush red lips overcomining ethic mentality and you kiss me, a kiss of greed, of wanting to endure the feeling of wanting more, grasping the lust out of me oh, you kiss me your kisses like streams flowing to my neck then to the anatomy of my breast oh, your kisses like winter snow in mid december descending with the rythum of my heart and am unable to breathe my pulse unable to rest you want me but not completly just the love of my physical body the nudity, the fire that burns between my legs the lurid world hidden in my runic thoughts so your monster can run wild with lust then you'll leave, pretending this ever happened this sight, this sacred dream now of lucid exsistance with a secret scilence of a meer memory of my breathing left unbroken.
Wake me up from this dream, nothings ever as it seems. this secret gift we do not share, leaves me wondering if you'll always be there. you bring me up when i am down. you make me smile when you see a frown. being with you is our own perfect world. a great escape from our reality that leaves us bored. i am yours as you are mine. a special love thats so devine. through the years there will be tears. lots of laughter and conquering of fears. i give you my body my mind and my soul, your love completes me, it makes me whole. you are so perfect in every single way. i can't live without you not even a day.
Lust means luxuria, lechery, lasciviousness and sensuality. lust means intensive desire for sexual pleasure, a taboo of the sixth commandments. lust is nothing but power, most aphrodisiacal. lust is carrying women in thought. lust is substituting prostitutes. lust is marrying and sustaining a family, putting up with children crying, overdoing themselves in explanation of lapses, looking at women they like to move around, buying expensive clothes for themselves, gifting valuables to women they have crush on, paying attention to woman other than their wives to make up what was missing without knowing what it is. in a nut shell, lust is in every action. 16.04.2007.
Feeling restless, feeling high this aching heat, it will never die it consumes me so, from the inside wanting escape, release, be on fire. i need to hear you breathlessly curse and moan and sigh my name to taste the salty sheen on your skin, and feel every nuance of your passionate embrace tell me with your body how much you need me, tell me with each thrust how desperate you are i want to hear your crazy erratic heartbeat to slowly melt in your heat as you feel me to taste our sinful essence on your tongue entangled in my mouth like you can't get enough. throw me on the bed of lust, consume me, i want you to make me lose myself completely.

Today i realised lust is not lust i must not be fussed with lust because i have a big bust lust isnt what it seems a hierarchy of beems what does it deem to be? not what it seems i had lust at my breast through that meaty chest i did my best but lust took my breast under the breast lies thy heart lust has to wonder along that part it broke my heart i siezed the day.
The lust for power consumes men blinds the mind and pollutes reason diverts good purposes and then corrupts the character's condition. the lust for power is seductive erodes the noble and benign ignores all truth, it's so destructive insatiable hunger is there assigned. a dragon of three heads set free devours all who would come near lust for power grows greedily claws in position, breeding fear. it lacks all sense of decency and by callous ardor will try to hold the power it gained deceitfully ignoring justice and truth foretold. copyright cynthia buhain april 14,2010.
Tequila breath, death, sex, your face. little dirty secrets and your young taste. never too scared to try what the public hates. showing me your naked body with no haste. i can see the eagerness in your eye's. i can feel the trembling in your thighs. you'll just tell your parents lies. no one knows the sinful lust you tried. you stick your tongue deep inside my mouth. exhilerated, youve become what makes you proud. a little piece of death inside my eye's. lets lock the door and make angels cry. sinful lust in the nude you trust. inner beauty, our privates our most fun. dont be scared, youve done it before. so its okay, were both filthy whores. but on the outside we seem so clean. sometimes things arent as they seem. dirty secrets for eternity. well wear our masks for the world to see.
The lust for power is an addiction the government their own praises do sing and rubbish their main opposition as to government they try to cling the voters bombarded with propaganda right up until election day the true fact of all politicians is they seldom do mean what they say the winners take all of the glory and the winners they do celebrate the prize it is great and worth lying for that's how they feel those who wish to rule the state the lust for power is an addiction and not a harmless addiction 'twould seem without such power some people feel worthless and suffer of low self esteem some people become so power hungry that power to their egos is fuel they feel it is their right to govern that they have been born to rule the opposition as bad as the government they too want power in the worst way any respect to their political opponents they have no desire for to pay it is all about power and their egos power to them is the best thing of all their pride to them is all that matter though pride it can come before a fall.
Orange slice inside my mouth zesty juicy and squirting sweetness from inside out feeding me more succulent dreams streaming out from luscious imaginations hidden behind invisible lovers teasing my heart till invading sparkles sit on the tip of my tongue with ripe bright oranges i slowly lap up for more of the same reviving delicious self pleasing enjoyment on eating a fruit as deep as the ocean of lust.
In loving someone, i cannot tell, the thought of lust, a continous bell, kissing and touching, is this really love? could we live without it? is it something we're above? do we need the touch of another, the caress of his lips, those warm arms around us, when the cold winter nips? could we deny pleasure, or is that all we are? and if we went slower, would we really go far? would we hold on forever, and never let go? or aren't you here forever? these questions i must know. for if you're here for love, i'll love you till i die, but if your here for only lust, im sorry, goodbye.
Trecking in from the wind, is a beauty so joyful, she begins to sing, also very playful, my babe is under my wing. we fly away when the time is necessary, rain or shine we glide so high, feeling safe which is a necessity, no one can deny or intefere which is why, we float in extacy, bleeding through our veins, running deep in our blood, is more we could gain, with a added bonus for a lust for love.
What is it really? is it within you? ..is it your lips wrapped around it? is it in the head? is it in the moon? venus really is it? is it always fault of mars.. is it always to soon? if it's touched..once is it lust..ing..? if it's touched over and over like book shelves is it dusting? what if it's touched just to hear it make it's noise that wet noisy? can lust make it feint? if streams damn a lake runs to rivers in currents ocean is flavor is it lust? is lust like dusting, out so call the maid, ring for the butler, man it is armed. over maid being dusted? what is it, is it lust..? is it very sweet musk? is it lust to touch one smile into another two smiles just to cover all the smiles? what is lust..is it need or is it simply thick seed running, into wells never filling, a truth? is lust yours simply unsealed, mounted, covered and filled?.
Lust destroyed my love lust pushed away my one lust made me weak lust took the one love lust killed my happiness lust is a sin i committed lust, i shouldn't had done lust got my suffocating lust made light turn into darkness lust made me miss my wife lust, my innocent girl is hurt lust i hurt myself too lust i miss my family i built lust, you were my biggest mistake.
The lust for power and money to corruption lead and some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed and big corporations do not have a soul the avarice that afflicts them their thinking control. the distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair and thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay. to be born of poor parents is their only crime and they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime in refugee camps they are forced to reside in a land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed. 'tis true power can be a corruptible thing of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing why laud people who have far more than enough when millions are homeless and have to sleep rough. the lust for power seems to be thriving of late and only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair in a world where empathy and compassion are rare.
He's just too 'touchy feely' he gets too close to me he gets a kiss from all the girls from six to eighty three but i don't think he likes me he avoids all my advances 'cos deep down it would be a thrill to get a priest's romances i'm really not that jealous though he never meets my gaze perhaps he's hoping my desire is just a passing phase perhaps i should leave well alone as a christian woman oughta instead i'll try to fix him up with my unmarried daughter.
My heart beats faster as i almost expect you to be there, as i look for you for, for your eyes, for your lips, for your touch. my skin yearns for you, for your fingers to linger across my chest. my lips need your soft tender kiss. i can't keep doing this i can't stop doing this, i need this, i need you. i.. need.. you. this thing, this yearning, this lust, i need.
Sail with me on my boat to the sea your breasts my paddles my pelvis your floor sail with me in the ocean of desire lust with me on this little leak of my boat to the sea sink with me to the deepest thoughts of the sea learn with me the meaning of love the true meaning of true love death of desire rising at the end to the greater joys of foam at the surface the sun, the moon and then the stars.
Blood dripping from the fangs that bite clothed within the dark of night discarded prey dropped out of sight the vampire stood nightly ventures from his lair cruel dark eyes that hold and stare tempting humans unaware the vampire waits shadowed by the trailing leaves an unsuspecting victim weaves the living heartbeat soon to grieve the vampire stalks under the cold dark waning moon one maiden's blood has made him swoon though undead sleep will claim him soon the vampire feasts cursing his old immortal soul he dreams and wishes he were whole even in death, life takes its toll the vampire sleeps sunset comes in the blink of an eye announcing an already menacing sky savouring the mortal about to die the vampire wakes.
I was lost 6 months ago it was lust that drove my soul i couldn't controll. what happened that night what a loss i say to you it wasn't love but why not try something new? why judge someone you don't know? just open your mind and go with the flow but no. you had left so many words unspoken i have questions, but your mind still isn't open what a loss i say to you.
Under the moonlight together we'll lie held tightly in your arms together you and i alone together at last how did i ever go on without you in my past each moment sweet kiss i simply can't resist everytime you touch me i feel comeplete when our eyes meet my hand is yours together walking along these shores we're perfect for each other a heavenly pair we're just two people whose lives we can share.
When i see the world, for you when you became the world to me a rainbow arched beyond the storms to green pastures of destiny where our paths converge as if god himself determined that this was the time that we had walked enough alone on those sad and winding roads when i see the world, for you by you, this is now a beautiful place in the sun that parts the darkened clouds in the presence of his grace your hand in my hand, together we face the uncharted horizon of hope, of promise, of love that god's gift of time is ours to share as we walk by the calm and shimmering sea down the glorious road now set before us onward to eternity.

That beach where we sit together beside the sea where our hands stretch out to be held again like yesterday is actually a vow, a promise that never shall again the sea and the earth part like two lovers taking opposite ways the sea licks the thighs of the earth and the earth surrenders in utter pleasure.
I hung the decorations and i trimmed the christmas tree. what really means the most of all is that you're here with me. you make the season special without spending lots of dough. your neverending friendship means more than you could know. i can't say what it means to me to share this special time. i thank god for another year that he's let you be mine. let's deck the halls and celebrate with family and friends. but, lets take time for you and me before the season ends.
Family comes together for always and forever in sickness and in health in poverty or in wealth family comes together for always and forever without any reason anytime or any season family comes together for always and forever in death or in life in happiness or in strife family comes together for always and forever in anger or in kindness whether all seeing or in blindness family comes together for always and forever whether for work or for play they somehow find a way for family to come together because families are forever.
I could never be without you in our lives, because you are our life. we are on a long voyage, a journey, a path that is uncharted. there are hills that will tire us and valleys that will amaze us, cliffs that will frighten us and oceans that will almost overwhelm us, there will be times for resting and healing our wounds and time for working to just make it through, we will ache and face sorrows, as well as celebrate triumphs, some nights will be dark with nothing to guide us, others bright, as the moon will shine on us, days that are frigid that chill our deep bones, followed by afternoon breezes that warm our souls, we will take turns, one can lead and one can follow filling the other when hopes seem so hollow. mount everest is a beast but well worth the climb as life is a tower, we must follow time. today may not be the same as tomorrow, it may bring us hope or it may bring us sorrow. but one thing i know that i can assure you, i promise you this, i never will leave you, i may fall behind, or get far ahead, but i will always wait, or catch up instead. we are partners traveling together. even if we get lost we will still be in good company.
My inability to fluctuate causes me to dissipate transient in nature but stolid in form panic unleashed, i hyperventilate moorings are broken, stability torn from deep in a hole these changes accelerate blending and blurring the pieces within no safe haven for me to extrapolate no end in sight, nowhere to begin i bow down to unity and flee from my sanity consciousness shared is one never lost striping me of my valued humanity solace in union at very high cost.
I am not like you, and you are just like that. how can you demand, when i've asked from you something? i don't think i should command. or expect respect. that should be given. of that i do not neglect. and you expect it? when you neglect it? i am not like you, and you are just like that. i try to be hospitable. i don't welcome with attacks. to bite and then regret. to greet and meet to leave upset. i am not like you. i welcome not condescend. nor do i solicit attention, to be focused on me. using that as a forum, to exploit me on the scene. i am not like you. i could never be like that. but i can be quite indignant, when i learn i've been scandalized. behind my back, by you. i am not like you, and you are just like that. bitter. and unable to forgive. baiting to become the center of attention. and using me as the subject, of your sorrows. i am not you, but you are just like that. and that is why you and i, have no tomorrows. to await for apologies to soothe. with alibis and excuses too. i am not you, but you are just like that. and that is why you and i, could never experience another forever, ever together, again.
Together we await the storm this storm of love where the possiblitys are so great our love can take us any where together we await the storm the love we have can last for ever together we share our souls as one together we await the storm together we await the storm together we await the storm tonight will be our night together we await the storm tonight will be the night together we await the storm the night of our love storm.
We go out together into the staring town and buy cheese and bread and little jugs with flowered labels everywhere is a tent where we put on our whirling show a great deal has been said of the handless serpents which war has set loose in the gay milk of our heads but because you braid your hair and taste like honey of heaven we go together into town to buy wine and yellow candles.
I am bored with love and it's passionless limbs that drape over my bed in a lethargic state of impotence while wearing the same red heart my soul picked up hitchhiking off highway now here we are alone in togetherness trying to build dreams with two by fours and glue but even a home won't tie us together when our hearts live alone poetic vows clinched into nothingness like all words do eventually and we allowed our bodies to become another pair of hollow shadows that make love to a wall instead of each other and we wonder why the roses are dying.
The old, oak tree stands firm, so full of historical memories that only can be expressed fully by the documented words in diaries. beside a tarnished statue it stands, its stiff old branches pointed upward toward the puffy, white clouds in the sky, and some of its limbs hung downward above the statue's bowing head as though they would protect it from the weather elements, and the caretaker's gross neglect. many years of tribulation have gone by, but the tarnished statue and the old, oak tree remember together the vast suffering of the bloody conflict that used to be.
His eyes are fixated on her soul her scent lingers on his clothes her lips want nothing more than a kiss his hands want nothing else but her with nothing to say is every word they're meant to be forever entwined no matter the scene no matter the world t'was love at first sight no plan no time the beauty inside is for eyes he holds behind his looks what her heart desires only had he ever lusted and dreamt until this day she's in his arms didn't want her for lust or her sight he wanted her heart he knew t'was right he questioned not once on how he felt he knew t'was love and nothing else so pure and so gentle he'd never pick fights unless t'was for his lover his wife met young and grew old together hand in hand they found their love in a grain of sand it came out of nothing though some may say it came from the stars where the moon doth lay it came from their life their love in their hearts apassion in soul a love in an art together and always soulmates forever monday 22nd september 2008.
That exciting moment was finally here, we didn't have to wait any more it's a girl i heard the doctor say, the joy in my heart cannot be described we held each other close as we cried with joy till we realized it was quiet as we turned to look at the doctors they were looking at us in a sad way i'm sorry to tell you this but your daughter has a few problems in her body she probably won't live to be but a few days old if she makes it that long i'm so sorry, but you can hold her for as long as you would like to for now they said she didn't have any eyes and she would never be able to see she didn't have a brain so her body wouldn't be able to function properly these were only a few of the problems that my daughter was born with we only had the joy of having her in our life for about one month then the lord took her home so that he could make her whole i can't wait until the day when i see the miracles that were performed and i'll feel that joy all over again just like the day that she was born but this time we'll be together forever in eternity never to face any tears.
The hour is falling free into the reflections of going mood purpose and work about for you and for me river of words life's food everything coming to go passions of feelings loss enormous ways you'll know getting day's music across the times of being here in our answers to find about the thoughts we give and share through the echoes where we together are entwined.
I plunk at a beach, silence herein, i am, bit by bit, shredded by winds i pause all alone, nowhere to go, as if i were lost, in a crossroad fall on my knees, and it is you i see dancing gracefully in a place i can't be flash before me, our memories, i close my eyes and it's i perceive, but, piece by piece, those memories, fading away, leaving me at a bay silence hurts me, tears me apiece but inside my heart, there goes a story won't ever last, though my body is torn apiece by winds before me. 'all of our trance, won't ever end until we can dance, together again'.
You have my heart and i have yours i dream about you and you dream about me too. promise me will stay together promise me will be together forever. tell me that you love me tell me that you need me but most of all promise me. promise me will always be together. lets always be together forever i need you and i think you need me too. we love eachother while we care for one another so promise me will always be together.
Long back when you were you and i was i we walked together side by side trying to keep our thoughts hand in hand fumbling for sameness and painting for an abstract future we walked together awake or in slumber holding the thought of togetherness in the midst of a vortex then we walked together step in step when i became you and you became me we walked miles together having together a sip of life even if it was sweet or elixir bitter or with venom tasting each other's tears imaging inner souls and flying high and falling down to hell we walked together suddenly a thought of teasing you vanish as a dewdropp but still we walk together it's not for others but i feel your touch holding my little finger to transfer unseen strength to complete the journey we walk together my slow steps in your long strides my tired soul getting consoled in your unseen hands my feathery body leaning on your shoulder we walk together day and night till the twilight of life we walk together.
Let us you and me be together living in happiness and nothing would disturb us whatsover. let us run away from this society and live our life without worry let us get rid of this anxiety and make a lovely story. nobody would keep you away from me cause i will endlessly weep till the tears turn to a sea that would drown everything deep. i wish our dreams come true and one day be together the only one that i love is you and you will stay in my heart forever.
Alone together in the darkness i can hear your heart beat alone together in the darkness i would ask for your heat alone together in the darkness i don't want you to retreat alone together in the darkness may your touch always be sweet.
I saw a butterfly i saw him well the tears were in his eyes they burned like hell he looked like just the strongest one in this world but if you touched him he could die this lovely butterfly who dreamed of life as he spread his wings to fly beyond the skies he wished the world would see him for who he is a lovely butterfly, not an eagle the butterfly i saw.

Went down to the garden and see a caterppilar crawling struggling on the earth in reality she is a butterfly working out for her rebirth, and after her rebirth, she's going to fly. she is going to shed that heavy coat and bounded chain and take on her new wings. and fly high above the sky. if we are a worm covered with the dust, trying hard to please but afraid to fail and feel like having nailed. remember we are a butterfly inside. and he is going to shed the coat and his nailed had set us free. if we hang in there you'll see, we are a butterfly we are going to shed the coat and someday reach, reach for the sky. 6. january 2008.
Long, long ago, there was a tale of a blue butterfly, that live in a silvery cage, up at the cold attic, silhouetted against the wall, surrounded by eerie silent, lost in the unknown time. it flapped its wings hopelessly, around the dusty cage, its magnificent colour getting paler and fader, under the screened window, and its spirit slipped away, inch by inch into the thin air. but i do not know, the ending of this tale, and only the blue butterfly, and he who know it to the very end.
Sweet, bide with me and let my love be an enduring tether; oh, wanton not from spot to spot, but let us dwell together. you've come each morn to sip the sweets with which you found me dripping, yet never knew it was not dew but tears that you were sipping. you gambol over honey meads where siren bees are humming; but mine the fate to watch and wait for my beloved's coming. the sunshine that delights you now shall fade to darkness gloomy; you should not fear if, biding here, you nestled closer to me. so rest you, love, and be my love, that my enraptured blooming may fill your sight with tender light, your wings with sweet perfuming. or, if you will not bide with me upon this quiet heather, oh, give me wing, thou beauteous thing, that we may soar together.
Butterfly, oh butterfly, why do you hide in the shadows? spread wide your wings, let your heart sing and come dance with me in the meadow butterfly, oh butterfly, why do you fear? you'll never stray, i'll lead the way just follow the path, i'll be near butterfly, oh butterfly, have you no hope? drink of the sun, our life's just begun thro time's hills and valleys we'll lope butterfly, oh butterfly, dare you to dream? on our hearts we depend, shall we follow the wind and consign to the fates grander scheme?.

I captured a butterfly in a jar i danced around in the grass for hours chasing it down stumbling falling laughing making the chase the most rewarding i captured a butterfly in a jar there it was for me to hold and keep forever anytime i wanted to relish in the joy of life there it was for me to look upon i captured a butterfly in a jar time eroded on and all things change the butterfly became just another bug trapped in a glass cage i captured a butterfly in a jar and saw how sad it truly was a prisoner and i the jailer i had to let it go i captured a butterfly in a jar i opened that lid and allowed it to go and it flew away far from me it left me yearning for that summer day i captured a butterfly in a jar but maybe it captured me because ever since that butterfly flew away i have never again felt free.

Vulnerable, soft and fragile delicate to the touch dodging, ducking, evading every attempt to clutch indian lore has told me a butterfly can grant a wish but first it must be captured and my desire whispered to it for the whisper to be granted the butterfly must be set free a difficult choice i ponder will my butterfly come back me?.

The little wings, bearing the colors, moving around the flower, charming her, kissing the petals, taking all the honeys, again forget her, leave her alone, take shelter of another, again making love, the consequences are same, may be he is the beauty, but he is the fortune hunter, the little butterfly.
Nobody knows this little butterfly, who wanders and roams who seeks for the senses of love, nobody knows her, so tender so pure, little butterfly, her colors are baby pastels like new souls and holy spirits of bliss. every petal touched by her caterpillars become an essences to the touch, her ultraviolet sight that only she can posses, the wonder of her unique little body and sense, nobody knows her, nobody sees the beauty in her. only the blissful only the lovers of love, nobody knows her, nobody sees her, because those who see are blind to her colors and soul, i am a butterfly.
I'm a bleeding butterfly. my wings are made of glass but are strong enough to carry me. my spirit glides like the summer breeze.. fragile yet untouched. i'm a bleeding butterfly, i will leave a rainbow in your sky with a trail of tears behind me. to love me is fatal, to feel me is toxic. to touch me would break me. the thought is too much.
You're pathetically ugly, thats what they all say. as they frolic together, in the summer and play. and i'm all alone, all by myself. here in my tree, with nobody else. but the jokes on them, and soon they will see. all of this beauty, that lives inside me. for my time will come, and some day real soon. when i step outside, of my self woven room. in my beautiful colors, so pleasing to eyes. kaleidoscopical beauty alive in the sky.k.
Butterfly, butterfly flew so high. butterfly, butterfly caught my eye. eyes were a glisten, wings winked in delight. sought such a current so as he could drift in warm summer's night. but as the days shorten he sags in the air. gracefully curves downwards, until he lies motionless so calm and fair.
As love falls down from the sky, it lands on the wings of a butterfly. the butterfly sings it's songs and rhymes, and flies through the air, no concept of time. it is the messenger of patience and change, from flower to flower, it's odd and it's strange. the butterfly can transform it's world. and give way to new beginnings, unfurled, it is the keeper of transformation, and flies on faith and imagination. the butterfly as no fear of change, it bravely escapes it's homemade cage. to change, it knows is necessary, for all the burdens we need not carry. the butterfly soars, and merrily sings, for, without change, it could never grow wings.
You are my butterfly so graceful and beautiful you are my loving butterfly i'm so glad that i have you as my butterfly i love you so much and that will never change you are my butterfly but not only are you my butterfly. you are my special mother.

Running running away from my tears away from my pain away from my fears away from my shame away from my peers running running ill be with you there ill make you happy ill be your right pair rnning running i wish i was gay i wish for that happiness i wish? must i may? running running im running so fast away from my family away from my past running running i am so ashamed i am so embarrassed im a bottle of pain.
Running, running there is nothing lef to do. running. away from my tears away from my pen running to know who i, am. running but you, don't know what, you're, running from. running in circles going nowhere. i'm saying goodbye i am running away. never stop running words running throught, my mind. running away, like the coward, like him horrible words i am running and running, for you. i m running but to where? i can't believe that i've put up with you lies. im running from the past.. running out the pain. running with out you.
I'm running from my tears, and i'm running from my cries. i'm running from my friends, and i'm running from my life. everyone i've hurt, and everyone whose cared. everyone whose tried, and everyone whose dared. everything i've done, and every time i've tried. everything i've said, and every time i've cried. as i run into the dark, as i run from the light. who will guide me through? and who will make this right? why should i stop? why should i slow down? when all that waits for me, is a lonely heart that's drowned. so who am i? what have i become? but a stranger in the night, a man who is on the run. who will care? and who will try? who will understand? and who will just walk by? as the rain rolls in, and every ones in bed, i'm out on this road, and i'm walking straight ahead.
I run barefoot and cold wanting to go where nobody has ever gone to the moon or maybe even the stars they all seem so far but i'll find the right place where i'll sit and wait and hope and pray that all these bad thoughts will go away but i highly doubt it, because these memories are here to stay, untill they go black and fade away.
Could there be a more perfect reason for a great guy like you to possibly like me back or even love me to attract people from my outside and make them run from what i seem to hold within me i never seem, to get them to stay you look at me with wantings eyes wanting me to let you in i let you see pieces and letting you think that you are completly in but are you? are you willing to stay when things get roough? and hold me when things fall apart? to be there to whipe my tears? so many questions, so many doughts will you run like so many befroe? i love you with all of my heart do you?.
Running away isn't as easy as it seems. there's no deserted mountain waiting when you come, no peaceful fountain to drink from. the stars won't be convenient at night, they won't lead you down by the river to rest. the hanging moon won't be fluoresced. no, running away is no means of escape, it will only bring you closer to fear and failure. those who want to get away from their problems must never run away, but learn to endure.
Running away that's what i'll do run away, away from you i'll run a million miles and sail the ocean blue i'll do anything to get away from you i'll battle a rattle snake i'll stab it with this stake i'll do whatever it takes i'll be out on the street with nothing to eat i'll end up probably dead with an injury on my head it doesn't matter because you'll be far away from me.
Deep as my love runs so runs yours too. caught at the point of the centre, our hearts, beating deep, retreat further as true love and devotion merge. no more apart, our souls meld, then reappear, fired as one. we are the same, identical aims run along a joined vein of life. desires become cemented in needs of the other. some days the pulsing of you fills my spirit with rivers of longing. when will you come and claim what's your own? i must inhibit the joy of that day, but as summer shone bright over my clouded life then, so rain your love deep, flood me with sunshine again.
Running away from honesty not touching anything not touched too by anyone you keep on running and running away? no one is reached no one reaches for you you keep on running and running away from no one but yourself because what you touch bites you and what you love is always a stone thrown at you and so you keep on running and running away from honesty and having gained speed you have become the fastest lie that even the winds of the northern seas cannot catch even a glimpse of who you are.
Why do you why, never bending, over it? could you not simply, as you would and should with it? and comes the blame, does it not often help lay windblown there, some where, lost in the middle of it? whisper then each kiss, and moreover it wading after running out of water.
Time is running short and i have to be on time at god's house god doesn't like when i arrive late for the service i try to be on time but i always fail on that that is something that i need to work on.
Time is running out tell me now before i leave time is running out what i have is what you need time is running out for you to tell me how you feel time is running out for you but not for me to heal.
At least he's not causing pollution of him that would be fair to say he runs to the work yard in the morning and back home at the end of the day a distance of some twelve kilometres that is six kilometres each way a fitness fanatic and a hard working fellow for him never an easy pay. wearing running road shoes and shorts and a light vest he carries his working gear in his backpack he runs to the work yard every morning and after work to home runs back a man in his thirties with a wife and teenage daughters he is a few years past his prime he never does work at the weekends and he never does work overtime. one who has run in many marathons and he always finishes his race his last marathon was his best finish just beaten by the winner into second place still he is one i do not envy and him i've no wish to emulate i could not push myself like he does i have no desire to be great. just before daybreak in the morning he is one you are bound to meet he runs to his workplace in the suburbs on the sidewalk from street to street to running he does seem addicted he works hard and he runs every day whilst others in their their beds are sleeping through the suburbs to works he jogs his way.
Running circles in the dark wanting nothing but the pain to stop wishing my life would depart i scream but no one hears me like no one can see wishing some one could try and help me but no one likes me so how can they try and love me i mean who esle can i be so ill stay here forever running circles in the dark with my life falling apart im in a place where the pain will never stop running circles in the dark.
Running away like a cat trying to catch its own tail, keep on running try catching a shadow keep on running sweat out the feeling of air and breeze and smoke and fog all whipped up by this wind keep running pursue the reasons why one must keep running does it really help you cope up with what you are leaving?.
Strike me right to the heart. why am i feeling so insecure.. pieces on the wall, start to tear. puzzle pieces, no longer there. thoughts continue to scare.. is it still there? if you ask me.. i kno my part is.. i'm feeling like running.. should've started packing.. no more falling.. i stand, watching the time go by.. with every second.. you remain in my mind. mixed thoughts, heart starts shaking. hands trembling.. eyes resting.. theres only one.. just one.. no one else.. but you.. insecure with the thoughts that remain.. feeling like running, should've started packing.. but i dont feel like leaving.. for that.. i am staying.. i'll watch it blow up in my face.. i'll watch it rejuvenate.. whatever it is.. theres no running away.
Running in a race, but not the same past, i wish i could go faster, but my body wont let me, like im tied in chains, and the pain is to insane, running till i fly, but my wings wont let me, like a bird with dislodged wings, running in place, even though im comming in late, and i bit to much on the plate.
When you are running through the streets there is no hope for you you have got to pick yourself up isn't there something better for you to do there is nothing but trouble if you continue to stay within the vicinity if you do not make this move now no one will show you any sympathy.
I'm burning all my bridges and i'm running out of time if i'd had just one more minute i could have somehow made you mine, but as it is, im broken and im falling to the ground, im weightless, empty, and nothing i say makes a sound. baby please tell me that you want me so maybe this writers block will ease. there was a time i would have told you that without you i cant breathe. oh but darling my ego is fragile and its only getting worse. these easy words and my cruel detachment is my long suffered curse.
My soul wants to fly away riding on a brilliant ray to a land of oblivion where im known by no one just live my life in peace no one to hurt no one to please away from the complexities that this life brings to its crease but then i think why run away the road does get rough in its way but it also streteches out in a straight road it may be long but you do reach your abode as long as you dont hurt anyone knowingly absorb the ride, its highs and lows in totality pain is a part of the road and will make you realize feel it, endure it and it will help you rise.
Forever through the darkness. wind whipping like pain through your heart, unable to stand, unable to sit. you keep running on and on and on. silent footsteps trace your route through the darkness you're running on foot. silently floating the followers are. they know why you're running and they know where you are. you've ran so far yet you've ran so little. you'll never escape so don't even try. the followers know where your planning to hide. bury them deep but they will come back. the longer you ignore them the harder they'll track; along the roads to follow you, floating around you in everything you do. yet i'm still running in the darkness running through the night. running out the pain running without a light.
Running water on the river despite the boulders it finds itself its way to where all the waters meet in that destination of everything and everyone running restless souls towards the same destination it is not divergence it is convergence it is the oneness of all rivers of all souls i run and flow i become everything and everyone at the end from this flow on this journey towards everything and everyone i am gone i am found i am lost i am the drop becoming a part of the ocean's universe.

One must not take love wrongly a kiss may mean anything emotion gets physical in different ways if planted on the head think of me always is a likely import for a kiss planted on the cheeks it calls for fraternity even in strain on the back of the hand what other meaning than adoration for the one beloved or on the feet unreserved worship indeed it is only when a man kisses his wife full on the lips that romance is exclusively expressed they lock in passionate embrace tumbling to the floor in throes of devouring passion making bashful sounds they will disdain in the somberness of morning it is not so i feel for my best friend with him every touch is only a call to truer fraternity that one heart may sincerely love the other as unto itself.
The waters rippled on an incoming tide the shimmering finger of the moon danced on the small waves a hiss of rolling stones broke the silence as waves invaded and retreated on the shore they walked oblivious to it all the silent whispers from their eyes told the age old story as they strolled beneath the heavens with its millions of eyes no voices broke the stillness of their evening bliss the smiles etched on their faces only spoke of a stolen kiss.
When i daydream what do i see you, waiting for me you ask me how i feel with you it feels real we sit and talk and on the beach we walk you compliment me as we watch the deep blue sea i look at your eyes and you start to watch mines i move close to your face too see how a kiss taste.
The woman full. the sun it burns. the earth when wet which scented smells. between the collums, where you stood, i am. rising from the mud. the squelch of sound is of. the seaweed it is dark it grasps my feet. released divine all knowledge, of some lighter secret? pulsing, pulsed it's forced, as it pours out. do you as other people touch that feeling? what kind of sight, first night? the love of wind is travelling through the air, and the northern star, the rainstorm, where the water it is sharp. two bodies which become. each depending on the others single sweetness. kissing you, i kiss the sky, and by your kiss, i slip once more into the night.
I will kiss you good night good morning good day when you open your eyes when you close them again i will kiss you lips exploring textures untested new tastes, new temptation probing, delicious and sweet dancing, delighting teasing i will kiss you as you feast upon my love as you consume my body let me fill you with my joy then, i will kiss you again.
Sounds very simple to do, to kiss me quick but your love must be true and to catch me, is the trick when our lips do meet i know it will be such a treat for me as well as you nice and wet like the morning dew lips twisting and turning for more defiantly yearning and i'll probably want a lot once i have been caught.
With an energy of love between our hands, fingers laced between the other. that first touch of fire reveals the power starting to burst and starting to smother, tingling tightening, to squeeze off your air, blood rushes off to southern most parts, your scalp is alive with bumps in your hair, your face is reddened with a pounding heart, then he pulls you close and you feel the strength, of encircling arms around your waist, gently he presses, and kisses at length. then you look into his rugged soft face, and smiling and giggling, at all this, you try and savor your very first kiss.
Closed eyes can see, lips upon lips. thoughts empty of resistence, bodies filled with urgency. hunger turns into a beast, without hesitation. closer than close, lips brush lips. electricity surges, lightning strikes the sky. tongues seductively dance, harmonous with the sounds of lust. passion consumes, lips tasting, feeling, teasing, yearning, urgent to satisfy the starvation of time. tongues gently licking wet lips, sucking. bodies are alive, buring with heat. all reason cast aside. the sheer pleasure of a oneness, feverish, passionate, wanting more. more pleasure, more hot steamy, wet tongues flickering. slowly parting gazing eye to eye, the purist truths exposed. nothing hidden in the instant that we first kissed.
Brunette lady with dark mysterious eyes, you even mesmerize the moonlight falling softly upon you with love. in a midnight garden, roses sleep like happy angels, but you walk with a man kissing the nape of your neck, running his hand beneath your blouse to touch your stomach in ecstasy. the heavens are breathing romance, amorous gods and goddesses are disrobing, the world is becoming intoxicated with the wine of desire, and you alone surpass them all with your supple body of captivating dreams, with the slightest movements of your breasts making every gazing man tremulous, setting off lovely eruptions. it is impossible to possess you, but i would repeatedly kiss the pillow that has cradled and caressed your head while you peacefully slept and left the world anxiously waiting to see your magnificent vision again.
He dances with his shadow like a youthful fred astaire, such symbiotic harmony, they make a perfect pair. no footfalls can be heard around about them as they move, through empty evening streets, they waltz to beats of true love's groove. they float upon a vapour trail which carries them aloft on mem'ries of the sweetest touch of tender lips, so soft. he laughs at shadow's antics as his mind's consumed with bliss and the treasure she bestowed him with that magical first kiss. a moment that he carries even to this very day, though many years have pass'd them by, they both still feel that way. the passion that ignited in the fuel of youthful lust, became so much more to them, through their love, respect and trust.
Let me kiss that special kiss the one that's more than touch that gentle pressing of the lips persuading blood to rush the kiss that makes you tremble and makes your legs go weak a moist embrace of tenderness that takes you to your peak with a heady scent of passion it makes your body sway the kiss that penetrates your soul and takes your breath away it lingers for a lifetime you never will forget the bursting of your senses when our emotions met.
It was a late november night i remember it well we went to the movies in russelville my parents drove and in the back we cuddled when we dropped you off and i walked you to the door we kissed it was a shy awkward kiss but one that i'll remember because in it i felt a promise from god to me that you and i will always be together since then theres been other kisses some more passionate and loving some more meaningful and romantic but nothing can beat that first time when our two lips met it was one second of our time but it'll last for eternity.
There's a kiss to say i love you, there's a kiss to say i care. there's a kiss to prove our friendship, there's a kiss for us to share. there's a kiss to say it's true but the kiss i love the most, is the kiss i get from you.
Golden slumbers kiss your eyes, smiles awake you when you rise ; sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry, and i will sing a lullaby, rock them, rock them, lullaby. care is heavy, therefore sleep you, you are care, and care must keep you ; sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry, and i will sing a lullaby, rock them, rock them, lullaby.
The kiss was two hearts in the warmth. the kiss was two hearts enjoyed each other. the kiss was fate in the love. the kiss was love fire. the kiss completed the life. you kissed because of the love. i kissed because of the longing. the kiss was two speaking hearts mutually. kiss.please i'want to kissed. the kiss planed the love in the love. the kiss described all the colours of the rainbow in the heart. the kiss maintained loyalty. the kiss escaped from the sadness. the kiss was the friend in solitude. the kiss was to introduce us in the belief. the kiss mixed all the feelings. the kiss decorated the world. did you want to feel the kiss to be perfect? the perfect kiss must with the love. the perfect kiss must with the sincerity. the perfect kiss must with the wish. the perfect kiss must despise the belief on the love. the perfect kiss must with the prayer. the perfect kiss god bless you.
A room no music nobody within i am out when i am back music no room square of music and tears square of fear, erected laugh and murder the kiss i could see the dagger and the lightning of fear glinted on it a dropp of tear i heard the hiss. a stream of blood i remember a kiss.
The soft plump faded pink lips the green eyes looking deep within the soul. friends for a year, memories that would last a life time. drooping my face towards the stiff grey concrete. angles of today that are, unheard of. never been kissed, as the wet lips subside, on there own. lonely and loosing love, crackling the red heart within. pain as it deteriates. i want to take the heart beats from your body. fill in the gaps of the dried out heart. catch you when you fall, and be there when you need someone to love youthe most. your first wet smile, to make yours greater in size. the kiss you will remember and hold on to, never letting go. as i say i love you you slip away from me once and for all.
That kiss, that kiss. that kiss, that i do miss. that love, that love. prettier than a dove. that heart, that heart. that heart, that shone like art. her hair, her hair. it floated on the air. that lie, that lie. that lie, that made her cry. the fool, the fool. i was, to think it cool. the knife, the knife. that ended my life.
The words i say today make the world fall away the ring on your finger means your here to stay the smile on your face lets me know you love me when i wake up your the first thing i want to see the look in your eyes make the world go away the words we say makes my heart skip a beat the bliss in this kiss is ever so sweet with your hand in mine its not hard to find my very own piece of heaven were the angels fly happy and free there i find you circled by these angles that sing they sing a song a melody of bliss in a kiss your kiss.
A kiss down by the riverside, when the waterspouts comes to life and across the evergreen glide. a kiss with your mouth open wide, with noses nuzzling and lying on a foliage mattress with nothing to hide. a kiss beneath the harvest moon, in the wheat and the rye, when pixies spiral to an eventide rune 'til the morning phoenix soars by. a kiss during a fiery noon in the fields of midday bloom and so sings the loon while petals rise from the gloom. a kiss, for birds to sing, for the winter to turn to spring an exchange of bliss, a kiss, to melt a world of snow in one breath of warm mist.
They were a soft kiss that he felt on his lips. the kiss was gentle and made him fell warm. the kiss made him fell safe and secure. just for the special seconds he had her in his arms. even then this angel who kiss him disappeared. he knows that deep in his heart. he had a kiss of an angel in his heart.
To these i turn, in these i trust; brother lead and sister steel. to his blind power i make appeal; i guard her beauty clean from rust. he spins and burns and loves the air, and splits a skull to win my praise; but up the nobly marching days she glitters naked, cold and fair. sweet sister, grant your soldier this; that in good fury he may feel the body where he sets his heel quail from your downward darting kiss.
Poets today in what so ever land can be agent to inspire anybody that today we need to understand, changes changed us into mediocrity. our good values of sharing a hand to those who need our sympathy, like the poor and needy of the land who never had behold the beauty of living a life without strife upon had turn into a deaf advocacy. useless war against humanity, erred by poverty across every land, and the burning fire of other's tyranny, besets nations to remain us one need to be stop to save humanity. in our own little way, we can be agent of change with a conviction that by the power of our poetry we can bring peace, love and union across every land in our world today.
Near to the ocean close to my heart calm one day cyclone another the waves with regularity crash break spraying spray day after day near to the ocean close to my heart "welcome" change. but then everything resumes its course.
Time or fate may separate friends, lovers, but friendship or love that's true will ever thenceforth continue to live forever, true love conquers the odd with its power. as time passes by, things change with the time, every moment, hour, day, month, and year, all things have their turn to change with the time, life, time, and events change with the years. everyone, everything, have a time and day, a time to change, end, begin a new day, change is life, the course of life everyday, all things change, and we change with them all days. only the eternal one is constant, all things in the universe, inconstant, but despite it all, love is important, the world may change, but true love is constant.
The fireworks have flown, the wishes have been welcomed, the booze has reached the brain, yet everything still seems the same, alhtough one year has bid us farewell, and a new year has arrived. on the acid crystal drops of the rain. a heavy head greets my morning, just as it has always done, as sure as the sky and the sun, the coffee still tastes as bitter as i, like it did last year, and the year before, the car refuses to wake from its mechanical sleep, the radio showers my ears with static, just as it did last year. the date may have changed, but life's enduring pains, simply move with the years.
Change, when change comes, it should enlighten the eye change is sometimes painful and especially when without warning, leaving one wondering and questioning just why? regarding of the nature of a matter, in time change shall surely come most of the times there's a significant purpose in change, a long tough battle won.
Why change after so long we had thought we have been made for each other? yes, you can go to your new heart i will beat my old one the path you walk i pray will be strewn with roses the ones you sent at the first valentine you got me my heart i would have done anything for you for your happiness why change? if it is that is what you have chosen with full blessing i let you walk your path but remember my love still accompanies each of your steps my tears each of my fingers inspired by 'it will not change' it will not change now after so many years; life has not broken it with parting or tears; death will not alter it, it will live on in all my songs for you when i am gone. sarah teasdale.
The wind of change blows through our days sometimes can leave our minds with haze when thinks do not go as expected it is easy to feel quite dejected if we live with love inside and never faith we compromise we can bring our dreams to reality transform that haze into clarity wind of change can be uplifting promising and also gifting a chance for love and new beginnings when you believe you end up winning.
To everything there is a season, a time of gladness, grief and cheer, smiles of laughter, sadness of tears, for every sunset there's a sunrise, there is no rainbow without the rain, no summer time without the spring, golden days and frosty nights, icy winds thoughout the days, with winters newly fallen snows, whose years are like the seasons, let the future hold no doubt, there'll come a change of scene, with rain bound skies of hope and love, i have seen your different faces, life is like the changing seasons, upward always climb, as the seasons change as we.
It's creeping slowly into my blood this feeling of desolation and madness swirling inside my voids when i look at you confused as to why my mind is fantasizing why my body is materializing why my emotions are stabilizing. has this been here all along or just began? have i always longed for you or only now? did i wish for this forever or did it start today? was i supposed to take this forbidden step over you make that fateful choice into the unknown open myself to breaking completely again with you i have no ideas no where to run to no place to hide. so maybe i'll just lay my head on your shoulder or whisper that i'm looking at you in a light that only now appeared to my eyes and it's beautiful.
When i was younger i wanted to go out like morrison. life lived at break neck speed debauched high dead in paris at age 28. nowadays i just want to be tom waits sat on a porch with a glass of wine in my hand and my cat's asleep at my feet. it's funny, as each passing year drags you one step closer to death your priorities seem to change.
The autumn morn' awakes leaves vibrantly cloth himself taking chance upon winds searching for new breath in the journey unto the winds of chance each touch then flow apart then touch again yet in each touch something new something old something peculiar never the same each time the winds of chance blows a leaf from it's branch has a dance then takes it's prance life has a kiss.
Change can happen when you get the chance change can happen without a passing glance change can change everything in your path change is the resistance to the things in the past change is what people have to do to make theyre lives good.
1 i shall not wonder more, then, 2 but i shall know. 3 leaves change, and birds, flowers, 4 and after years are still the same. 5 the sea's breast heaves in sighs to the moon, 6 but they are moon and sea forever. 7 as in other times the trees stand tense and lonely, 8 and spread a hollow moan of other times. 9 you will be you yourself, 10 i'll find you more, not else, 11 for vintage of the woeful years. 12 the sea breathes, or broods, or loudens, 13 is bright or is mist and the end of the world; 14 and the sea is constant to change. 15 i shall not wonder more, then, 16 but i shall know.
You cannot change the past 'tis gone forever and worrying only turns your hair to gray and remember 'tis the future's all that matter for we cannot change what happened yesterday. don't harbour grudges for grudges only harm you for a grudge like a cancer only grow ill feeling on you can become a burden and you'll feel happier when you leave your grudges go. karma will take care of all wrongdoers and all of those who harm others in any way will one day for their mistakes feel regretful when to karma they will have a price to pay. you cannot change the past what's done is over before we walked we had to learn to crawl and from the book of life we're always learning and the future's all that matter after all. the past is gone and the past is past changing and let bygones be bygones so it has been said and put more of your thought energy into your future for your happier days for you might be ahead.
I wish it would change. the urge to cut my self. i wish it would change. this pain that is felt. i wish it would change. so i write it all down. i wish it would change. wearing my blank lifeless frown. i wish it would change. crying everyday. i wish it would change. not having any thing to say. i wish it would change. so i don't have to write poems. i wish it would change. and wish everbody knew them. i wish it would change. i'm just trying to fight it. i wish it would change. everyday trying to hide it. i wish it would change. my sorrow, my pain. i wish it would change. it's getting worst everday.
Thoughts broke down from my dreams demise as i shut my dreaming eyes stars flickered out my wish lost truth as i cried in a phone booth the string untied memories faded away i cried all night and i cried all day missing you and you haven't even left me missing who you used to be i'm missing you and i wish that you'd leave me, just wish that you'd leave me alone knowledge broke through hope lost touch i cried too much just thinking of you the pain came down my smile turned to frown and i wish i could walk away i just with that i could walk away missing you and you haven't even left me missing who you used to be i'm missing you and i wish that you'd leave me, just wish that you'd leave me alone.
Oh, how i love it when i have a change of address and i have to tell everybody that i have just moved and you have to leave the friends that you have but, you do find new ones at your new address.
Autumnal winds caress my face as summer's heated breeze expires. the years have quickened in their pace, foregoing my misplaced desires. as winter lurks not far ahead my memory drifts to warmer days, where on a greener grass i tread absorbing love's adoring rays. beneath the august moon we'd dance, embracing 'til the blaze of dawn, but violent gusts would steal my chance and whisk away the dreams i'd drawn. through fallen leaves of yesteryears i sift for blades of thriving hope, to help me cool these caustic tears and find the strength and will to cope. for in the autumn of my life is when i'll gain a peace within, discarding weights of pain and strife and letting reigns of joy begin. then when the days of fall conclude and winter takes its turn on stage, i know my soul will be renewed as life records my final page.
Change shall accustom me in after years to kingdom's builded on life's overthrow; onward with other poets i shall go, unpraised of thee. though praised of all my peers, until the vine that thou hast quckened, bears its fruit in others' hands; until i grow so different from myself i shall not know this poor young desperate heart, nor these wild tears. but though i change, thou shalt not change with me, thy shrine shall stand unaltered and unmoved, and if we meet again i shall but see the features of a stranger, thou wilt be wholly what once thou wert to me, beloved and not what time and men have made of thee.
I walk in clothes you don't like, i hangout with friends you don't like, why can't you just excpet the way i am, i can't not change, its who i am, this is who i am, the person i am growing up to be, don't you understand, i am who i want to be, can't you just let it go, because this is who i am, you can't change a thing. you let her walk in skimpy clothes, when all i want to wear is black, she goes and dates older men, when i only date guys my age and you still won't let it go. you don't have to worry, don't you want me to be happy? if you do then let it be. this is who i am, the person i am growing up to be, don't you understand, i am who i want to be, can't you just let it go, because this is who i am, you can't change a thing.
Open your life and accept change; its like a flower in midst fo a mountain range. blooming and shining unconditionally; spreading its fragrance and hue in the valley. changes teach us that there is more to life, it shows us our goals and the way to strive. its like a dropp of golden sun in the darkness illuminating the thoughts and directing it to harness. accelarating and enlightening as it comes; failures and sucess all it sums. providing an intermediary betwixt past disappointments and future aspirations; welcoming change is the only way to reach the life's destination. life and its ways are truly very strange; the key is to accept what you cannot change.
You have changed and it's not for the better all of the sudden your different and it's no good. what's with you lately i know you want to fit in or impress a girl but please dont change. not for her. standing from the outside i can see it. you're different, not the same, i'm not too sure about this new person please change back.
Keep your change for a rainy day because when it is raining outside you won't like to walk outside because you will get wet if you walk ouside and if you have some money in your pocket you will be able to ride on the bus without geting wet.
I dreamed i grew a money tree outside in my yard. my job was to care for it and i worked very hard. i saw that it was watered. it grew so straight and tall and when the money ripened i picked it in the fall. the flowers were green dollar bills, the seeds inside were coins, and others grew and glittered where all the branches joined. on windy days i stood below and held a great big bucket. other days i climbed right up to find one ripe and pluck it. people say that money doesn't really grow on trees. i know. i only wish it did just like in my dreams.
Children love, they laugh, they care. children, bless them, they know how to share. children try hard to be what you want, sometimes they can't and they start to cry, that's when a hug or a kiss is the tool, no not a spanking that's not the rule. children do good and children do bad, children are happy and children are sad. children must walk before they can run, all of us wake to the bright morning sun. so cherish the children these treasures from god, for without them the earth would be nothing but water and sod.
I know sometimes that clouds bring rain, in wintertime it's snow, and spring is good because it makes the pretty flowers grow. i know that god is everywhere and angels all have wings, that dogs can't talk and bunnies hop i know so many things. but why do daddies go away? it makes kids and mommies sad. are there windows up in heaven? did i do something bad? my mommy said it's not like that. that children all are good. sometimes daddies just can't stay even though we wish they could. she said daddy loves me most of all, not to think he doesn't care . and he sees me from the windows. god just needs him more up there.
There's an angel in my pocket who is watching over me, just a little voice down deep inside that i can hear, not see. i wish that i could let her out so that everyone could see 'cause we have the greatest secrets, many things she shares with me. she whispers little things to do to make my parents glad and tells me when there's something that i want to do that's bad. oh i wish that i could see her not just hear her talk to me. it's just a little voice down deep inside that i can hear, not see.
I like words like 'yes' and 'no' they mean just what they say. they either mean you can or can't do what you want today. other words like 'maybe' or even like 'we'll see' make me feel like crying 'cause that isn't answering me. 'someday' isn't too bad 'cause it still means we will. but 'later' is even better 'cause it's waiting just until.
All things within this fading world hath end, adversity doth still our joys attend; no ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet, but with death's parting blow are sure to meet. the sentence past is most irrevocable, a common thing, yet oh, inevitable. how soon, my dear, death may my steps attend, how soon't may be thy lot to lose thy friend, we both are ignorant, yet love bids me these farewell lines to recommend to thee, that when the knot's untied that made us one, i may seem thine, who in effect am none. and if i see not half my days that's due, what nature would, god grant to yours and you; the many faults that well you know i have let be interred in my oblivious grave; if any worth or virtue were in me, let that live freshly in thy memory and when thou feel'st no grief, as i no harmes, yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms, and when thy loss shall be repaid with gains look to my little babes, my dear remains. and if thou love thyself, or loved'st me, these o protect from stepdame's injury. and if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse, with some sad sighs honor my absent hearse; and kiss this paper for thy dear love's sake, who with salt tears this last farewell did take.
Snow was flaking all around then gently piling on the ground. just tiny puffs when floating free, but stuck together, i could see it's like one voice that singing for us or a lot, like in a chorus. i rolled some up and stacked it high to make a happy snowman guy. i'm glad it's that way just with snow and that's not how we children grow, 'cause on a warm and sunny day, my snowman slowly melts away. as he melts, he gets so thin. i wish, like me, that he had skin.
Our fathers wrung their bread from stocks and stones and fenced their gardens with the redmen's bones; embarking from the nether land of holland, pilgrims unhouseled by geneva's night, they planted here the serpent's seeds of light; and here the pivoting searchlights probe to shock the riotous glass houses built on rock, and candles gutter by an empty altar, and light is where the landless blood of cain is burning, burning the unburied grain.
The day the circus came to town, my favorite was the circus clown with his great big shoes and funny clothes, a painted face, and a big red nose. a giant smile was painted there, with children laughing, everywhere. i wondered as i looked at him, was he frowning 'neath his painted grin? now when i am feeling down, i think about that circus clown with his great big shoes and funny clothes, a painted face, and big red nose. i put a smile on, anyway and soon, my frown just fades away like the day the circus came to town and i learned it watching the circus clown.
I don't have a little brother. i don't have a sister, too. it's just me and mom and daddy but there's lots of things to do. sometimes we go on picnics and play ball until it's dark. sometimes we play on slides and swings when we go to the park. we can go and see a movie, other days go to the beach where i can get sand dollars and daddy helps when i can't reach. i wish i had a brother. i'd like a sister, too, but it's me and mom and daddy and there's lots of things to do.
My brother's in a wheelchair and he can't jump or run but i can throw a ball to him to catch and we have fun. he can't do a lot of things that other kids can do. he needs help getting dressed and he can't tie his shoes. mommy told me it's called 'special' when a child is born that way. i said i could have told her that. my brother's special every day.
Today i found some scissors by my mommy's sewing chair. i learned scissors can cut paper and scissors can cut hair. i learned scissors can cut many things, lots of things you shouldn't oughta. but the best thing that i learned today is scissors can't cut water.
Give love to the children children need love everyday give love to the children guide them on their way love's like a burning flame consumes all that stands in the way love is the only power on earth to take all the hatred away give love to the children set the children free to make their own decisions then they will clearly see love is the sun the moon and the stars love is a golden ring love is the one thing the whole world desires be it beggar or king give love to the children youth has not long to stay love is a long term investment the best you will find any day love like the rising sun takes all the darkness away our children will tell their children and their childrens children will say give love to the children they are our crock of gold and if perchance they ever stray they will come back to the fold give love to the children the children of today give love to the children and love will come to stay.
So, this is christmas morning. everyone is here. i don't really understand it cause it isn't very clear, but mom and dad are happy, there's pretty ribbons everywhere, lots of things that they call presents and even paper i can tear. they keep showing me this new stuff, balls and books and even soxes. they don't seem to know how fun it is just playing with these boxes.
There's a lighthouse on an island built on boulders in the sea. a home to no one anymore, and it's beautiful to me. the waves come crashing, sending spray. their salty drops rain down blessing me and other people and the buildings in the town. the lighthouse wakes at evening time and its beacon comes around protecting all the ships out there so they don't run aground. i sit and send my wishes way up high on seagull wings and then pretend that they'll come true on notes the lighthouse sings. that lighthouse must be magic. i hear it call to me from its bed of boulders on an island in the sea.
On the unbreathing sides of hills they play, a specklike girl and boy, alone, but near a specklike house. the sun's suspended eye blinks casually, and then they wade gigantic waves of light and shade. a dancing yellow spot, a pup, attends them. clouds are piling up; a storm piles up behind the house. the children play at digging holes. the ground is hard; they try to use one of their father's tools, a mattock with a broken haft the two of them can scarcely lift. it drops and clangs. their laughter spreads effulgence in the thunderheads, weak flashes of inquiry direct as is the puppy's bark. but to their little, soluble, unwarrantable ark, apparently the rain's reply consists of echolalia, and mother's voice, ugly as sin, keeps calling to them to come in. children, the threshold of the storm has slid beneath your muddy shoes; wet and beguiled, you stand among the mansions you may choose out of a bigger house than yours, whose lawfulness endures. it's soggy documents retain your rights in rooms of falling rain.
Listen to the music of love, that seeps in from everywhere. the rhythm of two hearts, beating as one. the murmurs of passion, that consumes us all, from time to time. listen to the music of love, as it fills the air everywhere.
When there is a song about love then the music does become a soul of my heart when i hug the melody of music then i feel the spirit of words, traveling with me when the voice of music passes in the air then my ears are listening to its harmony when i close my eyes and feel the rhythm of its music then i dream an angel of its music goes around me melody is my love and the eternal music is my life the music has its own story that plays with amazing emotions and i can hear its beautiful song with touching rhythms let it be symphony, classic, jazz or hard rock but everyone loves music which has only one language in this universe that has known as sound of music. anyone who has no interest themselves in music is nothing but dead bodies on the ground. because music is my eternal life.
Music is a door, an escape to a different world. a world you make and controll in your mind. music is a hero, one to cheer your spirits when you are down. music is an enemy, sometimes the lyrics bring you down. music is your personality, expressed through song. the music player, is you, the one holding it all together. music is an awakening to the real world. its lyrics are real and true. music is a best friend, one to give advice when you need it. music is what you think of it. its starts off empty and colorless, and escalates to something more, your own world.
Wait mister. which way is home? they turned the light out and the dark is moving in the corner. there are no sign posts in this room, four ladies, over eighty, in diapers every one of them. la la la, oh music swims back to me and i can feel the tune they played the night they left me in this private institution on a hill. imagine it. a radio playing and everyone here was crazy. i liked it and danced in a circle. music pours over the sense and in a funny way music sees more than i. i mean it remembers better; remembers the first night here. it was the strangled cold of november; even the stars were strapped in the sky and that moon too bright forking through the bars to stick me with a singing in the head. i have forgotten all the rest. they lock me in this chair at eight a.m. and there are no signs to tell the way, just the radio beating to itself and the song that remembers more than i. oh, la la la, this music swims back to me. the night i came i danced a circle and was not afraid. mister?.
Play life's music sweetly, play life's music low as demons once awaken come, in fast and low play life's music gently, let sleeping dragons lie play life's music slowly, be gentle on yourself life's music can be restful, life's music can be nice listen with an open heart and let sleeping monsters lie.
Begin to charm, and as thou strok'st mine ears with thine enchantment, melt me into tears. then let thy active hand scud o'er thy lyre, and make my spirits frantic with the fire; that done, sink down into a silvery strain, and make me smooth as balm and oil again.
I hear the music of the heavenly angels coming softly through the blue sky from above blending with the music from on the mountain tops bringing to all earth's people messages of love. the song birds are singing to the angels' music telling us to hear the words of truth very clear, "all of earth's people are more alike than different and to help each other will leave no room for fear". come listen to the music of quiet gentle breezes and music from wild flowers growing on the hill whispering softly to awaken our spirits saying, "only listen and let your hearts be still, so to hear the music from the living waters that can bring abundance wherever there is need, can heal all broken hearts burdened with sorrow, and can free the people caught by their fears and greed". listen to music from the world's throbbing heartbeat commanding its people to live in true harmony by hearing the voices of heavenly angels singing love, joy, and peace can be our destiny. listen to the music in kind smiling faces and the music of a child laughing gleefully both creating music with notes of "just caring". won't you please come listen to this music with me?.
Music, when soft voices die, vibrates in the memory; odours, when sweet violets sicken, live within the sense they quicken. rose leaves, when the rose is dead, are heaped for the beloved's bed; and so thy thoughts, when thou art gone, love itself shall slumber on.
My heart starts to beat like drum my mind sings music of love and words overflows from my lips music flows in my viens and it reaches every part of me love spreads and heart rejoices it heals my body and my mind upbeat music reaches my brain it lift up my mood boost my body and nature hums along with me it's the time to tap my toes dance in rhythm with my love.
I hear the music the music is playing the music is soft the music is now fading the music is gone which means so is my life no music means no life the music is gone come back to me music the music is begining i have a life the music is pretty the music is wonderful oh no the music is fading again i love the music the music is gone good bye music.
Do you hear it its the pounding of your heart the thump of your foot hitting the pavement its the rythym its the song in your head that tune your whistling the jingle on the tv its the music its the rap kicking with the subs the rock that show you how to stick it to the man the blues with that soul its the music what is it its the music the heartbeat of the world the rythym that brings us together the only universally understood language its the happiness the sorrow, the guidance, the inspiration its the music it lives in us all its the music the power the life.
Queen of every moving measure, sweetest source of purest pleasure, music; why thy powers employ only for the sons of joy? only for the smiling guests at natal or at nuptial feasts? rather thy lenient numbers pour on those whom secret griefs devour; bid be still the throbbing hearts of those, whom death, or absence parts, and, with some softly whisper'd air, smooth the brow of dumb despair.
Music isn't just music, it's a way of life. music is more than life. it's a work of art. music is like a cumulous cloud on a stormy day. it brings joy to the people who love it. music is like a catelpillar hatching out of its chrysalis its spreds its wings at a slow part dramactic part then takes flight in the entergetic parts. music is more than life. it's an inspiration.
You sing i will be the mountain and hold your voice deep inside you feel i will be the earth and keep your vibrations in my core you cry i will be the ocean keeping your sacred drops alive you chant i will be the holy hymn, we shall soar you fly i will be the sky, always holding you high you dance i will be the music that you wore.
Take me by the hand; it's so easy for you, angel, for you are the road even while being immobile. you see, i'm scared no one here will look for me again; i couldn't make use of whatever was given, so they abandoned me. at first the solitude charmed me like a prelude, but so much music wounded me. translated by a. poulin.
Where thoughts are about fear where stress becomes routine the anger, lust, revenge and vices tries to conquer human heart complains and asks stop stop and make things easy it depends upon my health the human heart, its performance you makes it dangerous to sustain you makes it feel disturbed when you opt for foolish struggles the heart says you are in danger hear, the wonderful organ highly sensitive to emotions keep the emotions less stressful where your speed must control otherwise heart will call it to stop the journey itself.
Can we deselect stupidity? coral blanches in the warming seas, the arctic cap recedes, and indifference breeds an expanding waist of greed. this is no greek tragedy. this is not great sophocles, not oedipus destroying mother earth. that was accidental. this far worse as the white faced clown is chosen from the chorus, merely an apprentice, plucked for the task, by the call of avarice.
Beating throbs of desire stirring inside aching to hold and caress to plant new seeds of life thoughts rushing in at the sight of you deepening as we embrace oh the hunger starving through lent as we abstained craving your body close to melt together as one unions of fiery explosions hot steamy breath intermingling mouths attached together seamlessly hands wandering exploring without direction every valley every crevice no taboos tingling sweating skin wanting everything needing only you tracing along your every curve lips lightly kissing nibbling for effect squirming this body beneath erotically moving in time rhythmically the urgency of animal lust boiling higher magma of bodies mixed peaking to exhaustion breathing deeply, holding one another slowly descending passions frenzied path resting interlocked warm bodies touching, sweat mingling to sleep.
The sea knows how to dream and dream it will still dream about a jellyfish a flesh of a jelly fish, and it will sleep and think about this dream of more flesh and sting and fling its salt like the tentacles of the jellyfish to the fish and the sea urchins and starfish begin their journey to the shores where desire stops but does not end i am the sea and i dream about her tentacles her flesh and the pain in my skin the needles of the urchin and the hardness of the starfish and the shore where i lay to desires that do not end to loves lost to wishes that it may regain again sea dreams sea pains sea urchins the boat on fire and the captain drowning.
I wish we understand the voices of the birds as they give their views on the dazzling look of the earth from the sky maybe we know how privileged we are to have dominion over it. if only we understand the roars of the lions as they praise the splendid look of the forest we will stop cuting and plant more trees. if only we could listen to our hearts as it praise the seductive, moves of the of the fishes we will show our waters more respect..
One can build a molecule as such to match the structure just as much as if equaled element compose within its varied electron rows thus the simplified combined to have the same effect on mind as the elemental tract to which the mind must counteract.
When sounds the trumpet at the judgment day, and when forever all things earthly die, we must a full and true account supply of ev'ry useless word we dropp'd in play. but what effect will all the words convey wherein with eager zeal and lovingly, that i might win thy favour, labour'd i, if on thine ear alone they die away? therefore, sweet love, thy conscience bear in mind, remember well how long thou hast delay'd, so that the world such sufferings may not know. if i must reckon, and excuses find for all things useless i to thee have said, to a full year the judgment day will grow.
I'll smash your back i'll weaken your bones i'll bury your lovers to rot in the earth i'll take your sons where they cannot be reached i'll make your daughter rip her knickers down i'll leave you alone to collect memories then i'll take them too and i'll be what's left.
Got colds today warning my body the i have less immunity, i will take rest and drink plenty of fluids there is a rush for being again healthy lots of work to do lots of deadlines to meet for the meantime i need sleep but this i cannot miss another poem for me and for you.
When i am an old woman i shall wear purple with a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me. and i shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves and satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter. i shall sit down on the pavement when i'm tired and gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells and run my stick along the public railings and make up for the sobriety of my youth. i shall go out in my slippers in the rain and pick flowers in other people's gardens and learn to spit. you can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat and eat three pounds of sausages at a go or only bread and pickle for a week and hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes. but now we must have clothes that keep us dry and pay our rent and not swear in the street and set a good example for the children. we must have friends to dinner and read the papers. but maybe i ought to practice a little now? so people who know me are not too shocked and surprised when suddenly i am old, and start to wear purple.
Behind the trees the red road leading to the end of summer we wandered by the rhododendron its purple flowers attracting your attention i watched you swat a fly something i thought you would never do and now you turn again in this perfect afternoon your swivelled head wanting me dead for no reason.
Does anyone ever wonder why the clocks tend to wander and with the passing of time days even fade to the sublime is military synchronization for wake? i often thought, it be better for naught if never the french we spake an english body, while complex and shoddy reduces the mg, ug, mcg, keyboard mistake.
Do not think me gentle because i speak in praise of gentleness, or elegant because i honor the grace that keeps this world. i am a man crude as any, gross of speech, intolerant, stubborn, angry, full of fits and furies. that i may have spoken well at times, is not natural. a wonder is what it is.
My rainbow has changed for it has faded for now it just many shades of grey some darker some lighter so worse that others for i shut down my emotions yesterday so that those who hurt be would not see me cry but now i can not seem to turn them on again it is as if my emotions are lost all expect for pain the pain never went away that i can hide bury within but where have all the colors gone will it ever return so will i stay in a state of gray for it is no longer a rainbow but a grey scale.
Through rainbow tears i see love's true colors shining bright amongst them above all others. red, green, yellow, violet and blue. all these beautiful colors i now see in you. love is my pot of gold, forever within my grasp all i need are open eyes and a map to complete this task. and the storm will come of this we know and darkness soon calls the show around me a rainbow of tears have spent. my pot of gold to you have went. and miracle is the day i found my rainbow tears scattered upon the ground my heart forever now is glad leaving room for light to replace the sad. and to the dearest most sacred spot my rainbow tears your hand has caught. in this bond we shall forever rest. two souls combined for the rainbow test. copyright 2006 a.j. mckinley.

Leaving rainbows in my sleep only vision softly creeps venus slain to rise again to share the light and quell the pain stardust shimmers like the past prisms shattered or everlast evasive whispers in my heart carves the image my soul imparts voices chime in dreams of glass the future in the hour cast immortal as time's frailty unending with mortality and in the dust the diamond makes within my heart reverie wakes alone you haunt, your essence chase with the sun the moon is chaste in the mind illusions dwell only the heart will clearly tell better my love to you before glows the morrow even more.
There's a fabulous story full of splendor and glory, that arabian legends transcends; of the wealth without measure, the coffers of treasure, at the place where the rainbow ends. oh, many have sought it, and all would have bought it, with the blood we so recklessly spend; but none has uncovered, the gold, nor discovered the spot at the rainbow's end. they have sought it in battle, and e'en where the rattle of dice with man's blasphemy blends; but howe'er persuasive, it still proves evasive, this place where the rainbow ends. i own for my pleasure, i yearn not for treasure, though gold has a power it lends; and i have a notion, to find without motion, the place where the rainbow ends. the pot may hold pottage, the place be a cottage, that a humble contentment defends, only joy fills its coffer, but spite of the scoffer, there's the place where the rainbow ends. where care shall be quiet, and love shall run riot, and i shall find wealth in my friends; then truce to the story, of riches and glory; there's the place where the rainbow ends.
Breath when sheathed by the web of ebbs i still remember the rainbow by the blue moon your ripples when slither by the resonance when you flossed into the moon by the rainbow when blurs blood when turns to tears by the fire yet the thunder crakes the earth elsewhere love when falling ruefully across the dew red of the blood yet whirls fast in the heart white when blemishes my god innate images delve deep into your dreams as blotted when i embrace blue when unabashed death when conquered by the dream as you slowly melted to mingle into the waves i keep on benign look to the mist when reflexed yet i am never alone even if lie lonely by your reminiscence from the truth as day when dies bereft of sun by the shadow night when cries out for the moon when alone yet deep dark night turns to the light the scar unflappable when sparks in me the outcry besotted may diffuse my quest the mute flow of the silence touches you nearer as you steeped in blue by the eyes in the evening still your song in allegiance promises me of my love. as the speckles of your whisper touche me ever and your sparkled eyes rebound within eternal.
If i could place a song in every rainbow so it could strum its tune in colored melody. after all the storm clouds rolled away in your life it would play softly its tune for you from me. songs of joy and hope and of laughter in bright colors, they'd take away all your worries and despair. accompanied by a thousand angels, singing in the sky they would be singing just for you too know that god and i are there. i am placing some words of love down on this paper so that you know that i will always care. that if your feelings are not where you would have them be today there is more than one person, in your life that cares. you are grown and so far away i can not hold you to kiss and wipe away each tear, like when you were very small. but when you look up at god's given colored rainbows you'll remember colored melodies of my love, are playing in them all.
Lovers who want to make successful lives always compromise i have since years gone by always said yes never no who am i to stop the freedom of the one i love even animals are blessed so love each other when you flow and let go when charms don't glow and both know very beautifully conveyed love all day and night him you may till life's last days letwater flow in the rivers of where live you may and entwined for life do stay god bless such lovers like you always.
Clear glass like water in it the swimming fish like the ideas. sometimes, it shows its beauty and sometimes, its thorns. sometimes, it goes into the abyss and sometimes, it remains afloat. no wonder, no one can predict where this fish will go..?.
Quickly anticipating melodies and their liveliness as they grab and take me with them into realms of a musical reality. watching rivers flow past, mind swimming against the tide, as it touches upon the harmony of life and it's future. always watching, nothing interfering and all of nature, human and otherwise, finds it's way in exacting measures of musical interludes.
Swimming in the crystal water is a thing of joy, there's the play of light the tricks of the sun's ray like your love. i love it but feel afraid as it may not help me float any time to get me drowned. but, i can't leave this addiction and can't stick to it. perhaps, i'll stay at the same state unless i leave this habit.
The salmon are swimming upriver in the cold gray damp of the dawn to the gravel beds of the rapids to dig out their spawning beds to spawn november is their breeding season in the cold and wet northern fall when yesterday's flood is subsiding they are answering to nature's call. the salmon are swimming upriver by nature they are duty bound they jump waterfalls on their journey to get to their high breeding ground their urge for to breed is upon them their numbers they must multiply to insure the survival of their species their natural urges they cannot deny. the salmon are swimming against the current a hundred kilometres or more to the high gravel beds of the river that journey to the atlantic shore they risk the gaff and spear of the poacher so that their species will survive and the main reason for their survival is their natural sexual drive. the salmon upriver are swimming with the chill of late fall in the air through old fields and along by hedgerows by cold winds of their foliage stripped bare they swim on against the strong currents without even one thought of fear of the fate that might even await them death by the poacher's gaff or spear.

Tracks across the heavens, disappearing into clouds, no vehicles driving upon them, only pictures in my mind. wanting to be up there, hanging from strings which are embedded here and there within the sky. having to be content with sitting here on the ground, still wishing to be above, playing in blue heavens and swimming with the clouds.
Watching children learn how to swim, my granddaughter having done quite well through the years, on the top of her level each time. splashing, smiles, scared faces when some go off the diving board for the first time ever, afterwards all of them laughing and wanting to do it again.
I saw myself a lake of stars as i walked past the lake last night they reminded me of a thousand burning cigars as they seemed near, and were so very bright, i watched them as they shone and glimmered then out of curiosity i tossed a stone into the lake and then the stars they all shook and shimmered as then to the shore came their quake, stars of thousands i could easily see and they all were inside this small lake they brought me joy and also glee that one moment in time i will never forsake, just think that all the stars that were in the sky were now in this one small body of water and the moon as well, she was nearby as the mother is always close to her daughter, so into the lake i went in for a swim i then swam with the moon and all the stars i did it without thinking as it was just a whim and while in the lake, i swam towards mars. randy l. mcclave.

She tried to warn me right from the start, she said she had a friend that had stolen her heart, even though i was warned from the very beginning i liked her so much i kept right on swimming, i know winning her over would be tough to do so, when she gave me an opening i slipped right through, now that i'm in the water seemed to have gotten deeper, i'm not so sure that she's a real keeper, i think she swims along plays her part, but she can't 'feel' because she doesn't have a heart, i've even thought about backing off so, maybe she could find the soulmate she'd lost, but i also know that she really needs me and swimming away from her isn't quite so easy, but so often i ask myself what role do i play am i just another 'fish' or am i standing in the way, i hate being confused from one day to the next, feels like i'm tangled up in a fisherman's net, a part of me would like to leave and get out of the dark but there's the other side thats madly in love with the shark.

I went with them to the fishing hole, way back yonder in the back of the woods, . two girl's without boyfriend's, they'd never even kissed. look at the lips of her mom, leaving with them, i asked her, with lips like those, i wanna know where your taking me fishing. he grinned and then said, let's go fishing. each time it rains, it washes both holes out and sometimes the fish are easier to see and catch.

Butterflies, complete panic, a thrill of excitement. watching the water, pure and clear, a feeling of wanting, drilling through my mind. the race is called, my first event, i feel a shudder run up my spine. standing in a line with my competitors, my new enemies. i observe them, watch as they prepare themselves. standing on the blocks, the eerie silence of the start. i single beep and i'm flying, straight though the air, and then splash, i'm in the water. the smooth cool water is calming, but now is not the time to be clam. the chlorine sings my skin. i break the surface, hear my friends cheering. i put my head down and stroke, only four more laps. the sound of water drills in my brain, i turn my head to breathe, and see my competitor. i gain speed slightly, adding to the tension. i reach the wall and do my fastest turn, i will not let her overtake me. when i breathe i look up to see my team, to see them screaming and cheering. their support makes me put in a little more effort. then it starts, that nagging in my lungs, my legs start tiering. i push harder, striving for the finish, sensing the fear of the girl in the lane next to me, i gain speed. i relish the competition. ten meters, only 10 more, i start thinking of the finish. it only makes me want it more. i slide into the wall and finish, i watch as the timekeepers discuss my time. as they tell me my time i feel a rush of pride, a personal best. i close my eyes and listen for the results. they call them, from 3rd place to first, second. a rush of excitement and regret fills my body. but who beat me? i look around, spotting out the winner.
she looks so happy, in my mind i think she won't be as glad next time. i slip out of the pool in one smooth movement, walk back to my team with pride. receive the sarcastic comments from my friends, and the constructive critocism my coach. the as the adrenalin of the race dies down, i hear my name being called for another race.

There have been so many like u.s. trying to get into your dream's. though unlike u.s. those extraterrestrial races still alive have evolved and managed to survive. crossing infinite bridge's, bridge's built by those other's, benevolent bridge's they built and then left. i have long since theorized due to humanities self destructive way's. drone's are by them all they will risk. america has shone an affinity towards making weapon's that can kill the whole world. having conquered disease and illiminated old age they can sit back and watch u.s. on t.v. common since would dictate if we can't learn from them then there are only so many mistakes we have left. while having more money you can't spend isn't one of them. unadvised children and million's of abused adult's will never endear them to u.s. and i don't want to be exterminated by them because of your selfishness and greed. either we can evolve out into the stream the stream where it's green the dream we can choose, it is real.

A walk in nature never boring in nature great beauty to see the wild birds are chirping and singing on fence wire and bush and on tree away from the street and the traffic from human made pollution and noise above the gray scrub by the river the skylark he sings as he flies. the poets have been inspired by nature and of her great beauty they sing the swallows return to their homeplace when they sense the coming of spring and the artists they paint nature's beauty the woodlands in their autumn brown and one can see the beauty of nature even in the park of your town. my stay on this planet a brief stay but mother nature will live on and the birds will be heard in the woodlands when i am forgotten and gone our lives they are not that important for our lives they are numbered in hours but mother nature is forever and she outlives her beautiful flowers. a walk in nature never boring though she hides her secrets from me her birds always chirping and singing on hedge and on bush and on tree my stay on this planet a brief stay our average span ten years with three score but mother nature is not for the reaper and she will live forever more.
The bird born in an aviary and raised in captivity can never live in nature's world amongst the wild and free even the birds of it's own species will peck it till it die so never allow your feathered pet the freedom of the sky. i am naive of the laws of mother nature and naive of nature's way and for interfering with nature there is some price to pay the bird born in captivity in a cage must remain why even it's own kind in the wilds would kill it is beyond me to explain humans try to manipulate nature and nature's creatures control but mother nature far greater than human kind her's is an eternal soul for we are like nature's seasons we come to life and go yet of our earth mother who feeds us so little we seem to know. the bird born in captivity in a cage condemned to stay for if released the other birds will kill it since this is nature's way and mother nature herself as old as father time she claims the young and she claims the old and those still in their prime.
Nature, that washed her hands in milk, and had forgot to dry them, instead of earth took snow and silk, at love's request to try them, if she a mistress could compose to please love's fancy out of those. her eyes he would should be of light, a violet breath, and lips of jelly; her hair not black, nor overbright, and of the softest down her belly; as for her inside he'd have it only of wantonness and wit. at love's entreaty such a one nature made, but with her beauty she hath framed a heart of stone; so as love, by ill destiny, must die for her whom nature gave him because her darling would not save him. but time, which nature doth despise and rudely gives her love the lie, makes hope a fool, and sorrow wise, his hands do neither wash nor dry; but being made of steel and rust, turns snow and silk and milk to dust. the light, the belly, lips, and breath, he dims, discolors, and destroys; with those he feeds but fills not death, which sometimes were the food of joys. yea, time doth dull each lively wit, and dries all wantonness with it. oh, cruel time, which takes in trust our youth, or joys, and all we have, and pays us but with age and dust; who in the dark and silent grave when we have wandered all our ways shuts up the story of our days.
Have you ever seen the offspring of a cross between a sheep and goat of the parents in the young one you can see a bit of both with the physical appearance of a goat and sheep strange as that may appear born of an act of nature and in nature of stranger things one does hear. and anything in nature is never a strange thing a cross between a starling and a myna has a pleasant song to sing but when humans tamper with nature 'tis there the wrong comes in though some with their degrees on natural science respect for their work do win. on what happens within nature humans should not have a say and leave nature to nature she does things her own way some results of nature may seem quite strange to see but what happens within nature happens naturally. humans do not tamper with nature leave nature to her own device every time we tamper with her for to pay there is some price the mad cow disease is one example when meat and bone to cows was fed just one of the many bad results of humans tampering with nature one might say enough said.
The trees were angels this morning, seeming to bend their variegated boughs to bestow benediction upon my weary brow as i walked out my front door, and driving along the hilly, back road i wanted to stop and merge forever into the misty autumn landscape, for that peace is all i could ever hope to become.
It'll be you and me up in the tree and the forest will give us the answers it'll be you and i up in the sky we'll be so high its a combination for disaster i'll be yours and you'll be mine its a law i cannot define but the fire will keep us burning for eachother it'll be us against them the current churnning again as the waves bind us together.
The bubbling brook doth leap when i come by, because my feet find measure with its call; the birds know when the friend they love is nigh, for i am known to them, both great and small. the flower that on the lonely hillside grows expects me there when spring its bloom has given; and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows, and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven; for he who with his maker walks aright, shall be their lord as adam was before; his ear shall catch each sound with new delight, each object wear the dress that then it wore; and he, as when erect in soul he stood, hear from his father's lips that all is good.
Theres a poem in every flower, a sonnet in every tree, a tale in every lifetime its just for you to see. theres a lyric in every brook as it rushes over rocks, theres an ode in every nuance, as loves wonder unlocks, theres rhythm in every sound, every beating of a heart, theres poetry in every union and every couple who are apart and just as there is wonder in every new life created there is sadness and regret, for the unsaid and unfeted just listen for the music that your ears cannot hear, just strain yourself for the melody thats so far and yet so near the wonder of the creator, the magic of the divine is there to feel, for all of us, to soon be yours and mine.
Nature is beautiful nature is enticing nature is fun and exciting we can only love it's wonderful diversity stunning imagery and panoramic scenery nature is god's gift which we must cherish and protect but in the name of development we demolish and destroy it nature is tolerant upto a point beyond which nature retaliates with floods, hurricanes and tsunamis if we can't live in harmony with nature we will perish for sure.
When the morning sun rises in the sky when the new day is born as beautiful when the dew drops rolls down the leaves when the garden of flowers hugs the nature and shower its fragrance and makes nature proud when the trees leaves oxygen for mankind starts dancing to the tune of wind when the birds sits on top of the trees and singing to the nature's choir with happiness when the fauna in the jungle sets free to live proudly when the stream water gurgles from the mountain and when wet earth makes barren land fertile when the farmers glorify the nature with happiness and start to cultivate food for the nations when the sun sets behind the green mountains and the moon start to light the nation when the nature forgets its vastness then the god show his creation on his earth.
I feel that i have heard enough of talk of world strife and what i need is joy and love and peace back in my life and i must refrain from listening to the radio news and watching t.v. for rumours of revenge and war is worrying to me. my god is of the female kind and she is dressed in green and she is very beautiful the finest i have seen and in these times of tension where the seed of hatred grow i turn to mother nature the only god i know. in the scrub patch across the way in the cool evening breeze the honeyeaters and wattlebirds on the banksia trees are chirping and singing and at this time of year the voices of the male birds all day long you hear. the children of mother nature my god's family in nature's wild garden living wild and free they live on the nectar of tree blossoms and flowers and their worries are little when compared to ours. on the news on the radio and the t.v. these rumours of war seem all too much for me so i turn to my god mother nature in moments like these and in her green garden i find peace and ease.

As a fond mother, when the day is o'er, leads by the hand her little child to bed, half willing, half reluctant to be led, and leave his broken playthings on the floor, still gazing at them through the open door, nor wholly reassured and comforted by promises of others in their stead, which though more splendid, may not please him more; so nature deals with us, and takes away our playthings one by one, and by the hand leads us to rest so gently, that we go scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay, being too full of sleep to understand how far the unknown transcends the what we know.
Nature baby as free as a bird nature baby not speaking a word nature baby living day by day nature baby always floating away. feeling the soil around my feet the sun rays beating down with heat my being feeling like i'm not physically here and when i look around i'm so much more aware. the energy keeps coming my way as i buzz through life and play nature baby being free nature baby that is me that is what is meant to be. nature baby gave the garden lots of love and energy and now the gardens have surrounded me with beauty and the heavenly scents from each flower in bloom as we share the space within this big room. nature baby as free as a bird nature baby not speaking a word.
The sounds of nature tells us many things. the sounds of nature are our teachers. the sounds of nature are so soothing yet they can be terrifying. how can we say what nature is? what do we really know about nature? so many questions we have asked. so many have gone unanswered. so what does the sound of nature means? we shall never know.
I love time out with nature and i love peace and quiet to walk along the gravel path in the evening sunlight when the wild birds are singing and spring is in her prime and even memories of such inspire the soul to rhyme. i love time out with nature a brief release from care for nature she is generous her gifts with all she share we drink of her clear spring waters and we breathe in her life sustaining air and nature's splendid beauty is around us everywhere. i love time out with nature the only god i know her stream from the high country down to the river flow the skylark from the rank grass in the mood for song he fly one of nature's feathered minstrels he carols in the sky. in time out with mother nature from life's cares i find ease the sounds of the leaves rustling in the freshening evening breeze and we much like the seasons to life we come and go but nature lives forever the only god i know.
The wind is trying to tell me something just softly murmuring and whispering gently touching my skin and making me tingle breathe in the freshness and let it mingle take in the new earth after its been drenched of rain ease your minds out of the painful past and all the pain sing with the wind resurfacing the music that slowly died feel the vibrations of nature's love and not your hurt pride sway with the new crop out there in the fields and not the dagger of your anger that it wields the rose has wilted but a new bud has arisen release the past and let it out from your prison life is transient and you may not be able to capture love but beauty is constant and it will always keep you above.
Full of rebellion, i would die, or fight, or travel, or deny that thou has aught to do with me. o tame my heart; it is thy highest art to captivate strong holds to thee. if thou shalt let this venom lurk, and in suggestions fume and work, my soul will turn to bubbles straight, and thence by kind vanish into a wind, making thy workmanship deceit. o smooth my rugged heart, and there engrave thy rev'rend law and fear; or make a new one, since the old is sapless grown, and a much fitter stone to hide my dust, than thee to hold.
Nature the gentlest mother is, impatient of no child, the feeblest of the waywardest. her admonition mild in forest and the hill by traveller be heard, restraining rampant squirrel or too impetuous bird. how fair her conversation a summer afternoon, her household her assembly; and when the sun go down, her voice among the aisles incite the timid prayer of the minutest cricket, the most unworthy flower. when all the children sleep, she turns as long away as will suffice tolight her lamps, then bending from the sky with infinite affection an infiniter care, her golden finger on her lip, wills silence everywhere.
I've found a friend in nature although nature could turn on me if i'm out and about in a storm and its lightning strikes me if a tidal wave sweeps me far out to sea or a poisonous snake takes a bite of me if a tornado twirls me high into the sky yes, the irony is that nature which i find so enchanting could one day cause my demise.
Your relationship with nature speaks volumes about you do you only see nature as a means to financial gain or are you one of those who love nature for her beauty and love her wildlife and her trees and her rivers, lakes and mountains and her fields and flowers and bees? your relationship with nature tells of the sort of person that you are do you see nature's protectors as those who have gone too far in their dispute with the developer in their fight for every tree if this be so you support the environmental vandals or so 'twould seem to me? your relationship with nature about you more can say than all of your friends and enemies can or so 'twould seem that way for your apathy to nature tells of your inner strife and your attitude to nature is your attitude to life. your relationship with nature says far more about you than anyone else of you can say as their words may not be true for if you love mother nature and with her live in harmony then you are working for the good of all of humanity.
The sounds of nature o, tis so sweet. who am i that would dare try to repeat the lovliness of a tweet. the flutter of its wings the tiny cute prints of a little birds feet. the sounds of nature o, how beautiful yet afar. are raindrops against the windshield of a still parked car. each little drip dropp runs caressing the mind so intensely seemingly just to play a part or perhaps for the fun of it. o, the sounds of nature sometimes deeply doth groan. when by an unwillingly nature one's heart decides to roam. how lovely is a weep who does understand the moan. when its all part of nature but who wants to be left alone.
Nature is what we dont see for instance the essence that pushes words out for this poem fated for posterity the birds that without fail chirp at first light, morn breeze the unseen clock working at the dot nature is what we dont see the nocturnal bloom, that folds itself in the day, throws its fragrance in the dead of night as lovers hide in each others' bossoms below the soft glare of the moon centimetre by centimetre it has inched forward to exhibit its full blown majestry to the world nature is what we dont see the shadow play master tilting the earth the petals for its bloom dance the successive cells here there guided towards optimal functions and that ogiasmic tremour that shuttles the world round and round nature is what you should not see the formulas, secrets kept behind everything that could get even einstein mad in unveiling, explaining them nature is what we all should not see nor equipped to see though it rambles through our every cell like the worst of storm.
Human nature, mother nature, enough of your torture. safely nature, easy nature, play your game, foolish nature, custom nature, i know your plan can you nature, would you nature, try to run away. stupid nature, poor nature. find my secret. miserable nature, faulty nature, get out of my way. it is in my nature, it is my nature, don't give me away.

Dark clouds had just burst into rain, i was alone, travelling in the train. it was just beginning to gain speed, i had with me sunday newspaper to read. the girl sitting opposite to me, started to complain, as her seat faced backward. i offered to exchange seats for her in return i had to accept her offer. of buying coffee for both of us, friendship with this girl began thus. i thought, she must be an american, from her accent, but she denied to be one. her father was scottish and mother hungarian but she considered herself as a proud canadian. we talked our way through the long journey on drinks, it was my turn to spend money.
Her hero's gone away, will he come back another day? she could not say. she let her soul mate run away, and something inside of her died. 'now i don't want to come out and play', the little girl cried. left all alone in such a big world, he is not there to protect her, no longer will he make her feel safe in his warm embrace. he used to love her but things have changed, the girl is alone. she let her soul mate escape, her insides hollow, the girl is left opaque.

Ah, she was music in herself, a symphony of joyousness. she sang, she sang from finger tips, from every tremble of her dress. i saw sweet haunting harmony, an ecstasy, an ecstasy, in that strange curling of her lips, that happy curling of her lips. and quivering with melody those eyes i saw, that tossing head. and so i saw what music was, tho' still accursed with ears of lead.
Girl, when i look at your eyes i see all of your genuine charms i want to give you my everything including the moon and the stars you're the one that i love you're always in my heart i think of you in every way whether you are near or far girl, you know how much i love you you are my everything anything in this world, i would do for you love and tenderness is what i'll always bring i could not love no one else that's how special you are to me they say that love is blind but now we're able to see nothing could ever come between us we have a special bond we can stand on our own two feet our love for each other will continue to live on.

In a world of barbies, implants and a size 26 waist heartache's no more prevalent than in her with a beautiful face. no more wanted for her looks than her heart her persona fades as soon as puberty starts. she screams celebrity in a small town manner in a world that passes judgement by how much you achieve she must use her 'talents' as the world perceives. as years go by her beauty's but a nuisance to the person inside made up of more substance. she screams celebrity in a small town manner there's no plastic surgery to alter your soul no place for outward beauty in the world of good will. to wed true love's but a leap of trust so she squanders her beauty as a matter of must. for small town love in true hollywood fashion.

My eyes first caught her across the street she looked like someone i'd fancy to meet she was wearing a long violet dress but i was rugged and my hair was a mess you were wondering who was this cat sitting on a rotten bench in a dirty cowboy hat on his guitar he was trying to play some john denver song you laughed because half of his chords were wrong she walked up and asked if i wanted a cuppa joe i boyishly smiled and said 'i reckon so' i strolled down the dirt road with this girl in a pretty gown she said there wasn't a single paved street in town at the restaurant he informed you that he was from amarillo where the cops are awful and the democrats are yellow you smiled and said 'tha pigs are worse here, i'll bet ya' you nonetheless added 'welcome to georgia' i grinned as i stuck a marlboro in my mouth and told her it was my sixth trip down south i said i enjoyed rural towns in this part of the states where life is simple with no technological updates you somberly said you no longer find this place desirous for the city of atlanta is spreading like a virus you said your days are full of concern and strife for atlanta's threatening your way of life after coffee we took a long walk in the park it was peaceful, there were no dogs there to bark i told her i though she was very pretty and apologized that i was so dirty you bashfully accepted the compliments from this young man and said 'well ah tra to make masef as beautiful as ah can' then he kissed you, which was a bit of a surprise but you didn't mind as you closed your eyes i felt kinda guilty for kissing her quickly without reason so i told her she was obviously very smart and a good person i said she was much nicer than city slicking bitches who are materialistic, dishonest and untrustworthy snitches you looked into his weather hardened yet pretty face and offered to take you both back to your place he lowered his head and shyly agreed you were glad you didn't have to plead i awoke before her with my mind a blur but i hurriedly left a note saying i must catch a greyhound for it was san francisco where i was bound you woke up with an empty stare for he was not there you probably thought to him it was just a game and that all men are the same.
Once upon a time there was a little girl. she liked to sit outside at night and talk to the moon. everynight she kept the moon company. one night she noticed the moon seemed tired, so she climbed upon the roof, to tell the moon a secret. the old moon smiled, so she reaches up takes the moon in her hands and puts him in her pocket. then she climbs down and goes into her house, up the stairs to her room.there she takes the moon out and lets lay on her bed.for hours they talked, told secrets and giggled. then they heard people asking where the moon was. outside was so dark, they couldnt find their ways. the old moon says to the little girl 'maybe you should put me back into the sky, so the people can find their way home at night'. the little girl agreed.so she picks up the moon, puts him back into her pocket. she walks downstairs and goes outside. it was very dark, but she wasnt afraid, she had her friend the moon to help show her the way. she climbs back upon the roof, takes the moon out of her pocket. holding him with both hands she tells the moon'i love you, we will still talk every night, but you must go back give people light at nightime'. she leans over kisses the moon goodnight. then reaches back and tosses the moon hard as she could back into the nightime sky. then the little girl and the moon hear, all the people shouting and laughing. after everything quietened down the stars who were so happy the moon returned all gave the moon kisses. the little girl climbed down with the moon lighting her way went inside up to her room took 1 last peek out blowing the moon a big kiss goodnight.
So, watch this space there will be more, and, just in case others adore the one who is by way of soul in this small quiz her luscious whole. i shall reveal in time that's due. i broke the seal only for you.
The devil twinkling of an eye, the shape, the look of you, not being privy to your scent, sound of your words resound, resonating, ripples the head; sets on thinking, unthought things, base things, but natural, absolute, such as, i want to sleep inside you.
She huddles against the dirty wall hugging it ever so tight; hopeing that he will choose not to do the things, he did last night. her breathing is ever so shallow no signs of life in her. a technique she's developed with perfection, to guard her twisted world. 'maybe he will think i'm dead, ' she hopes 'for he can't see me breath, perhapes for just one night, he will turn around and leave' her wishes fade away in the night as he climb into her bed and any hopes of fooling him are replaced with anquish and dread. she knows too well the ritual, it's the same as the night before. the abuser will take what he wants from her and no words will this child implore. for she tries so hard to please him and everyone she loved. yet all of the time she cringes from their touch. while she is huddled against the wall never once looked in to he's eyes she can almost she him smiling as he rape this child of nine. this little girl holds back the tears. she knows she soon will cry she utters not a single word. as he enjoys the one he despise. and when the torment is over, he leave without a sound, and the tears that she's been holding back, fall silently to the ground.
I'm just a girl, a hopeless case. living in the world a familier place. i'm just a girl, with tears in her eyes. swimming in a pool of cold hearted lies. i'm just a girl, always second best. with sleepless nights and no time to rest i'm just a girl, with scars all around. always screaming with out a sound i'm juts a girl, giving up on life. running from my problems headed for the knife i'm just a girl, who's messed up in the head. with hope and wishes and prayers to be dead i'm just a girl, with nothing to live for. who shut out the world and fell to the floor. i'm just a girl, living in fear in the dark lonely place, flooded with tears. i'm just a girl, behind closed doors, soon to be gone and live no more.
With two white roses on her breasts, white candles at head and feet, dark madonna of the grave she rests; lord death has found her sweet. her mother pawned her wedding ring to lay her out in white; she'd be so proud she'd dance and sing to see herself tonight.
My dear, my dear, i know more than another what makes your heart beat so; not even your own mother can know it as i know, who broke my heart for her when the wild thought, that she denies and has forgot, set all her blood astir and glittered in her eyes.
She, under her big smile stows away the unhappy memories she wants to be the perfect happy person in this world and everyone would love her and she kids herself, she kids herself of what she really is and she is the empty shell waiting to be filled and she is the little los t orphan waiting to be found and she is the blank book waiting to be written in and she is hollow.
There is a girl inside. she is randy as a wolf. she will not walk away and leave these bones to an old woman. she is a green tree in a forest of kindling. she is a green girl in a used poet. she has waited patient as a nun for the second coming, when she can break through gray hairs into blossom and her lovers will harvest honey and thyme and the woods will be wild with the damn wonder of it.

The simple joys of life are nicer a rose, a rain or a river they're natural thus beautiful uncorrupted, pristine, eternal they're the life and so pure to any mental ailing perfect cure. the cashew nut, the cigar, the car in the hands of a dictator they affiliate more. artificiality and sophistry in revival of fortunes they cause only melancholy at last beyond the influence they 're confined, socio phobic, so artificial all true pleasures, delight, happiness of life forever denied.
Every morning i have to drive towards the sun just as the sun is about to rise. you pull down the car sun visor, but it is always too short and the sun gets in your eyes. you cannot see the road ahead, just yellow blobs before your eyes. you keep blinking until they fade away. one day i wish car manufactures would road test their cars in the morning sun. they then might make the car sun visors a little larger to stop the sun getting in your eyes. 11 february 2008.
By stuffing newspaper up the exhaust of my car somebody i do not know have taken their fun too far i do not have a known enemy and i'm new to this town why is someone i do not know trying to drag me down? my car it felt sick and i rang the r a c v and what the mechanic discovered a huge surprise to me a newspaper rolled up blocked the exhaust pipe rear by some not too nice person it was pushed in there. i am not without sin i will not cast the stone but if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone you do unto others what you'd like them do to you those words not by me but those words seem so true. against the person who did this i could not hold a grudge and since i am not meant to be anyone's judge of that karma will surely take care what goes around comes around that does seem fair. some non thinking person with low self esteem could only do something like this it would seem and i would like to say to this person leave my old car be you should not harm my car if you do not like me. i am new to this town here not many i know and all i ask of anyone is a fair go i am not without sin i will not cast the stone and if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone.
Two days ago while ringo was crossing the street into the sidewalk suddenly a careless driver ran over the little kitten ringo, his mom called possy did not about that accident, but she gave birth to four little kittens in the same day ringo had that accident, possy cared about ringo, but his fate was not a matter of questioning, we all felt sorry for ringo's death, but we can not do anything, ringo rests in his tomb for ever, so no fear about him anymore.
See my car, i am driving the car ask not its name and number i have already mentioned elsewhere here. see my car, i am driving the car, controlling the steering wheel i am driving the car, giving due respect to accelerator and brake, i know here in this car there is the truth called engine, passion and action are there in fuel and i know all knowledge and everything is there in tool box provided by the company itself. see my car i am going with my car to the service center as it is not running well as it met an accident though no fault of mine, all of a sudden it met an accident with the rain and the sun.
You sit inside the car as i drive on this busy road in the city, on some dangerous intersections, and you hold your hair with your left hand leaning on the mirror seeing the flow of people on the pedestrian lane and you quip, why do you love a stupid woman like me? i focus myself on the road and it begins to rain and people are running everywhere seeking for shelter you ask, do you really love me? i am sorry putting you on this mess. i am really sorry, tears begin to roll from your eyes the rain goes heavily on the glass and i cannot clearly see the road it is dark and i turn on the front lights and drive the car slowly on the side of the road. i stop for a while, it is hazy, i said. and i just love to kiss you.
From deniliquin to jerilderie paddocks gray and bare and brown on to narrandera and west wyalong and many smaller country town, to forbes and parkes and on through dubbo, gilgandra and coonabarabran miles and miles of weary travel through the world of outback man. on to narribri and then to moree on the north bound newell highway through new south wales the country's first state on a sunny april day and we cross the queensland border just after the sun go down and we spend our first night in the sunshine state in goondiwindi town. lettered signboards along the highway 'stop and rest for to survive' from victoria to south queensland it's a long and tiring drive for to see all of australia it might take a century it's a vast and open country and a lot of land to see. miles and miles of sunburnt country here and there a patch of green flocks of sheep and herds of cattle in the brownest land i've seen, kangaroos victims of traffic ravens pecking at their eyes here and there along the highway left as fodder for the flies. this vast land of wondrous beauty is too big for man to tame it's a wild and rugged country for want of a better name just a small part of australia but the journey seems quite far if you travel from victoria to south queensland in a car. from the wooded hills of sherbrooke to echuca's border town on through new south wales and northwards though a country wild and brown on beyond south queensland border to rest after tiring day just a small part of australia but it seems a long, long way.
We came out early on that tuesday afternoon i didn't want to part just yet for you to be gone so soon a cable car ride suggested, it quickly took your mind we took a tube to greenwich and traced around o2 no sooner than we knew it we were at the ticket office and with oyster discounts in our hand and wristbands strapped on tight it was not long before we took off upon our circular flight enclosed in glass we swept up to greyed out skies the wind picked up and swayed us on our cable i hoped that one such gust would place your hand in mind but you proved to be the braver one you never moved a finger i desperately wanted to put my hand in yours but was frightened still to do it but it wasn't' the wind but love youknow that made we want to do it the moment passed with a gps joke and then onto costa coffee.

Drivin' away in my automobile, taking a corner a little too fast chuckling loudly about the great deal 300 horses oh what a sweet blast. coppers are hanging on to my tail, ought to be chasin' the crooks in town, planting my foot, stay out of jail what's going up surely comes down. god gave me this daimler benz ain't my corned beef if laws of the land do not conform, i have great friends, up there in heaven where jesus blends fuel made for racing, sends it to me nothing they have will keep up the pace. i will prevail, be homebound for tea pigs of the world, give up your chase. drivin' away in my automobile writing my laws as i want them to read, no one but i would know how to steal modern fast cars, it's a definite need.
While driving my car late evening from school when the rains fall heavily on the streets looking like deserted i talk to myself unceasingly like we are very close friends and now for the first time in 20 years meet for this historic reunion i greet myself with such a warm hello ric this is ric meet ric how you have not changed for years you still look wonderful tonight and how are things doing with you? i am fine and doing well and i am at home with myself progressing in my career and happy with what i have and what i am looking forward to more excitements of my life like you do too with your life ric to ric the talk goes on and on and then the rain stops and then i finally arrive and honk my car to this house where the gate opens all too quickly with anticipation like this joy of an emotion the lights are all on brightly they shine on the glass of the car i am home at last.
I will never forget the day i bought my first new car, and had a date with a girl that lived not too far, we drove out into the suburbs and parked under a full moon, and listened to the car radio play a brand new tune, and if my neighbour would ever ask who the girl was, that was in the car, i will tell them it was my late mother who's on her way to heavenly abode, the day i bought the car.
'but do not come to daddy, crying, come monday morning expecting to pay what i offer you right here and now, so come, do sign the papers if you know what's good for you and me.' 'i want to shop around to see what deal can be arranged to suit me best, i must look out for number one, surely you know, a customer does have the right? ' 'well, once again, this deal is, to put it bluntly, for today, and not for any other time that follows. i'm in a mood to help you out, i like you, frankly and i know that you will send me all your friends, so trust me, sir, i'm doing what is best for all of us, and also, i could tell. the truth is, that you may be, so i notice a bit embarrassed with that old jalopy.' 'so what is the exact and final figure, counting the trade of cedric here, and all the costs on road and for the kaiser, insurance which you kindly offered, in other words, how much will be enough? ' 'now that's more like it, the thinking man, you know, so many of my customers are, to put it mildly, so ignorant, don't get me wrong, i like them all, but it is always such a pleasure to deal with someone who can think like you. so, i suggest we get the papers done right now, i'll call your banker with the final figures then, and you go home and celebrate the deal, no need to worry, i will handle it from here. '.
With the gift of the gab they would talk their way out of hell these used car sales people they know how to sell on their selling ability their jobs are at stake the more cars they do sell the more commission they do make on any deals they clinch they have never lost and your trust on such people can come at a cost the more cars they sell the more money they get paid a hard job to succeed in the used car trade, shy and sensitive used car sales people one might say are rare to sell one a car no effort they do spare they have to sell cars or their boss them will fire and other used car yard owners as car sales people them will not hire the more cars they sell the greater is their pay so to sell you a car they try every which way.
Have you ever tasted sorrow, i think it taste like lemons, if all feelings had a taste i think of lemons, they can be sour then can get sweet, lemons sweet or sour then comes the sorrow taste, sorrow taste of rain, sorrow taste of lemons,.
Teardrops fall down my face. the mistakes i cant replace. the days i forgot, the memories i lost. and all because i was killed inside. poisoned by youre secrets like cyanide. i lost myself forgot my friends. headed towards the dark end. and i try but the harder i try, the more i fail the more i lie. and i have to beilive than i can go on. even when everything has turned out wrong. i have to keep going in the hopes of tommorow. waiting for the day without any sorrow.
Wouldst i live with tears of sorrow fearful of what will come the morrow, yearning for past times of glee thinking back on thee. wouldst i live with sadness borrowed from the losses of life's furrows, walking forward in the past lamenting what has gone so fast. wouldst i live for a rosy future one that promises another way that will make a brighter day, and all the while i am right here living in a state of fear. leaving past to memories locker and the future not yet formed i will not; cannot follow. all that holds the gift of life is present now and free from strife, in this moment full of potential is the answer existential. giving light and holding faith never lacking; full of grace. looking back i loose my self when all that's needed is belief that this ever present moment frees me from all the causes of my grief.
I smile as the blood runs down my arm. the blood is a mixture of mine and those who have, betrayed my trust and heart. i don't care if i die for my crimes, to me it was all worth it in the end. now i know that no one will betray me again, but if they do i will kill myself instead of them. maybe, just maybe, i'll rest in peace with no fear of ever getting hurt again, but i know that's not true, you never get peace. there is no such thing in any life time.so now i know why i'm here. i'm one of those few poeple born into this world, that are priveleged to be hurt, stabbed in the back, betrayed, and most of all.unloved. that day i ran out of tears, so now i smile. i truly have no reason to. but since my tears are forever dry. i smile for its the only thing i can do.
My feelings for you had changed, i found it deep within, i'm getting well with this problem, but there's no other way. you treated me bad, what do you want me to feel? just be quiet? and feel sorry for me? . my anger for you, will surely remain, getting this bruises, mkes me wonder, why did i suffer like this? my anger for you, was like a burning fire, not seeing you, makes me feel very much happy. my anger for you, was like a hell, and this will be forever, anger and hatred in my heart.
What sorrow has befallen me no sun to light my day, these clouds yield only misery while joy has fled away, across the lands where no one goes and all do fear to tread, where only fear and silence grows and dreams are lying dead. now waves of sadness and despair do swamp my aching heart, for no one now does seem to care my life's been torn apart, regrets i shall take to my grave my tears forever flow, for all my hopes i could not save and on the winds did blow. and yet no malice do i keep nor hate towards my love, i'll dream of her within my sleep while stars do shine above, and hope that soon the dawn shall break then shine just like before, for now i know each morn i wake i'll miss her even more.
The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves, the brilliant moon and all the milky sky, and all that famous harmony of leaves, had blotted out man's image and his cry. a girl arose that had red mournful lips and seemed the greatness of the world in tears, doomed like odysseus and the labouring ships and proud as priam murdered with his peers; arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves, a climbing moon upon an empty sky, and all that lamentation of the leaves, could but compose man's image and his cry.
Red lotus incense fades on the jeweled curtain. autumn comes again. gently i open my silk dress and float alone on the orchid boat. who can take a letter beyond the clouds? only the wild geese come back and write their ideograms on the sky under the full moon that floods the west chamber. flowers, after their kind, flutter and scatter. water after its nature, when spilt, at last gathers again in one place. creatures of the same species long for each other. but we are far apart and i have grown learned in sorrow. nothing can make it dissolve and go away. one moment, it is on my eyebrows. the next, it weighs on my heart.
Joy and sorrow resolute within and beyond night seems to lie in deep sleep speckles of darkness covers her body i close my eyes by the bliss of love tonight tolls cry of innocence as we look back through lone silence audacity of hope resigns to repose rain was running in deep breath earth clenches mirth into riff of dusts thirst dissolute melting the shadow would you not comeback to fold of tonight moments still remembers tinge of snow.
Your sorrow and my sorrow are not really ours to keep. they belong to the earth, to the heart of the earth inside its beautiful bosom. let us leave them just right there, secure and honed. we are leaving now to another sphere, the one that we see in our dreams the more colored ones feel the excitement, keep yourself poised to something more lasting more divine.
My soul is cold as ice. my heart is darker then the void. nothing seems nice. all happiness devoid. i feel nothing. except that of pain. i've looked for that one something. but i just ended up crying in the rain. my tears are dry. they could fill the deepest oceans. the end seems nigh. there is only pain, no other emotions. my hope, my life.shattered. i cannot pick up the pieces. it's not like i mattered. but my sorrow increases. i have been mocked, betrayed, and destroyed. no medication can numb my hurt. all those around me seem overjoyed. when my face is shoved into the dirt. my god has left me. sitting up in his throne. i did not want to be his enemy. i'll just sit here and moan. my love has thrown me aside. like damaged goods. i wish i just would have died. in a grave unmarked in the deepest of woods. and so here i am. i am not sure if i will be alive tomorrow. i just don't give a damn. i am going to drown in my sorrow.
Tides came and washed away the empitiness inside my vacant heart, the waves came with a thrash and washed all the remains only leaving a lonley piece of driftwood, withered and set alone to endure its helpless future for someone's raging fire listening to the gulls, screeching in harmony of knowing the tides were very high with huge changes in store, i walked along the beach that fatefull day and wondered, which way to follow as night set in, calmly now, the sea once again was thrashing to and fro and leaving behind the tity bed of new sand with the moon casting its lonely shadow, it told me then, the sand is new, and now is the time for a new start in my life leaving behind the battered hinges on the door to my forsaken heart, but letting the oppourtunity to replace its barren walls of sorrow.
A day of sorrow, a day of pain, not knowing who's to blame? towers standing tall and true, destroyed by people with something to prove. millions cried and millions prayed, to save one life the heroes slaved. clearing the rubble and mounds of debris, with tears in their eyes, they worked fearlessly. stranges wept for the many and few, hoping god will pull them throught. i walk throught the valley of the shadow of death; the last words spoken before we laid them to rest. i cry with people i do not know, to see their pain it hurts me so. maybe one day our pain will end, with love and support from family and friends.
What of life as the sun rises away from the cloud of doom. is there a place that is without doom and gloom. is there a far distant land where life is full of fun, and is there a land where life does not have to look down the barral of a gun, torment and sorrow as far as we can see but life could be so different if everyone was free free from hunger, free from pain, but there is never a break it always remains the same. sex abused kids and the want for food, what is the meaning of this modern brood. can we change this perfectic world and find a life without sadness and sorrow, can it happen now or do we wait until tomorrow. tomorrow never comes as everyone knows, but the pain and sorrow just grows and grows. there is a chance that the world could live as one, but not while we are looking down the barrel of a gun. every country has it's own rule, but it's the people that live there are made to look the fool.
The bare eyes of old houses crack with sorrow, because the sun will rise again tomorrow. of all who pass by there is no dissenter, no mood exists upon this street but winter. a woman and a man walk by together, their shadows painted filigree on weather. gazing steadfastly upward beyond dying, they memorize whatever birds are flying.
Despair is in the suns that shine, and in the rains that fall, this sad forsaken soul of mine is weary of them all. they fall and shine on alien streets from those i love and know. i cannot hear amid the heats the north sea's freshening flow the people hurry up and down, like ghosts that cannot lie; and wandering through the phantom town the weariest ghost am i.
Once i heard the song of sadness, t'was full of melancholy pure. i sat and listened for what seemed to be forever, it seemed to be joy's cure. never again can you think the same, once you've heard such a song. never again can you live the same, once you know what's truly right and wrong. i fell into pieces, i lost all my hope. i whithered away, there was no way to cope. now i've joined the chior, i am not alone. i sing the song of sorrow and madness, chilling listeners to the bone.
When sunsets for night sorrow drifts in, whispering through the trees. her gown flutters through the air as she glides over me. setting quietness throughout the land, in a dangerious whisper that gave me shivers. the despair settled over me, as her calming deadly wrath, wrapped me in a blanket of sadness.
Sorrow can leave you spending in a frame with so much gulit and pain sorrow was taken as a game but it's so much more than and emotion it's a pain love brings sorrow in the game it's like a pain calling your name sometimes that come and never goes away sorrow is based on a fear sorrow is a secret you hold near sorrow can hurt based on if it's a fear but thats basically why sorrow found you here.
I'll be sorrow tomorrow i'll be sorrow tomorrow, with me myself and i. i'll be sorrow tomorrow, holding myself while i cry. i'll be sorrow tomorrow, while lying sleepless in my bed. i'll be sorrow the next day as one thought haunts my head. and when i finally rest my lids and cease my icy breath, that one thought will exist no longer, that horrible thought of death. ruby.
When i dream i dream of sorrow, my dreams are long and dark, i can hear the sond but never see the color, my dreams leave me awake some nights thinking, some dreams are more of a story, but all have sarrow and pure sadness, the trees are dead im the last alive, all my dreams end the same, a rock and a bang, the rock is the earth, more sorrow then the night before, my dreams are deep and make me wright things like this, the more i dream the more i cry, the more i cry the more i think about my own death, will a die at 90 of age or 15 from a gun, will the killing ever stop, will we ever know how the world ends, my dreams paint a dark and stormy picture, my poems paint a clear, my mind crys of dark things like this, my hart crys harder and harder, between sweet and sour, i think the end will end sour, are we to end in fire or ice, you chose i would rather end in ice,.
Yet i do remember the hoary stance of night rolling spumes away into onshore to heap of sands yet not unknown history yet records reels of fire. where are those tiding whelms from hide speckles ocean pierce into air unfailing whispering dew of roses basking in glow moon seemingly snored in valley of obscurity mystery may uncover the flings of sorrow night when chilled being chiseled of snow do we ever know the eternity by reality? rainbow is ephemeral by voyage to void.
One can hear the voice of sorrow sobbing, sobbing endlessly yet it hides in dark recesses sorrow you can never see it's a black and brooding creature with a voice that aches of pain and all of those who have met with it hope not to meet with it again. joy is always bright and breezy joy has got a laughing face and where ever joy is present you will find a happy place joy is loved by everybody the scars of grief it can repair it is such a happy creature joy is welcome everywhere. there is not one who likes sorrow you will not hear some one say i've met with sorrow this morning and meeting it has made my day at the mention of the name of sorrow people pretend not to hear but joy always bright and happy greets you with a lusty cheer. sorrow it is dark and tearful and it hides in a dark and lonely place but joy is always bright and cheerful and it greets you with a laughing face and everybody hates old sorrow as it always gives rise to woe but joy the happiest of the happy the one all people wish to know.
Rivers are like the life we share, sometimes we go fast, sometimes we go slow, my river is slow and filled with sorrow, it seems endless, never turns and always follows the same path, far from anyone or any place, alone my river stands and alone it shall stay, the sorrowful river with a path so untold, will my river of sorrow ever cross paths with one other,.
The women of your age i train my eyes on remind me of you through some resemblances and some violent contrasts now and then. nose studs and ear drops i see in the shops catch my eyes and bring to my view your face. i imagine the stud worn on your nose and with that how your nose would tempt my lips. i imagine the drops hung from your ears and with that how your ears would prompt me. when i am lonely you are in my thought; i dream of passing my hand through your hair and gazing into your eyes full of love. to bring this about, i must conquer fate as i accuse myself of cowardice. i have no courage nor propriety even to let you know my feelings. this is my sorrow that cripples my mind. this is my agony underlining. 02.11.2008.
I still remember the soft touch of your hand, as i stand here lonely in this foreign land. and can you remember how i loved you? does love still glow in those eyes of blue? sing me that song those birds sang long ago. hold me close in those arms and never let me go. don't say you are leaving as you have done before. say we will be together today and forevermore. let's walk together and talk of what has been done, and then go for a swim in the bright sun. as i get the feeling the time is drawing near, i will hug you to me and cry a sorrowed tear. the memories were special, for now they are gone, but i still recall each one with every rising dawn. one last goodbye, parting forevermore. one last kiss, more feverish than before. i cherish our love, it's tender, sweet song. and hope in my heart, this parting won't be long.
The tear of sorrow runs down my cheek friendship is what i seek i used to think i had it all but now my backs against the wall and my heart has been broken and these words are unspoken i look back at my past and wish the sorrow would end my life at last.

Its just a small story and i feel the need to say it i just couldn't take it anymore the pain he was causing me it was just too much for me to bare it was only that night which i realized that i had to do it i gave you a text message apologizing, but in the same time telling you that i had to be strong and forget you it was over i never worried about my past or future and you were my past that was the only thing which was clear to me suddenly you call me asking for an explanation i told you it was too much for me to put up with you did your best to apologize but it was all in vain there was no time for another try although a big future was awaiting the both of us you still tried to apologize but i was too stubborn to try once more all i did was close my phone and go to bed hoping that till tomorrow i would have forgotten you i feel asleep very fast because all the tears i cried had finally made their effect the next morning i woke up happily as i turned my phone on i was ready to call you but then i just froze there doing absolutely nothing remembering i could no longer be with you i went to our special place next to the pink lake under our blossom tree but i saw someone was already there it was you i started quivering you turn around to me and fake a smile but even his fake smile soon faded away apologizing once more with little hope in your heart a tear runs down my face and i run to you you open your arms widely patiently waiting for me to throw myself in them it was exactly what i did you tell me you're never going to do any mistake never again in your life i tell you that i just can't live without you it was that night i realized how much i love you how much i care for you how i'm addicted to you you're like a drug for me and i'll never check in a rehab with such a satisfactory drug like the one which is on my mind right now that drug is you now we just go on with our lives being there for each other with no fake smiles with no secrets only with a flame in both our hearts a flame which will burn forever.
Together they make a bond together they stay for life long together they walk and stand and sleep together they play, sing and weep together they stay for life long in the end they write their song and if they ever separate they make the world a bad place till they meet once more.
I stand tall as all the misery around me floats the words when i first heard of the sadness in my life but i do not budge for i am strong i walk past all who offer me a kind word to help ease my soul i decline for i let my strength shine through acceptance within my heart i say i am all right everyone watches as i walk past and comment on my strength some fear that i have no feelings others envy for they hurt so much i walk through the door of my bedroom and shut it behind me i fall to my knees and catch myself with my hands as the tears stain the floor my strength is gone and now my sorrow envelopes me my sight is blurred as the pure rain falls from my cheeks i can not breathe as i realize what happened after some time i wipe my eyes dry and walk back out with my strength for all to see.
By the river, under the sorrow tree, the universe says the bones must dance, and she, who goes out with a net to catch the spirits, returns, her hands filled only with the dark briars we have hummed these many years. the one who sees sorrow cannot staunch it, yet by her side something white announces itself. the bones are sucked clean, the one nearest the heart becomes a flute, when you blow, the dead come and behind them, the other bones in a circle the universe says loss demands birth and the two are lovers.
A time for you and a time for me, to be whatever, we choose to be; to set our sights, to reach the peak, to realize goals, we truly seek. a time to dwell. on things long past, a time to think, on things that last; on family, friends and things that matter, on things that endure and do not scatter. a time to laugh and a time to weep, a time for treasured things to keep; a time for reflection on how we feel, a time to mend and a time to heal. a time to live and a time to die, a time for joy and a time to cry; a time to smile and a time for tears, a time for god to calm our fears. a time to despose of loved ones dead, a time to get on with the day ahead; to blot out death and face the 'morrow, to clear the mind and bury sorrow.
The pain crashes to the depth of my soul just another feeling of sorrow another flinch from pain just like yesterday, it'll be there tomorrow wounds healing slowly so slow, it seems not at all i want it gone tonight but still and fast i fall where does it go from here? does it end? will it continue? when did it begin? but you don't care, do you? i don't know why i even bother you will never be what i need why should you try now to be the father? are you done hurting me? are you finished yet? you enjoy it, don't you? you have not one regret. you took away my pride, my joy, and my brother. you avoided talking of things i needed to hear such as my mother i just needed you the love of a father but i don't want it anymore because i was never your daughter.
There was a sound amongst the hills, echoing in the valley of wind, a challenge was made. dark birds flew over the grey sky fire, smoke, cloud, dust blinded the gods, all hope was lost. a man stepped up, undaunted by the demons drew his sword, with all its glory marched on.. a lake so placid, in a forest so dark god be with the soul who passes thee for he do not know what lurks beneath, riding into the forest, the land of men seemed distant, there was no turning back, the fiery horse galloped away an abyss of oblivion for those who dwell among the trees. life an eternity of sorrow. there lay the enemy, cold; with a force so tremendous that he couldnt fight, but home was far away. the winding road, to the gates of hell was gleaming in delight. despair was in the air. the sword was broken. the gods wept that day, for their loyal soldier had fallen. tears irrigating the land, for another son of the soil to rise.
Sorrow, sorrow why have you catch me so why have you left me in such a big hole sorrow, sorrow when will you leave my soul and let my heart breath so there is nowhere to go if you keep beating on my heart so sorrow, sorrow its time to go and let your heart be with your soul.
Tears fill my heart, i cry in the darkness, i cry in the shadows, i cry in the moonlight, alone and afraid. the pain engulfs me, taking me away, yet keeping me chained. my mind screams, my body aches, for these painful memories are forever etched in my heart.
My mother groaned, my father wept, into the dangerous world i leapt; helpless, naked, piping loud, like a fiend hid in a cloud. struggling in my father's hands, striving against my swaddling bands, bound and weary, i thought best to sulk upon my mother's breast.
Good morning mr magpie alone again, like me i greet you then i bless myself and hope that i shall see your lady busy in the trees up here in jagger green. the wind is soft and urgent on the pale green yorkshire hills rooks fuss in high bare branches looking down on silent mills and the magpie is a single bird up here in jagger green. i watched him as he rested in the mayday morning light then hard and low and straight there came another flash of black and white and the sun is like a woman's kiss up here in jagger green.
Come and see where it is you find dancing the sea. never find the sky loughing somewhere in the city. you find me without size and shape the rough road ahead. come and see i am missing in the gitamandir. and i am somewhere on the bank of the ganga where judge is there to pass order after the game over.
October, 1918 across a world where all men grieve and grieving strive the more, the great days range like tides and leave our dead on every shore. heavy the load we undergo, and our own hands prepare, if we have parley with the foe, the load our sons must bear.
Slaves to the powers of the external mind if your innocent or guilty they do not mind watching and waiting to make their strike they'll take you down and watch you drown as long as they get somebody to make themselves proud they won't care that your mind is not all there all over the world the powers of the external mind is watching you.
A jury sat around a tree to judge a man for treason. the foreman said 'how can it be this fellow had no reason. a patriot who, for his land stood deep in flanders' trenches, today is forced to take a stand and face justitia's benches. then tea was served and little snacks, one of the jurors fainted, she found it hard to just relax when evidence was tainted. they shot the fellow near the tree, 'twas sanctioned by the nation. they had no proof that one could see, did no investigation. it often happens in this world where imbeciles now rule, and when their ugly lies are hurled it's you who plays the fool. they put you down, just like a dog and laugh when you expire. then toast each other with their grog, it's justice they admire. the little word integrity has fallen out of favour. the tea served underneath the tree does have a modern flavour.
We can never create a single life, so we shouldn't have right to take it, but what is going on all around a society, some psychotic man have been serial killer, some are killing people for so called revenge, some are killing as a victim of a situation, intentionally and unintentionally we are killing, now any one can say that for this we have laws, but what is our law doing in the sake of justice? hanging a person, or electrocuting him on a chair, in the name of painless death injecting poisons, but are not these the way of killing a person? are not these the excuses to hide our failures? this is us, who give birth these sick murderers, this is us, who let a man to be a killer, whatever that is, so called legal or illegal, are not these both killing processes sin? are not these bot about taking a life? can we say this justice a justice, which allows to take a life empowering a badge? think man.humanity is crying in the door of justice.
Fairness and justice are just two nominal words on our earth because we completely lack them anytime and anywhere, they are just two words in shape, but we lack them totally in content, they are like you dream to get them when you need them in life, so we pay very high price when we lack them.

How can be a difference between peace and justice i never knew there could be a difference among these two essential points for survival our world's i always thought they complete each other humanity's world has got destroyed how can the world bear all these woes but if ill be asked to choose among those justice or the peace i would choose the peace because without peace lives stop surviving as well as the world but what's the meaning of justice it's the difference among our thoughts thoughts if neglected lives will be survived but when the peace deserts our lives no one will stay alive so for what is your justice when it will take lives.

An innocent man lies his head down to rest not wanting to wake to the morning sun instead wanting to wake in a parallel universe where truth and justice is number one in the real world his days seem like years they eat away at his mind body and soul if a witness would lie he knows he might die before truth and justice would see the light but he's got to keep up the fight all he wants is justice with no lie so come forward and let truth and justice shine it's light.
I'm walking i'm walking i can hear the hospital talking doctor death wants to get in my head laid me on the bed put electrodes to my head blasted me till i'm nearly dead they knew i'd confessed with voices in my head now they was trying to make me dead did they think i wouldn't survive did they think i'd go and hide as the years rolled by my demons said goodbye now it's time to have justice on my side doctor death you can't hide it's justice time.
Millions of us stand on the roads, not waiting for the transports to board, just searching the peace that is lost, opportunities missed and the destiny tainted. rugs are cleaner and not with punctures, in certain place, but looking at these juncture, why are these people let to wear such attires, why aren't they cared and seen as equal? when sugar, grains and spices are procured, value their sweat to value these commodities, why do the rich want to buy these necessities, at the price of these poor countries? the beautiful blouse that we wear, the elegant shirts that covered with the coats, branded ties, meticulous belts and shoes, believe me, might have been made, with 25 cents per hour petty salary, their children are alive half empty, while our children are obese and naughty, these people do not have to go to hell, as they already live a life of hell, where they drink untreated water, frequent power cuts, clogged drains, herbal remedies, god given diseases, entertained by the music of mosquitoes.
She is passionate about fairness and equality. justice is not just a store, but rather a progressive and important social concept. rosa parks and mother teresa are role models who inspire her. she likes how february is black history month and march is women's history month, but yet she still ponders how women have only had the right to vote since 1920 in america. not even 100 years have passed and there has never been a woman president. she doubts some men would ever vote for a woman president and that makes her sad. she likes when women do not hit the glass ceiling and instead rise to positions of leadership. she thinks pay inequality based on gender is grossly unfair. she ponders how can men still be paid vastly more for the exact same job as a woman in a progressive society? she is a social justice girl.
When justice fails because the constable has blundered do not be surprised, do not even be discouraged, proceed in procurring justice still with the way how you are trained to do so, get the fingerprints of your thoughts and present the same to those who doubt and wavered, show them the intricate lines of your own determinations this is how it must be done there is still a map of this destination, when justice fails because the judge and justices have also lost their sense what justice is and how it should be dispensed like a blindfolded lady that you misunderstand with her scales on one hand and a sword on the other, do not be shaken, do not lose hope, heave a sigh and breathe the remaining clean air, there are still those who in silence still remain steadfast holding on to truth and keeping their hands clean and hearts pure and minds active to the pursuit of this eternal approximation of fairness there are still those whose eyes still daze to the glitters not of gold but of truth, beauty, and goodness, i will count you in please count me in too and how about you? i ask, please be counted we shall stand on the good side of things we shall look for the brightest star the ideal from among the blunders in the darkness of our nights let the hammer fall and let it fall everyday let those in the dark side have their houses full.
It's a troubled world we live in the world of today but love with peace and justice only decades away in fifty years or less from now there won't be mistrust and hate the war lords and the men of war will have passed their use by date. those who love peace and justice are beginning to unite and for the men who worship war their loss of power in sight soon war jets will not fly the sky under the cloak of night and those who promote harmony will be the men of might. the yearn for peace is spreading getting stronger by the day and those who are divisive will not have a part to play in the world of the future the racist and the cruel will not have any power at all only the just will rule. the children who are born today will surely live to see a world of peace and harmony and of war and hatred free for the yearn for peace is spreading and with each passing day it grow and war will be unheard of in forty years or so.
It was just another day or so i thought but madness had got me i didn't even know i was walking through the city minding my own when i saw a man hurt someone i should have known i should have turned away i should have gone another way but my mind wouldn't let me it was too far away i'm chasing i'm chasing i'm gaining but i'm losing i'm fighting but i'm not moving i'm chasing my dreams away i catch him i beat him i take the blame for him then i pay for what he done twenty years of pain justice never done.
When justice stands still only the fool hearted, will contemplate pursuing even the most just of causes, when justice stands still, the brave only will seek retribution for sins committed against them and their kinsman, can any gleamse of sovereignty exist where justice takes a tea break, and when justice decides to stand still will any sanity prevail, where justice once stood still, can any unity ever be restored once upon a time the jews were slandered and abused but they had the courage to stand up and refuse, when justice stands still, the supposed saviours become the enslavers, who then will stand up to refuse for the people when justice stands still, the law makers become peace detractors, creating laws meant not to ensure harmony, but to bring woo to the masses, when justice stands still, they will seek to devour, those they once vowed to protect, justice stands still, the eleventh plague, not just a biblical fantasy, but a present reality.
Prison dark room no light human life breathes murder charge old age innocent soul suffers justice call hard labor to work as stone cutter bones crack after days work real pain and eyes spark is this the life to suffer? is this the punishment to offer? prison sentence before trial human abuse with justice denial.
Sometimes we seethe with rage over some heinous crime committed. our voices are raised with thousands of others for justice to prevail, and then watch in disbelief as a nominal sentence is incurred. although the courts think, they decide the fate of the individual it is inside the walls of prison that really seals their fate. sex offenders and child abusers are never welcome there. the prisoners welter out their own brand of punishment for them. 14 november 2009.
Justice justice where is it in close door or in open court justice justice nowhere you can trace it out in any form anywhere justice justice speak not about it it is disgusting it is boring only push back fire rushes no smile but cries.
Loyaulte me lie echoes through history a sacred oath, a blessing a cry for truth and justice of equality and freedom that lies at the heart of kingship and of princes and men. let justice prevail in all its form let the truth be known that loyalty binds me.
For years together there were no rains we adulated you, my god, impatiently then. requesting you to allow rains to rain, for diminishing your subjects inner pain. hungry we were and in search of bread, in search of water, tears we had to shed. nothing we could do other than devotion, expiating always for all the committed sins. no one could stop the harsh man slaughter no one could bring on dry lips a laughter. then came a day, the day of your glory, every side fainted with cats and dogs raining. what is this unjust justice, i could'nt guess, oh god, do you want us only difficulties to face.

Yolinda often was depressed she then stayed home, inside her nest. to help her illness she used gin it quickly did restore her grin but alcohol's welcome effect was not expected to correct her melancholy disposition thus it required repetition. she managed thus for many years depression and some other fears. and on her deathbed she required the liquid she so much admired. it helped, this time she drank a quart before she left for god's resort.

Depression is a fact of life for me. as much a part of life as food and air, it hovers like a dreaded entity. it scatters joys like useless stale debris, and sews the ashes of my dreams in gloom. depression is a fact of life for me. it poises like a shadowing banshee with somber wings just waiting to enshroud. it hovers like a dreaded entity, and i can almost always guarantee secreted in my spectral holidays depression is a fact of life for me. my life becomes a frequent abductee purloined by mirthless bird of prey it hovers like a dreaded entity.. a vulture pouncing when my back is turned, but hidden, and not easily discerned. depression is a fact of life for me it hovers like a dreaded entity.

Depression takes over my body. making me dizzy, sick, and sad. as i walk the halls with a blank face i'm dieing inside with so many thoughts it takes over my body. i walk the halls with tears running down my cheek. with black merky makeup running down my blank expressionless face. i woundered if anyone noticed whenever my teacher sounds my name, my heart starts to ache, surprised someone actually knows i exist. i wounder if anyone notices the depression taking over. i smile blankly but crying endlessly inside. no one knows 'me'. all those lies catch up with me. all those memories haunt me. there's just so much that time cannot erase. i wounder if it'll ever change. i pray but then what happens? depression is my disease that doesn't go away. i've tried many times to get rid of it but never did go away. so i listen to music to get the pain away.tempararily.

A period of crying can betray the soul showing the pain that makes us whole. without pain what would happiness be? would it be there for us to see. would we not know happiness without pain how could you tell what was best? is our pain in a way needed? is it somehow misleading? trying to show us, yet we get caught, too selfish to busy with my own thought. but when you are happy think of the pain, oh think how good it is to be happy again.
Depression in so many it's always so sad to see the numbers are uncanny just take a look at me so many in pain unseen as depression numbers rise sometimes life can be so mean just look into my eyes afraid to go home don't know how to deal you're feeling so alone this is how i feel.
I fear my little child. i fear that she will not feed and grow strong and healthy, i fear that she will stop breathing when i am out of the room or selfishly asleep, i fear that she will become ill because of something i have done or did not do, i fear that she will be in pain and i will not know why. i fear that her father will reject her, i fear that her father will reject me, i fear that her father will compete for her love and that she will love him more, i fear that her father will be distant and that she will not love him enough. i fear that others will think that i am incompetent, i fear that others will assume that i am capable, i fear that others will force upon me unhelpful or unwanted advice, i fear that others will believe i can cope. i fear the loneliness of endless days without contact, i fear the emptiness of endless nights without love, i fear the weakness of endless days without proper meals, i fear the weariness of endless nights without sleep. i fear inexperience. i fear uncertainty. i fear guilt. i fear despair. i fear my little child.
Stab me with your rusty knives i don't care i've given up my quest for acceptance left my dream of peace cut me all your evil mind wants i beg you to let me die i want to lie here on the floor bleed to nothingness in the night perhaps then my soul will fly unite with the wind and muggy air feel the warmth of joy's arms so do what you want to my useless heart chop me to pieces or burn me alive if death is my only way to salvation then i want to open the darkened door now.

There is a rat i call depression inside me, eating at my innards. the pain goes to my throat so i am choking on my tears my tears of blood. would that i could write of something else, would that i could. and i am so very tired if i could only end it all looking at words on the page that reflect back to me my misery. and where am i?.
When you try to make it better with the truths you hold so close and the lies made up apart of you to the ones you hate the most something screams inside i'll never change when your thoughts are painted black someone chose for me to be this way. and there's only me to thank and when your heart falls in the way you think there's really no turning back and the ones you think you thought you loved could never judge the way you act you've played this part for way to long now the center stage is clear grab my wrist and hold it tight tell me nothing's left to fear. i thought words could explain the way i feel but now i know that's just a lie grab my wrist and hold it tight i'm coming home tonight when i go just leave the door unlocked i'll make it worth my while when the high gets low and my conviction stands just look at me and smile.
The unnamed feelings eating me alive, and depression is lying inside. as the thin dark ropes falling from the sky the brown knots are dancing in front of my eyes i quickly closed them and pray 'god, am i losing my mind? ' i hold my blade and cut my unloved wrist it's bleeding still but i can't feel relief yet i ran to the balcony as am looking down and wondering if the height is enough to smash my head over the floor? will it be enough to break my out through this door? the monster inside my head is calling my name and asking me to suicide. it screams inside and then orders me to die die dying. you are not alive just cut it deeper and die.you don't want to survive 'god, i'm screaming for your help i'm begging for a relief a moment of inner peace did you forget me i'm still here living in this empty shell f grief can't you remember me. ?.
I remember as a child i had a deep seeded fear of heights i would envision my demise long prior to even a possible fall once as a teenage boy i knocked a front tooth from my mouth when i jumped twenty feet into a drainage ditch next to our house my mother rushed me to the dentist with my tooth in milk he soon restored my youthful smile but did little if any at all to replace my fear of falling as i still panicked whenever i even stood close to a ledge. for the last sixty years i have managed to cope more or less always waking up before any tragedy occurred but last night upon being led to this cliff in my life i jumped and have not landed yet as i knew it was a bottomless pit i was entering.
Life is all lies borrowed for cries tears are all shy like wings that won't fly like eyes that won't see like lips that won't speak like lungs that won't breathe like freedom that's not free it won't just pass through it is really stuck on you like glue like gum on a shoe it's like an eclipse let the words pass through your lips let the tears in your eyes stick making the stress in your mind slip i know it's like being raped like all your thoughts are being taped like you have to keep your fists shaped like the tears in you have turned to rain well this whole thing is not your fault your life is not at a stop there is a way to crack this vault there is a word you could call your life is not all flat there's a chance you could catch there is a way, that is a fact depression is what caused all that.
Depression hurts when you grow old and life has passed you by no more dreams to think about or even wishes to come true you lose a friend and then another and there's no past to talk about no laughter, only tears to shed that others cannot see depression hurts no matter what you try it breaks you down till nothing matters life doesn't matter either you come or go, who cares no one that really cares too much no friend thats left to tell your troubles to no love that puts its arms around you and holds you close. why stay and sit in this old chair with nothing to do day after day smoke cigarettes, why not its too late now to care goodbye to this life i would gladly say why god won't take me now i do not know because he knows i want to go home with others that i love there's more up there than down here more love from friends in heaven no friends do i count down here depression hurts, it hurts down deep inside it breaks your heart and destroys your mind your thoughts are eratic and blown until the thoughts that used to come are gone forever, depression hurts.
Shackled to depression intertwined, amongst my veins self worth, self love are lost, within the pain anguish and shattered dreams lie embedded in my heart a glimpse of personal torture revealed, within the art a medicated mind does it offer resolution? candy coated prescriptions swallowed, without solution blind to the rising sun of opportunity, to thrive another breath inhaled without purpose, without drive shackled to depression consumed by failure, and disgrace a crying soul unseen i walk invisible, without face copyright 2007 w. bureau.
The depression of the 1930's was the time of my childhood days, there were a lot of worries and hardships in many ways. whatever time people could spare, they would help each other out, bad times also came when there was a draught. the depression of the 1930's our parents would help make quilts of all kinds, they would work long hours, day and night, it was alot on their minds. fathers would work on the w.p.a. just to make ends meet, breaking stones was very hard work, some of them fell to their feet. the depression of the 1930's there were problems about work, severe winters and war, people never know from day to day what may be in store, there were children of all ages, sick with an illness, some of them passed away with the long nights of stillness. the depression of the 1930's made it bad for all ages, work was scare, there was pay of low wages. during the depression, we all learned how to survive, a lot of people shared the hardships by showing love and being alive. the depression of the 1930's will be in my heart for the rest of my life, i, margaret l. hockenberry, now margaret l. rodkey lived in those hardships of struggle and strife my parents were loving and caring in every way, they taught me to respect people and show them we care.
I got these pills for christmas but not from santa claus i got them from the pharmacy with the greengrocer next door. they're really very nice pills i take them all the time and even when its raining i say the weather's fine. they're very cost effective about ten bucks a week and for all the good they do for me they're really very cheap. i have to say i'm nervous each time i get a scrip i whisper what i'm buying they often have to read my lips. you see i suffer from depression and i'm scared if people know they think i'm all peculiar and say 'sorry gotta go'. it's quite lonely being lonely it's lonely by myself it's lonely being a victim of imperfect mental health.
Our lives avoided tragedy simply by going on and on, without end and with little apparent meaning. oh, there were storms and small catastrophes. simply by going on and on we managed. no need for the heroic. oh, there were storms and small catastrophes. i don't remember all the particulars. we managed. no need for the heroic. there were the usual celebrations, the usual sorrows. i don't remember all the particulars. across the fence, the neighbors were our chorus. there were the usual celebrations, the usual sorrows thank god no one said anything in verse. the neighbors were our only chorus, and if we suffered we kept quiet about it. at no time did anyone say anything in verse. it was the ordinary pities and fears consumed us, and if we suffered we kept quiet about it. no audience would ever know our story. it was the ordinary pities and fears consumed us. we gathered on porches; the moon rose; we were poor. what audience would ever know our story? beyond our windows shone the actual world. we gathered on porches; the moon rose; we were poor. and time went by, drawn by slow horses. somewhere beyond our windows shone the actual world. the great depression had entered our souls like fog. and time went by, drawn by slow horses. we did not ourselves know what the end was. the great depression had entered our souls like fog. we had our flaws, perhaps a few private virtues. but we did not ourselves know what the end was. people like us simply go on. we had our flaws, perhaps a few private virtues, but it is by blind chance only that we escape tragedy. and there is no plot in that; it is devoid of poetry. anonymous submission.

More than half a century ago, the monsoon showers had just brought relief from the sweltering summer, just when i was dreaming of playing soccer whole day outdoors, my dad decided that i have to attend an elementary school. i was dragged a mile by my older brother to my new school, it would be my favorite durga temple converted into a school, my dreams of a class with benches and chairs just vanished, as we were sitting on the floor in open partitioned classrooms of the school. i thought i would get a nice colorful uniform to wear to school, but it looked like that the dress code was a futuristic dream, at least every class had a black board bigger than my slate, the teacher had a duster whereas i had to wipe the chalk with my hand. the fear of some burly kids and nostalgia of home made me sad and homesick, i could not stop crying and asking my teacher to let me go home. i still remember the teacher with big black cane, every time i cried to go home, i got a whack on my palm with his cane, i could not stop crying, he would not stop whacking, till i was sent in a distant corner for breaking the class rule. kneeling down in the corner, i dreamt of mom and home, i found comfort in the memories of joyous durga puja days, i wished the goddess would come alive, and pierce the hands of the teacher with her big spear. finally the tiffin time heralded the temporary recess, the teacher came down and helped me open my tiffin can, he asked me to eat while he wrote something on my slate, he hoped that it would keep me interested in his school.
after i finished my food, he handed my slate, he had drawn a picture of a big smiling cat with whiskers and big tail, he asked me to draw the cat on the other side of the slate, i was so happy drawing the circles and lines whole afternoon, i forgot i had a rough first day in school.

In old school house yard at ruby a dark brown shorthorn cow and leghorn pullets cackling beneath the cypress bough this school must hold good memories and memories live somehow here in their lunch hour children played but where are those children now? . the old school room now a tea room has undergone some change and if past pupil came back here he'd find the place quite strange where is the desk he sat at? the blackboard is not there and time has brought change to ruby as it has done elsewhere. the old school house at ruby a memory of past years here ruby children sang and laughed and shed their fledgeling tears and do those children of ruby who now live far away in dreams return to old school house and ruby childhood day? . the old school house at ruby a memory of the past and time has brought about some change and time bring change too fast this school must hold good memories and memories live somehow here in their lunch hour children played but where are those children now? .
School is fun, school is great, even if your late. in school we do math, we do art, i love that part. in social studies, we have homework buddies. pe is the best, compared to all the rest. during lunch, we will munch, and then drink grape punch. then we play, for thirty minutes of the day.
Before, vick became my name before, sad thoughts set in before, girls started to say no before, entering the party world before, the ps2 craze before, bible girl before, long work days before, the blizzard of 200 before, dvd's made my list before, my other friend before, people started to diss before, poetry was at my best before, cell phones rang before, life became a test before, my loser gang before, memories i started to miss before, days became lonely before all this you knew me from school.
In school, when i saw you i intuited i have found my lost world in you i wish i could act to be appreciated by you in school. in school, it would be too sad to narrate the ordeal i have been through i wonder if its best i had met you in the school. in school, though i had not said it there has been so many ways that i have shown it my actions had done whatever i wanted to say at school. in school, i never thought being in love could take me to madness well, it is better than leaving me in sadness in the school. in school, when i approached you i knew i was silly it was because suddenly, i forgot who i was in school in school, why do you sneer when i am near it really breaks me just tell me what to do to get a room from you in and out of school. in school, sometimes though it is hard i guess i must let go some things i wish to have though good things also could be found elsewhere as it has been in school.
This is it everything that you have gone through is now memories. all of your happy and sad times in high school have now faded. a new life has begun on your own. no more waking up dreading that this day will never get here. now the day is here and your missing everyone before they even walk through these high school doors. every memory is left unsaid. on graduation day everyone cried, i even cried. knowing that i may never get to hang with my friends ever again. hoping they'll be here for my graduation crying with me.
It now is time. i'll have to tell the world. and never did i ever mean to do this. regardless of, what peers today require, i will come out. the girl i love is no one you would know. she is the sweetest, loveliest of all. she walks around as if the world could well ignore her. i am afraid, i tell you with reluctance, that someone bigger, better, smarter comes along. and takes her on his horse to distant fields, she would forget her home, and me the fool from school. what do you think? she loves me and i love her. would all this count enough to seal our pact forever?.
I found an old country cowboy valentine that was made so very long ago. it was signed at the bottom in crayon by a young boy who's name was, buffalo joe. you could tell it was all hand made some of the glitter and bangles have fallen off. colored with bright colors so neatly better than any in a store, one could have bought. tried to picture the face that made it tried as hard as i could ever do. but for as hard as i had tried to remember i couldn't grasp that vision of you. those were the days of less worries and a childs heart now just memories. 'will ya be my valentines partner? ' in that valentines card you made for me.
Our evergreen school days will not come back again from the nursery to high school we learnt the best and the best that taught by our teachers our school life was full of cheers and lived with full of mischievous but the discipline was maintained well we sang and danced without thinking of our future. we spent money without earned them when the school start after the vacation we meet our friends happily and welcomed new friends dearly we played all the games and we won many games with out care of sun or rain many years have been gone today we live different parts of the world but the memories of our school days will live in our hearts as ever green days.
The old school gate still stands here though the school has long since gone, it stands amongst the hedgerow now and opens for no one, the school gate leads to nowhere no one passes through it now, and it remains so firmly shut yet it survived somehow. although its frame is rusting well and crumbling away, it stands there as a symbol of a long forgotten day, a small estate of houses where the classrooms used to be, the playground too has vanished now it breaks my heart to see. so many times i'd waited here so many times passed through, i close my eyes and can recall the times that i once knew, the parting and the welcoming i held my mother's hand, beside this gate in front of me that can now barely stand. so sad to see it in this state so many years gone by, yet while it lasts my dreams survive and memories will not die, the faces of the teachers and the faces of my friends, the sight of children playing there yet here is where it ends.
It was a remote village, a school teacher single, with boys of assorted age, had to manage and tackle. 'boys, inspector, any time, to inspect the school, is expected to come, be smart, ready and cool.' 'he may, perhaps, ask you, the shape of the world, my snuff box, all of you see how it is round.' 'i'll keep it on my table, for your remembrance here, one of you should be able to answer, have no fear.' suddenly on a sunday, knowing it was a holiday, he came to inspect, on his way to his own village nearby. the teacher rang the bell. the boys were puzzled. it was short of a hell, to have them assembled. boys with unkempt hair, boys with soiled dress, boys with faces poor, took their seats in the class. the teacher in a hurry, kept a square snuff box, and was feeling sorry, to miss his round box. the boys, as expected, heard the same query with their hands raised, kept the answer ready. up one of them stood, and promptly he said, 'square on all sundays and round on other days. '.

If only you knew how much i love you if only you cared that i was alive but theres no way you would care if you knew because you don't feel near the same as i for you my love will never be shown because you won't like me for i am sure mt heart thirst for my love for you be shown but broken will it be for ever more if only you knew my love so deep my heart wouldnt ache for your love i wouldn't have to cry myself to sleep if only i could get help from above if only you knew how much i cared you might love me back but i am too scared.
It's the final day as we all take photographs and say goodbye; a thought goes through my mind. i may never see any of you again. i don't want to let go of the many memories we have made. yet i know that will not happen as the memories we have created have been engraved on my heart and left a deep impression in my mind. your kindness and caring attitude has been an inspiration and so have you, and i look forward to the future where in some distant lifetime we will meet again and relive the old times and the old memories. this is what makes me cherish the true friends i have now.
Executioner happy to explain how his wristwatch works as he shadows me on the street. i call him that because he is grim and officious and wears black. the clock on the church tower had stopped at five to eleven. the morning newspapers had no date. the gray building on the corner could've been a state pen, and then he showed up with his watch, whose gothic numerals and the absence of hands he wanted me to understand right then and there.
He made a line on the blackboard, one bold stroke from right to left diagonally downward and stood back to ask, looking as always at no one in particular, "what have i done?" from the back of the room freddie shouted, "you've broken a piece of chalk." m. degas did not smile. "what have i done?" he repeated. the most intellectual students looked down to study their desks except for gertrude bimmler, who raised her hand before she spoke. "m. degas, you have created the hypotenuse of an isosceles triangle." degas mused. everyone knew that gertrude could not be incorrect. "it is possible," louis warshowsky added precisely, "that you have begun to represent the roof of a barn." i remember that it was exactly twenty minutes past eleven, and i thought at worst this would go on another forty minutes. it was early april, the snow had all but melted on the playgrounds, the elms and maples bordering the cracked walks shivered in the new winds, and i believed that before i knew it i'd be swaggering to the candy store for a milky way. m. degas pursed his lips, and the room stilled until the long hand of the clock moved to twenty one as though in complicity with gertrude, who added confidently, "you've begun to separate the dark from the dark." i looked back for help, but now the trees bucked and quaked, and i knew this could go on forever.

Up at my school everyone is different yet we are treated like an equal everyone is always smiling or laughing so hard they start to cry that's my school a lot of people go through my school home of the blue jays to cool for school standing tall upon the hill behind all the trees stands the blue jay's school yup, that's my school each person is unique form the clothes to the hair to their personality each person is free to express themselves and be who they want that's my school whs blue jay pride that's something that can never be beat and something that we can't hide friends come and go but one thing will live on the pride we had for our team just like my school did no matter where i go or how far i leave town i'll always be proud to say whs in washmo is my school.
The freshman girl, oh, so shy, sits and watches the sophomore guy, the sophomore guy, his head in a whirl, sits and watches the junior girl, the junior girl, in her red sadan, sits and watches the senior man, but the senior man so hot and wild, secretly loves the freshman child.
It was expected to belong. a boy who has his sights aimed high, who aims to make his parents proud, will show respectability and rise above the common folks. it was the driving force that made me join the choir, a voice of mediocre quality would not disgrace the school as it was mixed into the crowd of screaming baritones, of pubescent basses and the lone and rather spindly looking pallor who, as a rarity, was an essential tenor. when teenage vocal cords perform, there is an awe that settles in the hall, or auditorium, it clings to dusty walls and rests among the cobwebs of the past. and hearts pick up their happy beat as if to shout about their sheer invincibility, each ear, as it partakes the sum of all, of loud, angelic voices oh, so pure, claims ownership of the collage of tones impressed and stirred to greater deeds, while restless eyes now roam, subdued search rows of colleagues in the amber light until they find that pair of mellow molecules, look back into the innocence of all, and tiny promises now sing a melody.
My teacher asks me to study get up early every morning time table for each day plan your things as it says as my school reopened new books and a clean slate books covered and labeled white cloth and chalk for the slate how neatly i wrote my name drew a picture in the front page wanted it to remain the same never teared a single page i was studious had an aim colourful marks i scored in test with friends we played few games in every game we were the best then as the days go by started to tear pages from the books then said the books a brief bye bye dog ears in all my books pages used for a million other things paper rockets to fly at friends wrote the names on their wings painted red at the rocket ends played in water on rainy days plastic shoes and pink raincoats prayed for fever on test days in water sailed paper boats now its time for the big exams no more playgrounds and fun days back to books to clear exams once again early rise each day.

'tis sad to think that many with power abuse it those with power who abuse it weak not strong there is nothing wrong with having power in the first place it is the abuse of it that is all wrong for the abuse of power leads to serious crimes against the powerless though power in good hands it is quite okay and good people with power never do abuse it they use it in the most constructive way some people with power are quite benign people and philanthropic one of them can say but those who abuse their power to the law may never answer though to karma there's a price they have to pay the abuse of power leads to dictatorial regimes that leads to serious crimes against humanity in the despicable crimes against women and children the wrongs of power gone wrong for all to see the people who abuse their power should never have it though to their power they desperately do cling power in the right hands an adavantage to others and power in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing there is nothing wrong with power from once 'tis used well but some with power they do abuse their rule and some with power they can become quite nasty and derive pleasure out of being cruel but power in the right hands can be a blessing and kind people with power their praise we ought sing since they have the gift of empathy within them and happiness to others they do bring.

There is a power in taking but more power in giving there is a power in revenge but more power in forgiving there is a power in destroying but more power in letting something live there is a power in denying our true age but more power in showing that we've lived.
Pain is the feeling you endure when you are alone, it is great torture when you have no friends at all pain is the feeling you endure when you break a bone, you endure great humiliation and pain when you slip and fall however, you possess the spirit to get back on your feet, even if the path in front of you becomes too rough there will be friends along the path that you will meet, that will help make you become strong and tough also, they will help cure you when you are sick, they will be friends with you through thick and thin and they will never think about playing a mean joke nor trick, your friends will be as close to you as your own kin now i know i cannot quit during the fight, because i know my friends will help me see the light.
Three or four repetitions of a mental picture of the location as i walk toward a building from a parking lot, and i'll remember, later, where i've parked my car. it's taking considerably longer to remember where i've parked my soul.
To have power over others is something one does not need for tis only by good example that one can ever lead and many with power over others their power they do abuse and for those who abuse others there cannot be an excuse. if you wish to be a leader some sort of form of power you crave and what it takes to be a great leader is to be understanding kind and brave but leaders with such qualities to say the least seem rare to some very ordinary people they do favourably compare. for to have power over others a good person does not desire and many power hungry people are those we should not admire power over others and personal power are different from night and day we all do need some personal power for to serve survival's way. to have power over others is something one can do without and on those who desire such powers one has to cast some doubt they seem to be control freaks with darkness of the soul the lives of other people they do need to control.
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway? to make me give the lie to my true sight, and swear that brightness doth not grace the day? whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill that, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds? who taught thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate? o, though i love what others do abhor, with others thou shouldst not abhor my state. if thy unworthiness raised love in me, more worthy i to be beloved of thee.
They've got a libdo and a desire that can't be controled they've got the power to sex you in the shower and they always score no one can ever keep these rangers down the power of love sweet love is on their side oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers mighty horny power rangers they love to take their dates hard into their hands they know to always use condoms and practice safe sex no one can ever keep these rangers down the power of love sweet love is on their side oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh you mighty horny power rangers no one can ever keep these rangers down the power of love sweet love is on their side oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh you mighty horny power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers oh oh power rangers.
A bad habit they form as a young girl or boy to have power over others some people enjoy with personal power some are not satisfied their desire for top job they don't try for to hide they need more than personal power to be seen to succeed it is all about money and all about greed one might say they do have big egos to feed the more money they have the more they seem to need power and money are siblings it does seem that way and money speaks every language some are known to say the non greedy and non power hungry people one has to admire the lust for large sums of money or power over others they never desire they are not the type for to put others down or wish to be known as the best in the town.
You pray a lot and take pride that your prayers are granted and you pray some more like a monk like a priest, sometimes i think about prayerful dogs, what if their prayers are granted too bones and more bones would surely rain from the heavenly skies. oh yes, i pray, but if my prayers are not granted, i still know that god loves me he thinks my wants are not the best for me, and he reserves the rest. that really suits me best.
To have the right to dream and to follow it each day until some tiny part of it is you in every way gives zest to all of living and lets you dream some more 'til at last you are near heaven's gate as your thoughts lift up and soar. this, then, the freedom that i seek for you and all mankind the spark of real achievement capturing heart and soul and mind. to strike off lingering chains of doubt look out on a new day where freedom holds you to a task that asks your best in every way.
How the time passes by. we are unable to arrest it. how quick the people are leaving this world. we are unable to prolong our existence on this land. we therefore should not take it away as we are approaching to the end of the twentieth century. many nations of this world are racing to build their armaments. why are they doing it? to destroy this land with the people living on it. can we be proud having an atom bomb. those who have it are announcing to the world their power. without thinking of a mistake and dimensions of destruction. how funds are melting away to build them and be tested. these funds can be used for the hungry masses, to feel them and fertilize our land to make it richer. a multitude of people would be satisfied they would be happy and enormously grateful maybe that day will come. that we will together save the nature and masses of people. the bomb once thrown carries only death and destruction everything would be reduced to ashes. all living things would die, even trees. to the ones alive a bird would not sing because of the nuclear experiments people are becoming poorer lets give some thought how to conquer that evil. lets look differently on nature and perceive its beauty. this world is indeed charming, india is a mysterious and curious country. is the atom bomb for them a paradise? among the other countries it brought indignation, is it worth to change your own country into hate? atom bond will not solve problems and feed people why not anybody is thinking about it, lets use the atom for peaceful purposes lets leave the decisions to the highly developed countries, how to save the land from being fed with poison, how to fertilize, so that the masses will not be hungry, also war, but not nuclear, must be proclaimed to the element of nature. not necessarily atom weapons for destruction. it is being done with perfectionism by cataclysm, that is the real enemy of people.
we must learn hot to strive to subdue it, then we will not be the perpetrators of exterminating this beautiful globe, as is our mother earth.
When you look at your life with your trophy wife do you feel fulfilled? in your comfort zone are you bored to the bone? has your spirit been killed? do you dance in the rain? do you feel the pain that makes you know you're alive? all things work to a plan you're a corporate man for wealth and power you strive. your materialist god has an iron ruling rod no room for free thought. in the brave new world your flag is unfurled your status you've bought. all the things that you've promised have you really been honest? people's lives are your tools. and when you are wrong you then sing a new song i think 'who are the fools? ' have you ever been loved? is your handshake steel gloved? can you really unwind? have you drank to excess? is your true happiness in your business like mind? a blip in the market turns your mood very dark, it puts your nose out of joint. who do you want to be? all the best things are free you're missing the point.
Connected to god, in tune with nature, heartfelt passions spoken in a line. what better place to find serenity than in the prayer of a poet online. gathered in unity, divided in style; souls searching for perfect peace touching lives by a timely rhyme giving solace and pain's release. seeking an emissary to heaven's throne? to whisper entreaties to angels there; no better place to reach god's ear than through the power of a poet's prayer.
From them only negative stuff we do hear they tell us who to trust and tell us who to fear we want to believe the lies to us they tell they promise utopia and give us earthly hell. we want to believe every word that they say and for to cling to power they create us and they we help to create our own reality the blind in the light of day never do see. their pre election promises they never do keep we give them our power and we follow like sheep they tell us who to fear and them we believe and they laugh behind our backs and us they deceive. through false patriotism to power they do cling and the praises of war heroes they gladly do sing they cling on to power and they cheat and they lie whilst in the wars they created the innocents die.
The power of truth is in the belief the power of love in the heart the power of faith is felt in the mind with every member of your being a part yet the power of change is hard to adjust because temptation is so hopelessly strong while the power of right is substantially hard you must overcome the power of wrong but the power in you is much greater than all in you, his power is born so when the unfairness of life takes your power away remember to whom the power belongs.
The lust for power is an addiction the government their own praises do sing and rubbish their main opposition as to government they try to cling the voters bombarded with propaganda right up until election day the true fact of all politicians is they seldom do mean what they say the winners take all of the glory and the winners they do celebrate the prize it is great and worth lying for that's how they feel those who wish to rule the state the lust for power is an addiction and not a harmless addiction 'twould seem without such power some people feel worthless and suffer of low self esteem some people become so power hungry that power to their egos is fuel they feel it is their right to govern that they have been born to rule the opposition as bad as the government they too want power in the worst way any respect to their political opponents they have no desire for to pay it is all about power and their egos power to them is the best thing of all their pride to them is all that matter though pride it can come before a fall.
The sea invades the coastal cliffs, battling against its stalwart stone, devouring its surface bit by bit, and leaving it gullible and prone. the rocks hit back with warlike will, facing the churning water's rage, with ceaseless power, the ocean spars, and tries, at all times to upstage. so firm and strong the crags were formed, and tough and sheer its rock face stands, but slow erosion there will always be, as the bluff gives way to the deep's demands.
When a tiny melody catches your breath and wonderful lyrics impound your brain the clarity of a voice stirs your heart you know you've finally come home a climbing spirit bursts through the clouds sharing emotions without constraint turning the key that opens the chambers making you believe again the combination touches your soul you feel, you explode, you're soaring high how does this wonderful journey affect you so, make you live? a rare gift stirs the senses so absolutely a beautiful breeze to make you fly this my friends is how it feels it always amazes me, this ride.
They say her words were like balloons with strings i could not hold, that her love was something in a shop cheap and far too quickly sold; but the tree does not price its apples nor the sun its selling power the rain does not gossip or speak of where it goes.
The lust for power and money to corruption lead and some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed and big corporations do not have a soul the avarice that afflicts them their thinking control. the distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair and thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay. to be born of poor parents is their only crime and they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime in refugee camps they are forced to reside in a land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed. 'tis true power can be a corruptible thing of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing why laud people who have far more than enough when millions are homeless and have to sleep rough. the lust for power seems to be thriving of late and only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair in a world where empathy and compassion are rare.

Seeking the healing power of sleep, i find no respite in my dreams. sinking into slumber deep, it's not so restful as it seems. agony's relived time and again, magnified by the helplessness i feel in my dreams and then i mourn lost love and happiness i find more relief in time than sleep, although i still relive my loss, i feel the pain less acutely, still there, but not as it once was.
One second might not tell when held against an hour one hour might not count when weighed against a day one day may not matter when considering a life one word may mean little from the conversation whole one line may not be missed when stricken from the book one thought may be dismissed in comprehension of the mind one flaw might be overlooked when evaluating character one mistake means little when summing up a man one sin may be forgiven in the judgement of a soul so how is it a single glance can make one wither so?.
I never turned anyone into a pig. some people are pigs; i make them look like pigs. i'm sick of your world that lets the outside disguise the inside. your men weren't bad men; undisciplined life did that to them. as pigs, under the care of me and my ladies, they sweetened right up. then i reversed the spell, showing you my goodness as well as my power. i saw we could be happy here, as men and women are when their needs are simple. in the same breath, i foresaw your departure, your men with my help braving the crying and pounding sea. you think a few tears upset me? my friend, every sorceress is a pragmatist at heart; nobody sees essence who can't face limitation. if i wanted only to hold you i could hold you prisoner.
A word is capable of anything it is capable of changing enemies into friends. it is capable of penetrating the impenetrable. it is capable of changing the impossibility into possibilities. it is capable of uniting man and woman into husband and wife. it is capable of changing the atheist into christian. it is capable of changing illiterate into professional. it is capable of changing political crisis into independence. beginning today let us not just utter words but live by them, let your words be sweet and caring to all those around you. because we never know how far reaching something we may think, say or do today will affect the lives of millions tomorrow.
U fooled me u cheated on me u let me go u made me cry u forced me to believe your lies u tried to control me u betrayed me u did not love me u never knew me u never understood me even you have never ever tried finally, simply u left me but now all i can say is i love you because this is something i have no power upon to and i just cannot stop thinking about you because this is not something i usually do.
The little power we have to others we give away they rule our lives for us we go by what they say the media they control and only lies from them we hear they warn of terrorists and terrorism and fill our hearts with fear of people we do not know or may never even meet they even have us looking out for terrorists as we walk down the street each stranger that we meet we look on with mistrust though they may be kind of heart and they may be good and just. they are our enemy yet we see them as a friend for their political survival on our fears they do depend and those we see as our enemy their leaders are the same they instill in them a fear of us they too play the political power game. we are ruled by self centred men and us they do deceive when they tell us who to fear them we want to believe they create us and they and to conquer they divide and tell us with a smirk we have god on our side. to lie to cling to power to them is not a sin some call it propaganda and others call it spin and when our so called enemy civilians die in a bombing raid collateral damage is what they say is it right that loss of human life be dismissed in such a way? the little power we have to ourselves we never keep to the power hungry we give it away we value it as cheap they lubricate our fears to insure they cling to power in a garden full of noxious weeds you may not find a flower.
The lonliness of the night, is matched by the emptiness of my bed. the emptiness of my heart, is equalled by the absence of hope. the absence of a future, is akin to the depth of my need. the depth of my memories, is beaten only by the heat of the sun.
Come lets kiss and rejoice you.. in my ingenuity, and me, in your feeble ability to forgive such deviltry, as mine come lets play blindfolded you.. will still envision joy and me apathetic, oblivious to the tears turning red blood as wine come lets wear deaf plugs you.. can then sing along with my loud booming rythym..all the while as the moans of tattered, torn, children.. .die. just sad. marriot; islamabad; pakistan..the question is no longer why.
A poet loses his power for poetry a poet loses his power for poetry he can put down words but they no longer have poetry in them something of the feeling of what real poetry is is gone. he strives he writes again and again he puts words down in the forms and in the shapes his poems usually take but he has no poetry in him he has lost what he is and all he can do is strive again and again word after word silence after silence to hear within himself again a voice he does not have. the poet is writing poetry and it is not poetry the poet is dead and he is pretending to be alive is this a poem? is he a poet is he dead? is he alive?.
The angels promised to stay on guard. and that they did. mom realized that i was her little miracle. when i look back i realize she made a conscious decision to love, protect, and direct. and that she did. all through life she has been my greatest fan. she's been my advisor. she's been my close friend. if i had a chance to choose a mother i would choose her again and again. there's so much i plan to do for her as a token of my love and appreciation. the little things i've done for her sometimes cause her to say.. 'thank god he kept you safe within my womb.' i'm thankful too. i'm thankful she's my mom. one day in january i was born held and nourished by a lovely soul. i am because she is.
January is a new month a new start for me to learn new things to learn to let go of my anger and open up my heart and to listen to what my heart is saying it is waking up from a long painful journey of last summer i love you all the time sunsets january thanks god you are mild because i hate the cold.
On our china anniversary love goes on under the sun; from paper to crystal that has ended another new one has just begun. twenty years of living together is not a walk in the park; at times the days are sunny, sometimes the clouds are dark. but by god's loving hand we've ventured into the rough sea; able to climb the highest hill, striving hard toward victory. we've stood against all odds, braving the wind of changes; we've remained firm and steadfast, making all the right choices. as long as we have each other, we do hope for the silver's dawn; praying not only for the gold but also for the dazzling diamond. the pages of the next chapter are willed by the father's hand; a new episode shall be written till we reach the promised land. our love for one another shall achieve the higher degree; it will grow all the more on our china anniversary.
May your year be full of joy; may laughter fill your days; may morning's light bring fresh delight expelling dreary haze; may friends and loved ones ever buoy a heart weighed down by strife; and may serenity alight from the simple things in life.
It is january 1997. and so far. it has been far from heaven the skies has been dark shades of blue and gray. as i bend my knees to pray. the weather has been cold and wet. as i sat in my room and wept. as i wish to witness to see a heaven sent angel. i tried to remain stable. i strolled through the peaceful cemetery. searching for sanctuary. as i perched my depressed infested body. against an ice cold tombstone. covered with time and age. i see my life on the darkest stage. i only wish the unhappiness away. i only long to write the next play. of life that will bring hope. and colorful dreams in cinemascope.
Nothing extends a phone call more effectively than saying you're on your way out but she wants to tell you the five things she requires in a man one is intelligence he must have a brain also he must be good a term she likes because it embraces both the opposite of evil and "good in bed" and you admire the way she skillfully maneuvered the conversation to the sex lives of jazz fans who live in the village and the enduring validity of the cyrano story and so well you wish you didn't have to go.
It's one of those rare winter nights when it's not freezing cold but crazy windy weather rain poured down the whole day long lightning flashed in the sky and there is a sense of danger yes this weather really scares me i feel my heart beat faster and i long for peace and calm yet it is winter, it's to be expected the temperature is dropping like crazy and i know winter is purple pink and violet.
Sometimes at night i hear small birds lament. dark notes that seem to second moon's descent. cold is the color of a deep regret, an etude perfected by winterset. the world was music and it turned us round. stirred by the subtle atmospheric sound, you gently sketched a snowflake on my face which shall be mine till light has left this place. such solace has the power to outlast time, to lock a small bird's elegy in rhyme. somewhere beyond the january mist, the magic of our landscape still exists. copyright,2008, sandra fowler.
With numbing cold, biting at my brittle bones i feel many years giving me a wake up shake gripping my coat through the more gripping cold i feel the world has grown old. january i cried for my mom the first time she probably cried and then smiled for my tears she surely is yet smiling for my thoughts through these years for the tears that she shed were at giving me birth january is the warmest time on earth.
It was a dark night, full of fights, as if the sun will never rise the bullets were passing beside me, but i couldn't realize all the people were afraid, , i was trying to resist anywise the voice of freedom rose high in the souls of the arise the life of the oppressors, was walking anticlockwise the voice of injustice blinked away, like its form analyse the devil thought and thought, 'how could i make a plan, to stop that voice, to regain everything without complain' the birds began to sing, voice of freedom returned again to prevail the happiness again, , to resist suffering pain. the sun which we thought that it will never rise again. it rose to remove steps of a man made it without vain. the sun will keep rising and rising every day, , to bloom the flowers, to remember us, how is that light, was thanks to god and martyrs.
When the time keeps passing and the world goes round and the sea is crashing at the cliffs and the sounds erupting as the seabirds cry, you can watch the river as the time goes by and it's like it's holy and it can be hell and you feel so lonely and you fear the smell of the guns that fire then you see the light of a rainbow dawning and you realise that the river's flowing as the time goes by and you met the people and you knew them well and you said you loved them and you rang the bell in the tree of life you watched them grow and the world is turning as the river flows the earth smells good and the sky turns gold when the birds are singing and you bless the old you can kiss your woman and it feels so right as you touch the river as the time goes by as you stand barefoot upon the morning shore and you feel the centuries of death and war and the wind is biting and it tears your skin and the river's flowing where its always been and the river washes and the river's clean and the soul remembers where the river's been as you watch it tumble and you watch it flow your life's a river now you know, now you know your life's a river now you know.
Forbidden waters makes one weak a drowning man knows no peace flooding river winding down like a warden grants no release flooding river gonna take my home leave me naked and alone mean old river so unkind shows no mercy leaves nothin' behind.
Where'er the sweetest river flows i long that land to be my home, where i shall walk with my true love amongst the hills of green, and there above the sun will shine within the skies of deepest blue, and i shall never leave that place of beauty so serene. where we shall walk together through the finest meadows hand in hand, then stop to pick some daisies as we rest beneath a tree, and listen to the birds that sing within the boughs that cast their shade, and there we'll stay till evening falls and kiss so tenderly. we'll stop to watch the stars appear to share the silence of the night, then make a wish for love to last so we shall never part, we'll see the dawn then rise again above the hills that stand before, to light the way for us to go and joy shall fill my heart. where'er the sweetest river flows with waters pure i'll drink for thee, where blossom forms and flowers bloom and spring shall never end, each day we live so filled with joy but i know soon i shall awake, till then i'll rest within my dreams with you my precious friend.
I have to go back to long ago back accross misty rivers memories of so past lives to dawn on me so the way to live from the blood all do know cowling towns folk shall see into there souls with a whisper a sound misty rooms sweet scent maidend gown from he no protection could so be found very survive yon lore of past cought up in the mythes none may so pass for me to live some had to die thats why its called the river of blood.
The river does not walk on its journey struggling to get to its destination because it takes its step in a direction that has been destined for it. so my brother, like the river you would continue to flow in this life without any struggle till you reach wherever you want to end this journey of yours. did you ever see the tree attempting to end where its height should end on its journey towards the blue skies above? that is the way you would grow in life as nothing would cut short whatever height you wish to attain in life, my brother.
There is a river we all must cross, thousands will pass it tomorrow; some will go down to its waters with joy, others with anguish and sorrow. some will be welcom'd by angel bands, coming from over the river; others be borne by the current adown, where there is none to deliver. these shall land safely in eden's bow'rs, wearing the white robes of pardon; those shall be cast on a desolate shore, far from the gates of the garden. these shall have voices to join the song ever from eden ascending; those shall unite in the wailings of woe woe, that hath never an ending. over the river we all must cross, jesus may call us tomorrow; shall we go down to its waters with joy? shall we with anguish and sorrow?.
Today i met a woman who died four years ago she spoke to me for hours as though she knew my soul she took me by the hand led me along a stream where trout swam in sparkling waters under clear crystalline skies this woman shared the magic of years of circumspect living and artfully crafted writing precisely gem set words she dwells now in brightness i could but pause and glimpse through my own dark glass her poems the only light in memory of kathleen raine.
The rivers edge becomes a pledge rapids, riptides, undertows i'm diving in and letting go i'm diving in with all my sins i've gone down deep i'm thankful that i took the leap painful, purges, purity washed away entirely thankful of the lord's decree the river now runs through me.
In a dream i returned to the river of bees five orange trees by the bridge and beside two mills my house into whose courtyard a blind man followed the goats and stood singing of what was older soon it will be fifteen years he was old he will have fallen into his eyes i took my eyes a long way to the calenders room after room asking how shall i live one of the ends is made of streets one man processions carry through it empty bottles their images of hope it was offered to me by name once once and once in the same city i was born asking what shall i say he will have fallen into his mouth men think they are better than grass i return to his voice rising like a forkful of hay he was old he is not real nothing is real nor the noise of death drawing water we are the echo of the future on the door it says what to do to survive but we were not born to survive only to live.
Beside the raging river rhyme poetry florets flower with prose. scripted sweet petals grow and entwine english gardens of fragrant rose. immortalized in pantomime, the sonnet's nuance smell, intertwines with ivy vines and comely cockleshell. flowing water of endless words gather and come hither. make known your message meaningful before the blossoms wither.
I was a young man my trade was a deck hand my first love the clipper the old rosalea we sailed from the old town down by the river to bombay and shanghai we traded for tea i met a young girl down by the river she said we could marry and live on a farm i told her i'm sorry my heart's with another we kissed as we watched the sun o'er the yard arm i know when my time comes and i meet my maker i'll have no regrets i'll be happy he'll see for i'll have my ashes cast out on the river that i once supported and now supports me.
The broad river flows fierce than an ocean. in front of the longest bridge both of us at the two ends and the sign board says not allowed for pedestrians and only for heavy vehicles. our fruition is fruitless and how long we have to stand like this? forget the racism my sweetheart who made us with the same clay? we break this primitive fundamental bridge, jump to the river and swim upstream.
I watch the river flowing down towards the deep blue sea, at the end of its winding path i know you wait for me, like the mountains and the valleys and the sun up in the sky, my love for you will shine eternally and never die. for the river is the spirit that puts life into my heart, and tells me you are with me all the times we are apart, for its beauty and its splendour, its wonder and its grace, will be with me forever on this journey that i face. like the colours of the sunrise and the coming of the spring, i gaze upon this paradise and hear the birds that sing, so sweetly in the treetops while i know that far away, my home is where my heart lies where i long to be this day. for the river keeps on flowing and is acting as my guide, and leads me ever onward to the place i shall abide, hope shall live eternally and never will be gone, i know that while this river flows i'll always carry on. i pray that god will steer me through the rocks that lay ahead, and all the troubled water to a calmer place instead, where there is only sunshine and a sky so clear and blue, i know the path i follow now will lead me back to you. for the river is the reason why i need you evermore, it heads towards the place i knew so many years before, and although things may have changed i won't regret i came, for you are all i care for and i hope you feel the same.
The river led me to you though the way was hard and long, it saw me through adversity and taught me to be strong, for when the doubts beset me that you would be waiting there, at the river's end i saw you and it kept me from despair. for the river kept on flowing and its water made me brave, when i was weak and fading such encouragement it gave, following its winding path around each and every bend, until i found you waiting for me at my journey's end. i saw you in the distance there and i began to run, my weariness deserted me like life had just begun, and you stood there so lonely hoping that i would return, our loving eyes did meet again with passion that did burn. for the river kept us company when we were so alone, and we found such comfort there in every rock and stone, with waters pure we both did drink that kept us both alive, and led us to each other through the pain we had to strive. and when i held you once again it felt like yesterday, that we two were parted and we both then lost our way, but in my dreams you lingered for i never could forget, every time i heard your name i just got so upset. for the river was the lifeblood and all that i did need, to give me the courage and the power to succeed, and yet although i stumbled and so many times did fall, our love did hold the answer for our love did conquer all.
The current of time's river will carry off all human deeds and sink into oblivion all peoples, kingdoms and their kings. and if there's something that remains through sounds of horn and lyre, it too will disappear into the maw of time and not avoid the common fate.
There is a hill ahead, and death is behind the hill; i urge the horses onward, onward. there is a river here; always, there is a river just when death scents victory. white current seethes about black rocks; how fair the meadow is, after crossing the water.
Time is not a river nor a ticking clock nor an hourglass we cannot save time we cannot spend time we cannot borrow time we cannot buy time we cannot cheat time time is not a gift time is not our friend nor our enemy time is not on our side time is not ours in any sense save for the single second that holds our full attention then slips forever beyond grasp.
Upon the shaded river bank where willows weep on water's edge, and drape the sympathetic shore that to my heart shall yield, some comfort as i sit and rest and gaze across the surface calm a mirror of the august sky and pray my wounds be healed. i listen as the birds do sing upon the boughs that gently move, within the breeze that softly calls her sweet name unto me, a breath so warm with tender touch that melts the chill of lonely days, but yet i know she'll never come to end my misery. upon the shaded river bank my only thoughts to be with her, and so these tears shall never dry until i find relief, the graceful swan who swims alone and so forlornly bows her head, as she does search in vain for love i too now share her grief.
I was your lover long ago, sweet june, ere life grew hard; i am your lover still, and follow gladly to the wondrous tune you pipe on golden reeds to vale and hill. i am your lover still; to me you seem to hold the fragrance of the joys long dead, the brightness and the beauty of the dream we dreamed in youth, to hold the tears we shed, the laughter of our lips, the faith that lies back in that season dear to every heart, life's springtime, when god's earth and god's blue skies are, measured by our glance, not far apart.
I am so excited that once again it is june when the sun is bright and the birds all sing in tune winter is finally gone so no more shoveling of the snow now there are hedges to trim and also grass to mow, just think, no more slipping or freezing or falling upon the ice but, though now we must worry about the mosquitoes and the lice in my youth and in my past i once loved the snow and the cold changes though will come, as with seasons and i am getting old, the flowers they are awakening from their summer sleep we now again have gardens to tend to and also yards to keep we can now go off to the park and then off to visit the zoo at night in the yard we could light marshmallows or have a barbecue, it is the best month for parties and birthdays and marriages so in june you had better be prepared to see baby carriages and out in the yard and parks the children are eager to play only thing better than a june night, it is of course a june day, children can chase and catch lightning bugs late at night while we all can sit around the yard with only a porch light winter was long and cold and finally here comes june it again came right on time, not to late and never too soon. randy l. mcclave.
The tiny breeding frogs are singing in the roadside drain and the magpie he pipes in the wind and the rain and as shades of darkness roll across the sky the foxes are barking on the hill nearby in the chilly gloam of a gray winter's day the grey roos in the scrub they box as they play and the calls of the birds known to some as weerloo the big birds known to most as yellow tail black cockatoo, a chilly evening in june ten weeks from the spring but the grey backed magpie is not shy to sing, with it the gray fog carries a silent chill as it slowly creeps across the old stony hill, on a chilly evening not cold enough to snow harsh is the caw of the dark homing crow.
Who thinks of june's first rose today? only some child, perhaps, with shining eyes and rough bright hair will reach it down. in a green sunny lane, to us almost as far away as are the fearless stars from these veiled lamps of town. what's little june to a great broken world with eyes gone dim from too much looking on the face of grief, the face of dread? or what's the broken world to june and him of the small eager hand, the shining eyes, the rough bright head?.
.violet in june a violet caught i in repose upon a sunbathed bank. her head was bowed. do you suppose it was from life she shrank? she seemed so wilted in despair; no tear was in her eye. she languished in the torrid air and seemed resigned to die. oh little violet, you have bloomed when others fail the task; amid the hardships that have loomed there is no more we ask. although a breeze of furnace heat has robbed you of your tear, your destiny is not complete, put off your shrinking fear. oh little violet, lift your eyes above the world, up to the sun; fear not, for when the daylight dies another dew will come.
There are days in june that seem to be december. thus sometimes the substance of this room or more accurately the people in it who pray silently start up in the midst of happiness and alter, bewitched by a murmur from the calm foliage. our hearts are shifting as the winds changing, pliable as gold. see this windless sail, motionless? almost before one feels the subtle breeze, it stirs up and slips away.
Vultures meander on their bikes the gas station lights flicker i walk with quickened pace and brawn to escape their rapacious tongs' that glimmer obscenities chew centurion words bayonet looks from across the river on asphalt roads of distant concrete i escape to be their dinner.
Your memory is pushed back in my mind always getting covered with here and now. pushed back so far, where are you going? you were supposed to stay, to lay with me through night and day. you told me as i sat crying, you dying, lying in front of my face. the clock is racing around so slowly and you're going, going, gone. the con of it all you took my heart, it's mounted on a stone and i'm all alone. one second, two seconds, three seconds more, one memory is lost when the clock hits four. for so long now i have only waited, hated the thought that i can't find anyone better then you. you were perfect, i'm a wreck, your lips on my neck, a memory cold as ice. i roll the dice. isn't it true that love is like gambling? if you could have gambled for your life, would you have? to die fast and painless or be with me forever, for so long? time running, life cunning my every thought of you. i feel like i'm falling, crawling to get out of the huge hole that we both made to trap ourselves away from the world. now it's nothing and you left me here deal, i feel the pain, the strain, my whole body's trying to recover from your absence. and yet i still find myself crying, dying, lying, that you are still here with me. but you're not.
They wallowed for a stricken minute more in the blood and mud helpless they tried to stand, gagging hauled by their wrists crawling to dry sand these were the chosen for the day staggering from the killing ground to the small pond of human excretion they flopped and rubbed hands slashing the filth from their chins scrubbing it from knees and elbows they sat another minute their hands and faces dripping nothing stirred but the stench of death they knew it was their last minute, an eerie requiem went up as their skin peeled off so easily from their bone heaped now as one the howling souls turned into vapor the resident stench remained it was common the beast slept well this night as the pile was the highest yet.
daylight came too quickly the stream of condemned shooed from their pens moving slowly, almost reluctantly they stared with a sad look of relief as calm after a long journey no one could stop the babies from crying, they would be first the killing ground was silent nothing could be seen between the herd it was very dark inside between the snortings and stompings the hot breath slapped their faces in their nostrils was an odor rank and fierce and primal suddenly with a rumble and a roar the screaming agony of death tumbling backward, barking chins, dropping heads piles upon piles tripping against each other down they fell like leaves in wintry weather to rest beyond the gate as more would come peering out from the small opening in their pens their eyes blinking, sunken, adjusting to light the pile became unglued the rest remained lined up against the fence they were next they embraced the wires like long lost friends stammering and swaying, falling and crawling the horde torn down, weak with relief a faint prayer heard in hebrew they put their back to the fencepost hands held out slowly, dubiously they came making a magic ring of prayer then closed it tight, heads bowed they closed their eyes bracing and embracing each other they bumped cheeks and noses gently touching faces a minute passed deaf, blind, starving, dieing they joined in hope and fear the warm fur of their humanity they stood guard over their last minute only a minute created together a red raw sun chinned on the horizon a new day dazzled for the beast.
June sings for me, a song of a rain cloud, which has lost its way in a desert storm, haunted and chased by the conspiring rays of of a burnt up sun but found its way back to a green hill to sing again a song for me. june 11,2009.
I realized today that winter would not exist without you, father. in a world where death is confused with life, your breath crystallizes fear into snow. mounds and piles of snow. only when your breath stops will this snow ever cease.
He never loved me, though i know how hard he tried. he was a good man, sewn tight with pride. on visits in his final years he cried standing at his graveside able at last to say i know you knew how much i loved you anyway.
Oh father, my father am humbled by your ways as you sustain innate integrity of having a low profile lifestyle always patience and responsible as you stay loving mum till now oh father, my father am inspired by your manners as you hold the cool temperance of always being forgiving and caring always supportive and understanding as you are standing by for us till now oh father, my father am encourage by your humility as you practice sound principles of fatherhood and a counselor always guiding us by example as you live a clean life till now no wonder i am your son as i walk on your footsteps of being a dear good father to my beloved own family how i wish i could live on to be like you till now at 75.
He wept for his father his father who implored him to not test life, to not seek treasures unknown but his son wanted more and spent his long days slashing the darkened skies in conquest of a golden sun but the son was like a god opening his mouth to warm the coldness of the earth and his father did not bless the summers or winters of his son with the light of his departure the father turned his head away, his once strong grip, weakend, only the whitened hollows of his face did he leave him.
In the name of the father, crusaders sallied forth raping and murdering. in the name of the father, the vatican turned its back on the holocaust. in the name of the father, we assassinated gandhi, and martin luther king. in the name of the father, the irish killed one another, and the british urged them on. in the name of the father, paedophiles lurk behind dog collars and cassocks. in the name of the father, children are sold or enslaved. in the name of the father, this a father i can do without.
Mother earth and father time are walking hand in hand. they're visiting their children and checking on their land. they view the worlds destruction everywhere they turn. they fear their precious children are never going to learn. ''this earth should be their playground with joys beyond belief yet, all these children seem to know is senseless pain and grief.'' ''how do we teach our children to care for such a place? they may not get the message till we slap them in their face.'' the children are oblivious to even basic rules. that's why so many people grow up looking like such fools.
Rare can i find a father of great statue and character man of words and honor even possess good humor often a friend to many more. man of guts and practicality a respected guy in the locality law abider often a good provider never he gets angry without reason especially if one has to learn a lesson surely he'll teach anyone just soon. being my father i'm proud to be his daughter like a sheep that sheepherder feeds lavishing me with my own basic needs on certain condition that he always point never will i do him wrong or disappoint exerting much efforts my father do not rest simply because he wants to give me the best.
Father and daughter spend some quiet time together in the living room shining through the curtain is the sun and outside is the glorious afternoon father reads to his daughter the poetry she loves father and daughter enjoy each other's company father takes his daughter by the hand as they take a walk outside father cares for his daughter and always wishes the very best to happen for her.
Dear lord in heaven, this has been a very interesting week, still so much to learn and so much to be forgiven for. although lord verbally we have not offended anyone but inwardly sometimes we have feelings of jealousy or envy. these feelings truly are negative feelings and need to be dealt with. today lord i pray that you rid our minds of such thoughts and replace those thoughts with grateful thoughts. show us how to look at things in a different light, to see what is important and not to focus on the material things in life but to realize that we were all given gifts and those gifts are to be treasured, respected and shared with others. father when others copy us, let us realize that this is a compliment, which shows that we have the ability to set the trend, to take the lead and to move forward allowing others to follow and create a much brighter environment. father when others speak badly of us because they are feeling jealous of us, teach us not to react in a negative manner but to continue to hold on to the positive not allowing such words to hurt us. hold our hands a little tighter lord. father, teach us to be humble and to always put you first, always have you at the head of our tables, present in our midst, clear in our thoughts, forever under your umbrella and lord teach us to always listen to the whispers. i thank you father for all that you have done for me and i share this prayer with my brothers and sisters on poemhunter in the hope that they will find something here that may be of help to them. i ask you lord for forgiveness, i ask you to keep us out of harms way, i ask that you continue to walk with us, stand by us and to carry us when we can no longer walk. lord in the name of your son jesus, i thank you, i love you, i respect you, i know you and i will always worship you. amen.
A man had just delivered a toad from his wife's armpit. he held it by its legs and spanked it. do you love it? said his wife. it's our child, isn't it? does that mean you can't love it? she said. it's hard enough to love a toad, but when it turns out to be your own son then revulsion is without any tender inhibition, he said. do you mean you would not like to call it george jr.? she said. but we've already called the other toad that, he said. well, perhaps we could call the other one george sr., she said. but i am george sr., he said. well, perhaps if you hid in the attic, so that no one needed to call you anything, there would be no difficulty in calling both of them george, she said. yes, if no one talks to me, then what need have i for a name? he said. no, no one will talk to you for the rest of your life. and when we bury you we shall put father of toads on your tombstone.
You're standing in the doorway. your workday is all done. he waits to see you everyday, this boy that is your son. he hopes you will go fishing. he hopes you'll shoot the gun. he just wants to be with you, this boy that is your son. he is your spitting image. to him you are ''the one''. he hopes to be just like you, this boy that is your son. you show him what a man is. you teach as you have fun. you are admired as well as loved by this boy that is your son. you've got a friend forever. until the world is done. then, still you will be holding this man that is your son.
Life has many ways, of telling our age each more interesting, with each new page but in my heart, you will never grow old dear father of mine, with many stories to be told with patience and love, you guided me bringing me up, the best i could be you worked hard and long, even after i was grown thank you dear father, for the love you have shown so much to be learned, from your experience all you went through, all your endurance i will always treasure, what you have done dear father of mine, you're number one so often this child, has failed to say how much you're loved, each passing day and i thank god, he picked you to be the greatest father, ever for me.
My father was the greatest man i ever knew and loved he never judged me, never scorned me and never held a grudge if i grow old being half the man that taught me all i knew then i would lie down in my grave amongst a privileged few.
When father ranney left the states, in canada to try the fates, he settled down in dereham, then no dairyman lived near him; he was the first there to squeeze his cow's milk into good cheese, and at each provincial show his famed cheese was all the go. then long life to father ranney may he wealth and honour gain aye. he always took the first prize both for quality and size, but many of his neighbors now profit by his labors, and the ladies dress in silk from the proceeds of the milk, but those who buy their butter, how dear it is, they mutter. then long life to father ranney may he wealth and honour gain aye. now we close this glorious theme, this song of curds and rich cream, you can buy your hoops and screws, and all supplies for dairy use, milk cans and vats, all things like these in ingersoll great mart for cheese, here buyers do congregate and pay for cheese the highest rate. so we call on you again aye, to honor father ranney.

Wilt thou forgive that sin where i begun, which was my sin, though it were done before? wilt thou forgive that sin, through which i run, and do run still, though still i do deplore? when thou hast done, thou hast not done, for i have more. wilt thou forgive that sin which i have won others to sin, and made my sin their door? wilt thou forgive that sin which i did shun a year or two, but wallow'd in, a score? when thou hast done, thou hast not done, for i have more. i have a sin of fear, that when i have spun my last thread, i shall perish on the shore; but swear by thyself, that at my death thy son shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore; and, having done that, thou hast done; i fear no more.
Fathers hold you when you have bad dreams and they comfort you when all is lost it seems. fathers teach you to dribble a basketball and shoot a free throw and they lead you as you grow. fathers teach you how to drive a car and they try to teach you how to putt for par. fathers wipe the tears of your broken heart and they hold your hand when you don't know how to start. fathers quiz the boys who take you on a date and they scold those boys who bring you home late. fathers carry you on their shoulders when you're too small to see and they watch as you giggle when they bounce you on their knee. fathers extend their feet to you when they teach you how to dance and they always give you a second chance. fathers wait in the wings while you start your own life and they pray for a husband to make you a wife. fathers walk you down the aisle on your wedding day but fathers never really give their little girls away.
She hears me strike the board and say that she is under ban of all good men and women, being mentioned with a man that has the worst of all bad names; and thereupon replies that his hair is beautiful, cold as the march wind his eyes.
Ulcerated tooth keeps me awake, there is such pain, would have to go to the hospital to have it pulled or would bleed to death from the blood thinners, but can't leave mother, she falls and forgets her salve and her tranquilizers, her ankles swell so and her bowels are so bad, she almost had a stoppage and sometimes what she passes is green as grass.there are big holes in my thigh where my leg brace buckles the size of dimes. my head pounds from the high pressure.it is awful not to be able to get out, and i fell in the bathroom and the girl could hardly get me up at all. sure thought my back was broken, it will be next time. prostate is bad and heart has given out, feel bloated after supper. have made my peace because am just plain done for and have no doubt that the lord will come any day with my release. you say you enjoy your feeder, i don't see why you want to spend good money on grain for birds and you say you have a hundred sparrows, i'd buy poison and get rid of their diseases and turds.
My beloved father, the last time we met in company with your confidant and friend abu, we spoke of many things. most importantly the history i'd lost in the half century of not being your son. you surrendered me for expediency because you were a man of peace. the circumstances of then made me who i am, and not necessarily the son you wanted; but that's another story.
The long lines of diesels groan toward evening carrying off the breath of the living. the face of your house is black, it is your face, black and fire bombed in the first street wars, a black tooth planted in the earth of michigan and bearing nothing, and the earth is black, sick on used oils. did you look for me in that house behind the sofa where i had to be? in the basement where the shirts yellowed on hangers? in the bedroom where a woman lay her face on a locked chest? i waited at windows the rain streaked and no one told me. i found you later face torn from the history of siege, eyes turned to a public wall and gone before i turned back, mouth in mine and gone. i found you whole toward the autumn of my 43rd year in this chair beside a masonjar of dried zinnias and i turned away. i find you in these tears, few, useless and here at last. don't come back.
The memory of my father is wrapped up in white paper, like sandwiches taken for a day at work. just as a magician takes towers and rabbits out of his hat, he drew love from his small body, and the rivers of his hands overflowed with good deeds.
We are not the same human, as we get experienced, day by day non stop, and we are not stagnant, but flowing with the current, holding hand to hand, collecting memories of, new relationship, forgetting the old, hurt and be hurt, happy and let others to be happy. at certain part of our life, our sweet presence, may become unnecessary, to the loved ones, so we have to pick up, the courage and wisdom, to draw the gentle demarcation, where everyone will be the king and queen, in their own territory.
Respect is earned respect is given respect is not demanded respect is not forced to give others respect is our tradition our culture my dear, forget not as you sow so you reap go on your own trip the engine of respect you see it is auto never bother who says what you say whatever you like as freedom of speech is there .
If you respect yourself respect to others you'll show never judge a person that you do not know but your political leaders feel free to praise or to criticize since their decisions impact on you that you must realize if you so wish you can heed or ignore my advice those with only personal power leave to their own device since any personal decisions they make do not impact on you as you'd like them to treat you likewise to them do anyone if they so choose with their words can be unkind and if you look for flaws in others then flaws you will find those kind with their words to their higher selves true we receive from life what is only our due those into trash talking i for one don't condone let the one without sin come and cast the first stone.
Give respect to a woman your mother your sister your daughter are there in a woman. give respect to a woman a woman is your wife and producing your children with much difficulties and rearing them sacrificing everything giving you pleasure at life's risk. give respect to a woman a woman is a woman you men can not describe a woman being the product of a woman you just give respect and beg excuse i know wrong is with you.
No respect dude the teenager said unhappy with me for not honouring the war dead but his idea of what is respect is quite different to mine he has his opinions and that suits me fine. the making of a young soldier in some future day to fight in a war from his homeland far away for by his own admission that is all he aspires for to be the heroes to him are not heroes to me. perhaps of emulating his ancestor the teenager does dream but those he sees as heroes are not mine it does seem my heroes believe in live and let live and any perceived wrongs of the past are happy to forgive. no respect dude words from one quite young perhaps one day too his praises will be sung and though he may not survive to march in the war parade at his grave site the last post for him will be played. my advice to no respect dude is live long as you can and forget about war live to be an old man and watch your great grandchildren in the children's playground play for life is for living as some are known to say.
Lord, teach us to hace and show respect for each other each day, patience and kindness to listen to what others have to say. we all have a need to turn to others at times, teach us to have enough respect to reach out, and not act blind. teach us to respect that others can teach us things in life as we walk, teach us to respect good criticism to us as with others we talk. lord just teach us to in all things to respect and show love each day, that is what we ask you today as we pray.
If you pay respect to where respect is due and to your own higher self try to remain true and treat everyone as an equal and all as the same your's ought to live on as a remembered name. if for everyone you believe on a 'fair go' and despite their race or creed due respect to them show and never ruin anyone's character with malicious lies above the ordinary you are one who does seem to rise. if you unlike many not addicted to greed and try to help those of help who are in need and of your own human flaws you do feel aware to say the least people like you are quite rare. if you do believe in the live and let live and you are not too proud to receive and generous enough for to give and respect to the rights of all others you pay then as a person you are doing quite okay.
I am sitting in the back of the bus observing the children play with the weather just gorgeous on a very lovely day a mother of two tries to discipline her son he just would not listen he just wanted to have fun as the mother told him to sit down he raised his foot at her i couldn't believe what i saw i was left in a stare where is the respect has this boy lost his mind the situation is looking bleak as the boy's behavior is so unkind.
Respect is what you earn not command that is something some find hard to understand you earn respect if respect you do show from people in your life you've come to know of respect or lack of we do read of and hear though 'tis a thing that cannot be born of fear of somebody who has power over you in your feigned respect your feelings are not true. many may respect and admire the high achievers of the town and applaud them on their journey to renown but with the many some do disagree through different eyes we see things differently. respect is something you can only show for one that you feel privileged for to know and of any shackles true respect is free that's how it is and that's how 'twill always be.
The world will not stop turning if friends we had none the world would be a better place having a genuine one. the rain will not stop falling because we cannot trust the rain will fall as tears when a friendship has been bust. the sun will not stop shining when friends walk away the sun will shine brighter having friends with you today. the moon will always shine way up there in the sky the world will continue to turn wether friends you and i. the love thats between friends is so easily broken our trust is all we can give others in return as a token. respect and hospitality we can all try and share being there for each other showing that we really care.
We have forgotten traditional values that was owed and very much due he teachers were considered as founding stone for the future of students alone even though the basic knowledge was from home the teachers were always welcome and adored their position it was respectable transition it may be with lack of facility that student might have faced in its utility the teachers have gone all out to help in every aspect and talked about the teachers were always held in high esteem but were less paid still they have performed their duties to the help and welfare of societies we naturally held high regard and look forward for heir guidance and advice it is always full of promises.
I would love to be hated for ever reason and stand related each action being criticized and cut to size that shall give me enormous joy nice reason to feel elated and enjoy at least you near to the people for what ever cause and trouble they will call you man of vested interest try to malign motive behind and test they want simple excuse to air dissent they have actually lost civility and curtsey is absent i am sure of great respect when they will know about my act the work put behind success and providing them best window with access with such intention, any man can work freely he has the platform and vast horizon readily he can go for in and utilize the space as has good intention show class in chase.
Women need it as mark of respect we all have to think seriously and introspect when god has made it then why do we stand as suspect? has everything got relevance with cast, creed, color or sect? yes, color do attract us for certain reasons it is natural and varies from person to person but is it the only criteria to hate an individual? still we have we to fight against role called dubious or dual? i salute to those who stand against such move? they may be threatened with their live or removed yet the fight may not be over till it ends we as an human beings must change our trend we are in land of peace and liberty we are equally blessed with freedom from almighty why do we create hatred only on the basis of color? this is not simple matter but serious and major some of the people may not speak openly against but secretly they will bless and insist that struggle rages on indefinitely the people are brandished and disappear quietly it is suppression and blot on humanity it is not even today discouraged for continuity enough blood has been shed and still it remains let us do everything which is possible in our domain.
Lovely and beautiful woman can be looked upon as human she can be guide and mentor in life she can prove as good wife too she has everything in form of natural gift she is embodiment of strength with no shift she is known for her kindness always keeps smile on face her life revolves around family fully conscious of duty assigned by an almighty she sees everything in her mission and performs till lat with compassion she applies no mind but remains always kind uses emotions of heart very real and as natural art trust and respect as she holds all noble acts as sister, wife and mother she holds position better.
People stay away and pay scant respect to beggars who stay not near? but far from civilized world to have their own fold they know and blow with wind and not mind someday some change may come in with time edge who knows what may be swept away? the fortune, wealth or greedy way no world for beggars no words for poor but look backward and then think forward patience they have and silently behave too with insult and deep restraint.
A man should have respect his case may not accord him that, nor his situation yet he must feel self worth. a man must have respect he may be poor and destitute but he is a child of god. he is a spark of the spirit he is a wonder in himself he is unique the greatest of animals. a man will have respect primordiality may refuse him it but he will strive all he may to clinch it still.
Respect each and every one you are for all in this procession. the procession is for peace and you are to present with information. no need of information act you are to chalk out your program and react. action and reactions are necessary they are both sides of the same coin. accept them all they are yours as you call.
Being doing the misery i was born yes, it was i nobody else, why? cuz, life means a lot for being a plot and, then leaving why, naah, never plz, dnt do that atleast, not with me i rise above hate to teach the lesson my passion, my ideal idol, the one the only my life champ, john cena may live forever, i love his every atom, character.
I will not allow a woman or a child to be abused or disrespected in my presence. i do not think racial slurs are humorous. i'm not interested in being converted to your religion. i am not interested in your sexual preference, not interested in playing games. i dont care what you own. i will do anything i can to help you, but i wont be owned by you. i will respect your right to opinions, you will respect mine. i'm not always a good man, but i'm a hard enough man to stand my ground.
I have respect for you in so many different ways. your fire and your passion, your kindness and your love, your strength to fight through all the pain. i openly admire you for your determined honest ways. i respect you for having given me so much of your patience and precious time. the second chances when i have screwed up like a foolish child. i respect that you've taken all the time to truly get to know me. broken through and down so many walls that so many others never had the courage to even try and climb. i love and respect you for understanding why the walls were there foe such a long time. i respect and admire your rock hard perseverance in the face of hate and doubt. i truly can't tell you all the ways i respect and love you for there's too much there to count. just know that i love you dear, respect you and hold you as a hero that i so admire and who's loving dedication and confidence i look to and aspire.
Respect to it has more than a one sided way do not expect the respect of others if respect to them you don't pay you treat other people as you'd like them to treat you and in turn they will give you the respect you are due you may be the wealthiest and most powerful person in your town and you feel that you have the right for to put others down and others respect you or so to you it does appear but between feigned and true respect the difference is quite clear despotic leaders believe the masses them do revere but this sort of feigned adulation is adulation through fear to protest in such circumstance they'd be risking their own lives and the lives of their children as well as their wives if you do not respect then respect do not expect to receive just a known fact of life that one ought to believe.
Self respect is self love self respect provoke love for others self respect is god respect self respect is self norishing self respect is self control respect and love respect and praise respect and join respect and rejoyce respect and cellebrate respect and enjoy for the love of god is respect.
All the diversity groups in the world won't help any situation. one solution is getting to know one another, then deciding whether or not we like a person for who they are. it's a way to combat what some see as racism. we're not meant to like everyone we meet and that's okay. live and let live, and respect the fact that we can't all get along. that's what makes the world unique and diverse. trying to make people fit some preconceived idea of a few people is totally absurd and asinine. leave people alone, go your own way, find your own place in life and don't expect others to follow your pathway.
When sun is above the horizon and, the light it spreads reaches our eye we forget the darkness, and think ourselves be blessed sun's power to light the glory world is self respect. when rain enters our rooftop, it doesnt ask whether you are rich or poor the melody of the sweetness is for everybody you may call it the rains self respect. wonderful stars are there in our sky and they twinkle to make the sky looks like in a wedding gown and, its sweetness is preserved in the fairy tales, thats the self respect that the stars have. when i mingled to write down a poetry, thinking it to be my only work supported by my passion, the happiness i get after make people smile, thats certainly the self respect i give to myself.
It is all but relative and no way connected with me. one should learn how to respect others one should know he has no right to disrespect others. it is true i am not unselfish, to certain extend i have to compromise with the right of others. i know i am no way connected with action and with the fruits there of. but i am here, and i will be here before you, my dear and it all depends on your visual capacity. what is there to renounce that i do not know you are seeing all at this moment on the next moment all these are not here what to say about others when i am not mine here.
Those who spend decades learning about nature of nature's ways will tell you they have much to know her deepest secrets we will never learn of and our wonder of her only seem to grow one could live for a thousand years and yet not know all about her as her most precious secrets with us she will never share and yet in part due to us she does seem much the poorer as many of her life forms either extinct or rare many of her waterways by us have been polluted our factories puff up black smoke to the sky why do we try to harm the one who feeds us that is the question many have asked why without us nature would do nicely though for to live on her we do depend she supplies all of our needs for our existence though to her we are not a good friend in technology humans have come far and many human achievements are great but we've not been respectful to nature and that's something we cannot celebrate but nature she will live forever and like her seasons we come to life and die immortality for us homo sapiens has surely been based on a lie we depend on her for our very existence and our achievements to her seem so small and though we are one of her life forms we do not respect her at all.
I am a woman respected some women i need to respect few women are not respectable but i am respecting them a golden rule i am respected for i am a woman i am ought to respect other women no matter what they do they act they pose they say i have to respect them that is their rights to be respected for a woman like me and a women like them respect is essential.
Respect is something that you and me ought to have respect is something that you and me ought to show respect is something that you and me ought to give respect is something that you and me ought to learn respect is something that you and me ought to share respect is something that you and me ought to know.
Nobody gives a damn about you until you pick up a gun or strap on a bomb and kill someone with your version of kindness nobody gives a damn about you until you have a couple too many drinks get behind the wheel of your suv and kill someone with your version of having fun nobody gives a damn about you until you call someone a honky or a nigger and kill someone with your version of the truth nobody gives a damn about you until you learn to give a damn about yourself.
Respect women for they bring a lot into this world they are just more than procreators bringing in girl or a little boy. they are the caregivers, the nurturers, and have a gentle touch do respect feminine energy and honor it more than a bunch. don't abuse women no longer on this planet so dear by being disrespectful like slapping them on the rear. how disrespectful can that be? it shows the person who does it has no respect or integrity. written by christina sunrise on august 12,2013.
The 12 steps to gain respect.more or less the more you demand respect the less respect you possess the more humility you possess the less humiliation you own the more kindness you own the less penance you owe the more respect you owe the less friends you have the more friends you have the less help you need the more help you need the less arrogance you show the more arrogance you show the less love you will know the more love you know the less hate will grow the more hate you grow the less wisdom you display the more wisdom you display the less foolishness you practice the more foolishness you practice the less love you will know from jehovah the more love you know from jehovah the less respect you demand.
What to expect? dirty dust under my feet. am i a cheat? i am holding your hands i am touching your forehead i am in front of your eyes i am a flower in the garland you wear. tell me, tell me, who am i and you are in equanimity with new clothes every moment taking me upwards with and without my consent. all these are here not for the sake of show i realized and you called me loudly i want to sacrifice myself for you and you are declaring my victory at the end. what to do with that victory that i do not know and i am sure i know not the beginning and the end and in the middle i am in my life threefold.
Blue sky, blue sky. looking at you, wishing the day by. blue sky, purple sky. storm coming in, here it is, there's the eye. blue sky, grey sky. the earth is wailing, the thunder yells, and the clouds cry. blue sky, grey sky, black sky. tore away at the moon, swallowed stars, listened to the sun die. black sky green sky orange sky red sky pink and yellow and mean sky. come on and roll in; it's only in my mind.
The sky is low, the clouds are mean, a travelling flake of snow across a barn or through a rut debates if it will go. a narrow wind complains all day how some one treated him; nature, like us, is sometimes caught without her diadem.
Blue sky yesterday grey today did the blue sky go away? what is blue and sunny too? the blue sky hiding behind the grey. grey today but with blue sky waiting to come out and play. the sun is laughing at my blueness blue sky with its greyness never meant for sadness. blue sky here today but with a greyness covering all the blueness this is what i want to say.
My eyes set their gaze across the horizon the sun is setting in late fall afternoon cold snap in the air as the leaves swirl about a welcoming view is the painted pink sky streaks of pale blue dotted with white have been suddenly brushed with a soft pastel the beauty is breathtaking, such natural artistry i am in awe of the painted pink sky i think of you now, how magnificent it would be to find ultimate and much needed serenity wrapped up in your strong arms in loves sweet embrace to be held by you under the painted pink sky.
Under the gleaming stars above for we love live and laughter sweet heart both you and i your cheeks just two roses you keep a happy smile there a golden flowers shining all the while with two lovely blue eyes and four golden hair my heart keep singing as if our love be forever spring is here there is music in the air you are love by all the world is smiled upon admired by all spring touch is every where beautiful shies gold and blue the melody in your heart and the love song be forever my darling.
Though there are miles between us, though the days and the nights may seem long, look up to the stars and know, that no matter where you are, i'm there with you, no matter where you go, my love you'll have. if ever you are lonely, or think you don't belong, look up to the stars and know, that i'll be there with you, so you won't be lonely, when you think that you don't belong, i'll be around to make sure you do. whenever we're apart, always remember, look up to the stars.
My hair is light sky blue, and my eye's are deep brown. what does that say to you? , please don't look at me and frown. well, my head is in the clouds, my eye's, are focused on earth. i do not wear any shrouds, and my life is full of mirth. when my head comes back to earth, and my eye's look at the sky. i wonder about my birth, and ask a lot of questions, why? why? , is not such a blur, it's always the same answer. we are all here to learn, if not, you get another turn.
Black sails, against a midnight sky, he buried his heart on an island. some day. it won't matter when, she'll open a green bottle and find within, a scribbled map that shows just where he buried himself.in despair. it'll read, from the oceans edge first, two steps forward and quench your thirst.for i am a river, disguised as a stream.for i am life, disguised as a dream. wake me, my love, wake me, i'll give you a sign, of where you can find this heart of mine.buried deep, and buried well. and far enough away from the oceans swell, that not just any one, sailing by, would know that it was i. black sails, against a midnight sky, he buried his heart on an island. he lay there buried, for what seemed like years, the oceans edge soon mixed with tears, and he waited and waited, though she never came, and the island no longer now looks the same. time has eroded both beach and sand with no more trace upon the land of where he buried his hope, and dream, scribbled on a message within a bottle of green. black sails, against a midnight sky, he buried his heart on an island.
Im not so sure he loves me. im not so sure i do. but when im around him. my heart tells me its true. when im around this guy, i feel like i can fly. so high i can touch the sky. i get all nevous and i get all red. i start to get a little light headed. he talks to me. its like a fantasy. i dont know whats left in the world. when he is not here to have me hold.
I reach for the end of day orange, pink, lavender, gray and watch it slide out of my fingers as the sun dips behind the horizon for night to come. the nights come with blacks and grays, moon and stars and some nights clouds draw the drapes to the sky and i wonder what is up there, invisible to my eye. sometimes i wait for mornings for those colors to reappear and reach for wonderful things the sun saw while on the other side of the world as i watched the night sky.
The sun has burst the sky because i love you and the river its banks. the sea laps the great rocks because i love you and takes no heed of the moon dragging it away and saying coldly 'constancy is not for you'. the blackbird fills the air because i love you with spring and lawns and shadows falling on lawns. the people walk in the street and laugh i love you and far down the river ships sound their hooters crazy with joy because i love you.
Sun is dad spreads love and cheer with each of his rays children's laughter everywhere moon is mom watching over the earth to make sure we dont miss our way in her varying ways she cares for each and all taking in all the pain to make sure all things are fine earth, earth, earth is my lover pulling me close all the time giving me food and a perpetual shelter even when i am mere skeletons and bones.
Give to me one more kiss. impart your spirit on my memory. chill my heart with a touch. ignite me with a glance. wrap yourself around me. and stir my soul with a smile. meet me on a midnight moon. where we can laugh and fly. make a dream that soars on wings. and kiss beneath a liquid sky.
I opened a letter but i couldn't read up in the sky down on the ground i must pick my posion do i feel pain with every breath or do i live in the sky after my death normal thoughts visit at times suicide ideas still exist day and night are always mine suicide tries are on my wrist the sky is peaceful and blue but also dark and blind if i become a walking soul my pain i will not find maybe, i could be wrong up in the sky down on the ground i must pick my posion.
Across the red sky two birds flying, flying with drooping wings. silent and solitary their ominous flight. all day the triumphant sun with yellow banners warred and warred with the earth, and when she yielded stabbed her heart, gathered her blood in a chalice, spilling it over the evening sky. when the dark plumaged birds go flying, flying, quiet lies the earth wrapt in her mournful shadow, her sightless eyes turned to the red sky and the restlessly seeking birds.
The sky is pink the grass is blue up is down and so are you to run is walk when left is right hop is fly and black is white east is west the sun is green the walls above the floor between the rain goes up the dirt comes down glad is sad and smile is frown to hear is speak to see is smell down are clouds and up are wells when you are me and i am you nobody knows just what to do.
The wind was kicking up from the northwest storm clouds gathered to section off the sun intense displays of furious pyrotechnics flashed brilliantly from the mouth of the dark beyond as nature made its feelings known and i lay slowly dying from a self inflicted stab at ending my family's drought having fallen on my sword as required in human sacrifice my blood letting was to be washed clean and absorbed into the dry parched earth beneath my heavy soul and the heavens would open up to receive me for all which flows from them, so shall all be returned.
Look up to the cloudy sky i can see no stars tonight just the silver moon above there honey, please know that i really care i wish i were there with you you hug me n i kiss you look at the moon from our veranda the mars and the twinkle little six stars i am longing to be with you i miss you sweetheart, it's truely true i always have you in my heart i'm with you, you're with me, even we're apart good night to you my dearest darling wish you sing a beautiful song while i sleeping seeing you tonight in my sweet dreams 'up to the stream' singing together as we're team.
Bodies falling from the sky, like drops of dreams, like sweet lies. without wings, and only with our souls.. we are able to fly, fusing with the sky.becoming one. in my dreams, the sky is like a canvas, my soul all colors, and my body a feather brush, in the hands of a blowing child. i love life more than my own life. to die we have to live, to wake up we have to sleep, to finish we have to start, to leave we have to arrive, these are the reasons why, flying keep us alive. my new thoughts, kill my old ones, my new me, kill my old one. we must dream, to let the day die we must fly, to let our bodies disattach. souls.bodies.minds in the sky. we set them free, they never die, they just go to another dimension, like this.like there.like that.
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin dance me through the panic 'til i'm gathered safely in lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove dance me to the end of love dance me to the end of love.
Sometimes we do the rumba, a foxtrot or a jive, as we dance through our life, each and every day. we dance and we dance, each day through. everyday to a different tune, just to get us through. in all our loving moments, we waltz through life, and in those complicated moments, we will twist the whole night through. for everything we do, there is a dance to get us through. for every day, we dance our life away. 17 june 2007.
At first i thought she waltzed, but then i saw the error of my observation powers. she waddled, all that blubber, garnished with shoulder pads, covert suspenders and duct tape, size called 'infinity', a wave of air preceded the mass, mostly the temperature was high but in the noise of raucous laughter it was hard to tell what happened. yes, men were at her feet, all over the dancing hall, though hardwood on a polished floor is without comfort. no one was able to keep standing, it was too much to grin and bear. majestic gestures emanated, clearly, there was confusion as to the identity and origin, was this thing human then? and, in the end it was decided that it had been good to have this episode, though fleeting pay its short visit, although the most intriguing part about the thing, consisted of its skills to speak of things that human beings hold dear, some raunchy stuff included. and all were shocked, though pretty glad when hardwood planks did give and cracked, and blubber sank to vanish through the hole, from where some devils must have grabbed to commandeer the energy, all the triglycerides, not food for thought but something quite substantial.
In twilight days of half meals we gathered weapons in, anger long stilled into vaporous ether whisked away unseen, a constant blown clear off these curled brows for it had finally been enough this unfathomable loss of us the fighting of flesh, the torn minds ripping and flailing about of limbs, acts against greater odds, desperate thoughts lingering for eternity between hot breaths sweat of common and high ranking mingled with battle fluids crushed beneath wild gaze and maiden strengths slipping about every heart, our fallen purged to the surface in anguish unblemeshed ghost fathers nagging the mete of our worth dispatched at ever more familiar foe pressing fate amid this clumsy waltz of true victory none, then weary home.
Dance with me take my hand pull me close caress my body with your warm embrace as the music plays press your lips upon mine let the music take control dance with passion as our body's become entwine feel the fire of desire that burns within move with the music let it slowly guide your hands the music controls are bodies our passions begging to be released will you dance with me.
Did she ever dance the tango on those clear and cloudless nights? did she ever wash the dishes? while i was wondering what might time have made of our new loving or was it moving out of sight? did she ever fully love you? or did she merely say she did? did she sometimes feel too tired? or did she not have any kids? did you simply just forget me? why did you let my passion die? why did you never ever let me just be me so i could fly?.
I'll dance all night i'll dance the pain away i'll dance until the morning sun graces us with day i'll dance until i'm numb until i don't feel anymore i'll dance until i'm gone and don't remember what i'm dancing for i'll dance until you love me i'll dance the rest of my life i'll dance until you return by the moon's gentle light i'll dance to the music of my shattering heart i'll dance until it doesn't hurt as you tear me apart.
Did you leave me here alone to face this world of emptiness while i wanted to have the dance of love with you did you leave me here alone to face this silence i wanted to whisper the song of love, into your ears while my hands were dancing on your skin feeling the warmth of your inside did you leave me here alone to face this dark night alone while i need the candle of hope, burning with warmth and light in our all cold and dark nights.

A little ray of hope across a midnight sky a time for all time, a light to shine sunrise and sunset caught in one net for ever fighting to stay one. a moon and a sun wanting to be as one to set together, in a time lost in forever earth moon and stars fade together a longing that fades into forever the alpha and omega fading in and out longing to be together but always in doubt a rainbow brings hope, a new way to cope we all need thathope to stop salt filled tears from falling oiling the way for another day.

Like an infant in the cradle i rocked in his arms and penned this fable the sweet lucid lyrics of the song made me forget right and wrong he looked at me as if a rainbow in the sky my heart skipped a beat and i felt so shy my silky black hair acted as a veil but his one touch and i let myself sail he held me close and his lips touched mine as if a thirsty soul tasted french wine my fingers then reached his curly hair ang got entwined without care i envisioned our future in those moments so pure he is my soulmate my heart said for sure the time should stand still was my wish i know i was acting childish one last embrace and that will be all for i have to rush back before my dad's call mesmerized by the thought of that beautiful evening i am writing this while his intoxicatins smell still lingering..
You have no dance item to do barring this lungi dance, taking full air, the lungi dance is but a loafer's dance and the lungi cannot come to anyone's rescue during the chilly winter. the lungi dance, the lungi dance the loafer saying and whistling it and dancing in his go as you like style, dancing and whistling, the lungi no dress is it, but the loafer's dance.

Our thoughts are the blooms and the wind our admirers in so many ways it blows and each time it does the petals put on a different dance into the world we dance with friends for each friend a different attire i put on to show my appreciation for every friend a different step in my dance to show my love.
Autumn. fall. leaves drop. cranberry, gold, chocolate, and rust. twitter and giggle as the wind blows them about. black birds glide through the air with a graceful ebb and flow. breathing in and out. confused, perhaps, on which way to fly. the weather, sweet mother, taunting us with warm days and cold nights. swift breezes. sweet hot cocoa kisses. gleam in the eye's of babes, tossing leaves up and out of their grasp. only to watch them glide back down to the starting position. hot teas, warm soups, crusty breads, melted butter. shawls wrapped around chilly shoulders. warm arms nestling you into love. snuggling under blankets. this is the season to fall. fall into dreams, kisses, love, and joy. hibernation begins. the season of hearty living, warm embraces and joyful awareness in ones own self. welcome autumn. welcome to the fall of life. a time when maturity has reached it's peak and spirals back down to rest before beginning again. the spiral dance has begun. we decline, to ascend. we bow down, to rise again. we ebb and flow to the rhythm of life. inhale and exhale. we all dance to this beat. we dance with quiet feet. welcome, welcome, i welcome you with warmth and gratefulness. come, and begin the dance with us. we have been waiting.
Dance, dance to the music dance, dance to the beat dance, dance to the rhythm stomp your feet dance, dance even though your tune they don't hear dance, dance for yourself have no fear dance, dance if you're alive you're doing well dance, dance and grin so the world can tell you know you've got a life to live and you're looking at the joy this world can give and you're dancing and laughing, you won't be dragged down you'd rather keep moving than wear a deep frown dance, dance til it's played to the end dance, dance with a smile my truly brave friend.
I have been touched by loves hand if but one moment in time and it's feeling wheat fields harvest can not compare in value or worth i have felt inside it's mystical spell and it's dance upon a thin line so fair if but for a moment one small stitch of time two souls reached the promise of the rainbow 'twas late august eve beneath full moon sky she placed her heart in my soulful hand to this very day somewhere deep within the magic has home to which it resides that one dreamers dance we did share long ago now holds my heart never letting go.
You walk up to me those blue oceans of yours twinkling as you take my hand and lead me towards the crowded room. as your arm goes around me i smile while we begin to drift away into our own little fantasy world that only the two of us can occupy. you slowly move in closer until you're inches away from my eyes the essence of you going through me as you softly speak into my mind. the music has ended now back to reality we stand looking at each other with a new light wondering what will happen the next time we dance.
Dance little baby, dance up high, never mind baby, mother is by; crow and caper, caper and crow, there little baby, there you go; up to the ceiling, down to the ground, backwards and forwards, round and round; dance little baby, and mother shall sing, with the merry coral, ding, ding, ding.

Like lightening to a bug, my world is transformed into another place. life is worn inside out, filled with doubt and insecurity. how can life go on in a trench so deep and mired with sadness? so quiet, so gently, everything turned around and no more feeling was felt. away from it all to a deserted isle within, hidden from all, attempting to follow heart's desires. silently waiting for forlorn music to end this sympathy symphony held daily within. taking notice of images, always standing within reach, contemplating their worth when life is done. all is lost, there is no more to work with. life has ended on this quiet, forlorn afternoon. and no one is the wiser for it.
A pocketful of sympathy is really rather wonderful to stop a scratch from stinging or a bruise from black and bluing a pocketful of sympathy can stop a heart from hurting or catch a tear that's falling like a raindropp down a cheek a pocketful of sympathy costs absolutely nothing it's the cheapest kind of plaster that you'll ever ever find and a pocketful of sympathy is like lindsay's magic pudding 'cos the more of it you give away the more you leave behind.
Irvan 12 april 1998 stars illuminate the darkness that night my heart amazing i still sit down and read the silence peel the skins memories that become embedded in spirit and grain flavor that started accompanying the hearts of all the senses i knew this trip would still be much longer although not as if i will survive i will keep trying to survive and survive to you my reason to survive i do not care whatever happens between us but i may know what you feel in your heart when i walked away from you my inner voice, screaming, mountain life abort and i never sleep without kissing your shadow as if longing urge you to come back again once inside, holy, eternal and sincere i love you and will always continue to love you how should i explain it to you so simple but so hard to say.
Hey what did you say, hey in which way? i called the doctor, but he told me to pay. o please tell me what does a speaker do? o please tell me what does a heater do? o please tell me what is a music? i don't know because, i am always sick. you should be happy, you can enjoy sound. because for me it, is never found.
Do you have any sympathy for god? because i have some sympathy for god do you believe in god? because i believe in god do you know who created you in his image? god created you in his image and that is not a lie.
As the television played to an empty room we fell apart in the kitchen; cups of untouched, unsuguared conversation brewed in my mouth but i said nothing. you said nothing but swallowed hard and that was the last time we spoke about love.
Can you be able to love without dream can you be able to own without understand you will never take you will never care i'm only a name you will never run you will never look around my shadow far from your heart can you be able to care but never reach should i hate to make you understand without talk without try only emotion you just say can't get it right just erase me here can you be able to promise but your heart's tired can you be able to protect without see me i realize i really know you you only hide you will never care you will never understand.
Some times we hold on somebodies.. that we feel that we care more about them. despite. that they only caused to us only a pains.. and we still long for them, in spite of that. and miss them from time to time. while they not deserve that yearning or this desire, , , even they not deserve this love which we hold inside our hearts for them..
Where is the voice in my head if any help it wants to be now would be the best these hands which flawlessly curse me perform a symphony of sympathy a one man orchestra of confusion and heartbreak where is this trust i've heard so much about but can't seem to find and to the world in which i stay don't hate me when i say 'this identical state of mind from the glass we look through can you locate the hopes of the citizens you erase you know our names and our faces but could you take one look at a blooming blue rose straight in the eye and call it ugly could you look at a hummingbird and ask for its wings to cease it's beat we are the angels of this life all we need is our wings so could you help me find mine the ones i lost some time ago.
I have no sympathy for you you took advantage of me but you want to act like you did nothing wrong you need to open your eyes and see you are your own worse enemy but you will not take responsibility i will not be your friend anymore because you have really hurt me.
We christen things we call them by their names names are famous and infamous the wind blows in different directions what should i call my sympathy? a relation, a compensation, a smart help, or a prayer to god for my anguish, scattered on the floor? it is a pillow for their heavy heads, a salty soup or a cup of confection, doesn't interest them. envy is ripe, very palpable to their tongues. they will accuse me and handcuff my wings they will take it as a nodule on the nose i dread despicable things i fear life too bereft of commiseration.
Ageing bella in the house at the corner outdoors she is not often seen she was a potential swimming olympian till a motoring accident she had at eighteen brought an end to her swimming career back in ninteen seventy three and condemned her to life in a wheelchair she does deserve great sympathy. she could not compete in the olympics and swim her way into renown and become the toast of the nation and the heroine of her hometown it robbed her of her chance of having children she has never been any man's wife one might say she was quite unlucky that accident ruined her life. she is quite an attractive woman her brown hair flecked with strands of gray she had spent years of her life in a wheelchair seven to ten years before her prime day when i meet her she smiles and says hello but sometimes she looks rather sad i can only empathize with her a terrible life she has had. thirty six of her fifty four years in a wheelchair since her widowed mum died five years ago she has lived on her own lady luck is surely against her a terrible life she has known confined to a wheelchair due to a car crash on the highway which robbed her of her chance of fame in swimming she was a young champion and for herself making a name.
As much as you want to believe it there is not sympathy in this world the only thing that god wants for us is that we die in our own pain to suffer the mistakes that we have made to feed on our blood if god has no sympathy. than who does?.
Blessed is the smile of the person which also can be gracious for the happiness of others blessed is the mouth of the person which speaks sincerely and honestly blessed are the eyes of the person which also can see the suffering of others blessed are the hands of the person which also can feel and carry the sorrow of others.
What's hell with everything that has ever happened i'll keep stepping and stepping to back i only smell your perfume and looked in the shadows of your eyes showing steps in any direction i understand its true that made me compassion because you are beautiful universe because you have wanted to own something i got and to me thou fairest nymph among all the angel who dwells in heaven when the night wind swept stars it was just me, the moon and your shadow i just do not care how crazy and be so i sat in the meadow that extend slowly i fall down my body right and i looked sharp and bright shining moon there was a gnawing loneliness night song my body feels lifted and flying towards the dark side of moon i saw you dancing in the bright light of the moon but like a dream that never real i never reach your and my body suddenly slammed hard in the mountain hard and sharp coral only i get sick and wounded why did i formerly sympathy to you? what could this something wrong with me?.
They don't have any sympathy for me because when i try to explain something it goes in in one ear and comes out the other sometimes i even wonder if they got the message at all it is even hard to say maybe they don't speak english well enough to understand me have i tought of that? no i never consider it maybe that is a fact.
I still love you, you abandoned me, when i was too young, i was taught to hate you, i could not, though i did try, i still love you, crave for your love too, you did not even tell me, why you did, what you did to me, was i wrong in being what i was to you? i still love you, i was born to you, it was your choice, to bring me in, i had not asked for it, but you still did, what you did to me, i still love you, will you ever come back to take me, i am growing up neglected, i wish i survive that wait till eternity, and you get back to me, your destiny.
Destiny where do i find you? destiny where can i look for you? destiny where are you hiding? why are you hiding from me? destiny what do you have for me? destiny what are my options? destiny which door is open for me? destiny do you have anything for me that i might want? destiny can i get any satisfaction from you? destiny are you my friend?.
Nothing better than not knowing what's going to happen, nothing better than eating chocolate to numb the pain. wishing my friends knew that i love them, wishing he knew im madly in love with him. hoping the best comes out of my mistakes, hoping i live to see tomorrow. listening to the ones i love the most, listening to the pounding heart in fear. seeing nothing but a fanasty world, seeing the truth that lies behind your eyes. tasting the truth of life, tasting the pain of unknown. living like theres no tomorrow, living without the truth. smelling the sweet revenge, smelling the destiny that lies within.
To get you to smile means the world to me i dont know where to begin through thick and thin and in between you loving me has been a dream i always wondered if dreams came true it was proved to me the day i met you i love you soo much you'll never know day by day my love for you grows love has always been a game for me but with you loving me it seems like destiny.
One day i say i love you, one day you say you love me, i was always so happy because i was loved eternally, for all time because its just you and i, like a fairytale come to life we live happily ever after you and i, for all eternity just us, you and me this is are destiny, i love you and you love me.
When i am happy, bustling with successes in life, when my dreams are fulfiiled, with love and riches i desired, i do not even think that, my destiny brought me here, i just give credit to myself. when we meet our beloved, when we start to love and miss each other, why we give all the credit to fate and destiny? we strove to get into that enchanted world, we played all the rituals of the love acts, there is no destiny, we got into it by our own free will. when we are sad, with the miseries of life and death, with broken dreams of happy life, with tormented heart in our love oasis, why we think that all of it was in our destiny? life is like an ocean wave, it has low tides, soon to be followed by the high tide, all we need is faith and determination, to get over the notion of our predetermined destiny. destiny does not shape our future, we do by our deeds and actions, i do not beleived in pre professed destiny, because i shape my own destiny.
If my destiny is already chosen. then why do i need to make it mine? if i was to live like this then why did i have to redefine the meaning of death and this drastic lose of faith.? gods are getting scarce. worshipping affinity we are distortion's the order of the day mistrust is here only to stay stitching together the images of fear destiny replacing 'curse'. gods. they are getting scarce.
Destiny hopefully knocks on our door at the right time because i know i missed the train and forgotten my ticket when it has tried to give me a chance i have become ecstatic and full of light ever since destiny came together like a puzzle i had the box and the pieces in my possession but i guess it took a little bit of time because i over think i over analyze i have this unbeatable streak of missing destiny's knock on the door well finally i answered and everything is coming together no missing pieces no bent or child manipulated pieces just a brand new box with the plastic wrapping right next to it with the steep price tag of 31 years the pieces are all out like my exposed heart everything is there everything is fastened together everything is great i apologize to myself for wasting so many years before i found my destiny.
Standing here on the threshold of a brand new dawn, we ponder over things wondering if we belong within this crazy world of ours. wondering if our destiny waits for us somewhere else. we never know the outcome until the time comes along. there is no way to change it and no reason to do it. just let the future shape our destiny whenever and wherever that might eventually be. 1 february 2008.
What determines our destiny to be? what we become, futures predestined to see. where will roads lead untill it all ends? destiny calling, live's for some predestined to spend. why do our lives, create a passion for some? and then for others, there seems to be none? struggling to be what is too far from fingers reach, never accomplishing, what it is that you have preached. dreams and hopes, they fade in the mist, grasping at life, from the dark depth of an abyss. looking back at what could, should, may have been, lacking that door of opportunity for your passion deep within. silver spoons for some placed in the mouths of their young, others dying to achieve selling you dreams with forked tongues. jokes being played an other's laughter not heard, destiny fullfilled at the bottom of a bottle at a curb.
I stood on a hill overlooking the sea, and wondered what my destiny be. would i be loved or would i be lonely? would i sail on a pirate clipper in search of some lost treasure? the wind ruffled my hair, but the sea never spoke to me. every person has a journey, for some it is long, while others it is short. no one can read our destiny; we only make it what it is to be.
My destiny is tired. the slope leads upwards, onwards, into clouds and far beyond. my destiny, like me, walks slowly mumbles softly remembers ancient rhymes. my destiny, not knowing why hardly realising that every game has it's rules has decided to try though, tired, and betrayed, a little bit frayed has decided to carry on, far beyond, with aching feet, on the winding path, the trees the boulders and rocks to avoid the torrent gushing beneath. copyright rani turton 2008.
A little plum dropped from the tree and struck a frog upon his knee. the frog did hurt and cried a lot the plum said oops, i plum forgot. which wasn't altogether true you see a plum is always blue a frog however must be green thus he can easily be seen. so, folks, it truly stands to reason that in the fall, the ripening season a bit of care would be advised that way a frog is not surprised. in any case, the knee did swell the plum just stayed right where it fell, so in an effort now to heal the frog fell for the plum appeal. he grabbed the plum and opened wide the plum prepared for its last ride. and said before it was too late a plum is to be eaten, mate. so, you can see that those that fall from trees or buildings, big and tall will usually just fail to see the maker of their destiny.
A thought leads to, a desire. a desire, leads to, an action. an action, leads to, a habit. a habit, leads to, a character. a character, leads to, a destiny. a bad thought, nip it, at its bud. a good thought, nurture it, as i said. your thought of a drink, kindles a desire, for a peg. your desire for a peg, takes you, to the bar. your visit to the bar, leads you, drink a peg. your first peg in the bar, makes you, a habitual visitor. your character, as a regular visitor, names you, a drunkard. as a drunkard you're, the day isn't far, for your rest in the grave. a thought of the lord, creates a desire, to see jesus. a desire to see jesus, leads you, to the nearest church. your visit to the church, makes you, a habitual visitor. your habitual visit to the church, converts you, a devotee of the lord. you're, as a servant of the lord, destined to his abode, on the day of judgment. now, you know the recipe, of your own destiny, to keep you ever happy.
Three roses, wan as moonlight, and weighed down each with its loveliness as with a crown, drooped in a florist's window in a town. the first a lover bought. it lay at rest, like flower on flower, that night, on beauty's breast. the second rose, as virginal and fair, shrunk in the tangles of a harlot's hair. the third, a widow, with new grief made wild, shut in the icy palm of her dead child.
Wounded by destiny, i struggle, for a life, i thought never existed, a life without his touch, a life without his shine, a life without his love, a life that was never mine stabbed by the truth of his death, i breath, an air devoid of that fragrance, fragrance of trust, so scattered, fragrance of loyalty that mattered, fragrance of faith, so divine, fragrance of love, you were never mine strangled by his thoughts, i died, in the shades of his memories, memories of the way he loved me, memories of the way he cared, memories of the times i cried, memories of the promises we made.

It was my destiny to die, and no matter how much you try, it is everyones destiny to die, no matter old or young, death will break the needle on which you're life is strung, death cares not that you're in love, death will push you death will shove, till you're life is on the edge, then death the sealer of you're destiny, will steal you're soul, and let you be, for it truly is our destiny, no matter how hard it is to see, to live to die to simply be.
Our destiny is in our own hands some have been known to say but circumstance in all of that must have some part to play if you are born on no hope street and homeless in your youth to you our destiny is in our own hands does not have a ring of truth. our destiny is in our own hands to some may well apply it may apply to you and he and her as well as i but not of course to everyone each day thousands of hunger die our destiny is in our own hands to the millions is a lie. the innocents who die in war and acts of terrorism did not create their destiny they would not wish it on themselves for to die so tragically their destiny was in others hands which often is the case they just happened at the wrong time for to be in the wrong place. that our destiny is in our own hands apply to some maybe but ninety nine per cent of street kids will die in poverty due to their circumstances of birth they are condemned to fail and some of them die of drug overdoses and some of them die in jail.
I cannot love for i will die. so much passion i keep that is only known for me inside. no one sees the grace in every tear i cry. for no one deserves the greatnes of my eye. untouchable i seem to be, but indeed i'm not. a queen of dammned souls i am love i cannot be worth of. for this is the destiny i have to live and one day leave. my soul is empty without the mother of all feelings love.
I always met people at the places i went to but one certain event i wasn't goin'to do but my destiny forced me there and i didn't have a clue why i was so determined that i was goin'to do but now i know why cuz i was to meet you on that certain day and fall in love with you and my destiny changed on that certain day too.
Though many may see it in a different way 'tis destiny in our lives that does have the say our life journey our journey to destiny to fame and to riches and to poverty. 'tis a fact that the greatest are mortals and facts never lie and from the day we are born to the day that we die destiny on our lives a huge part does play 'tis destiny decided that i pen this today. many who believe in life choices will tell you that your life journey you decide those who ignore that you need to have luck on your side they see your station in life as of your making not of circumstance and they scoff at any mention of destiny or chance. the town's wealthiest person in his fiftieth year was buried today 'twas cancer he died of in a slow painful way this was not of his choice of that most would agree a slow painful death part of his life's destiny.
If you're really so far, and in love with someone else.. how come i still feel your presence then, like you're inside me somewhere.. you said, i should try to forget you, and the dreams together we shared. so i forgot even my own image, but you're still inside my head. i cross the crowded streets, pretending you're walking beside me. i hardly stand in front of mirror, not to see the truth it would make me see. deep inside, heart knows that i'm a loner, and that's exactly what i was meant to be.. whatever you'll throw my way, i'll accept it as my fate's destiny.
My destiny haunts me day, my destiny haunts me at nights. my destiny speaks to me each morning, still i have not understood what "destiny is". my destiny keeps me up at nights pondering about "destiny", which i have heard so much about. yet i can not find the answer to my own destiny. seeing my fellow human it would appear that most of them have found the secret to this destiny. but, some like myself are still in search of our destiny. my destiny suddenly comes to light when i was near my end through the path of life. and, it was at that point i became aware that my task throughout my life was my destiny. my destiny has been visible in my actions, in my words during my life. the failer to make contact with my destiny was none other, than lack of understanding. destiny beckon at me with these words, "if you had known the meaning of the word destiny, you would not have toiled so much." that is your destiny.
We met at the pool when you were just a kid such a gentle soul, a life barely lived i had to leave for a little while you welcomed me back with that same warm smile i wanted to know you just a bit better that one night lasted almost forever i guess u dont know it yet but that night you saved me from inner death for some strange reason i felt a connection one i havent felt in 19 years life lessons as time went on we only got closer i prayed day and night for it never to be over but the past shows us nothing last forever why didnt i try to do things a bit better i became selfish, greedy and one track minded i wanted you all to myself until i was reminded that things arent always as they seem it was just all my pathetic little dream we learnt together a long time ago life without the other just wasnt the go we cant be together and cant be without i should never have opened my big mouth so here we are now trying to patch this up what brought this on so quickly, so abrupt of course thats right it was me chasing my fabricated destiny i hope we can move past this mess i know i will try my absoloute best i want, no i need you in my life who is to say wether its wrong or right time is the only judge, that will truly decide wether i should leave this place or swallow my pride because i dont want to lose you or have to leave we are destined to be just friends, i have to believe.
When the life blossoms destiny engraved in our lives when virtue and vice sway to and fro energized and driven by supernatural forces when we are grown up our lives started to face challenges when we encounter distress our lives impregnated with tears and worries that is the destiny of our lives. sometimes our lives tinged and embroilled with joys and sorrows destiny inflicting poison and evil into our lives destiny can make or mar our lives destiny inspires our lives to prosperity it can perish our prospects fortune and fate tossing each other end of lives salunated with blessings dulakshi wakista copyright 2009.
We plot our own destiny be it the path to happiness or the road to ruin. despite the highs and lows of our lives it is we and we alone who plot our own destinies. we can choose to be changed or be the agents of change we can remain chained to the taboos imposed by society or we can unchain ourselves and be free whatever we chose will finally make or mar our destiny.
I now gaze fixedly and intently upon our predetermined destiny and realize that our love is nothing but a perversion of reality, a distortion of equality, nothing but a cataclysmic consequence of infatuation. i foresee the dark ahead even as we lay enervated by our unsheathed passion and as the incandescent glow of our love begins to attenuate i realize this is our destiny our never ending legacy. i now lament that which is our destiny for it is not that of which i had envisioned for us, now i fear our destiny is sealed as the wheels of fate conspire to rob us of our eternal desire.the life we shared smolders in the ashes of our future. this is to be our destiny.

The other day i met a tramp his hair was wet, his clothes looked damp the poor man seemed hungry and cold he must have been sixty years old. his wrinkled face showed signs of strain in his right hand was a walking cane, the memory with me will long remain of him walking in the cold november rain. this slender man of snow white hair with clothes that were the worst for wear greeted with a curt good day and slowly plodded on his way. to be frank and speak the truth i pitied one so destitute and though it may sound a little queer i had to fight to choke a tear. the winter months are harsh and long and this poor man did not seem strong i wonder will he see the spring and hear again the blackbird sing? . as i sleep in a comfortable bed this man will sleep in a draughty shed inhabited by rats and mice on hay and straw ridden with lice. he's no self respect or pride, all self respect in him has died, he lives a life of poverty and has to beg for charity. he knows about degradation about prejudice and discrimination these he meet with every day when well offs from him turn away. but on his journeys he also meet people who give him money and food to eat, his type they can understand and reach to him the helping hand vagabonds are born to roam his kind seldom have been known to take a job and settle down they like to move from town to town. i pitied him he looked so frail, his wrinkled face so wan and pale and though i hope i'm wrong it seems to me that spring time he won't live to see. time from my mind will not erase the memory of the poor tramp's face who someday soon may be found dead in a cold and draughty shed.

Don't fear death in earthly travels. don't fear enemies or friends. just listen to the words of prayers, to pass the facets of the dreads. your death will come to you, and never you shall be, else, a slave of life, just waiting for a dawn's favor, from nights of poverty and strife. she'll build with you a common law, one will of the eternal reign. and you are not condemned to slow and everlasting deadly pain.
I know that i shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above; those that i fight i do not hate, those that i guard i do not love; my county is kiltartan cross, my countrymen kiltartan's poor, no likely end could bring them loss or leave them happier than before. nor law, nor duty bade me fight, nor public men, nor cheering crowds, a lonely impulse of delight drove to this tumult in the clouds; i balanced all, brought all to mind, the years to come seemed waste of breath, a waste of breath the years behind in balance with this life, this death.
From my mother's sleep i fell into the state, and i hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze. six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life, i woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. when i died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.
Every year without knowing it i have passed the day when the last fires will wave to me and the silence will set out tireless traveller like the beam of a lightless star then i will no longer find myself in life as in a strange garment surprised at the earth and the love of one woman and the shamelessness of men as today writing after three days of rain hearing the wren sing and the falling cease and bowing not knowing to what.
Death is nothing at all. i have only slipped away to the next room. i am i and you are you. whatever we were to each other, that, we still are. call me by my old familiar name. speak to me in the easy way which you always used. put no difference into your tone. wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we enjoyed together. play, smile, think of me. pray for me. let my name be ever the household word that it always was. let it be spoken without effect. without the trace of a shadow on it. life means all that it ever meant. it is the same that it ever was. there is absolute unbroken continuity. why should i be out of mind because i am out of sight? i am but waiting for you. for an interval. somewhere. very near. just around the corner. all is well. nothing is past; nothing is lost. one brief moment and all will be as it was before only better, infinitely happier and forever we will all be one together with christ.

Hey father death, i'm flying home hey poor man, you're all alone hey old daddy, i know where i'm going father death, don't cry any more mama's there, underneath the floor brother death, please mind the store old aunty death don't hide your bones old uncle death i hear your groans o sister death how sweet your moans o children deaths go breathe your breaths sobbing breasts'll ease your deaths pain is gone, tears take the rest genius death your art is done lover death your body's gone father death i'm coming home guru death your words are true teacher death i do thank you for inspiring me to sing this blues buddha death, i wake with you dharma death, your mind is new sangha death, we'll work it through suffering is what was born ignorance made me forlorn tearful truths i cannot scorn father breath once more farewell birth you gave was no thing ill my heart is still, as time will tell.
Perhaps if death is kind, and there can be returning, we will come back to earth some fragrant night, and take these lanes to find the sea, and bending breathe the same honeysuckle, low and white. we will come down at night to these resounding beaches and the long gentle thunder of the sea, here for a single hour in the wide starlight we shall be happy, for the dead are free. submitted by venus.
And death shall have no dominion. dead man naked they shall be one with the man in the wind and the west moon; when their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone, they shall have stars at elbow and foot; though they go mad they shall be sane, though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; though lovers be lost love shall not; and death shall have no dominion. and death shall have no dominion. under the windings of the sea they lying long shall not die windily; twisting on racks when sinews give way, strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; faith in their hands shall snap in two, and the unicorn evils run them through; split all ends up they shan't crack; and death shall have no dominion. and death shall have no dominion. no more may gulls cry at their ears or waves break loud on the seashores; where blew a flower may a flower no more lift its head to the blows of the rain; though they be mad and dead as nails, heads of the characters hammer through daisies; break in the sun till the sun breaks down, and death shall have no dominion.
Shall we, too, rise forgetful from our sleep, and shall my soul that lies within your hand remember nothing, as the blowing sand forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep when winds along the darkened desert sweep? or would it still remember, tho' it spanned a thousand heavens, while the planets fanned the vacant ether with their voices deep? soul of my soul, no word shall be forgot, nor yet alone, beloved, shall we see the desolation of extinguished suns, nor fear the void wherethro' our planet runs, for still together shall we go and not fare forth alone to front eternity.
I woke in a place that was dark the air was spicy and still i was bandaged from head to foot the morning that death was killed. i rose from a mattress of stone i folded my clothes on the sill i heard the door rolling open the morning that death was killed. i walked alone in the garden the birds in the branches trilled it felt like a new beginning the morning that death was killed. mary, she came there to find me peter with wonder was filled and john came running and jumping the morning that death was killed. my friends were lost in amazement my father, i knew, was thrilled things were never the same again after the morning that death was killed.

I see the death everyday death in relations death in religion and faith death of man in man everyday, everywhere, every moment death, death and death. i experience the death around me millions and billions of ceremonies the smoke on maps of mankind death in temple and streets death in clubs and parties death, death and death. i foresee the death of humanity harassment, discrimination and hatred death in purity and sacredness death in broken mirrors and home death in king, death in masses death, death and death.
We shall not ever meet them bearded in heaven nor sunning themselves among the bald of hell; if anywhere, in the deserted schoolyard at twilight, forming a ring, perhaps, or joining hands in games whose very names we have forgotten. come memory, let us seek them there in the shadows.
Never until the mankind making bird beast and flower fathering and all humbling darkness tells with silence the last light breaking and the still hour is come of the sea tumbling in harness and i must enter again the round zion of the water bead and the synagogue of the ear of corn shall i let pray the shadow of a sound or sow my salt seed in the least valley of sackcloth to mourn the majesty and burning of the child's death. i shall not murder the mankind of her going with a grave truth nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath with any further elegy of innocence and youth. deep with the first dead lies london's daughter, robed in the long friends, the grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother, secret by the unmourning water of the riding thames. after the first death, there is no other.
Now while my lips are living their words must stay unsaid, and will my soul remember to speak when i am dead? yet if my soul remembered you would not heed it, dear, for now you must not listen, and then you could not hear.
I want to sleep the dream of the apples, to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries. i want to sleep the dream of that child who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas. i don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood, that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water. i don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass, nor of the moon with a serpent's mouth that labors before dawn. i want to sleep awhile, awhile, a minute, a century; but all must know that i have not died; that there is a stable of gold in my lips; that i am the small friend of the west wing; that i am the intense shadows of my tears. cover me at dawn with a veil, because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me, and wet with hard water my shoes so that the pincers of the scorpion slide. for i want to sleep the dream of the apples, to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth; for i want to live with that dark child who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.
If only i could write a beautiful love poem i would write it special and only to you if only i could write a beautiful love poem so that we will forever remain so very very true if only i could write a beautiful love poem with more than a goodness like something new if only i could write a beautiful love poem like the everlasting stay of the sky so blue if only i could write a beautiful love poem i would pray to god if only i could write a beautiful love poem i would work very hard for the lord if only i could write a beautiful love poem with happiness the remain all through the year f only i could write a beautiful love poem knowing that you will be very near if only i could write a beautiful love poem one so very very true if only i could write a beautiful love poem i would write it just for you.
My poem would eat nothing. i tried giving it water but it said no, worrying me. day after day, i held it up to the llight, turning it over, but it only pressed its lips more tightly together. it grew sullen, like a toad through with being teased. i offered it money, my clothes, my car with a full tank. but the poem stared at the floor. finally i cupped it in my hands, and carried it gently out into the soft air, into the evening traffic, wondering how to end things between us. for now it had begun breathing, putting on more and more hard rings of flesh. and the poem demanded the food, it drank up all the water, beat me and took my money, tore the faded clothes off my back, said shit, and walked slowly away, slicking its hair down. said it was going over to your place.
I think it better that in times like these a poet's mouth be silent, for in truth we have no gift to set a statesman right; he has had enough of medding who can please a young girl in the indolence of her youth, or an old man upon a winter's night.
When music is far enough away the eyelid does not often move and objects are still as lavender without breath or distant rejoinder. the cloud is then so subtly dragged away by the silver flying machine that the thought of it alone echoes unbelievably; the sound of the motor falls like a coin toward the ocean's floor and the eye does not flicker as it does when in the loud sun a coin rises and nicks the near air. now, slowly, the heart breathes to music while the coins lie in wet yellow sand.
I am offering this poem to you, since i have nothing else to give. keep it like a warm coat, when winter comes to cover you, or like a pair of thick socks the cold cannot bite through, i love you, i have nothing else to give you, so it is a pot full of yellow corn to warm your belly in the winter, it is a scarf for your head, to wear over your hair, to tie up around your face, i love you, keep it, treasure it as you would if you were lost, needing direction, in the wilderness life becomes when mature; and in the corner of your drawer, tucked away like a cabin or a hogan in dense trees, come knocking, and i will answer, give you directions, and let you warm yourself by this fire, rest by this fire, and make you feel safe, i love you, it's all i have to give, and it's all anyone needs to live, and to go on living inside, when the world outside no longer cares if you live or die; remember, i love you.
You little box, held to me escaping so that your valves should not break carried from house to house to ship from sail to train, so that my enemies might go on talking to me, near my bed, to my pain the last thing at night, the first thing in the morning, of their victories and of my cares, promise me not to go silent all of a sudden.

There is nothing to be afraid of, it is only the wind changing to the east, it is only your father the thunder your mother the rain in this country of water with its beige moon damp as a mushroom, its drowned stumps and long birds that swim, where the moss grows on all sides of the trees and your shadow is not your shadow but your reflection, your true parents disappear when the curtain covers your door. we are the others, the ones from under the lake who stand silently beside your bed with our heads of darkness. we have come to cover you with red wool, with our tears and distant whipers. you rock in the rain's arms the chilly ark of your sleep, while we wait, your night father and mother with our cold hands and dead flashlight, knowing we are only the wavering shadows thrown by one candle, in this echo you will hear twenty years later.
There is always something to be made of pain. your mother knits. she turns out scarves in every shade of red. they were for christmas, and they kept you warm while she married over and over, taking you along. how could it work, when all those years she stored her widowed heart as though the dead come back. no wonder you are the way you are, afraid of blood, your women like one brick wall after another.
Song made in lieu of many ornaments, with which my loue should duly haue bene dect, which cutting off through hasty accidents, ye would not stay your dew time to expect, but promist both to recompens, be vnto her a goodly ornament, and for short time an endlesse moniment.
Just past dawn, the sun stands with its heavy red head in a black stanchion of trees, waiting for someone to come with his bucket for the foamy white light, and then a long day in the pasture. i too spend my days grazing, feasting on every green moment till darkness calls, and with the others i walk away into the night, swinging the little tin bell of my name.
If there is a river more beautiful than this bright as the blood red edge of the moon if there is a river more faithful than this returning each month to the same delta if there is a river braver than this coming and coming in a surge of passion, of pain if there is a river more ancient than this daughter of eve mother of cain and of abel if there is in the universe such a river if there is some where water more powerful than this wild water pray that it flows also through animals beautiful and faithful and ancient and female and brave.
A sunny day's complete poussiniana divide it from itself. it is this or that and it is not. by metaphor you paint a thing. thus, the pineapple was a leather fruit, a fruit for pewter, thorned and palmed and blue, to be served by men of ice. the senses paint by metaphor. the juice was fragranter than wettest cinnamon. it was cribled pears dripping a morning sap. the truth must be that you do not see, you experience, you feel, that the buxom eye brings merely its element to the total thing, a shapeless giant forced upward. green were the curls upon that head.
Hate is only one of many responses true, hurt and hate go hand in hand but why be afraid of hate, it is only there think of filth, is it really awesome neither is hate don't be shy of unkindness, either it's cleansing and allows you to be direct like an arrow that feels something out and out meanness, too, lets love breathe you don't have to fight off getting in too deep you can always get out if you're not too scared an ounce of prevention's enough to poison the heart don't think of others until you have thought of yourself, are true all of these things, if you feel them will be graced by a certain reluctance and turn into gold if felt by me, will be smilingly deflected by your mysterious concern.
The poem hunter beach, exists under beech. in every young's hand, in every pal's reach. in each senile hand, in every gal's reach. if he wishes to learn, if she wishes to teach. freedom of silence, and freedom of speech. it sucks poets' blood, as an extending leech.
"let's get going hunting geese" said jack impatiently "i don't know how to use my sights" said john hopelessly "it can be lots of fun if you can use your gun" "just point and shoot up in the air" said tom aimlessly.
I am bereft of anger that has passed through rage for the empty humans that cannot share or partake in this one earth they have removed themselves from our greater ken and the union of all life they can no longer return to us, not due to being out laws but due to being outliers from the sum of our potential and better nature to know right from wrong and respect inherently the dignity of all life.
It seems like we thrive from the adrenaline flow while hunting the morning of the very first snow. for all the mornings that we practically froze when we can't feel our fingers, or the tips of our toes. yet, we still hunt day after day in anticipation of the moment we can finally say 'i got a deer' with a cheerful shout. as we jump up and down and run all about. we think it's skill, but it's mostly luck that feeling we get when we get our first buck. when we talk about the hunt, or the antler size no one knows the real truth, 'cause everyone lies. it's remembering our first hunt, as a girl or a boy when we felt the excitement with a heart full of joy. it's the fun that we have with our family and friends. it's the sharing and experience that we hope never ends. so, go deer hunting.just do it some day then you might understand what i'm trying to say. hunting deer is special to me so, try it sometime and you'll find out and see.
There ought to be a worldwide ban on whale hunting since all species of whales are becoming rare and of the justification of killing them in the name of so called science the enlightened and aware on the sensitive issue of whaling will tell you that this is all lies that killing in the name of science of marine mammals has always only been a guise for commercialism at the expense of endangered species the human record on conservation is bad the number of creatures extinct and facing extinction for to contemplate even too sad habitat destruction and killing creatures for greed of money in the world has never been more rife yet we do not own the planet we live on we too are part of it's natural life, 'tis true that extinction is forever as dead as the dodo they say and more creatures becoming extinct or facing extinction each day for centuries humans have been trying to destroy nature we pollute the rivers the land, sea and sky but nature will live on forever 'tis only ourselves we'll destroy so why not ban the needless slaughter forever of the last great mammals of the sea we must pay more respect to nature and protect her creatures the wildborn and the free.
They run for hours on end each day through grasses gray and brown race antelope to a stand still and drag big zebra down outlast the speedy wildebeest their victims die in pain those amazing cape hunting dogs the hunters of the plain. they have no sense of right or wrong they must hunt to survive and their young in den some ten miles off without fresh meat won't thrive the cape hunting dogs of africa don't have sins to forgive they risk their lives amidst flying hooves they kill so they can live. the cape hunting dogs of africa are creatures i admire they chase big game for miles and miles and never seem to tire their team work and companionship they live to serve the pack they often kill ten miles from home and trot the ten miles back. the cape hunting dogs of africa live as true family they chase big game for miles on end and work in harmony they have no choice but kill to eat if they don't eat they die and they risk their lives to serve the pack when hooves of hunted fly.

A so called sport of the upper class that inspired the bards to rhyme fox hunting is banned in britain everything has it's time for nothing last forever it had passed it's use by date and in chasing down and killing a frightened creature what is to celebrate? john masefield's long poem 'reynard the fox' i readily can recall one of the best on fox hunting if not the best of all but that aside fox hunting was cruel or to me 'twould seem that way for to be hunted down and mauled to death by dogs not what you'd call fair play. i read in the newspapers how those for fox hunting protested long and loud but there was nothing in this so called sport of which they could feel proud for to watch a creature torn to shreds could hardly be much fun it seems a far more painful way to die than the quicker death by gun. the day is near when all blood sports will be things of the past for all things have their use by date and nothing seems to last some may see the fox as vermin but the fox warrants a fair go and empathy for wild born creatures not too much to ask to show. fox hunting is banned in britain such good news is good to hear news well worth celebrating to that i'll drink a beer to be torn to shreds by a pack of hounds seems an awful way to die and to this very cruel blood sport good riddance and goodbye.
Hunting the light travelling down the sewers of this ungrateful soul of mine as the sickness becomes a squatter taken over my body and mind. the torment that's unleashed upon the unsuspecting visitors who just happen by chance to cross paths. thrown into the abyss without a care or second glance discarded, rendered useless left to die, a lonely death. as vibrant colours dissipates as their sparkles are dying out life has lost its meaning only inner struggles remain. but, i'm sure i heard it mentioned once of a light that still remains a tunnel with an exit light i'll search for, not in vain to find this elusive tunnel. where life begins again. hunting for the light of life. by annette aitken 2017.
For years we have gone hunting. i've loved sitting next to him in his deer blind or sitting quietly in my own. now that boomer came into our lives i see all living animals as having feelings and i can't stand the thought of hunting. boomer is our bassett hound. he thinks he is human. i sometimes think so too. the way he has shown me that he feels things like we do has changed me forever. now, all i can think of is that if a dog can feel emotions like we do. can a deer? are they afraid? do they know why we are sitting there? do they hate me? i have to explain this to my husband and pray he understands why our hunting days together are over.
Gun hunting season opens tomorrow morning my husband is gathering his hunting gear around. he'll be getting up really early in the morning way before the break of dawn. he's trying his special orange hunting cap on so that he's not mistaken for a deer. us wives always worry about that you know it is one of a hunter's wifes greatest fears. the weather is suppose to be very cold and rainy my husband says that is the best weather for hunting in. because the deer are on the move much more then when it's warmer like some recent days have been. i will say a prayer to our lord above asking that he protect all hunters, on this opening day. and that they all come back with that buck or doe their after and no bullets from their guns shot go astray.
When the sun rise in the morning then you shine like a brighten lady when the moon set in the evening then you look like a beautiful lady when i go to bed in the night then you twinkle like stars when the cool breeze touches me then i take care of your love when you are under my arms then i tell you how much i love you when i say my night prayers then i thank god for giving you to me when i close my eyes to sleep then you rest your head on my chest and listen to my heart beat says you are mine.
Inner voice straining to be heard evincing what i already know to be true yet your web of lies is so beautifully spun before me that i so want to find even the tiniest glimmer of truth in those lies convincing myself that those beautiful lies originated from some beautiful truth.
We loved eachother our hearts were warm you loved me i loved you back but the sands of time made our love lack i needed you and hated you also we screamed, we yelled our mutual hatred swelled the day finally came when you handed back your token the emotion inside had finally woken my spirit was broken i became a shell wishing you would burn in hell i wanted so bad to scream and yell my mind has been set up after all i swallow my demon, and then i fall.
If i am not in your life, do not mind however, i will come in your dreams every night every night i will come and sit, in front of you touching you and feeling your soft breaths hold your hand and looking into your lake eyes you are singing and i am listening your sweet voice my head on your sky laps you rolling your fingers into my hairs you dropping your love on me as a rain moreover, i play with like a little kid games and the time is come. the moon completed his journey stars are going his home we waked up and came out of the dreams here we saw beautiful morning scene sun is red and bright birds are singing cold polite wind flow, flowers are laughing moreover, we both are thinking about this beautiful dream.
God's beautiful sky you hold the earth in place your friends surround your beautiful face your friends the clouds are your beard long the birds fly through your white fluffy hair and sing to you a song you hold the heavens above and the earth below i can see you wherever i go your friends the sun and moon are your eyes and ears the moon shines bright through the night to sooth a child's fears a tree starts as a seed and grows up really high but never get to touch their friend the sky your friends the stars above are your tokens of love that sometimes shoot across your beautiful face you can see them up in space look at the sky cause it is watching you and when you see a rainbow your wishes will come true.
Standing on the edge of nothingness the wind of regret blowing through me as my deamons dance the ring of deception that i'm becoming more tempted to join 'come, ' i hear them say as they weave 'you belong to us, don't you see? the dreams that make you scream, the dark mistress that forever stands beside you, everything that makes you who you are is nothing but a beautiful lie to keep you alive.' how do you fight a shadow when you are weak; when misery is engraved into your soul? how do you resist the urge to fade away when all your heart ever feels is pain? love has long since abanonded me happiness stopped coming to my door years ago and i have fallen from grace since the day my heart broke so with nothing to lose and nothing to gain i take my deamons' hand and dance. and the lie takes my life.
Tears are falling, from beautiful eyes. tears are falling, because of beautiful lies. tears are falling, because of what you said. tears are falling, onto a beautiful bed. tears are falling, in a beautiful stream. tears are falling, because of a beautiful dream. tears are falling, because of your lies. tears are falling, as beautiful dies.
As i walked down the steps, my eyes caught your innocence. the moisture on your lips inviting to be kissed. your firm suple breast could not make me rest; and as you walked towards me all i wanted was us to be alone. as i see you bid farewell, i wish to see you again. but in my mind you shall remain forever as my beautiful little stranger.
In a world of barbies, implants and a size 26 waist heartache's no more prevalent than in her with a beautiful face. no more wanted for her looks than her heart her persona fades as soon as puberty starts. she screams celebrity in a small town manner in a world that passes judgement by how much you achieve she must use her 'talents' as the world perceives. as years go by her beauty's but a nuisance to the person inside made up of more substance. she screams celebrity in a small town manner there's no plastic surgery to alter your soul no place for outward beauty in the world of good will. to wed true love's but a leap of trust so she squanders her beauty as a matter of must. for small town love in true hollywood fashion.
A shimmering of your hair as i glance in awe a quiver of your lips as i swallow in anticipation a flashing of your eyes as i stand near not far a movement of your hips as i watch you walk a gesture of your hand as i lower my lips a laughter in the air as i make another quip a sigh from deep within as i tell you my intent a gasp from tender breast as i look so deep within a tremble in your legs as i make you remember and you have absolutely no doubt beauty is in the making through each breath each of us are together taking.
Beautiful this world, beautiful this life. beautiful and beautiful everyth ing including the sunrise and also the sunset. beautiful and beautiful, the sky and the sea, the air and the water. beautiful this life and beautiful this earth, where we are.
Simplicity is beauty, purity, divinity; the virtue of quality excels that of quantity. beauty that pleases the sense is good, beauty and vitue are good, seek for things simple but noble, virtue alone can ennoble. true beauty is simply graceful, the graceful are beautiful, there's beauty that's deceitful, nature itself is beautiful, beauty is perfection of form, virtue and good sense conforms, beautiful things may deform, but virtue act in good form.
Blue eyes so full of life a wonder all of their own so beautiful and precious oh to see those eyes smile such a beautiful sight how i love to look into those eyes when i look into them a kind of peace comes over me beautiful blue eyes always haunting me .teasing me reminding me of what i want.can't have why do they haunt me so when will i be free of them constantly held captive by those blue eyes beautiful blue eyes always there a reminder of what i want.can't have such beautiful blue eyes beautiful blue eyes.

One wading a fall meadow finds on all sides the queen anne's lace lying like lilies on water; it glides so from the walker, it turns dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you valleys my mind in fabulous blue lucernes. the beautiful changes as a forest is changed by a chameleon's tuning his skin to it; as a mantis, arranged on a green leaf, grows into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves any greenness is greener than anyone knows. your hands hold roses always in a way that says they are not only yours; the beautiful changes in such kind ways, wishing ever to sunder things and thing's selves for a second finding, to lose for a moment all that it touches back to wonder.
You appear there in front of me very nearly transparent your presence looking like a reflection in a mist shrouded mirror so hazy a strong puff might blow you away like fog yet this love is not the memory of a beautiful dream. when i reach out you are there.
I woke up my body was cold i climbed off the bed i tried not to fall i couldnt see everything was a blur i remember being beat before i reached unconciesness i heard them speak they talked of blood and the next chapter to the book of shadows i felt the blade but it didnt hurt i couldnt speak maybe i couldnt even breathe all i know is right now im in the hospital laying in the bed i hear the breathing machine behind me buzz inside my head who makes the decision?.
I walked to the cliff top to watch the sunset thinking of you and the time that we met i watched as the sun drifted down from the sky a reminding reflection of light in your eyes a myriad birds flocked from over the hill returning to roost as the world stood still their fawning and waving high up in the air brought memories to me how you unfurl your hair the sea seemed to amble as if in a trance when reaching the rocks leaping into a dance its light sparking rainbows in fine misty haze a lasting encounter of how we embrace the sun kissed the horizon like i kiss your lips it was saying goodnight with its light fingertips caressing the ocean and stretching my way a beautiful end to a beautiful day.
The world energy resources depleted and the oil wells are running dry and perhaps in a decade from now the super rich will become poorer when they realize their money cannot buy gas to put into their big cars parked in their garages the people with nowhere to go to yet it is a known fact out of hardship that spirituality can grow. we are being told that this is to happen by those one might say in the know the oil reserves won't last forever we heard of that decades ago yet what did we do to conserve energy we went out and bought bigger cars and spent billions in money and wasted huge amounts of energy building rockets for research on mars what will happen when the oil wells will run dry when the super rich will realize that government bureaucracies them were deceiving and leading them on with their lies will billionaires jump off of big buildings when with financial disaster they come face to face in a decade from now the world as we know it could be a much different place. in the future the world will be different and that may not be such a bad thing for nature will live on as usual and songbirds in the morning will sing and we must go back to the pushbikes and with less pollution in the air we will be far healthier people and more spiritually and environmentally aware.
The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy, and wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy; for falsehood now doth flow, and subjects' faith doth ebb, which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web. but clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds, which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds. the top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be, and fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see. the dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds, shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds. the daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know. no foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port; our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort. my rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ to poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy.
The soul it seeks to perch and pray a tune that renders fine without a stop when started forth it hopes to sing a line with feathers wafting at its crest like hornets in its nest in storm and lightning thunderous sounds appeal to all in zest the warmth that beats within the chest is hard concealed to spin but in the cold and on the seas its surely bound to win.
Forgetting all my care soaking the night's air as i sit in the gentle breeze it almost brings me to my knees. finally seeing what allah had in store, i look and i listen at creation galore. when i think of the different types of love, it moves me to help create a solution. what will happen in ten years or more, if we pass off the problems or simply ignore? the happiness we had today will turn into sorrow, so pitch in and help for a better tomorrow.
I think about the future, and i wonder about our life. to much hate for one planet, to much fear. somehow, i missed the announcement that love had died, i missed her funeral, i hope it was nice. lost; the masses cling to faith, while the homeless cling to paper sacks, filled with empty dreams, fading, like old yellow newspapers, in the rain. in the future, there will be a day, when life will be worth more than greed; and paper sacks, are just paper sacks. i hope it comes soon.
You do not confuse me you only confound the issues. i am not taken back by your ignorance only slightly delayed by it as i struggle to understand why i should care. i am weakened by my sense of humanity not by my love for it. for my love is the one true strength that keeps you from destroying me as i pause to consider any possible method to your madness.
Tis said of every individual that they can shape their own destiny though others will tell you quite differently and with such thinking would not agree who knows what will happen tomorrow who knows what your future will bring though at present you feel a bit ordinary and none other your praises do sing. you may try to shape your own destiny without taking circumstance into account and you may have great plans for the future and to little that too can amount to if destiny does not point in that direction your destiny and circumstance does play a huge part in your future our gift of life came about by chance. who knows what will happen tomorrow you may feel sad and tearful today tonight you may win first division tattslotto and you can celebrate in a big way or tomorrow for you than today little different with your same set of worries and woes as shaw once said 'life's not meant to be easy' but such is life one must suppose. who knows what the future will bring to you despite what some say it does seem to me that we cannot look into the future such things are beyond us to see those things known as circumstance and destiny a huge part in our lives do play and these two can make us or break us for in our future they have a big say.
As mountains dwell in timeless sleep, as seasons come and go as oceans roll across the deep, as forests slowly grow an evil has been gathering, a dark age has begun all life on earth shall rue this day, the time of man has come with axe and pick that chop and chip, the land shall be stripped bare with fire and steel, that burn and deal a death to all who care with hate and greed, that fuel and feed the coming of the end into a fate consumed with hate our world will now descend as mountains wake, roar and quake, as seasons loose their sway as oceans rise to turn the tide, and forests die away a giant is awakening, a cleansing will ensue all life on earth shall rue this day; the debt of man is due with rock and flame that smash and maim, life shall be erased with flood and wave, that drowns and paves a path to deaths embrace mother earth begins again, but none remain to tell that the balance is precarious, between paradise and hell.
The past is what makes me, me the now is what i choose to be the future is what i cant see if i live in the past the now wont last the future comes fast the past was bad the now is sad the future has to be glad the past is over and gone the now is here, so i go on the future is soon to come.
Is it true? that the future is always bright in the past there was not much light the future is ours to behold but what i was told in the future you get old the future will come this is sure yours and mine one sec. at a time until the final curtain our lives uncertain what the future will bring will be exciting.
A future time, a future place here on earth or out in space the doors are open if you choose to learn the skills that you can use computers you use every day atomic medicine is here to stay a walk on the moon is a thing of the past we're on our way to the stars at long last radar, and laser, and quasar, and such, these words sound strange, but they mean so much learn these things, and many more see what wonders the world has in store don't let folly lead you away from learning the skills you need so today have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow that the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow be good to yourself, and study with zest, and, soon, you will find you're ahead of the rest a future time, a future place here on earth or out in space the doors are open, come on through learn the skills, it's up to you.
We stand together, united as one, forward on we go, facing friend and foe. we do not turn back for regret; we have not time for that. if we make mistakes we will repair them at a future time, we can stop to help an injured soul, for a brief moment in time as we go. our mission lies, somewhere in the future, so we cannot linger here. what our mission is, only someone else knows. we will know what it is before the final curtains close.
In this world which will someday fall to ruims dreams and hopes don't matter at all oh, because you're asleep within your heart you will never awake but feel with those hands the future that can't be changed runing from your life even if i sacrifice this life that will someday burn out drowing in my dream even if i drown a dream is only but a dream you are my starlight.
We must wait for the future to see which is the land, which is the sea? we must wait for the time to decide who are the slaves, who are the free? we must wait for the future to see is the world ours, is the world thee? we must wait for the future to see is the man peaceful, is the mind free? we must wait for the future to see i love you? do you love me? you will be mine i will be thee i can dream it, i can see.
The vanishing future the lake we swam in, as children, is now a sea of knee high thistles, in summer evenings, that had no night, we fished for trout, now i see empty tins of sardines blinking in fading sunlight i had travelled long to get here fifty years or so, my old home was an oblong square on ugly ground, but i did find a rusty spade to dig my tiny space while smoking a last cigarette or two.
Looking into your eyes, i realize. my life will never be the same. i don't want to place any blame.. but after all it is your fault. i am happy and in love, the way i smile. the way i laugh. i think i've finally forgotten about my past.
Near the shore of that eventful destiny, hold us no resentments of the past. from the mistakes of the past, let us not challenge the present and my friend, i know i hurt you and even you hurt me. for the time on which we heal the past and erase our eroded egos and i promise i cause you no further harm, from my anger on which i reacted but not intentional. calm now the seashore and i know it is not easy to forget the clouds of shadows covered on one good friendship and at the end wisdom is not a flagship label to cover the pretences of life and i feel it is time to forget and forgive in grace as life is too short to settle scores on a battlefield to dampen the creative brightness of future.. november 30,2008.
I remember when love was a stranger in a lonely life i led, then you came along, and my world changed for the better. you put sunshine into my smile, air under my shoes, made me feel ten foot tall, and filled with love this empty shell. now love walks with me, everywhere that i go. the lonely life i lead is no more. you are my soul and inspiration as into the future we go.
The bombs have caused death and destruction and the families mourn their dead but there is hope for the future for better days ahead when those for peace and world harmony will finally prevail for those who talk of waging war are surely doomed to fail. there is hope for the future though i may not live to see my dream of a better life for everyone in a world where peace will reign supreme a world free of borders and camps for refugees where the smell of death and destruction is not blowing in the breeze there is hope for the future around me not all dark i hear young children playing in the playground in the park the children are the future and they may well unite behind a peaceful leader who won't lead by power of might. there is hope for the future and all surely not lost though there won't be peace tomorrow and 'twill come at a great cost the rose of peace will bloom again though with the dead i lay and the young and enlightened leaders to peace will lead the way.

The world beyond our shameless eyes is drowning more than we can see where money is what cheating buys but never seems to grow on trees tomorrow's dreams of yesterday have dissipated in the heat of poisons and ozone decay while houses crumble in the street our lives drone on repeatedly toiling toward some unknown end forlorn attempts die feebly to fix what time itself can't mend the government is fraudulent and slightly skewed toward tyrany what they say and what they meant shout greed and mass hypocrisy and for the future we invest no questions asked, no answers raised about the past we joke and jest yet disregard the present days but who's to blame, and who's to say? why should the 'land of liberty' or any other nation pay for crimes of all humanity?.
Neither have i measured the life with coffee spoon nor did hips ever become a drum to beat, at noon cruel hunger like autumn paved the path for spring i dreamed; for empty tummy within the poverty ring. i measured life with tear full tumbler like a gambler breathe stucks up on stake and eyes and mind blur initially lord gave me poverty and then thought now held pen with pain, for you, poems, i brought. whether you read or not, poems, here on poem hunter i will write, so as to ease myself and my agony, for barter.
Profit and loss sheets are spread separated by hyperboles and conjectures upon my desktop and the poverty of my brain as i try to amass some common sense approach to what it all means to me reduced receivables don't add up and one must make the deductions for the ever rising cost of raw materials discount specials on an inventory of older dreams i seem to have forgotten my humble beginnings when i loved life and not the dollar.
Nothing wrong has been done by dana majhi of kalahandi. he has just taken away on his shoulder, the dead body of his wife. the sweetheart of dana majhi, as you know, died in tb at the hospital. but let me ask a question why you people are so much worried about the incidents? it is because something wrong is there within you, it is because you are enjoying your life, at the cost of the people and doing no welfare acts so far. remember, the summum bonum of life is situated in the loving service of the people in any set up of govt. you are seeking happiness, true, by employing your senses in the modes of materialism, and you are not satisfied. it is true, you engage yourself in various philanthropic and altruistic works and all fail to give you satisfaction. it is happening only due to your own childish innocence, you are by nature eternal servitor of the people and you are taking away everything from the common men like dana majhi, and knowingly and unknowingly not providing the basic needs.
An infectious disease spread through the air or blood. nor a dominant gene passed down from father to son. want is not traced deep in the palm of your hand. no one chooses to go out daily alive with hunger. it is a silent burglar with a sharp knife cutting away at will. leaving behind only the form, the shape, the shadows of what we are.
I over heard two fellows arguing about poverty whilst i sat in the cafe drinking coffee and in truth i could not help but overhear them as they sat at the next table to me. the older of the two a silver gray haired fellow said to rid the world of want and poverty we would need to depose every despotic leader but the younger bloke with him did not agree. he said in so called wealthy societies there's want and hunger and where affluence is poverty too abound from here you don't walk far to see poor people for poverty is everywhere around. the older bloke countered but this is a free country and those in poverty have themselves only to blame and if hungry people in our midst are living do not expect me to feel any shame the younger man again with him did differ saying want is caused by those who only care for themselves alone and their own self interest many must grow poorer for to make one millionaire. i left them there in the cafe to argue and not for me to say who is wrong or right for both of them looked well dressed and well fed fellows and they won't go to bed hungry tonight.
Not every beggar is a poor man or a poor woman anytime. not every poor man is a beggar anytime. beggars versus poor people. poor people never beg for money or anything anytime. beggary is a bad deed that makes someone behaves badly and unwisely. poverty is not beggary and beggary is not poverty anytime. beggars are mostly greedy and liars simply because they beg for their greed and not for their poverty. most poor people never beg for money and for anything else in life. poverty is not a mistake, but beggary is a grave, ugly, and bad mistake. most of those who beg don't need to beg anytime simply because they are greedy anywhere and everywhere.
At least spare a thought for the children the children of poverty street they are homeless as young teenagers and against the odds they must compete their parents serving time for robbery and narcotic offences and most of their role models in jail their circumstance of birth is a huge mark against them the poor young people destined to fail. they steal for to buy food, drugs and alcohol on poverty street life is tough too young much too young to be homeless without shelter and sleeping rough they are pushed to the social fringes the young people society disown ignored by the government bureaucracies and to the police only known. who could envy them their existence those born into cruel circumstance the gods are completely against them of success they do not stand a chance for them life is such a great battle they must battle their ghosts of despair they don't even dream of the good life to them life is very unfair. you who waffle on of life's choices with you talk is always so cheap bet you were not homeless at thirteen and on a park bench had to sleep you would not talk of life's choices if you had to steal for to eat if you felt alone and abandoned like the children of poverty street.
Their skin soaks up the heat leaving it as black as the midnight sky, their eyes wide, white, pleading begging to the passersby. they litter the street half naked bodies, red and colouring their feet searching for a entrance a door out of the circle of poverty. poverty means destruction destruction means fear behind locked doors we sit in early evening too scared to see a black face terrified of black feet crossing the threshold. but why be fearful of your slaves, those you whip and beat treating like the dirt from the doormat where you wipe your feet. role diversity causes poverty poverty destroys peace but peace minus poverty means equality should increase.
It's killing me bit by bit it enhances my frustration i'm lonely because of it girls want wealth not adoration boys are as cheap as sweetmeat but i can't change my condition oh i feel like i'm unfit like a house with no foundation like a guy of the street.
And what is poverty in which we are busy in discussing so much? is not poverty lacking of faith? has it some friend and if yes who are they? we are fully aware poverty is nothing but a mental status so long as we are telling we have brain, let the brain in its way. and we are in our world with every richness with us.
Poverty seems like a repellent stuck on the poor whose only fault lies in owning no property or asset to parade among wealth admirers and worshippers to whom poverty seems dour in contexts where ostentatious display of wealth cuts the grade that profligacy and extravagance attract robbing the poor of the dignity glitter as though on purpose fleas of poverty they contract dumping ugliness on the poor on whom fruits of affluence litter dwindling humanness and affection which wealth simpleton conflate into little human worth and warmth where spooks of poverty deflate in proportion to the increase in affluence sloth sown, grown and thrown with utter scorn to belittle abject poverty misguided affluence thinkers warn amounting to little less than spittle poverty peels off humbug and complacency exposing deeper layers of flawed humanity denuded of perspicacity and sagacity sometimes concealed in the deficit of humility that often mars circles of affluence where possession seems to epitomise human dignity mistakenly regarded as diluted influence the poor exert in extolling human unity shorn of wealth affinity and motility.
Wild horses we pricked at the wind, never to know, alas; that all the lord of our fortunes bought for us was poverty grass. poverty grass the paupered seed so sickly poor, alas; the souls of the great untamed grow weak despair on poverty grass. and you, my friend, grew sick awhile, and cried and cried, alas; while i grew fat on a flowering weed called pride and poverty grass. and when you left the field to me i almost died, alas; for i was left in a fallow field piled high in poverty grass. wild horses we pricked at the wind, never to know, alas; that all the lord of our fortunes bought for us was poverty grass. 24 january 1980.

A room i saw where the babu of poverty had been a frequent visitor few walls were stark naked as if they never wore anything and a few were shedding away the color they were draped in the room had nothing in it no furniture, nothing much to address as wearable, a small blanket was there with dust marks and small holes which seemed at least two decades old and must've at some point been the food of rats roaming around as i looked around i found a few broken, rusted kitchenware kept in a corner, a clay pot to store water which was dripping from the roof so that for drinking it can be used the room was like a cell allotted to criminals hardly you can find an entrance for the air the smoke coming out of the beedi that the man in lungi was inhaling was all it had to offer. he was coughing, spitting in the broken bucket he had there was no sign of sunshine even when it was 12 at noon on my watch, food looked like a distant visitor to his house it seemed, it liked the dustbin of a rich more than the stomach of a poor his eyes told me a story a story that i can never forget, when my eyes met his of broken bodies and shattered dreams of a frustrated soul and fractured beliefs i could easily sense his disbelief in gods not a single image of idol was there in the entire room bhagavad gita and quraan too were invisible to my eyes maybe because god didn't come to save his family when corruption ate it alive? it was then when kareem ran in saying 'chacha jaan, mla sahab has come to our slum.' but no, he didn't move an inch instead, he just blabbered something in muffled voice and then lit another beedi up, it seemed as if he knew all the tactics of these white dacoits.
he was all alone now with wrinkled face and hands that trembled, no longer could he pull a rickshaw or clean a garden, what he could only do is to count the beads of the rosary of death. written by sutputra radheye.
If i would own nothing, poverty would be my name if i would acquire wealth, with it a name now i pass by my friends of old they are as strangers, as my feelings are cold money has spoiled my heart of flesh and has relinquished the warmth that was once fresh now as i grow old and start to reflect i realize my mistakes, but can no longer connect and for this i weep, for when all has been said what i have been left, is no better than one dead.
You look at the poverty of other people romancing it like a metaphor in your poetry the color of a man's unwashed shirt with mud and blood, dried sweat, the sound of a hungry baby like the sound of thunder coming from the breasts of mountains the ignorant woman like a beautiful native naked and bathing in the river and rising like a famous nude painting their poverty to the rhythm of some blues the colors in brown, and black and violet and scarlet the trembling hands and biting lips and blank stares the blackest background ever to a future as bleak as ember to a poverty hopeless as ever.
It is true poverty is a relative thing a poor bloke buys his girlfriend a ten dollar ring but to a pauper one with ten dollars is not poor at all what to one seems big to another seems small, that poverty is a relative thing seems so true you may well be poor but many poorer than you there are millions of homeless on poverty street searching in rubbish bins to find something to eat and there are millions who lay down to rest hungry at night and sleep in the open under the starlight at least you have a roof over your head and a bed on which to lie and it will not be of malnutrition that you will die and of those down on their luck the singer may sing but poverty can be a relative thing.
An egotistical backlog of creditors waiting in line waiting to take the cloths off your back and the skin off your bones all to make money and to make you broke while the politicians who got into power laugh and smirk.
Freedom in our land not gives us enough food, freedom in our land not has enough work, freedom in our land creates the lazy cowards, freedom in our land not worth to have power of people, believe me that we are free to do anything that could, walking through the streets to find out the meaning, of acquired freedom that we have to materialize nothing. what a rush is this, human have no direction to go towards, what a mad rat race is it, that human take part in it, what a planner are these people, who neglect the people in their planning, what type of freedom is it that put, minds of people in the prison of poverty?.
Poverty is an baleful curse. a more terrible curse than the plaque. poverty hits innocent lives. tears peoples relationships. brings you into a black hole. poverty is an elixir of depression. brings on fearfulness. like a malicious dragon. poverty is ones worst adversary. hard to prevent and slay.
This animal is there, waiting with cruel claws, the teeth are sharp, always hungry and vigil, eating all our flesh, leaving us in skeletal structure, this animal likes the shout, as our cries are the lullabies, it never sleeps, but pretends to be quiet, it sucks our blood for its thirst, our sisters grow beautiful, our brothers are handsome and bold, they are disturbed by this animal, whenever they go out for survival, brains are the factories of sorrows, before we reach our rice pots, this animal regularly eat the last morsel, millions of people eat a meal a day, as long as this animal is happy and gay, where the human are careless and weak, this animal is very strong and in attack mode.

Eradication of poverty all over the world a must and justice to the people poverty is not at all a curse or to blame it is surely the system's failure in sharing. poverty the most dreaded thing to experience to a thinking mind to live without food or to the barest minimum of necessities where it is denied is a cruel thing to experience blame the world of poverty and try for corrections share the resources to such an equality at least for two square meals a day and minimum necessities that humans want respect the human being and its dignity all over surely poverty is the most objectionable thing the confidence of life losing in its bottom lines the unhelpful society accuses the poverty as fate. the world is so improved in living conditions but the system in sharing is rotten and old change those inequalities in perfect peace allowing the human life more possibilities and change. life is short and human life is precious only the world order can save the humans the world is fully capable to look after if there is a perfect world with change of mind contentment, kindness, and humanity be preserved.
Water simmers on the stove grater is turning to pieces, a dry clove eyes shimmer with vapour at the door outside, enjoying with smells, a beggar inside intestine is being cut with dagger life is such a mirage with darkest craze they are fit, meadow green they graze.

I see the passion in your eyes i feel the warmth of your embrace i see every curve and crevice in the beauty of your face. i've seen the passion in you rise to a boiling point of no return and the touch of you to my skin burn. in you is the beauty of the stars and the depth of the universe and at the same time the emptiness of space to capture you, a long frenzy race. for your beauty is far beyond compare and is something that i'm willing to share except for the love that i know is locked up inside. for when this love is finally set free you will hear all church bells ring. this love will touch every mans soul and the core of all their hearts and pull up feelings which they did not know could exist. and turn their lives into 'heavenly bliss'. this is the passion that you have within and if not reached, a downright sin,.

Passion a red rose waiting to be given a light touch on the arm a cuddle close a passionate kiss under the stars a pen carefully handled to write a lover letter to a special person a dance upon a dance floor before the sea a slow walk upon the beach in the sunset passion existing in all of us, however deep.
Once in a saintly passion i cried with desperate grief, "o lord, my heart is black with guile, of sinners i am chief." then stooped my guardian angel and whispered from behind, "vanity, my little man, you're nothing of the kind. ".
Beware, my love of the thunder that we will encounter when we touch beware, my love of the rain the outpourings of the pain for the lost time beware, my love of the lightning the resurrection that it will bring of our dormant desires beware, my love of the flood the mingling of our blood when our skins dissolve beware, my love of the reverbration the resounding celebration of our eternal embrace.
When do you want our breaths to meet? when do you want our souls to touch? when do you want to feel the heat? and make me drunk on our love? when do you want our gazes to entwine? and then taste each others sweetness? when do you want our dreams to be love lined? when do you want to surrender to this madness?.
Love is a breeze of the dawn caressing our skin, passion is a fire which melts our heart. love is kindness that touch and does not get aged, passion is a volcano that blows up in eruption. love is a lasting feeling, passion is a transitory alienation. love is peace, serenity, complicity. passion is affliction, suspicion, desillusion. love is union of two human beings in communion, passion is conjunction of bodies in ecstasy and possession. .
When will the warmth of your cheek rest against mine? when will the stream of kisses gush on my ravine? when will your heartbeat rhyme with mine? when will i stop writing these verses and become thine? when will the fire of love envelop us and enshrine? when will the winter suddenly get warm with our heat combined? when will we be drunk on each other and not need any wine? when will the moon become bewitched with our embrace divine?.
Give me such passion that it knows no end let my heart grow wings and take flight again allow me such love that i feel with each embrace overwhelming fires that grow with the thrill of chase grant me such a kiss that my heart escapes my chest such a beating against my ribs that my pain tolerance is at test bestow upon me such passion that nothing else exists warm me with your arms bless me with your lips touch me with such tenderness that i cannot believe that such passion could exist inside someone like me.
Your kiss, your gaze or your breath what do i cherish more? your breath that i breathed suffusing me to the core sanctifying me. have kept it inside safely stored every breath that i breathe intermingles with it and roars ecstatic in its union electrifying me. keeping me alive.
It reasons the warmth when chilled gracious delight to know the rising sun to be shined as when quivering by the frost when intense by the wind shedding the pains the woes when alone may be flicked by yet it rocks her up by shadows as dark for all the raved up alphabets as when learned whispering the love as when rambled by the passion through latticed window the light when goes away flicking bye shadows as melting saddened by the glooms into the room of its repose as wrinkled yet in silence poised by the pretensions.
A haunting melody a lilting song invades my senses staying long a whiff of your fragrance brought by the wind permeates my skin mingling within fleeting images forever in the pond of my heart now i see your face staring at me stark are you for real or just a mirage? dreams dont come true in life's collage let me dip and drown in my own dream where you and i will fly and stream.
Taking your hand fingers touch my lips i want to love every inch of you taste every part of you to drink your love through your very pores lay down beside me feel my body crying for you i want to get lost. your sweet caresses touching my soul want me, like no other need me, like air join me to make one mind, one soul fused in the heat of passion existing in this moment.
Today i dont want to close my eyes my heart tells me that your image is going to fly from the horizon of my heart to its beyond i want to capture the image forever in the pond a sacred reflection into which i can dip when the sun is too strong and sip its drops when i want to quench my thirst when my throat is parched and i want to burst into a song.
Shivers and cries secrets of passion kisses you and lies secrets of passion floats you even higher secrets of passion crashes you into a pit o' fire secrets of passion you feel deffered secrets of passion please. just die in vain.
O gentle love, ungentle for thy deed, thou makest my heart a bloody mark with piercing shot to bleed. shoot soft, sweet love, for fear thou shoot amiss, for fear too keen thy arrows been, and hist the heart where my beloved is. too fair that fortune were, nor never i shall be so blest, among the rest, that love shall seize on her by sympathy. then since with love my prayers bear no boot, this doth remain to cease my pain, i take the wound, and die at venus' foot.

Last night i dreamt of you continuing what we couldnt complete our salivas intermingling lips travelling from head to feet mmm.whole body tingling bare on the sheet our souls singing. you, the hunter and i, the prey and then the prey becomes the hunter satiating our hunger but the bodies are not enough our thirst goes deep to dive into the soul to make each other complete where its pure and divine we dont feel the heat happy in our respective shrines we are floating amidst pristine white clouds thousands of angels come out and enshroud showering us with rose petals and we are endowed with their blessings.
I wish i was the morning wind gently brushing against your skin i wish i was a ray of sunlight giving you warmth that would stay through the night i wish i was a dropp of wine that mingled in your blood making it my shrine i wish i was the fragrance in the garden of love where you were a prince i wish i was the spring in your life with blossoms spreading their wings i wish i was your breath enervating you, keeping you alive.
Lost in the vortex of my thoughts seeking a vision that got lost fire consumed or a lost monsoon parched earth awaiting a boon a solitary traveller in an undulating desert that got lost. come show me the way in your light, everything is clear and its a sunny day in your absence, its all dark and queer all thoughts gone astray come show me the way in your sound, everything is music to the ears to which i dance and sway in your absence, cacophony blares all notes dark and gray come show me the way in your touch, everything is pure with a bright spark and a ray in your absence, cannot endure even my own skin, t'is like clay.
Lay down on your pillow and turn the lights down low let me take you to the garden where the passion flower grows close your eyes and enter dreams as love's emotion sets the scene and flitters through the garden where the passion flower grows touch the tender petals of the flower as she grows a tentative endeavour as your feelings overflow let me draw you to the place where ecstasy can be embraced the beauty of the garden where the passion flower grows feel your mind exploding in the heavy scented air experience the shiver as your captured unaware a little touch of heaven where imagination flows the valley in the garden where the passion flower grows.
Everytime i am near you i can feel your passionate gaze i just want to let you do whatever you want i feel helpless when i am around you your kisses are like poison they knock me senseless for hours at a time and your sweet caress is more than i can bear it all makes me feel helpless when i am around you i shouldn't be wanting you like i do i can't help it that you have me under your spell no matter how hard i try to fight it i still feel myself falling for you every time that i look at you i can feel the toxins of your passion burning through me now your passion is burning in me too your passion is like a wild fire it burns deep within your heart and soul i can feel it when you look at me i can feel it when we kiss oh how i love to see your passion burning so brightly.
I just want to keep looking at you what have you done to me, baby? your smile quenches my inner thirst the spark in your eye lights up my being i feel alive like a germinating seed after a winter freeze i feel light like a butterfly kissing the blushing blossoms i feel beautiful like the full moon getting slowly uncovered i feel complete like the parched earth after a thunderous rain i am almost afraid to touch you lest my dream come to an end.
It lies in all of us, sleeping, waiting and though unwanted, unbidden it will stir open its jaws and howl it speaks to us, guides us passion rules us all, and we obey, what other choice do we have? passion is the source of our finest moments the joy of love, the clarity of hatred, and the ecstasy of grief it hurts sometimes, more than we can bear if we could live without passion maybe we'd know some kind of peace but we would be hollow, empty rooms, meaningless lives, withiut passion we'd be truly,.
Thou shalt not laugh, thou shalt not romp, let's grimly kiss with bated breath; as quietly and solemnly as life when it is kissing death. now in the silence of the grave, my hand is squeezing that soft breast; while thou dost in such passion lie, it mocks me with its look of rest. but when the morning comes at last, and we must part, our passions cold, you'll think of some new feather, scarf to buy with my small piece of gold; and i'll be dreaming of green lanes, where little things with beating hearts hold shining eyes between the leaves, till men with horses pass, and carts.
Such is the passion the want of desire to burn in the heart with fingers of fire wet lashes wrapped up, in a sweet velvet rose to follow your heart where ever it goes such is the passion the heart strings to pull that the cup runneth over, with emotions so full to send you to heaven, the stars and above to make senses reel in the sweet dance of love such is the passion in the depths of ones soul infuses ones mind and the dreams in the role of a lovers sweet kisses, to imprint its mark of secret assignations alone in the dark such is the passion the fire inside shines forth from the eyes, with nowhere to hide yet the heart and the mind, will tumble and fall if signals mistaken, will then wither and stall.
Flames of raging lust, thoughts of fiery dust, sparkling kindled hearts blazing in the dark. arms enfolding, holding tight, bodies joining in the night, hands soft and tender, grasping, rending flesh that lithely writhes against their probing, sending mind into ecstatic states; to which you may relate. groaning, moaning cries of joy, crimson sounds on pink rustled silk. penetrating shrieks that thrill, reaching down to earth, rising up so high, and slowing to a restful glow, ambers of the heat that flowed; not anything you don't already know and most likely can relate.
My house is full of roses the fragrance seeping through my skin into my blood racing to the heart permeating and settling within i am intoxicated not by its fragrance but by your streaming presence waking, sleeping, in everything that i do your thoughts have possessed me through and through.
My head's in the clouds., i'm not sure i can last., breathing heavy., and my heart's beating fast., can it be the passion of you., the emotion of you., the warmth of you., the fire of you.? ? ? what can i do.? ? ? with the passion of you.? ? ? it's driving me mad., the passion of you.
I think and thought i hoped and wished i cried and mourned i yelled and laughed i screamed in excitement then i realised it was passion. passion is strong it is intense it is a great feelin of emotion love, hate, desire, enthusiasm, fondness, zeal, affection and ardor. a man without passion is like a man without life. yes, i pride in myself, i have life because i have passion, i know love i show affection i know what it is to be fond of i can give warmth i am full of ardor. just when i was begining to be exalted by my feelings you came into my life, i found you in my soul then i knew what i claimed was passion, was nothing compared to what you gave me. i came to realise that passion wasn't anything else but a woman.and not just any woman, it was you. then i remembered 'a man without passion is a man without life.without you i'm incomplete, without passion i have no life now i can boast of passion of love of life. because i have you.
You sing i will be the mountain and hold your voice deep inside you feel i will be the earth and keep your vibrations in my core you cry i will be the ocean keeping your sacred drops alive you chant i will be the holy hymn, we shall soar you fly i will be the sky, always holding you high you dance i will be the music that you wore.
My beast has been awakened. i shiver from its reverie. my desire raised in a breath. the beast hungers for you. candlelight flashes across your face. eyes intoxicated with lust. i want you. i can't think when you have been close. nothing is right. nothing is wrong. need overtakes me and i am a slave to it. a slave to you. my beast hungers. still. copyright 2006 a.j. mckinley.
Untie the knot for me of your deep inner secrets. give me the key of your inner fantasies where u have been drowning. let me swim in the sea of your dreams, desires and longings. let me unravel the mysteries of your mind thats made you blind thats been raging in you tormenting you spending you lusting in you bursting in you. come. touch me and feel the peace walk into your soul. the storm will cease. feel the calm like a balm. stop searching and yearning. feel my aura. embrace it if you hug me close you can share it.
Weave me into you you, the warp and i, the weft in between, no space left if anyone tried to tear will fail, because we will share a bond so strong with an amalgation of our spirits no you no me only we only we.
Passion does not have culture's or level's of studies passion comes from the heart, how one sees life from inside the soul, passion is like a savage animal, that does not understand or knows what he feels; but has inside him the passion that awakes his instinct of savage love, passion has nothing but a soul and a desire to love.
As real as air, earth and water as real as a lovers fight as real as teh laughter of a child in delight. as real as the expanse of the sea as real what lurks underneath as real as the lovers glee of an unexpected rendevous. come and touch my heart and make me real gaze into the depth of my soul make it sublime and surreal.
I wish you to unfold me i wish you to hold me i wish you to undress me i wish you to bless me i wish you to ravage me i wish you to savage me i wish you to blaze me i wish you to daze me i wish you to love me love me to death i wish you to smother me smother me with your love i wish you to inspire me inspire me to sing sing with you together where we can view and feel a garden of paradise.
Night of passion, the day of feelings, you see my smile, you see my joy you filled my dreams, you fill my empty sadness, my night with you, my day with to you your passion, my sweet passion, you wish my eternal wish, i wish your eternal wish, nights to love, those are nights of passion.
My heart is a wanderer in love may it ever remain so roaming in the pathless land in a caravan just going where the winds blow. sometimes rendered miserable blown in all directions in search of my eternal love fable inspite of all defections always singing the song of love. longing for the moon searching in the dunes will only be still when it becomes crystal that there is no breath left for me to fulfill.
Try my love song from the heart inside let it touch here through its going feel the gathering of its truest glide as it is willingly and knowing with some passion that touches me with some passion that touches me let the beauty from within come right here through the deep of the dark night with its flowing and its limits to share till all its touches become alright in the end of its limitless deep of the hours from down dark under with its dances and beats to keep as we drift though the waves asunder with some passion that touches freely with some passion that touches freely i might be in heart feeling lonely though i had my luck in its try you are touching my soul here and only filling moments with each their try with some passion that touches me with some passion that touches me try my love song from the heart inside let it touch here through its going feel the gathering of its truest glide as it is willingly and knowing with some passion that touches me with some passion that touches me with some passion that touches me.
I want to become. a dropp with no thoughts a stop that no one sought nothingness so that i can absorb empty so that i can fill until i fill you in and illuminate in your sight and i become your ray. you, my light.
I was drunk with the sobriety of my love wandering with a passion of a possessed soul swimming in the azure waters of my wonderous cove thought that i had discovered love that was whole in your light, the rays that touched me set me ablaze torching a flame in my heart, urging a song to give, to surrender, to live forever in this love haze and to live in this radiant light for as long as the fire crackled in this warm universe and the monsoon made love to this thirsty earth drenched in this ecstasy, i let the beauty dance unleashing a rapturous force that shook my soul breathing new life in me with just one of your glance words pouring out to celebrate this romance in this dawn of hope, he came with a searing kiss and woke me up from this languid dream where i had got lost in the timeless bliss now completely awake, dazzled by the sunbeams groping in the darkness of my subconscious all i remembered, t'was a dream.so sensuous.
The star of my mishap impos'd this paining, to spend the april of my years in wailing that never found my fortune but in waning, with still fresh cares my present woes assailing. yet her i blame not, though she might have blest me, but my desire's wings, so high aspiring, now melted with the sun that hath possess'd me, down do i fall from off my high desiring, and in my fall do cry for speedy speedy. no pitying eye looks back upon my mourning, no help i find when now most favor need i; th'ocean of my tears must drown me burning. and this my death shall christen her anew, and give the cruel fair her title do.
The sun is not just a special star huge balls of hot gases are stars spinning in space so big so hot and giving heat and light to the earth larger than one million earths is the shining sun in front of our face. we must never look directly at the sun cos it's not fun its brightness will damage the eyes the sun gives lives to all creatures on earth to all births, animals, human beings n natures when sun shines the stars shine all the time day and night the sun's so bright, it hides the light of the other stars with a steady light's broken up as it passes through the earth's atmosphere oh my dear, how beautiful they look, sparkle twinkle little stars. the earth spins or rotates on its axis in geographic, we have.night and day, who wonder how? the axis is an.imaginary line, going through the centre of the earth taking 24 hours at once for the earth to spin around. at night, one side of the earth moves away from the sun that part is the darkness..as the sun seems to sink below look at the horizon, the darkness is starting filling the dawn sky with the rich dark beautiful colours, changing to night time very very slow.
Once upon a shining star, i made a wish and it came true. i wished for someone for me to love, and then i was loving you. you quickly became my everything, my hopes my desires and my dreams. though we had our share of problems, they were never as bad as they seemed. but apparently they were bad enough, you decided to part and go your own way. life for me has been an empty void, since i couldn't convince you to stay. in all my life i have seen so much, i never imagined there could be more. but trying to face each day without you, is the toughest thing i've had to endure. the saddest part about you being gone, is that i no longer have my trusted friend. i guess i always thought you would stay, and we'd be together until the end. so today i'm searching for another star, one that i can wish upon once more. i'll wish for you to come back to me, to be the lover and friend i so adore. 2004.
Go and catch a falling star, get with child a mandrake root, tell me where all past years are, or who cleft the devil's foot, teach me to hear mermaids singing, or to keep off envy's stinging, and find what wind serves to advance an honest mind. if thou be'st born to strange sights, things invisible to see, ride ten thousand days and nights, till age snow white hairs on thee, thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, all strange wonders that befell thee, and swear, no where lives a woman true, and fair. if thou find'st one, let me know, such a pilgrimage were sweet; yet do not, i would not go, though at next door we might meet; though she were true, when you met her, and last, till you write your letter, yet she will be false, ere i come, to two, or three.
My apologies to chance for calling it necessity. my apologies to necessity if i'm mistaken, after all. please, don't be angry, happiness, that i take you as my due. may my dead be patient with the way my memories fade. my apologies to time for all the world i overlook each second. my apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first. forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home. forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger. i apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths. i apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a.m. pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time. pardon me, deserts, that i don't rush to you bearing a spoonful of water. and you, falcon, unchanging year after year, always in the same cage, your gaze always fixed on the same point in space, forgive me, even if it turns out you were stuffed. my apologies to the felled tree for the table's four legs. my apologies to great questions for small answers. truth, please don't pay me much attention. dignity, please be magnanimous. bear with me, o mystery of existence, as i pluck the occasional thread from your train. soul, don't take offense that i've only got you now and then. my apologies to everything that i can't be everywhere at once. my apologies to everyone that i can't be each woman and each man. i know i won't be justified as long as i live, since i myself stand in my own way. don't bear me ill will, speech, that i borrow weighty words, then labor heavily so that they may seem light.
The star that surrounds me, the star has gone away. can we look forward to seeing it again? is it death calling for me? is it light from up above. no one knows except for me. it's hope and laughter crashing me down into the street. i need you.
I walk over to the place we used to visit, where laughter filled the rims of each cup, flowing over with desire and subdued embraces. blue flowers floating on crimson waves making its way into the enchanting waters. i reach for a petal, the beauty of it stands visible, accepting rays of golden light from the sun, extending her arms out to sprinkle kisses upon the silver sand below my feet. wind from the east brushes me with thoughts of you, and the place where you once sat lit up from a falling star, i hold on to the passion within, and close my eyes to see the light on your face, only knowing that deep inside me, you reside.
