All Reason Cast Aside. The Sheer Pleasure Of A Oneness, Feverish, Passionate, Wanting More. More Pleasure, More Hot Steamy, Wet Tongues Flickering.

Brunette Lady With Dark Mysterious Eyes, You Even Mesmerize The Moonlight Falling Softly Upon You With Love. In A Midnight Garden, Roses Sleep Like Happy Angels, But You Walk With A Man Kissing The Nape Of Your Neck, Running His Hand Beneath Your Blouse To Touch Your Stomach In Ecstasy. The Heavens Are Breathing Romance, Amorous Gods And Goddesses Are Disrobing, The World Is Becoming Intoxicated With The Wine Of Desire, And You Alone Surpass Them All With Your Supple Body Of Captivating Dreams, With The Slightest Movements Of Your Breasts Making Every Gazing Man Tremulous, Setting Off Lovely Eruptions. It Is Impossible To Possess You, But I Would Repeatedly Kiss The Pillow That Has Cradled And Caressed Your Head While You Peacefully Slept And Left The World Anxiously Waiting To See Your Magnificent Vision Again.

Wait Mister. Which Way Is Home? They Turned The Light Out And The Dark Is Moving In The Corner. There Are No Sign Posts In This Room, Four Ladies, Over Eighty, In Diapers Every One Of Them.

They Lock Me In This Chair At Eight A.m. And There Are No Signs To Tell The Way, Just The Radio Beating To Itself And The Song That Remembers More Than I. Oh, La La La, This Music Swims Back To Me.

They Then Might Make The Car Sun Visors A Little Larger To Stop The Sun Getting In Your Eyes. 11 February 2008.

Red Lotus Incense Fades On The Jeweled Curtain. Autumn Comes Again. Gently I Open My Silk Dress And Float Alone On The Orchid Boat. Who Can Take A Letter Beyond The Clouds? Only The Wild Geese Come Back And Write Their Ideograms On The Sky Under The Full Moon That Floods The West Chamber. Flowers, After Their Kind, Flutter And Scatter. Water After Its Nature, When Spilt, At Last Gathers Again In One Place. Creatures Of The Same Species Long For Each Other. But We Are Far Apart And I Have Grown Learned In Sorrow. Nothing Can Make It Dissolve And Go Away. One Moment, It Is On My Eyebrows. The Next, It Weighs On My Heart.

A Woman And A Man Walk By Together, Their Shadows Painted Filigree On Weather. Gazing Steadfastly Upward Beyond Dying, They Memorize Whatever Birds Are Flying.
When Sunsets For Night Sorrow Drifts In, Whispering Through The Trees. Her Gown Flutters Through The Air As She Glides Over Me. Setting Quietness Throughout The Land, In A Dangerious Whisper That Gave Me Shivers. The Despair Settled Over Me, As Her Calming Deadly Wrath, Wrapped Me In A Blanket Of Sadness.
When I Dream I Dream Of Sorrow, My Dreams Are Long And Dark, I Can Hear The Sond But Never See The Color, My Dreams Leave Me Awake Some Nights Thinking, Some Dreams Are More Of A Story, But All Have Sarrow And Pure Sadness, The Trees Are Dead Im The Last Alive, All My Dreams End The Same, A Rock And A Bang, The Rock Is The Earth, More Sorrow Then The Night Before, My Dreams Are Deep And Make Me Wright Things Like This, The More I Dream The More I Cry, The More I Cry The More I Think About My Own Death, Will A Die At 90 Of Age Or 15 From A Gun, Will The Killing Ever Stop, Will We Ever Know How The World Ends, My Dreams Paint A Dark And Stormy Picture, My Poems Paint A Clear, My Mind Crys Of Dark Things Like This, My Hart Crys Harder And Harder, Between Sweet And Sour, I Think The End Will End Sour, Are We To End In Fire Or Ice, You Chose I Would Rather End In Ice,.
Yet I Do Remember The Hoary Stance Of Night Rolling Spumes Away Into Onshore To Heap Of Sands Yet Not Unknown History Yet Records Reels Of Fire. Where Are Those Tiding Whelms From Hide Speckles Ocean Pierce Into Air Unfailing Whispering Dew Of Roses Basking In Glow Moon Seemingly Snored In Valley Of Obscurity Mystery May Uncover The Flings Of Sorrow Night When Chilled Being Chiseled Of Snow Do We Ever Know The Eternity By Reality? Rainbow Is Ephemeral By Voyage To Void.
Rivers Are Like The Life We Share, Sometimes We Go Fast, Sometimes We Go Slow, My River Is Slow And Filled With Sorrow, It Seems Endless, Never Turns And Always Follows The Same Path, Far From Anyone Or Any Place, Alone My River Stands And Alone It Shall Stay, The Sorrowful River With A Path So Untold, Will My River Of Sorrow Ever Cross Paths With One Other,.
The Women Of Your Age I Train My Eyes On Remind Me Of You Through Some Resemblances And Some Violent Contrasts Now And Then. Nose Studs And Ear Drops I See In The Shops Catch My Eyes And Bring To My View Your Face. I Imagine The Stud Worn On Your Nose And With That How Your Nose Would Tempt My Lips. I Imagine The Drops Hung From Your Ears And With That How Your Ears Would Prompt Me. When I Am Lonely You Are In My Thought; I Dream Of Passing My Hand Through Your Hair And Gazing Into Your Eyes Full Of Love. To Bring This About, I Must Conquer Fate As I Accuse Myself Of Cowardice. I Have No Courage Nor Propriety Even To Let You Know My Feelings. This Is My Sorrow That Cripples My Mind. This Is My Agony Underlining. 02.11.2008.
The Tear Of Sorrow Runs Down My Cheek Friendship Is What I Seek I Used To Think I Had It All But Now My Backs Against The Wall And My Heart Has Been Broken And These Words Are Unspoken I Look Back At My Past And Wish The Sorrow Would End My Life At Last.
Together They Make A Bond Together They Stay For Life Long Together They Walk And Stand And Sleep Together They Play, Sing And Weep Together They Stay For Life Long In The End They Write Their Song And If They Ever Separate They Make The World A Bad Place Till They Meet Once More.
By The River, Under The Sorrow Tree, The Universe Says The Bones Must Dance, And She, Who Goes Out With A Net To Catch The Spirits, Returns, Her Hands Filled Only With The Dark Briars We Have Hummed These Many Years. The One Who Sees Sorrow Cannot Staunch It, Yet By Her Side Something White Announces Itself. The Bones Are Sucked Clean, The One Nearest The Heart Becomes A Flute, When You Blow, The Dead Come And Behind Them, The Other Bones In A Circle The Universe Says Loss Demands Birth And The Two Are Lovers.
There Was A Sound Amongst The Hills, Echoing In The Valley Of Wind, A Challenge Was Made. Dark Birds Flew Over The Grey Sky Fire, Smoke, Cloud, Dust Blinded The Gods, All Hope Was Lost. A Man Stepped Up, Undaunted By The Demons Drew His Sword, With All Its Glory Marched On A Lake So Placid, In A Forest So Dark God Be With The Soul Who Passes Thee For He Do Not Know What Lurks Beneath, Riding Into The Forest, The Land Of Men Seemed Distant, There Was No Turning Back, The Fiery Horse Galloped Away An Abyss Of Oblivion For Those Who Dwell Among The Trees. Life An Eternity Of Sorrow. There Lay The Enemy, Cold; With A Force So Tremendous That He Couldnt Fight, But Home Was Far Away. The Winding Road, To The Gates Of Hell Was Gleaming In Delight. Despair Was In The Air. The Sword Was Broken. The Gods Wept That Day, For Their Loyal Soldier Had Fallen. Tears Irrigating The Land, For Another Son Of The Soil To Rise.
Sorrow, Sorrow Why Have You Catch Me So Why Have You Left Me In Such A Big Hole Sorrow, Sorrow When Will You Leave My Soul And Let My Heart Breath So There Is Nowhere To Go If You Keep Beating On My Heart So Sorrow, Sorrow Its Time To Go And Let Your Heart Be With Your Soul.
Tears Fill My Heart, I Cry In The Darkness, I Cry In The Shadows, I Cry In The Moonlight, Alone And Afraid. The Pain Engulfs Me, Taking Me Away, Yet Keeping Me Chained. My Mind Screams, My Body Aches, For These Painful Memories Are Forever Etched In My Heart.
Come And See Where It Is You Find Dancing The Sea. Never Find The Sky Loughing Somewhere In The City. You Find Me Without Size And Shape The Rough Road Ahead. Come And See I Am Missing In The Gitamandir. And I Am Somewhere On The Bank Of The Ganga Where Judge Is There To Pass Order After The Game Over.
October, 1918 Across A World Where All Men Grieve And Grieving Strive The More, The Great Days Range Like Tides And Leave Our Dead On Every Shore. Heavy The Load We Undergo, And Our Own Hands Prepare, If We Have Parley With The Foe, The Load Our Sons Must Bear.
Fairness And Justice Are Just Two Nominal Words On Our Earth Because We Completely Lack Them Anytime And Anywhere, They Are Just Two Words In Shape, But We Lack Them Totally In Content, They Are Like You Dream To Get Them When You Need Them In Life, So We Pay Very High Price When We Lack Them.
I Am At Ease To Hate But Tense When Hated. I Am At Ease To Love But Tense When Rivaled. I Am At Ease To Seek But Tense When Rejected. I Am At Ease To Cuckold But Tense When Cuckolded. Can There Be Attitude For Justice? 11.0.2008.
They Say Pride Comes Before The Fall Who Will Be There For You If There Is Anyone At All Surely Things Can Not Go On As They Have Done All Along Where Tyrants Reign And Justice Is Merely Feigned Don Your Armor And Prepare Your Swords For The Things I Speak Are Not Merely Words I Challenge You To Fight The War The Dawn Is Coming And Soon You Will See Your Cruelty Will No Longer Be Endured.
When Justice Fails Because The Constable Has Blundered Do Not Be Surprised, Do Not Even Be Discouraged, Proceed In Procurring Justice Still With The Way How You Are Trained To Do So, Get The Fingerprints Of Your Thoughts And Present The Same To Those Who Doubt And Wavered, Show Them The Intricate Lines Of Your Own Determinations This Is How It Must Be Done There Is Still A Map Of This Destination, When Justice Fails Because The Judge And Justices Have Also Lost Their Sense What Justice Is And How It Should Be Dispensed Like A Blindfolded Lady That You Misunderstand With Her Scales On One Hand And A Sword On The Other, Do Not Be Shaken, Do Not Lose Hope, Heave A Sigh And Breathe The Remaining Clean Air, There Are Still Those Who In Silence Still Remain Steadfast Holding On To Truth And Keeping Their Hands Clean And Hearts Pure And Minds Active To The Pursuit Of This Eternal Approximation Of Fairness There Are Still Those Whose Eyes Still Daze To The Glitters Not Of Gold But Of Truth, Beauty, And Goodness, I Will Count You In Please Count Me In Too And How About You? I Ask, Please Be Counted We Shall Stand On The Good Side Of Things We Shall Look For The Brightest Star The Ideal From Among The Blunders In The Darkness Of Our Nights Let The Hammer Fall And Let It Fall Everyday Let Those In The Dark Side Have Their Houses Full.
When Justice Stands Still Only The Fool Hearted, Will Contemplate Pursuing Even The Most Just Of Causes, When Justice Stands Still, The Brave Only Will Seek Retribution For Sins Committed Against Them And Their Kinsman, Can Any Gleamse Of Sovereignty Exist Where Justice Takes A Tea Break, And When Justice Decides To Stand Still Will Any Sanity Prevail, Where Justice Once Stood Still, Can Any Unity Ever Be Restored Once Upon A Time The Jews Were Slandered And Abused But They Had The Courage To Stand Up And Refuse, When Justice Stands Still, The Supposed Saviours Become The Enslavers, Who Then Will Stand Up To Refuse For The People When Justice Stands Still, The Law Makers Become Peace Detractors, Creating Laws Meant Not To Ensure Harmony, But To Bring Woo To The Masses, When Justice Stands Still, They Will Seek To Devour, Those They Once Vowed To Protect, Justice Stands Still, The Eleventh Plague, Not Just A Biblical Fantasy, But A Present Reality.
Prison Dark Room No Light Human Life Breathes Murder Charge Old Age Innocent Soul Suffers Justice Call Hard Labor To Work As Stone Cutter Bones Crack After Days Work Real Pain And Eyes Spark Is This The Life To Suffer? Is This The Punishment To Offer? Prison Sentence Before Trial Human Abuse With Justice Denial.
Sometimes We Seethe With Rage Over Some Heinous Crime Committed. Our Voices Are Raised With Thousands Of Others For Justice To Prevail, And Then Watch In Disbelief As A Nominal Sentence Is Incurred. Although The Courts Think, They Decide The Fate Of The Individual It Is Inside The Walls Of Prison That Really Seals Their Fate. Sex Offenders And Child Abusers Are Never Welcome There. The Prisoners Welter Out Their Own Brand Of Punishment For Them. 14 November 2009.
Justice Justice Where Is It In Close Door Or In Open Court Justice Justice Nowhere You Can Trace It Out In Any Form Anywhere Justice Justice Speak Not About It It Is Disgusting It Is Boring Only Push Back Fire Rushes No Smile But Cries.
Loyaulte Me Lie Echoes Through History A Sacred Oath, A Blessing A Cry For Truth And Justice Of Equality And Freedom That Lies At The Heart Of Kingship And Of Princes And Men. Let Justice Prevail In All Its Form Let The Truth Be Known That Loyalty Binds Me.
Depression Is A Fact Of Life For Me. As Much A Part Of Life As Food And Air, It Hovers Like A Dreaded Entity. It Scatters Joys Like Useless Stale Debris, And Sews The Ashes Of My Dreams In Gloom. Depression Is A Fact Of Life For Me. It Poises Like A Shadowing Banshee With Somber Wings Just Waiting To Enshroud. It Hovers Like A Dreaded Entity, And I Can Almost Always Guarantee Secreted In My Spectral Holidays Depression Is A Fact Of Life For Me. My Life Becomes A Frequent Abductee Purloined By Mirthless Bird Of Prey It Hovers Like A Dreaded Entity A Vulture Pouncing When My Back Is Turned, But Hidden, And Not Easily Discerned. Depression Is A Fact Of Life For Me It Hovers Like A Dreaded Entity.

A Period Of Crying Can Betray The Soul Showing The Pain That Makes Us Whole. Without Pain What Would Happiness Be? Would It Be There For Us To See. Would We Not Know Happiness Without Pain How Could You Tell What Was Best? Is Our Pain In A Way Needed? Is It Somehow Misleading? Trying To Show Us, Yet We Get Caught, Too Selfish To Busy With My Own Thought. But When You Are Happy Think Of The Pain, Oh Think How Good It Is To Be Happy Again.
I Fear My Little Child. I Fear That She Will Not Feed And Grow Strong And Healthy, I Fear That She Will Stop Breathing When I Am Out Of The Room Or Selfishly Asleep, I Fear That She Will Become Ill Because Of Something I Have Done Or Did Not Do, I Fear That She Will Be In Pain And I Will Not Know Why. I Fear That Her Father Will Reject Her, I Fear That Her Father Will Reject Me, I Fear That Her Father Will Compete For Her Love And That She Will Love Him More, I Fear That Her Father Will Be Distant And That She Will Not Love Him Enough. I Fear That Others Will Think That I Am Incompetent, I Fear That Others Will Assume That I Am Capable, I Fear That Others Will Force Upon Me Unhelpful Or Unwanted Advice, I Fear That Others Will Believe I Can Cope. I Fear The Loneliness Of Endless Days Without Contact, I Fear The Emptiness Of Endless Nights Without Love, I Fear The Weakness Of Endless Days Without Proper Meals, I Fear The Weariness Of Endless Nights Without Sleep. I Fear Inexperience. I Fear Uncertainty. I Fear Guilt. I Fear Despair. I Fear My Little Child.

I Remember As A Child I Had A Deep Seeded Fear Of Heights I Would Envision My Demise Long Prior To Even A Possible Fall Once As A Teenage Boy I Knocked A Front Tooth From My Mouth When I Jumped Twenty Feet Into A Drainage Ditch Next To Our House My Mother Rushed Me To The Dentist With My Tooth In Milk He Soon Restored My Youthful Smile But Did Little If Any At All To Replace My Fear Of Falling As I Still Panicked Whenever I Even Stood Close To A Ledge For The Last Sixty Years I Have Managed To Cope More Or Less Always Waking Up Before Any Tragedy Occurred But Last Night Upon Being Led To This Cliff In My Life I Jumped And Have Not Landed Yet As I Knew It Was A Bottomless Pit I Was Entering.

Depression Is My Life Without You, Depression Is The Darkness Taking Over The Light, Depression Is The Thoughts Of Suiside Depression Is Islolation From The Outside World Depression Is Where No One Loves Me Depression Is Where I Have No Friends Depression Is Where Every Looks At Me And Rools There Eyes Depression Is.
More Than Half A Century Ago, The Monsoon Showers Had Just Brought Relief From The Sweltering Summer, Just When I Was Dreaming Of Playing Soccer Whole Day Outdoors, My Dad Decided That I Have To Attend An Elementary School. I Was Dragged A Mile By My Older Brother To My New School, It Would Be My Favorite Durga Temple Converted Into A School, My Dreams Of A Class With Benches And Chairs Just Vanished, As We Were Sitting On The Floor In Open Partitioned Classrooms Of The School. I Thought I Would Get A Nice Colorful Uniform To Wear To School, But It Looked Like That The Dress Code Was A Futuristic Dream, At Least Every Class Had A Black Board Bigger Than My Slate, The Teacher Had A Duster Whereas I Had To Wipe The Chalk With My Hand. The Fear Of Some Burly Kids And Nostalgia Of Home Made Me Sad And Homesick, I Could Not Stop Crying And Asking My Teacher To Let Me Go Home. I Still Remember The Teacher With Big Black Cane, Every Time I Cried To Go Home, I Got A Whack On My Palm With His Cane, I Could Not Stop Crying, He Would Not Stop Whacking, Till I Was Sent In A Distant Corner For Breaking The Class Rule. Kneeling Down In The Corner, I Dreamt Of Mom And Home, I Found Comfort In The Memories Of Joyous Durga Puja Days, I Wished The Goddess Would Come Alive, And Pierce The Hands Of The Teacher With Her Big Spear. Finally The Tiffin Time Heralded The Temporary Recess, The Teacher Came Down And Helped Me Open My Tiffin Can, He Asked Me To Eat While He Wrote Something On My Slate, He Hoped That It Would Keep Me Interested In His School.
After I Finished My Food, He Handed My Slate, He Had Drawn A Picture Of A Big Smiling Cat With Whiskers And Big Tail, He Asked Me To Draw The Cat On The Other Side Of The Slate, I Was So Happy Drawing The Circles And Lines Whole Afternoon, I Forgot I Had A Rough First Day In School.
School Is Fun, School Is Great, Even If Your Late. In School We Do Math, We Do Art, I Love That Part. In Social Studies, We Have Homework Buddies. Pe Is The Best, Compared To All The Rest. During Lunch, We Will Munch, And Then Drink Grape Punch. Then We Play, For Thirty Minutes Of The Day.
In School, When I Saw You I Intuited I Have Found My Lost World In You I Wish I Could Act To Be Appreciated By You In School. In School, It Would Be Too Sad To Narrate The Ordeal I Have Been Through I Wonder If Its Best I Had Met You In The School. In School, Though I Had Not Said It There Has Been So Many Ways That I Have Shown It My Actions Had Done Whatever I Wanted To Say At School. In School, I Never Thought Being In Love Could Take Me To Madness Well, It Is Better Than Leaving Me In Sadness In The School. In School, When I Approached You I Knew I Was Silly It Was Because Suddenly, I Forgot Who I Was In School In School, Why Do You Sneer When I Am Near It Really Breaks Me Just Tell Me What To Do To Get A Room From You In And Out Of School. In School, Sometimes Though It Is Hard I Guess I Must Let Go Some Things I Wish To Have Though Good Things Also Could Be Found Elsewhere As It Has Been In School.
Our Evergreen School Days Will Not Come Back Again From The Nursery To High School We Learnt The Best And The Best That Taught By Our Teachers Our School Life Was Full Of Cheers And Lived With Full Of Mischievous But The Discipline Was Maintained Well We Sang And Danced Without Thinking Of Our Future. We Spent Money Without Earned Them When The School Start After The Vacation We Meet Our Friends Happily And Welcomed New Friends Dearly We Played All The Games And We Won Many Games With Out Care Of Sun Or Rain Many Years Have Been Gone Today We Live Different Parts Of The World But The Memories Of Our School Days Will Live In Our Hearts As Ever Green Days.
One Day It Was My Big Day All Packed Up But The On Dear Then I Say My Worst Sight Ever It Was School I Never Went Up In A Smile Ever Again So My First Day Blahblahblah Is I I Heard I Think It May Be My Day But Lets Lay Down Low Or I Could Be Called Gay So Now Ill Just Go Home.
It Was Expected To Belong. A Boy Who Has His Sights Aimed High, Who Aims To Make His Parents Proud, Will Show Respectability And Rise Above The Common Folks. It Was The Driving Force That Made Me Join The Choir, A Voice Of Mediocre Quality Would Not Disgrace The School As It Was Mixed Into The Crowd Of Screaming Baritones, Of Pubescent Basses And The Lone And Rather Spindly Looking Pallor Who, As A Rarity, Was An Essential Tenor. When Teenage Vocal Cords Perform, There Is An Awe That Settles In The Hall, Or Auditorium, It Clings To Dusty Walls And Rests Among The Cobwebs Of The Past. And Hearts Pick Up Their Happy Beat As If To Shout About Their Sheer Invincibility, Each Ear, As It Partakes The Sum Of All, Of Loud, Angelic Voices Oh, So Pure, Claims Ownership Of The Collage Of Tones Impressed And Stirred To Greater Deeds, While Restless Eyes Now Roam, Subdued Search Rows Of Colleagues In The Amber Light Until They Find That Pair Of Mellow Molecules, Look Back Into The Innocence Of All, And Tiny Promises Now Sing A Melody.
My Teacher Asks Me To Study Get Up Early Every Morning Time Table For Each Day Plan Your Things As It Says As My School Reopened New Books And A Clean Slate Books Covered And Labeled White Cloth And Chalk For The Slate How Neatly I Wrote My Name Drew A Picture In The Front Page Wanted It To Remain The Same Never Teared A Single Page I Was Studious Had An Aim Colourful Marks I Scored In Test With Friends We Played Few Games In Every Game We Were The Best Then As The Days Go By Started To Tear Pages From The Books Then Said The Books A Brief Bye Bye Dog Ears In All My Books Pages Used For A Million Other Things Paper Rockets To Fly At Friends Wrote The Names On Their Wings Painted Red At The Rocket Ends Played In Water On Rainy Days Plastic Shoes And Pink Raincoats Prayed For Fever On Test Days In Water Sailed Paper Boats Now Its Time For The Big Exams No More Playgrounds And Fun Days Back To Books To Clear Exams Once Again Early Rise Each Day.
The Power Of Ideas Are Immeasurable They Are The Hidden Treasures Which Lies Deep Within Each And Everyone Of Us When We Take The Time To Mind Them We Will Find That They Are More Precious Than Diamonds Ideas Which May Seem Insignificant Has Tremendous Power Within Them They Are The Genesis The Initiation The Foundation Of All Invention And Everything Which Is Created By Humankind The Power Of Ideas Are Immeasurable They Have Got The Power To Move Mountains To Overcome Any Obstacle And To Make The Seemingly Impossible Possible Ideas Are The Levers Which Moves And The Axis On Which The World Revolves The Power Of Ideas Are Immeasurable The Power Of Ideas.
Pain Is The Feeling You Endure When You Are Alone, It Is Great Torture When You Have No Friends At All Pain Is The Feeling You Endure When You Break A Bone, You Endure Great Humiliation And Pain When You Slip And Fall However, You Possess The Spirit To Get Back On Your Feet, Even If The Path In Front Of You Becomes Too Rough There Will Be Friends Along The Path That You Will Meet, That Will Help Make You Become Strong And Tough Also, They Will Help Cure You When You Are Sick, They Will Be Friends With You Through Thick And Thin And They Will Never Think About Playing A Mean Joke Nor Trick, Your Friends Will Be As Close To You As Your Own Kin Now I Know I Cannot Quit During The Fight, Because I Know My Friends Will Help Me See The Light.
You Pray A Lot And Take Pride That Your Prayers Are Granted And You Pray Some More Like A Monk Like A Priest, Sometimes I Think About Prayerful Dogs, What If Their Prayers Are Granted Too Bones And More Bones Would Surely Rain From The Heavenly Skies. Oh Yes, I Pray, But If My Prayers Are Not Granted, I Still Know That God Loves Me He Thinks My Wants Are Not The Best For Me, And He Reserves The Rest. That Really Suits Me Best.
How The Time Passes By. We Are Unable To Arrest It. How Quick The People Are Leaving This World. We Are Unable To Prolong Our Existence On This Land. We Therefore Should Not Take It Away As We Are Approaching To The End Of The Twentieth Century. Many Nations Of This World Are Racing To Build Their Armaments. Why Are They Doing It? To Destroy This Land With The People Living On It. Can We Be Proud Having An Atom Bomb. Those Who Have It Are Announcing To The World Their Power. Without Thinking Of A Mistake And Dimensions Of Destruction. How Funds Are Melting Away To Build Them And Be Tested. These Funds Can Be Used For The Hungry Masses, To Feel Them And Fertilize Our Land To Make It Richer. A Multitude Of People Would Be Satisfied They Would Be Happy And Enormously Grateful Maybe That Day Will Come. That We Will Together Save The Nature And Masses Of People. The Bomb Once Thrown Carries Only Death And Destruction Everything Would Be Reduced To Ashes. All Living Things Would Die, Even Trees. To The Ones Alive A Bird Would Not Sing Because Of The Nuclear Experiments People Are Becoming Poorer Lets Give Some Thought How To Conquer That Evil. Lets Look Differently On Nature And Perceive Its Beauty. This World Is Indeed Charming, India Is A Mysterious And Curious Country. Is The Atom Bomb For Them A Paradise? Among The Other Countries It Brought Indignation, Is It Worth To Change Your Own Country Into Hate?
Atom Bond Will Not Solve Problems And Feed People Why Not Anybody Is Thinking About It, Lets Use The Atom For Peaceful Purposes Lets Leave The Decisions To The Highly Developed Countries, How To Save The Land From Being Fed With Poison, How To Fertilize, So That The Masses Will Not Be Hungry, Also War, But Not Nuclear, Must Be Proclaimed To The Element Of Nature. Not Necessarily Atom Weapons For Destruction. It Is Being Done With Perfectionism By Cataclysm, That Is The Real Enemy Of People. We Must Learn Hot To Strive To Subdue It, Then We Will Not Be The Perpetrators Of Exterminating This Beautiful Globe, As Is Our Mother Earth.
From Them Only Negative Stuff We Do Hear They Tell Us Who To Trust And Tell Us Who To Fear We Want To Believe The Lies To Us They Tell They Promise Utopia And Give Us Earthly Hell. We Want To Believe Every Word That They Say And For To Cling To Power They Create Us And They We Help To Create Our Own Reality The Blind In The Light Of Day Never Do See. Their Pre Election Promises They Never Do Keep We Give Them Our Power And We Follow Like Sheep They Tell Us Who To Fear And Them We Believe And They Laugh Behind Our Backs And Us They Deceive. Through False Patriotism To Power They Do Cling And The Praises Of War Heroes They Gladly Do Sing They Cling On To Power And They Cheat And They Lie Whilst In The Wars They Created The Innocents Die.
The Power Of Truth Is In The Belief The Power Of Love In The Heart The Power Of Faith Is Felt In The Mind With Every Member Of Your Being A Part Yet The Power Of Change Is Hard To Adjust Because Temptation Is So Hopelessly Strong While The Power Of Right Is Substantially Hard You Must Overcome The Power Of Wrong But The Power In You Is Much Greater Than All In You, His Power Is Born So When The Unfairness Of Life Takes Your Power Away Remember To Whom The Power Belongs.
To Some Power Is Guns To Some Power Is Knifes To Some Power Is The Ability To Read, And Write. To Some Power Is Control To Some Power Is A Fist To Some Like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Power Was Words. To Some Power Is Like A Trapped Animal Trying To Get Out Of A Cage. To Some Power Is Love To Some Power Is Art To Some Power Is Money To Me Power Is Knowledge So What Is Power To You?.
They Say Her Words Were Like Balloons With Strings I Could Not Hold, That Her Love Was Something In A Shop Cheap And Far Too Quickly Sold; But The Tree Does Not Price Its Apples Nor The Sun Its Selling Power The Rain Does Not Gossip Or Speak Of Where It Goes.
I Must Love Her More Than She Does, The Husband Wants. I Must Love Him More Than He Does, The Wife Wants. This Is Power Of Love I Must Hold Her More Than She Does, The Husband Intends. I Must Hold Him More Than He Does, The Wife Intends. This Is Love Of Power. Power Of Love Is Breeze. Love Of Power Is Storm 12.04.2008.
One Second Might Not Tell When Held Against An Hour One Hour Might Not Count When Weighed Against A Day One Day May Not Matter When Considering A Life One Word May Mean Little From The Conversation Whole One Line May Not Be Missed When Stricken From The Book One Thought May Be Dismissed In Comprehension Of The Mind One Flaw Might Be Overlooked When Evaluating Character One Mistake Means Little When Summing Up A Man One Sin May Be Forgiven In The Judgement Of A Soul So How Is It A Single Glance Can Make One Wither So?.
A Word Is Capable Of Anything It Is Capable Of Changing Enemies Into Friends. It Is Capable Of Penetrating The Impenetrable. It Is Capable Of Changing The Impossibility Into Possibilities. It Is Capable Of Uniting Man And Woman Into Husband And Wife. It Is Capable Of Changing The Atheist Into Christian. It Is Capable Of Changing Illiterate Into Professional. It Is Capable Of Changing Political Crisis Into Independence. Beginning Today Let Us Not Just Utter Words But Live By Them, Let Your Words Be Sweet And Caring To All Those Around You. Because We Never Know How Far Reaching Something We May Think, Say Or Do Today Will Affect The Lives Of Millions Tomorrow.
U Fooled Me U Cheated On Me U Let Me Go U Made Me Cry U Forced Me To Believe Your Lies U Tried To Control Me U Betrayed Me U Did Not Love Me U Never Knew Me U Never Understood Me Even You Have Never Ever Tried Finally, Simply U Left Me But Now All I Can Say Is I Love You Because This Is Something I Have No Power Upon To And I Just Cannot Stop Thinking About You Because This Is Not Something I Usually Do.
The Little Power We Have To Others We Give Away They Rule Our Lives For Us We Go By What They Say The Media They Control And Only Lies From Them We Hear They Warn Of Terrorists And Terrorism And Fill Our Hearts With Fear Of People We Do Not Know Or May Never Even Meet They Even Have Us Looking Out For Terrorists As We Walk Down The Street Each Stranger That We Meet We Look On With Mistrust Though They May Be Kind Of Heart And They May Be Good And Just. They Are Our Enemy Yet We See Them As A Friend For Their Political Survival On Our Fears They Do Depend And Those We See As Our Enemy Their Leaders Are The Same They Instill In Them A Fear Of Us They Too Play The Political Power Game. We Are Ruled By Self Centred Men And Us They Do Deceive When They Tell Us Who To Fear Them We Want To Believe They Create Us And They And To Conquer They Divide And Tell Us With A Smirk We Have God On Our Side. To Lie To Cling To Power To Them Is Not A Sin Some Call It Propaganda And Others Call It Spin And When Our So Called Enemy Civilians Die In A Bombing Raid Collateral Damage Is What They Say Is It Right That Loss Of Human Life Be Dismissed In Such A Way? The Little Power We Have To Ourselves We Never Keep To The Power Hungry We Give It Away We Value It As Cheap They Lubricate Our Fears To Insure They Cling To Power In A Garden Full Of Noxious Weeds You May Not Find A Flower.
The Lonliness Of The Night, Is Matched By The Emptiness Of My Bed. The Emptiness Of My Heart, Is Equalled By The Absence Of Hope. The Absence Of A Future, Is Akin To The Depth Of My Need. The Depth Of My Memories, Is Beaten Only By The Heat Of The Sun.
Come Lets Kiss And Rejoice You In My Ingenuity, And Me, In Your Feeble Ability To Forgive Such Deviltry, As Mine Come Lets Play Blindfolded You Will Still Envision Joy And Me Apathetic, Oblivious To The Tears Turning Red Blood As Wine Come Lets Wear Deaf Plugs You Can Then Sing Along With My Loud Booming Rythym All The While As The Moans Of Tattered, Torn, Children Die. Just Sad Marriot; Islamabad; Pakistan The Question Is No Longer Why.
A Poet Loses His Power For Poetry A Poet Loses His Power For Poetry He Can Put Down Words But They No Longer Have Poetry In Them Something Of The Feeling Of What Real Poetry Is Is Gone. He Strives He Writes Again And Again He Puts Words Down In The Forms And In The Shapes His Poems Usually Take But He Has No Poetry In Him He Has Lost What He Is And All He Can Do Is Strive Again And Again Word After Word Silence After Silence To Hear Within Himself Again A Voice He Does Not Have. The Poet Is Writing Poetry And It Is Not Poetry The Poet Is Dead And He Is Pretending To Be Alive Is This A Poem? Is He A Poet Is He Dead? Is He Alive?.
January Is A New Month A New Start For Me To Learn New Things To Learn To Let Go Of My Anger And Open Up My Heart And To Listen To What My Heart Is Saying It Is Waking Up From A Long Painful Journey Of Last Summer I Love You All The Time Sunsets January Thanks God You Are Mild Because I Hate The Cold.
It Is January 1997 And So Far It Has Been Far From Heaven The Skies Has Been Dark Shades Of Blue And Gray As I Bend My Knees To Pray The Weather Has Been Cold And Wet As I Sat In My Room And Wept As I Wish To Witness To See A Heaven Sent Angel I Tried To Remain Stable I Strolled Through The Peaceful Cemetery Searching For Sanctuary. As I Perched My Depressed Infested Body Against An Ice Cold Tombstone Covered With Time And Age I See My Life On The Darkest Stage. I Only Wish The Unhappiness Away I Only Long To Write The Next Play Of Life That Will Bring Hope. And Colorful Dreams In Cinemascope.
The Days Are Short, The Sun A Spark, Hung Thin Between The Dark And Dark. Fat Snowy Footsteps Track The Floor. Milk Bottles Burst Outside The Door. The River Is A Frozen Place Held Still Beneath The Trees Of Lace. The Sky Is Low. The Wind Is Gray. The Radiator Purrs All Day.
With Numbing Cold, Biting At My Brittle Bones I Feel Many Years Giving Me A Wake Up Shake Gripping My Coat Through The More Gripping Cold I Feel The World Has Grown Old. January I Cried For My Mom The First Time She Probably Cried And Then Smiled For My Tears She Surely Is Yet Smiling For My Thoughts Through These Years For The Tears That She Shed Were At Giving Me Birth January Is The Warmest Time On Earth.
The Cold Winds Of January From The North East Does Blow And The Weather Is Cold Quite Cold Enough For To Snow And The Hungry Birds Silent On The Naked Hedgerow In The Flat And Rushy Fields Where The Blackwater Flow. January In Duhallow From Here Far Away In The Chill Of The Morning The Frost Bound Fields Gray In The Farmyard Sheds Cattle Bellow For Silage Or Hay Where The Sun Seldom Shines On A January Day. The Distinctive Harsh Caws Of The Silver Backed Crow In The Season Where Grass Does Refuse For To Grow And Few Cars On The Roadway That Leads To The Town Near Where The River Flows Bank High In Flood Waters Of Brown. In January In Duhallow The Old Fields Looking Bare With The Harsh Chill Of Winter In The Cold Morning Air And At Least Eight Long Weeks Till The First Breath Of Spring When Nature Will Bloom And Her Wild Birds Will Sing.
The River Does Not Walk On Its Journey Struggling To Get To Its Destination Because It Takes Its Step In A Direction That Has Been Destined For It. So My Brother, Like The River You Would Continue To Flow In This Life Without Any Struggle Till You Reach Wherever You Want To End This Journey Of Yours. Did You Ever See The Tree Attempting To End Where Its Height Should End On Its Journey Towards The Blue Skies Above? That Is The Way You Would Grow In Life As Nothing Would Cut Short Whatever Height You Wish To Attain In Life, My Brother.
Today I Met A Woman Who Died Four Years Ago She Spoke To Me For Hours As Though She Knew My Soul She Took Me By The Hand Led Me Along A Stream Where Trout Swam In Sparkling Waters Under Clear Crystalline Skies This Woman Shared The Magic Of Years Of Circumspect Living And Artfully Crafted Writing Precisely Gem Set Words She Dwells Now In Brightness I Could But Pause And Glimpse Through My Own Dark Glass Her Poems The Only Light In Memory Of Kathleen Raine.
In A Dream I Returned To The River Of Bees Five Orange Trees By The Bridge And Beside Two Mills My House Into Whose Courtyard A Blind Man Followed The Goats And Stood Singing Of What Was Older Soon It Will Be Fifteen Years He Was Old He Will Have Fallen Into His Eyes I Took My Eyes A Long Way To The Calenders Room After Room Asking How Shall I Live One Of The Ends Is Made Of Streets One Man Processions Carry Through It Empty Bottles Their Images Of Hope It Was Offered To Me By Name Once Once And Once In The Same City I Was Born Asking What Shall I Say He Will Have Fallen Into His Mouth Men Think They Are Better Than Grass I Return To His Voice Rising Like A Forkful Of Hay He Was Old He Is Not Real Nothing Is Real Nor The Noise Of Death Drawing Water We Are The Echo Of The Future On The Door It Says What To Do To Survive But We Were Not Born To Survive Only To Live.
The Broad River Flows Fierce Than An Ocean. In Front Of The Longest Bridge Both Of Us At The Two Ends And The Sign Board Says Not Allowed For Pedestrians And Only For Heavy Vehicles. Our Fruition Is Fruitless And How Long We Have To Stand Like This? Forget The Racism My Sweetheart Who Made Us With The Same Clay? We Break This Primitive Fundamental Bridge, Jump To The River And Swim Upstream.
There Is A Hill Ahead, And Death Is Behind The Hill; I Urge The Horses Onward, Onward There Is A River Here; Always, There Is A River Just When Death Scents Victory White Current Seethes About Black Rocks; How Fair The Meadow Is, After Crossing The Water.
Time Is Not A River Nor A Ticking Clock Nor An Hourglass We Cannot Save Time We Cannot Spend Time We Cannot Borrow Time We Cannot Buy Time We Cannot Cheat Time Time Is Not A Gift Time Is Not Our Friend Nor Our Enemy Time Is Not On Our Side Time Is Not Ours In Any Sense Save For The Single Second That Holds Our Full Attention Then Slips Forever Beyond Grasp.
I Am So Excited That Once Again It Is June When The Sun Is Bright And The Birds All Sing In Tune Winter Is Finally Gone So No More Shoveling Of The Snow Now There Are Hedges To Trim And Also Grass To Mow, Just Think, No More Slipping Or Freezing Or Falling Upon The Ice But, Though Now We Must Worry About The Mosquitoes And The Lice In My Youth And In My Past I Once Loved The Snow And The Cold Changes Though Will Come, As With Seasons And I Am Getting Old, The Flowers They Are Awakening From Their Summer Sleep We Now Again Have Gardens To Tend To And Also Yards To Keep We Can Now Go Off To The Park And Then Off To Visit The Zoo At Night In The Yard We Could Light Marshmallows Or Have A Barbecue, It Is The Best Month For Parties And Birthdays And Marriages So In June You Had Better Be Prepared To See Baby Carriages And Out In The Yard And Parks The Children Are Eager To Play Only Thing Better Than A June Night, It Is Of Course A June Day, Children Can Chase And Catch Lightning Bugs Late At Night While We All Can Sit Around The Yard With Only A Porch Light Winter Was Long And Cold And Finally Here Comes June It Again Came Right On Time, Not To Late And Never Too Soon. Randy L. Mcclave.
Violet In June A Violet Caught I In Repose Upon A Sunbathed Bank. Her Head Was Bowed. Do You Suppose It Was From Life She Shrank? She Seemed So Wilted In Despair; No Tear Was In Her Eye. She Languished In The Torrid Air And Seemed Resigned To Die. Oh Little Violet, You Have Bloomed When Others Fail The Task; Amid The Hardships That Have Loomed There Is No More We Ask. Although A Breeze Of Furnace Heat Has Robbed You Of Your Tear, Your Destiny Is Not Complete, Put Off Your Shrinking Fear. Oh Little Violet, Lift Your Eyes Above The World, Up To The Sun; Fear Not, For When The Daylight Dies Another Dew Will Come.
There Are Days In June That Seem To Be December. Thus Sometimes The Substance Of This Room Or More Accurately The People In It Who Pray Silently Start Up In The Midst Of Happiness And Alter, Bewitched By A Murmur From The Calm Foliage. Our Hearts Are Shifting As The Winds Changing, Pliable As Gold. See This Windless Sail, Motionless? Almost Before One Feels The Subtle Breeze, It Stirs Up And Slips Away.
They Wallowed For A Stricken Minute More In The Blood And Mud Helpless They Tried To Stand, Gagging Hauled By Their Wrists Crawling To Dry Sand These Were The Chosen For The Day Staggering From The Killing Ground To The Small Pond Of Human Excretion They Flopped And Rubbed Hands Slashing The Filth From Their Chins Scrubbing It From Knees And Elbows They Sat Another Minute Their Hands And Faces Dripping Nothing Stirred But The Stench Of Death They Knew It Was Their Last Minute, An Eerie Requiem Went Up As Their Skin Peeled Off So Easily From Their Bone Heaped Now As One The Howling Souls Turned Into Vapor The Resident Stench Remained It Was Common The Beast Slept Well This Night As The Pile Was The Highest Yet.
Daylight Came Too Quickly The Stream Of Condemned Shooed From Their Pens Moving Slowly, Almost Reluctantly They Stared With A Sad Look Of Relief As Calm After A Long Journey No One Could Stop The Babies From Crying, They Would Be First The Killing Ground Was Silent Nothing Could Be Seen Between The Herd It Was Very Dark Inside Between The Snortings And Stompings The Hot Breath Slapped Their Faces In Their Nostrils Was An Odor Rank And Fierce And Primal Suddenly With A Rumble And A Roar The Screaming Agony Of Death Tumbling Backward, Barking Chins, Dropping Heads Piles Upon Piles Tripping Against Each Other Down They Fell Like Leaves In Wintry Weather To Rest Beyond The Gate As More Would Come Peering Out From The Small Opening In Their Pens Their Eyes Blinking, Sunken, Adjusting To Light The Pile Became Unglued The Rest Remained Lined Up Against The Fence They Were Next They Embraced The Wires Like Long Lost Friends Stammering And Swaying, Falling And Crawling The Horde Torn Down, Weak With Relief A Faint Prayer Heard In Hebrew They Put Their Back To The Fencepost Hands Held Out Slowly, Dubiously They Came Making A Magic Ring Of Prayer Then Closed It Tight, Heads Bowed They Closed Their Eyes Bracing And Embracing Each Other They Bumped Cheeks And Noses Gently Touching Faces A Minute Passed Deaf, Blind, Starving, Dieing They Joined In Hope And Fear The Warm Fur Of Their Humanity They Stood Guard Over Their Last Minute Only A Minute Created Together A Red Raw Sun Chinned On The Horizon A New Day Dazzled For The Beast.
If Not For June, My Memories Of Winter In December With A Wish To Witness, The Freshness Of Spring March Would Bring Would Not Still Remain So Vivid. As If Only Yesterday Visited. If Not For June. If Not For June, My Eyesight Would Not Be Teased By The Freedom Felt In Summer, With Hopes That Linger Of Those Things I Could Do, Under Clear Skies Showing Bright Sun. And Seeing The Fun Shared By Nearly Everyone, If Not For June. And If Not For June I Would Not Be Able To Reminisce, From So Many Experiences I Could Pick. June Seems To Be The Month I Can Do This. With A Thankfulness I Am Still In The Midst, Of A Year That Appears To Have Just Begun. With So Much Left To Offer Before It Is Done. And For Me This Happens Only When June Comes.
June Sings For Me, A Song Of A Rain Cloud, Which Has Lost Its Way In A Desert Storm, Haunted And Chased By The Conspiring Rays Of Of A Burnt Up Sun But Found Its Way Back To A Green Hill To Sing Again A Song For Me June 11,2009.
I Realized Today That Winter Would Not Exist Without You, Father. In A World Where Death Is Confused With Life, Your Breath Crystallizes Fear Into Snow. Mounds And Piles Of Snow. Only When Your Breath Stops Will This Snow Ever Cease.
He Never Loved Me, Though I Know How Hard He Tried. He Was A Good Man, Sewn Tight With Pride. On Visits In His Final Years He Cried Standing At His Graveside Able At Last To Say I Know You Knew How Much I Loved You Anyway.

He Wept For His Father His Father Who Implored Him To Not Test Life, To Not Seek Treasures Unknown But His Son Wanted More And Spent His Long Days Slashing The Darkened Skies In Conquest Of A Golden Sun But The Son Was Like A God Opening His Mouth To Warm The Coldness Of The Earth And His Father Did Not Bless The Summers Or Winters Of His Son With The Light Of His Departure The Father Turned His Head Away, His Once Strong Grip, Weakend, Only The Whitened Hollows Of His Face Did He Leave Him.
In The Name Of The Father, Crusaders Sallied Forth Raping And Murdering. In The Name Of The Father, The Vatican Turned Its Back On The Holocaust.

In The Name Of The Father, Paedophiles Lurk Behind Dog Collars And Cassocks. In The Name Of The Father, Children Are Sold Or Enslaved. In The Name Of The Father, This A Father I Can Do Without.
Dear Lord In Heaven, This Has Been A Very Interesting Week, Still So Much To Learn And So Much To Be Forgiven For. Although Lord Verbally We Have Not Offended Anyone But Inwardly Sometimes We Have Feelings Of Jealousy Or Envy. These Feelings Truly Are Negative Feelings And Need To Be Dealt With. Today Lord I Pray That You Rid Our Minds Of Such Thoughts And Replace Those Thoughts With Grateful Thoughts. Show Us How To Look At Things In A Different Light, To See What Is Important And Not To Focus On The Material Things In Life But To Realize That We Were All Given Gifts And Those Gifts Are To Be Treasured, Respected And Shared With Others. Father When Others Copy Us, Let Us Realize That This Is A Compliment, Which Shows That We Have The Ability To Set The Trend, To Take The Lead And To Move Forward Allowing Others To Follow And Create A Much Brighter Environment. Father When Others Speak Badly Of Us Because They Are Feeling Jealous Of Us, Teach Us Not To React In A Negative Manner But To Continue To Hold On To The Positive Not Allowing Such Words To Hurt Us. Hold Our Hands A Little Tighter Lord. Father, Teach Us To Be Humble And To Always Put You First, Always Have You At The Head Of Our Tables, Present In Our Midst, Clear In Our Thoughts, Forever Under Your Umbrella And Lord Teach Us To Always Listen To The Whispers. I Thank You Father For All That You Have Done For Me And I Share This Prayer With My Brothers And Sisters On Poemhunter In The Hope That They Will Find Something Here That May Be Of Help To Them. I Ask You Lord For Forgiveness, I Ask You To Keep Us Out Of Harms Way, I Ask That You Continue To Walk With Us, Stand By Us And To Carry Us When We Can No Longer Walk.
Lord In The Name Of Your Son Jesus, I Thank You, I Love You, I Respect You, I Know You And I Will Always Worship You. Amen.
My Father Was The Greatest Man I Ever Knew And Loved He Never Judged Me, Never Scorned Me And Never Held A Grudge If I Grow Old Being Half The Man That Taught Me All I Knew Then I Would Lie Down In My Grave Amongst A Privileged Few.

Lord, Teach Us To Hace And Show Respect For Each Other Each Day, Patience And Kindness To Listen To What Others Have To Say.

Lord Just Teach Us To In All Things To Respect And Show Love Each Day, That Is What We Ask You Today As We Pray.

I Reach For The End Of Day Orange, Pink, Lavender, Gray And Watch It Slide Out Of My Fingers As The Sun Dips Behind The Horizon For Night To Come. The Nights Come With Blacks And Grays, Moon And Stars And Some Nights Clouds Draw The Drapes To The Sky And I Wonder What Is Up There, Invisible To My Eye. Sometimes I Wait For Mornings For Those Colors To Reappear And Reach For Wonderful Things The Sun Saw While On The Other Side Of The World As I Watched The Night Sky.
It Was 16 Degrees Below Freezing Today. The Sky Was Blue, Bright And Vast. I Looked More Closely At The Sky And It Was Suffused By Sunlight, The Same Bright Sunlight That You Are Bathed In. There Was A Corner Of The Sky That Was Grey And Empty Where You Usually Are. I Resolved To Look More Deeply, More Intensely At This Vacant Part Of The Majestic Sky. The Deeper I Concentrated, The More You Emerged And I Found You Again, In The Sky Of My Mind In The Tapestry Of My Feelings And Thoughts. Across Wide Continents, You Are Here And The Empty Part Of The Sky Dissolves Into A Rich Portrait Of Your Days And Nights Where The Earth Beneath Our Feet Unites.
Give To Me One More Kiss. Impart Your Spirit On My Memory. Chill My Heart With A Touch. Ignite Me With A Glance. Wrap Yourself Around Me. And Stir My Soul With A Smile. Meet Me On A Midnight Moon. Where We Can Laugh And Fly. Make A Dream That Soars On Wings. And Kiss Beneath A Liquid Sky.
Across The Red Sky Two Birds Flying, Flying With Drooping Wings. Silent And Solitary Their Ominous Flight. All Day The Triumphant Sun With Yellow Banners Warred And Warred With The Earth, And When She Yielded Stabbed Her Heart, Gathered Her Blood In A Chalice, Spilling It Over The Evening Sky. When The Dark Plumaged Birds Go Flying, Flying, Quiet Lies The Earth Wrapt In Her Mournful Shadow, Her Sightless Eyes Turned To The Red Sky And The Restlessly Seeking Birds.
The Sky Is Pink The Grass Is Blue Up Is Down And So Are You To Run Is Walk When Left Is Right Hop Is Fly And Black Is White East Is West The Sun Is Green The Walls Above The Floor Between The Rain Goes Up The Dirt Comes Down Glad Is Sad And Smile Is Frown To Hear Is Speak To See Is Smell Down Are Clouds And Up Are Wells When You Are Me And I Am You Nobody Knows Just What To Do.
Bodies Falling From The Sky, Like Drops Of Dreams, Like Sweet Lies. Without Wings, And Only With Our Souls We Are Able To Fly, Fusing With The Sky Becoming One. In My Dreams, The Sky Is Like A Canvas, My Soul All Colors, And My Body A Feather Brush, In The Hands Of A Blowing Child. I Love Life More Than My Own Life. To Die We Have To Live, To Wake Up We Have To Sleep, To Finish We Have To Start, To Leave We Have To Arrive, These Are The Reasons Why, Flying Keep Us Alive. My New Thoughts, Kill My Old Ones, My New Me, Kill My Old One. We Must Dream, To Let The Day Die We Must Fly, To Let Our Bodies Disattach. Souls Bodies Minds In The Sky We Set Them Free, They Never Die, They Just Go To Another Dimension, Like This Like There Like That.
Sometimes We Do The Rumba, A Foxtrot Or A Jive, As We Dance Through Our Life, Each And Every Day. We Dance And We Dance, Each Day Through. Everyday To A Different Tune, Just To Get Us Through. In All Our Loving Moments, We Waltz Through Life, And In Those Complicated Moments, We Will Twist The Whole Night Through. For Everything We Do, There Is A Dance To Get Us Through. For Every Day, We Dance Our Life Away. 17 June 2007.
In Twilight Days Of Half Meals We Gathered Weapons In, Anger Long Stilled Into Vaporous Ether Whisked Away Unseen, A Constant Blown Clear Off These Curled Brows For It Had Finally Been Enough This Unfathomable Loss Of Us The Fighting Of Flesh, The Torn Minds Ripping And Flailing About Of Limbs, Acts Against Greater Odds, Desperate Thoughts Lingering For Eternity Between Hot Breaths Sweat Of Common And High Ranking Mingled With Battle Fluids Crushed Beneath Wild Gaze And Maiden Strengths Slipping About Every Heart, Our Fallen Purged To The Surface In Anguish Unblemeshed Ghost Fathers Nagging The Mete Of Our Worth Dispatched At Ever More Familiar Foe Pressing Fate Amid This Clumsy Waltz Of True Victory None, Then Weary Home.
Did She Ever Dance The Tango On Those Clear And Cloudless Nights? Did She Ever Wash The Dishes? While I Was Wondering What Might Time Have Made Of Our New Loving Or Was It Moving Out Of Sight? Did She Ever Fully Love You? Or Did She Merely Say She Did? Did She Sometimes Feel Too Tired? Or Did She Not Have Any Kids? Did You Simply Just Forget Me? Why Did You Let My Passion Die? Why Did You Never Ever Let Me Just Be Me So I Could Fly?.
Did You Leave Me Here Alone To Face This World Of Emptiness While I Wanted To Have The Dance Of Love With You Did You Leave Me Here Alone To Face This Silence I Wanted To Whisper The Song Of Love, Into Your Ears While My Hands Were Dancing On Your Skin Feeling The Warmth Of Your Inside Did You Leave Me Here Alone To Face This Dark Night Alone While I Need The Candle Of Hope, Burning With Warmth And Light In Our All Cold And Dark Nights.
A Little Ray Of Hope Across A Midnight Sky A Time For All Time, A Light To Shine Sunrise And Sunset Caught In One Net For Ever Fighting To Stay One. A Moon And A Sun Wanting To Be As One To Set Together, In A Time Lost In Forever Earth Moon And Stars Fade Together A Longing That Fades Into Forever The Alpha And Omega Fading In And Out Longing To Be Together But Always In Doubt A Rainbow Brings Hope, A New Way To Cope We All Need Thathope To Stop Salt Filled Tears From Falling Oiling The Way For Another Day.

Her Eyes Were Vacant, Her Mind Barren, Her Frustrations Clouthed In Blood, And Her Body, Thrown To The Curve. Her Hands Tremble, Her Words Spit, Her Knees Break , And The Drugs Settle In Her Blue Veins. Her Eyes Find A Smile, Her Heart Finds Love, Her Hands Become Strong, And The Moment Of Uncertainy Is Over, Now Its Time For Music And Dance.

Irvan 12 April 1998 Stars Illuminate The Darkness That Night My Heart Amazing I Still Sit Down And Read The Silence Peel The Skins Memories That Become Embedded In Spirit And Grain Flavor That Started Accompanying The Hearts Of All The Senses I Knew This Trip Would Still Be Much Longer Although Not As If I Will Survive I Will Keep Trying To Survive And Survive To You My Reason To Survive I Do Not Care Whatever Happens Between Us But I May Know What You Feel In Your Heart When I Walked Away From You My Inner Voice, Screaming, Mountain Life Abort And I Never Sleep Without Kissing Your Shadow As If Longing Urge You To Come Back Again Once Inside, Holy, Eternal And Sincere I Love You And Will Always Continue To Love You How Should I Explain It To You So Simple But So Hard To Say.
Mere Sympathy Only A Show A Fascination Of Modern Days Actual Need Is The Timely Help That Too Without Knowing Anyone The Left Hand Is Absent Minded When Right Hand Gives A Help Those Are Services To Humanity Those Which Judges Somewhere In Life Sympathy In Terms Of Publicity A Craze In Different Platforms Hear Most Of Times Timely Service Require Which Is Action Oriented And Result Fruitful.
Do You Have Any Sympathy For God? Because I Have Some Sympathy For God Do You Believe In God? Because I Believe In God Do You Know Who Created You In His Image? God Created You In His Image And That Is Not A Lie.
As The Television Played To An Empty Room We Fell Apart In The Kitchen; Cups Of Untouched, Unsuguared Conversation Brewed In My Mouth But I Said Nothing. You Said Nothing But Swallowed Hard And That Was The Last Time We Spoke About Love.
Some Times We Hold On Somebodies That We Feel That We Care More About Them Despite. That They Only Caused To Us Only A Pains And We Still Long For Them, In Spite Of That And Miss Them From Time To Time While They Not Deserve That Yearning Or This Desire, , , Even They Not Deserve This Love Which We Hold Inside Our Hearts For Them.
I Have No Sympathy For You You Took Advantage Of Me But You Want To Act Like You Did Nothing Wrong You Need To Open Your Eyes And See You Are Your Own Worse Enemy But You Will Not Take Responsibility I Will Not Be Your Friend Anymore Because You Have Really Hurt Me.
As Much As You Want To Believe It There Is Not Sympathy In This World The Only Thing That God Wants For Us Is That We Die In Our Own Pain To Suffer The Mistakes That We Have Made To Feed On Our Blood If God Has No Sympathy Than Who Does?.
Blessed Is The Smile Of The Person Which Also Can Be Gracious For The Happiness Of Others Blessed Is The Mouth Of The Person Which Speaks Sincerely And Honestly Blessed Are The Eyes Of The Person Which Also Can See The Suffering Of Others Blessed Are The Hands Of The Person Which Also Can Feel And Carry The Sorrow Of Others.
Destiny Where Do I Find You? Destiny Where Can I Look For You? Destiny Where Are You Hiding? Why Are You Hiding From Me? Destiny What Do You Have For Me? Destiny What Are My Options? Destiny Which Door Is Open For Me? Destiny Do You Have Anything For Me That I Might Want? Destiny Can I Get Any Satisfaction From You? Destiny Are You My Friend?.
One Day I Say I Love You, One Day You Say You Love Me, I Was Always So Happy Because I Was Loved Eternally, For All Time Because Its Just You And I, Like A Fairytale Come To Life We Live Happily Ever After You And I, For All Eternity Just Us, You And Me This Is Are Destiny, I Love You And You Love Me.
When I Am Happy, Bustling With Successes In Life, When My Dreams Are Fulfiiled, With Love And Riches I Desired, I Do Not Even Think That, My Destiny Brought Me Here, I Just Give Credit To Myself. When We Meet Our Beloved, When We Start To Love And Miss Each Other, Why We Give All The Credit To Fate And Destiny? We Strove To Get Into That Enchanted World, We Played All The Rituals Of The Love Acts, There Is No Destiny, We Got Into It By Our Own Free Will. When We Are Sad, With The Miseries Of Life And Death, With Broken Dreams Of Happy Life, With Tormented Heart In Our Love Oasis, Why We Think That All Of It Was In Our Destiny? Life Is Like An Ocean Wave, It Has Low Tides, Soon To Be Followed By The High Tide, All We Need Is Faith And Determination, To Get Over The Notion Of Our Predetermined Destiny. Destiny Does Not Shape Our Future, We Do By Our Deeds And Actions, I Do Not Beleived In Pre Professed Destiny, Because I Shape My Own Destiny.
Standing Here On The Threshold Of A Brand New Dawn, We Ponder Over Things Wondering If We Belong Within This Crazy World Of Ours. Wondering If Our Destiny Waits For Us Somewhere Else. We Never Know The Outcome Until The Time Comes Along. There Is No Way To Change It And No Reason To Do It. Just Let The Future Shape Our Destiny Whenever And Wherever That Might Eventually Be. 1 February 2008.
I Stood On A Hill Overlooking The Sea, And Wondered What My Destiny Be. Would I Be Loved Or Would I Be Lonely? Would I Sail On A Pirate Clipper In Search Of Some Lost Treasure? The Wind Ruffled My Hair, But The Sea Never Spoke To Me. Every Person Has A Journey, For Some It Is Long, While Others It Is Short. No One Can Read Our Destiny; We Only Make It What It Is To Be.
Wounded By Destiny, I Struggle, For A Life, I Thought Never Existed, A Life Without His Touch, A Life Without His Shine, A Life Without His Love, A Life That Was Never Mine Stabbed By The Truth Of His Death, I Breath, An Air Devoid Of That Fragrance, Fragrance Of Trust, So Scattered, Fragrance Of Loyalty That Mattered, Fragrance Of Faith, So Divine, Fragrance Of Love, You Were Never Mine Strangled By His Thoughts, I Died, In The Shades Of His Memories, Memories Of The Way He Loved Me, Memories Of The Way He Cared, Memories Of The Times I Cried, Memories Of The Promises We Made.
There She Stands With Her Evil Hands What Do I Do As A Tiny Man Against This Vicious Beautiful Woman However Good I Try To Be Nay She Says You Only Get What Is Destined From Me Why Do I Work Why Do I Love Why Do I Even Pray When All I Get Is Already Predestined.
My Destiny Is To Dream Dream Of Who I Want To Be My Destiny Is To Live The Way I Want To Live In Independent Freedom My Destiny Is To Love Love Without Shame My Destiny, My Destiny My Destiny Is To Live.
Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands Some Have Been Known To Say But Circumstance In All Of That Must Have Some Part To Play If You Are Born On No Hope Street And Homeless In Your Youth To You Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands Does Not Have A Ring Of Truth. Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands To Some May Well Apply It May Apply To You And He And Her As Well As I But Not Of Course To Everyone Each Day Thousands Of Hunger Die Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands To The Millions Is A Lie. The Innocents Who Die In War And Acts Of Terrorism Did Not Create Their Destiny They Would Not Wish It On Themselves For To Die So Tragically Their Destiny Was In Others Hands Which Often Is The Case They Just Happened At The Wrong Time For To Be In The Wrong Place. That Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands Apply To Some Maybe But Ninety Nine Per Cent Of Street Kids Will Die In Poverty Due To Their Circumstances Of Birth They Are Condemned To Fail And Some Of Them Die Of Drug Overdoses And Some Of Them Die In Jail.
My Destiny Haunts Me Day, My Destiny Haunts Me At Nights. My Destiny Speaks To Me Each Morning, Still I Have Not Understood What "destiny Is". My Destiny Keeps Me Up At Nights Pondering About "destiny", Which I Have Heard So Much About. Yet I Can Not Find The Answer To My Own Destiny. Seeing My Fellow Human It Would Appear That Most Of Them Have Found The Secret To This Destiny. But, Some Like Myself Are Still In Search Of Our Destiny. My Destiny Suddenly Comes To Light When I Was Near My End Through The Path Of Life. And, It Was At That Point I Became Aware That My Task Throughout My Life Was My Destiny. My Destiny Has Been Visible In My Actions, In My Words During My Life. The Failer To Make Contact With My Destiny Was None Other, Than Lack Of Understanding. Destiny Beckon At Me With These Words, "if You Had Known The Meaning Of The Word Destiny, You Would Not Have Toiled So Much." That Is Your Destiny.
We Met At The Pool When You Were Just A Kid Such A Gentle Soul, A Life Barely Lived I Had To Leave For A Little While You Welcomed Me Back With That Same Warm Smile I Wanted To Know You Just A Bit Better That One Night Lasted Almost Forever I Guess U Dont Know It Yet But That Night You Saved Me From Inner Death For Some Strange Reason I Felt A Connection One I Havent Felt In 19 Years Life Lessons As Time Went On We Only Got Closer I Prayed Day And Night For It Never To Be Over But The Past Shows Us Nothing Last Forever Why Didnt I Try To Do Things A Bit Better I Became Selfish, Greedy And One Track Minded I Wanted You All To Myself Until I Was Reminded That Things Arent Always As They Seem It Was Just All My Pathetic Little Dream We Learnt Together A Long Time Ago Life Without The Other Just Wasnt The Go We Cant Be Together And Cant Be Without I Should Never Have Opened My Big Mouth So Here We Are Now Trying To Patch This Up What Brought This On So Quickly, So Abrupt Of Course Thats Right It Was Me Chasing My Fabricated Destiny I Hope We Can Move Past This Mess I Know I Will Try My Absoloute Best I Want, No I Need You In My Life Who Is To Say Wether Its Wrong Or Right Time Is The Only Judge, That Will Truly Decide Wether I Should Leave This Place Or Swallow My Pride Because I Dont Want To Lose You Or Have To Leave We Are Destined To Be Just Friends, I Have To Believe.
We Plot Our Own Destiny Be It The Path To Happiness Or The Road To Ruin. Despite The Highs And Lows Of Our Lives It Is We And We Alone Who Plot Our Own Destinies. We Can Choose To Be Changed Or Be The Agents Of Change We Can Remain Chained To The Taboos Imposed By Society Or We Can Unchain Ourselves And Be Free Whatever We Chose Will Finally Make Or Mar Our Destiny.
I Now Gaze Fixedly And Intently Upon Our Predetermined Destiny And Realize That Our Love Is Nothing But A Perversion Of Reality, A Distortion Of Equality, Nothing But A Cataclysmic Consequence Of Infatuation. I Foresee The Dark Ahead Even As We Lay Enervated By Our Unsheathed Passion And As The Incandescent Glow Of Our Love Begins To Attenuate I Realize This Is Our Destiny Our Never Ending Legacy. I Now Lament That Which Is Our Destiny For It Is Not That Of Which I Had Envisioned For Us, Now I Fear Our Destiny Is Sealed As The Wheels Of Fate Conspire To Rob Us Of Our Eternal Desire.the Life We Shared Smolders In The Ashes Of Our Future. This Is To Be Our Destiny.

In An Instant I Am Transported To Exotic Faraway Landscapes Without Ever Leaving My Own Chair, My Soul Free To Experience Things It Never Can Otherwise.

Saigon War Museum Burnt Hole Ridden Children Clothes My Heart Too In Tatters At The War Museum, There Were Exhibits Of Clothes Of Prisoners And Even Those Of Children Killed In The Vietnamese War. I Remember When I Went To Visit The Killing Field In Cambodia, There Were Also Exhibits Of Torn Clothes Right Below The Monument Where They Exhibit The Skulls Of Those Killed In The War. They Really Put My Heart In Tatters.

If To Russia You Have Great Need To Go There Is Much More Buried There Than Snow And Hitler And Napoleon Both Will Tell Casual Preperation Is A Formula For Woe If In Russia You Truly Want Success To Show Do Not Casually To Mother Russia Go.
Every Year Without Knowing It I Have Passed The Day When The Last Fires Will Wave To Me And The Silence Will Set Out Tireless Traveller Like The Beam Of A Lightless Star Then I Will No Longer Find Myself In Life As In A Strange Garment Surprised At The Earth And The Love Of One Woman And The Shamelessness Of Men As Today Writing After Three Days Of Rain Hearing The Wren Sing And The Falling Cease And Bowing Not Knowing To What.
Death Is Nothing At All. I Have Only Slipped Away To The Next Room. I Am I And You Are You. Whatever We Were To Each Other, That, We Still Are. Call Me By My Old Familiar Name. Speak To Me In The Easy Way Which You Always Used. Put No Difference Into Your Tone. Wear No Forced Air Of Solemnity Or Sorrow. Laugh As We Always Laughed At The Little Jokes We Enjoyed Together. Play, Smile, Think Of Me. Pray For Me. Let My Name Be Ever The Household Word That It Always Was. Let It Be Spoken Without Effect. Without The Trace Of A Shadow On It. Life Means All That It Ever Meant. It Is The Same That It Ever Was. There Is Absolute Unbroken Continuity. Why Should I Be Out Of Mind Because I Am Out Of Sight? I Am But Waiting For You. For An Interval. Somewhere. Very Near. Just Around The Corner. All Is Well. Nothing Is Past; Nothing Is Lost. One Brief Moment And All Will Be As It Was Before Only Better, Infinitely Happier And Forever We Will All Be One Together With Christ.

Perhaps If Death Is Kind, And There Can Be Returning, We Will Come Back To Earth Some Fragrant Night, And Take These Lanes To Find The Sea, And Bending Breathe The Same Honeysuckle, Low And White. We Will Come Down At Night To These Resounding Beaches And The Long Gentle Thunder Of The Sea, Here For A Single Hour In The Wide Starlight We Shall Be Happy, For The Dead Are Free. Submitted By Venus.
I See The Death Everyday Death In Relations Death In Religion And Faith Death Of Man In Man Everyday, Everywhere, Every Moment Death, Death And Death. I Experience The Death Around Me Millions And Billions Of Ceremonies The Smoke On Maps Of Mankind Death In Temple And Streets Death In Clubs And Parties Death, Death And Death. I Foresee The Death Of Humanity Harassment, Discrimination And Hatred Death In Purity And Sacredness Death In Broken Mirrors And Home Death In King, Death In Masses Death, Death And Death.
We Shall Not Ever Meet Them Bearded In Heaven Nor Sunning Themselves Among The Bald Of Hell; If Anywhere, In The Deserted Schoolyard At Twilight, Forming A Ring, Perhaps, Or Joining Hands In Games Whose Very Names We Have Forgotten. Come Memory, Let Us Seek Them There In The Shadows.
Now While My Lips Are Living Their Words Must Stay Unsaid, And Will My Soul Remember To Speak When I Am Dead? Yet If My Soul Remembered You Would Not Heed It, Dear, For Now You Must Not Listen, And Then You Could Not Hear.
If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem I Would Write It Special And Only To You If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem So That We Will Forever Remain So Very Very True If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem With More Than A Goodness Like Something New If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem Like The Everlasting Stay Of The Sky So Blue If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem I Would Pray To God If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem I Would Work Very Hard For The Lord If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem With Happiness The Remain All Through The Year F Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem Knowing That You Will Be Very Near If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem One So Very Very True If Only I Could Write A Beautiful Love Poem I Would Write It Just For You.
My Poem Would Eat Nothing. I Tried Giving It Water But It Said No, Worrying Me. Day After Day, I Held It Up To The Llight, Turning It Over, But It Only Pressed Its Lips More Tightly Together. It Grew Sullen, Like A Toad Through With Being Teased. I Offered It Money, My Clothes, My Car With A Full Tank. But The Poem Stared At The Floor. Finally I Cupped It In My Hands, And Carried It Gently Out Into The Soft Air, Into The Evening Traffic, Wondering How To End Things Between Us. For Now It Had Begun Breathing, Putting On More And More Hard Rings Of Flesh. And The Poem Demanded The Food, It Drank Up All The Water, Beat Me And Took My Money, Tore The Faded Clothes Off My Back, Said Shit, And Walked Slowly Away, Slicking Its Hair Down. Said It Was Going Over To Your Place.
You Little Box, Held To Me Escaping So That Your Valves Should Not Break Carried From House To House To Ship From Sail To Train, So That My Enemies Might Go On Talking To Me, Near My Bed, To My Pain The Last Thing At Night, The First Thing In The Morning, Of Their Victories And Of My Cares, Promise Me Not To Go Silent All Of A Sudden.

There Is Always Something To Be Made Of Pain. Your Mother Knits. She Turns Out Scarves In Every Shade Of Red. They Were For Christmas, And They Kept You Warm While She Married Over And Over, Taking You Along. How Could It Work, When All Those Years She Stored Her Widowed Heart As Though The Dead Come Back. No Wonder You Are The Way You Are, Afraid Of Blood, Your Women Like One Brick Wall After Another.
Song Made In Lieu Of Many Ornaments, With Which My Loue Should Duly Haue Bene Dect, Which Cutting Off Through Hasty Accidents, Ye Would Not Stay Your Dew Time To Expect, But Promist Both To Recompens, Be Vnto Her A Goodly Ornament, And For Short Time An Endlesse Moniment.
Just Past Dawn, The Sun Stands With Its Heavy Red Head In A Black Stanchion Of Trees, Waiting For Someone To Come With His Bucket For The Foamy White Light, And Then A Long Day In The Pasture. I Too Spend My Days Grazing, Feasting On Every Green Moment Till Darkness Calls, And With The Others I Walk Away Into The Night, Swinging The Little Tin Bell Of My Name.
Loe Where She Comes Along With Portly Pace, Lyke Phoebe From Her Chamber Of The East, Arysing Forth To Run Her Mighty Race, Clad All In White, That Seemes A Virgin Best. So Well It Her Beseemes That Ye Would Weene Some Angell She Had Beene.

Ne Dare Lift Vp Her Countenance Too Bold, But Blush To Heare Her Prayses Sung So Loud, So Farre From Being Proud. Nathlesse Doe Ye Still Loud Her Prayses Sing, That All The Woods May Answer And Your Eccho Ring.

When The Sun Rise In The Morning Then You Shine Like A Brighten Lady When The Moon Set In The Evening Then You Look Like A Beautiful Lady When I Go To Bed In The Night Then You Twinkle Like Stars When The Cool Breeze Touches Me Then I Take Care Of Your Love When You Are Under My Arms Then I Tell You How Much I Love You When I Say My Night Prayers Then I Thank God For Giving You To Me When I Close My Eyes To Sleep Then You Rest Your Head On My Chest And Listen To My Heart Beat Says You Are Mine.
Inner Voice Straining To Be Heard Evincing What I Already Know To Be True Yet Your Web Of Lies Is So Beautifully Spun Before Me That I So Want To Find Even The Tiniest Glimmer Of Truth In Those Lies Convincing Myself That Those Beautiful Lies Originated From Some Beautiful Truth.
We Loved Eachother Our Hearts Were Warm You Loved Me I Loved You Back But The Sands Of Time Made Our Love Lack I Needed You And Hated You Also We Screamed, We Yelled Our Mutual Hatred Swelled The Day Finally Came When You Handed Back Your Token The Emotion Inside Had Finally Woken My Spirit Was Broken I Became A Shell Wishing You Would Burn In Hell I Wanted So Bad To Scream And Yell My Mind Has Been Set Up After All I Swallow My Demon, And Then I Fall.
If I Am Not In Your Life, Do Not Mind However, I Will Come In Your Dreams Every Night Every Night I Will Come And Sit, In Front Of You Touching You And Feeling Your Soft Breaths Hold Your Hand And Looking Into Your Lake Eyes You Are Singing And I Am Listening Your Sweet Voice My Head On Your Sky Laps You Rolling Your Fingers Into My Hairs You Dropping Your Love On Me As A Rain Moreover, I Play With Like A Little Kid Games And The Time Is Come The Moon Completed His Journey Stars Are Going His Home We Waked Up And Came Out Of The Dreams Here We Saw Beautiful Morning Scene Sun Is Red And Bright Birds Are Singing Cold Polite Wind Flow, Flowers Are Laughing Moreover, We Both Are Thinking About This Beautiful Dream.
Tears Are Falling, From Beautiful Eyes. Tears Are Falling, Because Of Beautiful Lies. Tears Are Falling, Because Of What You Said. Tears Are Falling, Onto A Beautiful Bed. Tears Are Falling, In A Beautiful Stream. Tears Are Falling, Because Of A Beautiful Dream. Tears Are Falling, Because Of Your Lies. Tears Are Falling, As Beautiful Dies.
As I Walked Down The Steps, My Eyes Caught Your Innocence. The Moisture On Your Lips Inviting To Be Kissed. Your Firm Suple Breast Could Not Make Me Rest; And As You Walked Towards Me All I Wanted Was Us To Be Alone. As I See You Bid Farewell, I Wish To See You Again. But In My Mind You Shall Remain Forever As My Beautiful Little Stranger.
A Shimmering Of Your Hair As I Glance In Awe A Quiver Of Your Lips As I Swallow In Anticipation A Flashing Of Your Eyes As I Stand Near Not Far A Movement Of Your Hips As I Watch You Walk A Gesture Of Your Hand As I Lower My Lips A Laughter In The Air As I Make Another Quip A Sigh From Deep Within As I Tell You My Intent A Gasp From Tender Breast As I Look So Deep Within A Tremble In Your Legs As I Make You Remember And You Have Absolutely No Doubt Beauty Is In The Making Through Each Breath Each Of Us Are Together Taking.
What Gives It Power Makes It Change Its Mind At Each Extreme, And Lean Its Rising Rain Down Low, First One And Then The Other Way; In Which Exchange Humility And Pride Reverse, Forgive, Arise, And Die Again, Wherefore It Holds At Both Ends Of The Day The Rainbow In Its Scattering Grains Of Spray.

You Appear There In Front Of Me Very Nearly Transparent Your Presence Looking Like A Reflection In A Mist Shrouded Mirror So Hazy A Strong Puff Might Blow You Away Like Fog Yet This Love Is Not The Memory Of A Beautiful Dream When I Reach Out You Are There.
I Woke Up My Body Was Cold I Climbed Off The Bed I Tried Not To Fall I Couldnt See Everything Was A Blur I Remember Being Beat Before I Reached Unconciesness I Heard Them Speak They Talked Of Blood And The Next Chapter To The Book Of Shadows I Felt The Blade But It Didnt Hurt I Couldnt Speak Maybe I Couldnt Even Breathe All I Know Is Right Now Im In The Hospital Laying In The Bed I Hear The Breathing Machine Behind Me Buzz Inside My Head Who Makes The Decision?.
I Walked To The Cliff Top To Watch The Sunset Thinking Of You And The Time That We Met I Watched As The Sun Drifted Down From The Sky A Reminding Reflection Of Light In Your Eyes A Myriad Birds Flocked From Over The Hill Returning To Roost As The World Stood Still Their Fawning And Waving High Up In The Air Brought Memories To Me How You Unfurl Your Hair The Sea Seemed To Amble As If In A Trance When Reaching The Rocks Leaping Into A Dance Its Light Sparking Rainbows In Fine Misty Haze A Lasting Encounter Of How We Embrace The Sun Kissed The Horizon Like I Kiss Your Lips It Was Saying Goodnight With Its Light Fingertips Caressing The Ocean And Stretching My Way A Beautiful End To A Beautiful Day.
The Soul It Seeks To Perch And Pray A Tune That Renders Fine Without A Stop When Started Forth It Hopes To Sing A Line With Feathers Wafting At Its Crest Like Hornets In Its Nest In Storm And Lightning Thunderous Sounds Appeal To All In Zest The Warmth That Beats Within The Chest Is Hard Concealed To Spin But In The Cold And On The Seas Its Surely Bound To Win.
I Think About The Future, And I Wonder About Our Life. To Much Hate For One Planet, To Much Fear. Somehow, I Missed The Announcement That Love Had Died, I Missed Her Funeral, I Hope It Was Nice. Lost; The Masses Cling To Faith, While The Homeless Cling To Paper Sacks, Filled With Empty Dreams, Fading, Like Old Yellow Newspapers, In The Rain. In The Future, There Will Be A Day, When Life Will Be Worth More Than Greed; And Paper Sacks, Are Just Paper Sacks. I Hope It Comes Soon.
You Do Not Confuse Me You Only Confound The Issues. I Am Not Taken Back By Your Ignorance Only Slightly Delayed By It As I Struggle To Understand Why I Should Care. I Am Weakened By My Sense Of Humanity Not By My Love For It For My Love Is The One True Strength That Keeps You From Destroying Me As I Pause To Consider Any Possible Method To Your Madness.
As Mountains Dwell In Timeless Sleep, As Seasons Come And Go As Oceans Roll Across The Deep, As Forests Slowly Grow An Evil Has Been Gathering, A Dark Age Has Begun All Life On Earth Shall Rue This Day, The Time Of Man Has Come With Axe And Pick That Chop And Chip, The Land Shall Be Stripped Bare With Fire And Steel, That Burn And Deal A Death To All Who Care With Hate And Greed, That Fuel And Feed The Coming Of The End Into A Fate Consumed With Hate Our World Will Now Descend As Mountains Wake, Roar And Quake, As Seasons Loose Their Sway As Oceans Rise To Turn The Tide, And Forests Die Away A Giant Is Awakening, A Cleansing Will Ensue All Life On Earth Shall Rue This Day; The Debt Of Man Is Due With Rock And Flame That Smash And Maim, Life Shall Be Erased With Flood And Wave, That Drowns And Paves A Path To Deaths Embrace Mother Earth Begins Again, But None Remain To Tell That The Balance Is Precarious, Between Paradise And Hell.
The Past Is What Makes Me, Me The Now Is What I Choose To Be The Future Is What I Cant See If I Live In The Past The Now Wont Last The Future Comes Fast The Past Was Bad The Now Is Sad The Future Has To Be Glad The Past Is Over And Gone The Now Is Here, So I Go On The Future Is Soon To Come.
Is It True? That The Future Is Always Bright In The Past There Was Not Much Light The Future Is Ours To Behold But What I Was Told In The Future You Get Old The Future Will Come This Is Sure Yours And Mine One Sec. At A Time Until The Final Curtain Our Lives Uncertain What The Future Will Bring Will Be Exciting.
We Stand Together, United As One, Forward On We Go, Facing Friend And Foe. We Do Not Turn Back For Regret; We Have Not Time For That. If We Make Mistakes We Will Repair Them At A Future Time, We Can Stop To Help An Injured Soul, For A Brief Moment In Time As We Go. Our Mission Lies, Somewhere In The Future, So We Cannot Linger Here. What Our Mission Is, Only Someone Else Knows. We Will Know What It Is Before The Final Curtains Close.
The Vanishing Future The Lake We Swam In, As Children, Is Now A Sea Of Knee High Thistles, In Summer Evenings, That Had No Night, We Fished For Trout, Now I See Empty Tins Of Sardines Blinking In Fading Sunlight I Had Travelled Long To Get Here Fifty Years Or So, My Old Home Was An Oblong Square On Ugly Ground, But I Did Find A Rusty Spade To Dig My Tiny Space While Smoking A Last Cigarette Or Two.
Near The Shore Of That Eventful Destiny, Hold Us No Resentments Of The Past. From The Mistakes Of The Past, Let Us Not Challenge The Present And My Friend, I Know I Hurt You And Even You Hurt Me. For The Time On Which We Heal The Past And Erase Our Eroded Egos And I Promise I Cause You No Further Harm, From My Anger On Which I Reacted But Not Intentional. Calm Now The Seashore And I Know It Is Not Easy To Forget The Clouds Of Shadows Covered On One Good Friendship And At The End Wisdom Is Not A Flagship Label To Cover The Pretences Of Life And I Feel It Is Time To Forget And Forgive In Grace As Life Is Too Short To Settle Scores On A Battlefield To Dampen The Creative Brightness Of Future November 30,2008.
I Remember When Love Was A Stranger In A Lonely Life I Led, Then You Came Along, And My World Changed For The Better. You Put Sunshine Into My Smile, Air Under My Shoes, Made Me Feel Ten Foot Tall, And Filled With Love This Empty Shell. Now Love Walks With Me, Everywhere That I Go. The Lonely Life I Lead Is No More. You Are My Soul And Inspiration As Into The Future We Go.
A Memory Or Two Returning Reappearing Surprisingly Entering Our Hearts Again Not The Same Always Rearranged Haunting And Intriguing Living And Dying Pushing And Pulling Remembering Togetherness Moments Of Shared Hearts In The Midst Of Isolation Remembering That We Were Not Alone No Longer Applying Such Long Forgotten Traces Of Feeling And Thought Never Again Will Our Lives Be As They Were A Future Uncertain With Unknown Duration Past Reflected As If Present Selecting Each Moment Wondering Searching For Meaning Past Changing As The Future Takes Hold Of Us.
My Future Is Already Set My Future Is Finding The Right Person For Me I Plan On Keeping That One Forever This Future Tells Me That I Am Going To Have A Perfect Husband My Future Tells Me That I Would Be Doing What I Love In Life This Future Tells Me To Keep My Dreams And Opition Open In My Future I Am Going To Be A Great Mother This Future Tells Me Already That I Am Going To Have The Man I Always Wanted And A Babygirl Named Dymond The Name I Always Wanted Too. My Future Id Just Perfect My Future.

After Dark Near The South Dakota Border, The Moon Is Out Hunting, Everywhere, Delivering Fire, And Walking Down Hallways Of A Diamond. Behind A Tree, It Ights On The Ruins Of A White City Frost, Frost. Where Are They Gone Who Lived There? Bundled Away Under Wings And Dark Faces.

On Ourselves We Invite The Anger Of Nature She Can Shake To Rubble Our Mightiest Towers Yet She Can Be Gentle The One We Live Off Of And We See Her Great Beauty In Her Blossoms And Flowers.

For Standing There, Iraqi Girl, Age Close To Seven, Dress Torn, Sandals Broken, Cupped Hands Outstretched; No Nose, No Cheek, No Right Eye. Staring Out Instead A Gap, A Void, A Fly Trapped Festering Hole. Horror Struck, I Search, I Find A Coin, A Silver One, To Give, To Push Into Her Hand. I Think Girl With Only Half A Face, Please Go Away, Please Leave My View, Seeing You I Ache, I Pain, I Hurt, For You Do Offend My Sight. She Had Run, Had Scurried Off, Was Quickly Gone.

I Was Built In 1914 On A Chicago City Block. Wrigley Field Had Come To The Scene, Where Cubs Baseball Fever Would Rock. Some Decades Later, Ivy Grew Famously On My Outfield Walls.

The Great Chicago Fire, Friends, Will Never Be Forgot; In The History Of Chicago It Will Remain A Darken Spot. It Was A Dreadful Horrid Sight To See That City In Flames; But No Human Aid Could Save It, For All Skill Was Tried In Vain. In The Year Of 1871, In October On The 8th, The People In That City, Then Was Full Of Life, And Great. Less Than Four Days It Lay In Ruins, That Garden City, So Great Lay Smouldering In Ashes, In A Sad And Pitiful State. It Was A Sad, Sad Scene Indeed, To See The Fire Arise, And Hear The Crackling Of The Flames As It Almost Reached The Skies, And Sadder Still, To Hear The Moans, Of People In The Flames Cry For Help, And None Could Get, Ah, Die Where They Remained. To See The People Run For Life; Up And Down The Blazing Streets, To Find Then, Their Escape Cut Off By The Fiery Flaming Sheets, And Others Hunting For Some Friend That Perhaps They Never Found, Such Weeping, Wailing, Never Was Known, For A Thousands Miles Around. Some People Were Very Wealthy On The Morning Of The 10th. But At The Close Of The Evening, Was Poor, But Felt Content, Glad To Escape From Harm With Life With Friends They Loved So Well, Some Will Try To Gain More Wisdom, By The Sad Sight They Beheld. Five Thousand People Were Homeless, Sad Wanderers In The Streets, With No Shelter To Cover Them, And No Food Had They To Eat. They Wandered Down By The Lake Side, Lay Down On The Cold Damp Ground, So Tired And Weary And Homeless, So The Rich, The Poor, Was Found. Mothers With Dear Little Infants, Some Clinging To The Breast.

Like The First Cracks In The Ice Of A Pond My Heart Began To Break And Fall Apart Desires And Plans Slipping Through The Cleft Pieces Falling Into The Cold Water Of Sorrow Any Hope Of Becoming Numb Grows Futile.

Lie Still, Sleep Becalmed, Sufferer With The Wound In The Throat, Burning And Turning. All Night Afloat On The Silent Sea We Have Heard The Sound That Came From The Wound Wrapped In The Salt Sheet. Under The Mile Off Moon We Trembled Listening To The Sea Sound Flowing Like Blood From The Loud Wound And When The Salt Sheet Broke In A Storm Of Singing The Voices Of All The Drowned Swam On The Wind. Open A Pathway Through The Slow Sad Sail, Throw Wide To The Wind The Gates Of The Wandering Boat For My Voyage To Begin To The End Of My Wound, We Heard The Sea Sound Sing, We Saw The Salt Sheet Tell. Lie Still, Sleep Becalmed, Hide The Mouth In The Throat, Or We Shall Obey, And Ride With You Through The Drowned.

I Watch You, As You Sleep, The Glow, A Rosy Hue Of Roman Cheeks, A Tiny Trickle, As If Glued Onto The Crease Of Lips So Red And So Inviting, Your Hands Asleep In What They Call The Warmest Spot Of Living Humans, I Wish I Could, And Surely Would. I Am Your Guard Tonight, Just Sitting Here, Prepared To Be The Death Of Horny Demons, Should They Forget Their Place And Wander In. I Have Now Put The Final Cork Away, And Opened Up The Kitchen Clock To Rip The Living Battery And Put An End To It, The Pulse Of Time. I Shall Be Happy Just To Sit Here, By Your Side, And Dream About The Warmth Of You, In All Those Feather Downs. For Angie.

Everything On The Earth Bristled, The Bramble Pricked And The Green Thread Nibbled Away, The Petal Fell, Falling Until The Only Flower Was The Falling Itself.

Shy One, Shy One, Shy One Of My Heart, She Moves In The Firelight Pensively Apart. She Carries In The Dishes, And Lays Them In A Row. To An Isle In The Water With Her Would I Go.

If You Have Forgotten Water Lilies Floating On A Dark Lake Among Mountains In The Afternoon Shade, If You Have Forgotten Their Wet, Sleepy Fragrance, Then You Can Return And Not Be Afraid.

Before The First Ray Of Sunlight On A Frosty Winter Morn. The Frost Has Hazed The Windows To A Feature Of Lands Long Before Our Life Began. To The Time When Dragons Ruled The World With Their Hot Breath And Thunderous Roars. However, The Gods Were Not Happy With Their Chosen Rulers And Banished Them Away. The Crown They Then Handed To Man In Hope For A Better Job Done. Since Then Man Has Ruined Everything His Eyes Gazed On. Therefore, Like The Dragons Of Long Ago, The Gods May Decide In Time To Banish Man As Well. Returning This Planet To The Lush Green Garden That It Used To Be.

I Am A Man Of Poland, Man In A Land Invaded. I Am But Content, That My House Has Not Been Raided. I Walk Up, To My Silent Home, Why Does My Wife Ignore Me. I See My Wife And Son Dead On The Floor Before Me. Jew, Jew, On The Wall In Blood Like A Damned Profanity I Look In Fear At The Madness And Insanity. Two Months I Have Walked The Earth And No Relief I Have Yet Found. One Day, I Saw Soldier Push A Rabbi To The Ground. He Sees The Symbol On My Neck And Puts The Rifle To My Head. I Now Know He Wants To Make Me Like The Poor Rabbi, Dead. I Wrestle Him And Put His Own Bullet Through His Heart. He Writhes In Pain And Hit The Dirt, Like A Twisted Work Of Art. I Know And Fear That In Hell, I Shall Soon Sit. But I Am More Surprised That I Was Good At It. So That Day, I Sold My Soul To The Dark. And Longer Can I Walk Amongst, The Free And Lark. The Kraut Soldier Walks Down The Street, I Crouch Down In The Dairy. He Gets A Bullet Through His Head, First To Fall To The Mercenary.
I Love The Hours Of Misty Morn When Clouds Descend And Kiss With Dew Lilac, Verbena, Rose Bud And Thorn. In Perfumed Morn, I Think Of You. I Love The Hours Of Warm Sunlight.

All Colors Are Pleasing To The Eye While I Think Of You In Seraph Flight Aureole, Wings, In Chromatic Sky. I Love The Hours Of Blissful Night And I Feel You Close In Candlelight. When I Fall Asleep You Hold Me Tight. With Your Love And Hope, I Greet The Light.

As The Sun Shines So We Make Our Hay, Knowing That It Is Not Here To Stay, And That Soon It Will Fade Away, For As The Dawn Comes So Will The Day, For Patience And Hope We Pray, That The Light We Follow Will Never Stray, Our Trust And Future I Their Hands We Lay, Waiting For Their Teachings And Inspiration As A Pay, Like Clay, In The Hands Of A Potter, Is Like Our Lives In Their Hands They Say, And If We Try To Fool Them At To Play, They Will Mould Us Into Whatever They May, And The Path They Will Lead Us Might Slay, So We Do As They Say, And Follow The Whole Way.

A Brave Face Can Certainly Be Misunderstood. Too Soon Lonely In The Darkness Of The Night. Afraid, Crying, Hurting Out Of Sight. No One Knows How Hard One Must Fight. Brave They Are To Those Around Them, Trying Not To Break The Silence Of What Is Really Haunting Them. A Pillar Of Strength For All To Be In Awe, When Deep Inside There Is A Flaw.

Quivering, Not Wanting To Mix With Society Out Of Their Shell, They Crawl In Early Morn To Show A Facade That Can Be Adored The Truth Must Not Prevail, What Life Really Does Entail. Their Fear Of Truth Must Never Be Told. It Is A Secret, Hidden Deep Within The Soul. The Bearer Will Endure Much Pain And Sorrow And Ponder Of Hiding Again Tomorrow Written October 12,2005.

Two Statesmen Met By Moonlight. Their Ease Was Partly Feigned. They Glanced About The Prairie. Their Faces Were Constrained.

I Will Love Them, Saith God, And Not Depart From Them, But Put My Fear Within Their Heart, That I To Them May Always Lovely Be, And That They Never May Depart From Me.

Once Upon A Summer Day, Flowers Bloomed In Full Array, Bright Rays Of Sunlight Spilled Upon My Garden On The Hill.

Skimming Stones, Into A Dirty English Sea, Bieng My Big Strong Dad, You Would Always Beat Me, By A Skim Or Two, You Were The Atlas Of My World, And I Adored You. Watching Me Proudly.

If I Could Only Learn Dark Supernatural Skills That Could Transform Fate Into Ardent Dreams, Then You Would Linger Here In A Blissful Embrace.
Driving On The Nights Highway Deep Into The Dark Night That Swells Scorched By The Moonlight Gone Astray The Wind Laments, The Devils Dwell The Dark Blanket Of The Night Enshrouds A Sudden Chill, A Gust Of Fog Envelops Sensing A Bad Omen, Together We All Crowd The Car Sputters, The Engine Goes Bust The Spirits Rise From The Ashes Chanting Ha Ho, Ha Ho A Searing Bolt Of Lightning Lashes Will There Be No Dawn Tomorrow The Wolves Huddle, Stalking Around Our Door We Could Hear The Beats Of Our Heart Whimpering With Fear, Crouching On The Floor As They Lunge I Wake Up With A Start.
As His Mind Weaves A Spiderweb On The Wall Of His Heart I Silently Watch Bemused Admiring The Intricate Web So Light Beguiling In Its Softness And Watch The Hovering Bees Slowly Becoming A Prisoner Caught In Its Beauty And The Spider Mind Already Moved To A New Wall To Make Its Next Masterpiece.
Everything Looks Different In The Dark Sometimes I Imagine That Things That Are Standing Still Are Moving And They Are Not; It Is Only In My Mind The Dark Sometimes Can Be Frightening The Dark Is Like A Burned Paint The Dark Must Grieve Alone For Its Lost Friend No One Around To Hear Its Silence But The Silence So Peaceful That Tears The Heart I Look Back As I Am Walking To See If Anyone Is Following Me But Thanks God No One Is Only The Sound Of My Footsteps I Hear The Trees In The Dark Looks Strange To Me, I Only See A Dark Shadow.
Dark Is A Shade Of My Heart. When I Close My Eyes I See A Ray Of Light In Dark. It Gives Me Pleasure Of Finding You In Dark. It Gives Me Life Of Your Existence. It Gives Me Passion Of Your Adorable Touches. I Always Want To Close My Eyes To See U In Dark. This Is The Way I Want You. When I Open My Eyes You Are Not In My Mind. It Gives Me Sorrow Of Losing You In Dark. It Gives Me Confusion Of Your Existence. It Gives Me Loneliness When I Am Surrounding With People. I Never Wanted To Open My Eyes Cause I Love You. This Is The Way I Love You.

I See You Now, And It Makes Me Cry In My Heart, One So Beautiful, And Yet, So Damaged And Messed Up Inside.

For I Have Seen Dark Mountains In The Sky, More Himalayan To The Naked Eye, Than Any Reason For Our Where Or Why. Hands Clasp To Lift A Measure Of That Height.

We Shall Not Always Plant While Others Reap The Golden Increment Of Bursting Fruit, Not Always Countenance, Abject And Mute, That Lesser Men Should Hold Their Brothers Cheap; Not Everlastingly While Others Sleep Shall We Beguile Their Limbs With Mellow Flute, Not Always Bend To Some More Subtle Brute; We Were Not Made To Eternally Weep. The Night Whose Sable Breast Relieves The Stark, White Stars Is No Less Lovely Being Dark, And There Are Buds That Cannot Bloom At All In Light, But Crumple, Piteous, And Fall; So In The Dark We Hide The Heart That Bleeds, And Wait, And Tend Our Agonizing Seeds.

Happiness Is Knowing, That You Are Truly Loved, But That Someone Special. Knowing That You Are Secure, With The Person You Are, Is Also Happiness.

Is The Life Lived Of A Belching Frog, More Important Than The One Sitting Quietly On A Lily Pad, Looking At Its Reflection On A Mirror Smooth Pond? Or Is The Frog That Belches, Showing More Appreciation For The Flies That Are Attracted. And The Reason That A Belching Frog, Could Care Less About An Image Reflected. But Expresses A Gratefulness For The Feast, Available To Be Eaten.
The Fairy Tale Says, That Every Time You Kiss A Frog Or Is It A Toad, It Turns Into A Prince Or A Princess, Depending On Which Story You Have Heard. I Thought That I Would Test The Theory. First On A Frog, I Tried, But Nothing Happened There. Then I Grabbed The Biggest Toad, Gave It A Great Big Kiss As You Know. All I Ended Up With Was A Big Wart On The End Of My Nose. So If You Are Looking For A Prince Or Princess, Do Not Kiss A Frog Or Toad, Because You Might End Up Like Me, With A Big Wart On The End Of Your Nose.

And Then A Frog Sang Before The Bog In That Late Afternoon. All Of A Sudden, Its First Loud Song Struck My Ear, Deaf For Nature That Day In Particular. Even If The Rhythm Was Dreary, I Could Felt Something Unusual Surging From That Kind Of Surreptitious Soul Of Mine.
I Fell In Love With A Frog, Who Was Sitting Alone On The Banks Of The Nile, Mooning Over The Premature Decease Of His Beautiful Wife. He Was Sobbing His Heart Out, His Lips Convulsed With Woe, Dripping Emotion, His Chin Atremble, The Words Buried In A Raven Black But Deafening Silence. I Instantly Knew He Was The Find Of My Ultimate Search For Love. A Bathos Unknown To Those Seeking Earthly Pleasures, A Poignancy Knocking Vulgarity Off Its Temporal Pedestal. My Dear Love, Dearest Of All Other Loves, My Love For This Frog, Please Become A Wreath A Halo, A Redemptive Power To Soothe All Pain.

A Glint Of Early Morning Sun Reflected In The Shiny Waxed Panels Of The Parked Cars With Blinding Rays Of Light From The Mirrored Wings Bursting Star Like On My Eyes From A Focal Intensity Only A Pale Shadow Of The Low Lying God In My Heaven Which Hung With Unknown Colour In A Pale Blue Sky. The Sole Of My Shoe Crunched A Gravel Chipping As It Pressed Into The Dry Surface Of The Tarmac Drive Making A Small Mark In Memory Of My Passing A Butterfly With Painted Wings Left Its Soft Repose And Dipped And Rose Upon The Gentle Blowing Wind The Same Air That Filled My Body With Breath And Life.
Hunger Is Fasting Always Eating Bubbles Asking For A People Stick On Which To Chew. Leaking Tears Of Spice To Mellow Tast Of You.

Work In The Morning Work At Noon Work In The Afternoon And Work In The Night. Work, Work, Work One Wakes Up Thinking Of Work Eating And Planning For Work Sleeping And Dreaming Of Work.

Work Is Only A Tiny Part Of Who You Are.
Early Darkness; As Oil We Drip On Tarmac, A Gathering In Black Fallen From The Sky. With Lemon Faces We Shadow The Next. Tears Empty And Clear; Cutting Out The Jabber Still Alive We Drift Over Cobbles. Arms Alongside Too Distant And Too Close, Much Too Close. The Crows Send Us Back Into The Rain, A Brass Aside Breaks The Ring, A Hole In Life. We Stare Into; Is That All?.

The Indian Culture Is Very Sound, It Is Based Upon The Family Background. The Bond Of Their Relationship Is Such Found, That We Can Smell The Presence Like The Hounds. The Indian Families Are Generally Spiritual, Living In A Joint Family Is Traditional. Love Among Each Other Is Proportional, The Partition Of Property Makes Them Emotional. The Support Of The Members Is Generous, Their Affection Towards Us Is Precious, Their Devotion Towards Us Is Fabulous, These Things Make Me Feel Very Specious. The Strength Of The Family Can Even Fight With The Tide, Where Sadness Goes Away And Hide. Where Even Obstacles Give Them The Side, Being The Member Of Such A Family Is My Pride.

Life Is The Cage We Are All Born Into The Zoo Drives Down The Long Snake In The Rain, Everyone Sits Alone In The Park In The Car In The Theatre Everyone Sits Alone And Looks Through Bars Of Their Flesh And Bone No Eager Hand Can Grasp Out Of This No Willing Hand Has The Reach, We Touch Our Flesh To The Flesh Of Our Cages, We Lay Down Chained And Little Birds Sing Beside Others Miles Away And Barking We Touch Steering Wheels As The Lights Cross Our Eyes We Learn To Believe The Birth Of Shadows We Drive, A Line Of Slaves, Down The Road Everyone Sits Alone.
I Hang My Head In My Burning Palms, Tears Sting Against My Soul, Searching For The Calm. Heartaches Like Never Before, Broken, So Lonely And Torn. Never To See The Light, No Tunnel To Be Seen, Sitting Here Alone, Within My Silent Screams. No Hand To Reach For, No One To Hold Me Close, I Have Never Felt So Alone. No One To Pull Me To Safety, No One To Turn To, Just Broken Hearted, Searching For Life Anew. No Embrace, Just Tears That Fall Down My Face. No Guarantees On Life Or Love, Nothing But Dark Clouds Linger Above. The World Tightens Her Grip With Every Breath I Take, Making The Next Step Impossible To Take. Alone In A World, The Void Is Here, Taking Over My Being, Taking My Life, But In This Void I Lose The Strife. Haunting Thoughts Consume Me, Just Looking Through These Tears, Just Wanting To Be Free.
You Not Alone, When You Are Still Alone, O God, From You That I Could Private Be. Since You One Were, I Never Since Was One; Since You In Me, My Self Since Out Of Me, Transported From My Self Into Your Being; Though Either Distant, Present Yet To Either, Senseless With Too Much Joy, Each Other Seeing, And Only Absent When We Are Together. Give Me My Self And Take Your Self Again, Devise Some Means But How I May Forsake You; So Much Is Mine That Doth With You Remain, That, Taking What Is Mine, With Me I Take You; You Do Bewitch Me; O, That I Could Fly From My Self You, Or From Your Own Self I.
It Is Yourself You Seek In A Long Rage, Scanning Through Light And Darkness Mirrors, The Page, Where Should Reflected Be Those Eyes And That Thick Hair, That Passionate Look, That Laughter. You Should Appear Within The Book, Or Doubled, Freed, In The Silvered Glass; Into All Other Bodies Yourself Should Pass. The Glass Does Not Dissolve; Like Walls The Mirrors Stand; The Printed Page Gives Back Words By Another Hand. And Your Infatuate Eye Meets Not Itself Below; Strangers Lie In Your Arms As I Lie Now.

Amongst The Flowers I Am Alone With My Pot Of Wine Drinking By Myself; Then Lifting My Cup I Asked The Moon To Drink With Me, Its Reflection And Mine In The Wine Cup, Just The Three Of Us; Then I Sigh For The Moon Cannot Drink, And My Shadow Goes Emptily Along With Me Never Saying A Word; With No Other Friends Here, I Can But Use These Two For Company; In The Time Of Happiness, I Too Must Be Happy With All Around Me; I Sit And Sing And It Is As If The Moon Accompanies Me; Then If I Dance, It Is My Shadow That Dances Along With Me; While Still Not Drunk, I Am Glad To Make The Moon And My Shadow Into Friends, But Then When I Have Drunk Too Much, We All Part; Yet These Are Friends I Can Always Count On These Who Have No Emotion Whatsoever; I Hope That One Day We Three Will Meet Again, Deep In The Milky Way.
Whilst I Alone Did Call Upon Thy Aid, My Verse Alone Had All Thy Gentle Grace, But Now My Gracious Numbers Are Decayed, And My Sick Muse Doth Give An Other Place. I Grant, Sweet Love, Thy Lovely Argument Deserves The Travail Of A Worthier Pen, Yet What Of Thee Thy Poet Doth Invent He Robs Thee Of, And Pays It Thee Again. He Lends Thee Virtue, And He Stole That Word From Thy Behaviour; Beauty Doth He Give, And Found It In Thy Cheek; He Can Afford No Praise To Thee, But What In Thee Doth Live. Then Thank Him Not For That Which He Doth Say, Since What He Owes Thee, Thou Thyself Dost Pay.

The Doctor Whispered To Me, Be Brave, Don, T Afraid, Tomorrow Will Be Better, Be Strong As A Stone. My Mind Had Been Ruined, I Can, T Thinking At All, The Sky Seems Hazy, How Sad To Be Alone. Seconds Seem Ages; The Day A Thousand Year, The Fear Inside My Body, Told Me, You Are Alone. Suddenly I Saw A Shade, Could That Be My Wife? Could Sons Come To See, How Sad I Am Alone. The Shade Became Too Close, O, God They Are My Sons, My Love Is Coming With Them, How Bad I Was Alone. By Love They Covered My Sky, By Love Returned My Soul, Their Love Grant Me The Strength, In Front Of Being Alone. Tomorrow Will Repair My Heart, Tomorrow Is A Biggest Day, Even If I Died That Day. By Love I Am Not Alone.
When I Walk Alone, I Think Of You My Love When I Walk Alone, I Walk With Broken Heart When I Walk Alone, I Walk With Sadness When I Walk Alone, I Walk With My Silent Tears When I Walk Alone, I Walk With My Sorrow When I Walk Alone, I Walk With My Sad Memories When I Walk Alone, I Walk With My Shattered Dream When I Walk Alone, I Walk With My Hands Lifeless Love Never Walk Alone But You Made Me Walk Alone You Promised Me That You Will Walk With Me Forever But You Made Me Walk Alone With My Tears Forever When The Heaven Stolen You From Me Yesterday All Your Promises Are Gone With The Wind Today, You Made Me Walk Alone With Out You My Love And I Promise You, I Will Walk Alone Till My Journey Ends.

In The Cold I Will Rise, I Will Bathe In Waters Of Ice; Myself Will Shiver, And Shrive Myself, Alone In The Dawn, And Anoint Forehead And Feet And Hands; I Will Shutter The Windows From Light, I Will Place In Their Sockets The Four Tall Candles And Set Them Aflame In The Grey Of The Dawn; And Myself Will Lay Myself Straight In My Bed, And Draw The Sheet Under My Chin.
The Lonely Angel Cries To Herself, Her Head Is Hung Low And Her Body Is Still, She Calls Out Into To Darkness And Hears Her Voice Echo, But There Is No One Else In Her Empty World, She Locks Herself In Afraid Of What Might Happen, Closes The Illusive Curtains And Shuts The Door To Her Feelings, Her Beautiful Face Has Grown Old With Crying, The Perfect Smile Painted On Her Lips Has Been Wiped Off, And Her Dreams And Aspirations Have All Been Erased. She Waits Patiently For Her Walls Of Solid Emotion To Tear, Her Cares Are Not For Money, Power Or Enlightenment, Instead Love And Care Is All That Seeks, Memories Whispered Gently Into Her Ears Is All She Has For Company, She Lays Naked With No Clothes To Protect Her, Her Prayers Are Always For A Light To Guide Her, A Small Crevice Created By Her Hope Lets Warm Air Upon Her, She Sometimes Huddles Against This Unique Warmth, And She Knows That If She Lets Go Of Hope She Will Be Cold Forever.

It Is In Every Leaf, In Your Smile, In Your Tears In Your Toil, In Your Triumphs And In Your Fears. Just Enjoy The Journey Without Looking Back Savour The Senses And You Will Not Lack. Truth Is More In The Process Than The Result Liberates You From Thought And You Can Exult To See The Truth In The False, Thats The Key To Understand, Without Changing It Just Let It Be Love Life, Live It And It Will Set You Free.
The Experience Of Faith Affects All The Faculties And Yet Transcends Them All. Spiritual Life Is Not Mental Life. It Is Not Thought Alone, Nor Is It A Life Of Sensation. It Is Not Merely A Life Of Feeling, Nor Does It Exclude Thought And Feeling But Elevates All In Love And In Faith.
Life Is A Dream To Some. Drifting Without A Goal. Life Is A Tragedy To Others, Without Knowledge Of The Soul. Life Can Be What You Make It. With Courage Undaunted And Strong. If You Try To Do The Best You Can. Instead Of Just Drifting Along. Life Is Earnest, Life Is Demanding, When We Live By Universal Law. For The Laws Are Unfailing And True, For The Flawless Action We Feel Awe. Universal Law Was In The Beginning, And Will Last For Ever More. When We Live By These Laws Life Will Cease To Be A Chore. So Live A Life Of One Who Knows, That Unseen Laws Govern All. Then Your Life Will Run Smoothly, There Will Never Be A Fall.

In The Tranquility Of Hope And Divinity Of Love That Binds Us To Feel The Inner Self Churns The Butterfly Moments Though We Met Umpteen Of Times We Drown To Search, What We Lost Found The New Us In Every Sight Mystical The Experiences, At Different Levels Felt The Warmth Of Your Companionship In Every Breath Though Let Down By The One Whom You Trust Fall In Love, Long For The Real One Love Is Life, Life Is Love.
This Expression That Life Is Love And Love Is Life Is Very Ancient Pronounced By Ancient Seers. But We Have Lost Contact With This Love In The Modern Age.

Return To Our True Nature In The Experience Of The True Spirit.
A Student Life Is A Golden Life, Truly It Is Told. The Student Who Has A Golden Crown Of His Study. Would Be A Great Man In His Life With A Great Hold. Otherwise An Idle Student Becomes A Wild Rowdy. Every Student Should Use His Time In A Proper Way. If He Kills His Time, Surely Time Itself Always Kills Him. Such Student Repents In Life Every Moment Of A Day. A Studen Must Think That His Time Is A Golden Rim. To Be A Dr.an Engineer, A Lawyer Or A Politician. Time Makes Him All For All To Become More Of Thing. Golden Time Of A Golden Life Even Makes A Muscian. One Who Neglects This Period Of Life Becomes Nothing. This Period Has A Great Charm To Make Also A Magician. A Life Is In The Hands Of A Student To Make Him Something.
