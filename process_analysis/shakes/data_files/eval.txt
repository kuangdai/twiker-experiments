If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves: for, indeed, Beseech you, Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificencein so rareI know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us. You pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance. Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together, though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves! I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it.
You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamilhus: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note. I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh; they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man. Would they else be content to die? Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live. If the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one. Nine changes of the watery star have been The shepherds note since we have left our throne Without a burden: time as long again Would be filld up, my brother, with our thanks; And yet we should for perpetuity Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, Yet standing in rich place, I multiply With one We thank you many thousands moe That go before it. Stay your thanks awhile, And pay them when you part. Sir, thats to-morrow. I am questiond by my fears, of what may chance Or breed upon our absence; that may blow No sneaping winds at home, to make us say, This is put forth too truly! Besides, I have stayd To tire your royalty. We are tougher, brother, Than you can put us tot. No longer stay. One seven-night longer. Very sooth, to-morrow.
Well part the time betweens then; and in that Ill no gainsaying. Press me not, beseech you, so. There is no tongue that moves, none, none i the world, So soon as yours could win me: so it should now, Were there necessity in your request, although Twere needful I denied it. My affairs Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder Were in your love a whip to me; my stay To you a charge and trouble: to save both, Farewell, our brother. Tongue-tied, our queen? speak you. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, Charge him too coldly: tell him, you are sure All in Bohemias well: this satisfaction The by-gone day proclaimd: say this to him, Hes beat from his best ward. Well said, Hermione. To tell he longs to see his son were strong: But let him say so then, and let him go; But let him swear so, and he shall not stay, Well thwack him hence with distaffs. Yet of your royal presence Ill adventure The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia You take my lord, Ill give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefixd fors parting: yet, good deed, Leontes, I love thee not a jar o the clock behind What lady she her lord. Youll stay? No, madam. Nay, but you will? I may not, verily. Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I, Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths, Should yet say, Sir, no going. Verily, You shall not go: a ladys verily s As potent as a lords. Will you go yet? Force me to keep you as a prisoner, Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? My prisoner, or my guest? by your dread verily, One of them you shall be. Your guest, then, madam: To be your prisoner should import offending; Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish. Not your gaoler then, But your kind hostess. Come, Ill question you Of my lords tricks and yours when you were boys: You were pretty lordings then. We were, fair queen, Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day to-morrow as to-day, And to be boy eternal. Was not my lord the verier wag o the two? We were as twinnd lambs that did frisk i the sun, And bleat the one at the other: what we changd Was innocence for innocence; we knew not The doctrine of ill-doing, no nor dreamd That any did. Had we pursud that life, And our weak spirits neer been higher reard With stronger blood, we should have answerd heaven Boldly, not guilty; the imposition cleard Hereditary ours. By this we gather You have trippd since. O!
my most sacred lady, Temptations have since then been born tos; for In those unfledgd days was my wife a girl; Your precious self had then not crossd the eyes Of my young playfellow. Grace to boot! Of this make no conclusion, lest you say Your queen and I are devils; yet, go on: The offences we have made you do well answer; If you first sinnd with us, and that with us You did continue fault, and that you slippd not With any but with us. Is he won yet? Hell stay, my lord. At my request he would not. Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokst To better purpose. Never? Never, but once. What! have I twice said well? when wast before? I prithee tell me; crams with praise, and makes As fat as tame things: one good deed, dying tongueless, Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. Our praises are our wages: you may rides With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we heat an acre. But to the goal: My last good deed was to entreat his stay: What was my first? it has an elder sister, Or I mistake you: O! would her name were Grace. But once before I spoke to the purpose: when? Nay, let me havet; I long.
Why, that was when Three crabbed months had sourd themselves to death, Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter, I am yours for ever. Tis grace indeed. Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice: The one for ever earnd a royal husband, The other for some while a friend. Too hot, too hot! To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods. I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances; But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment May a free face put on, derive a liberty From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom, And well become the agent:t may I grant: But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, As now they are, and making practisd smiles, As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as twere The mort o the deer; O! that is entertainment My bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius, Art thou my boy? Ay, my good lord. I fecks? Why, thats my bawcock. What! hast smutchd thy nose? They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf, Are all calld neat. Still virginalling Upon his palm! How now, you wanton calf! Art thou my calf? Yes, if you will, my lord.
Thou wantst a rough pash and the shoots that I have, To be full like me: yet they say we are Almost as like as eggs; women say so, That will say anything: but were they false As oer-dyd blacks, as wind, as waters, false As dice are to be wishd by one that fixes No bourn twixt his and mine, yet were it true To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page, Look on me with your wolkin eye: sweet villain! Most dearst! my collop! Can thy dam?mayt be? Affection! thy intention stabs the centre: Thou dost make possible things not so held, Communicatst with dreams;how can this be? With whats unreal thou co-active art, And fellowst nothing: then, tis very credent Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost, And that beyond commission, and I find it, And that to the infection of my brains And hardening of my brows. What means Sicilia? He something seems unsettled. How, my lord! What cheer? how ist with you, best brother? You look As if you held a brow of much distraction: Are you movd, my lord? No, in good earnest. How sometimes nature will betray its folly, Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms!
Looking on the lines Of my boys face, methoughts I did recoil Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreechd, In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, Lest it should bite its master, and so prove, As ornaments oft do, too dangerous: How like, methought, I then was to this kernel, This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend, Will you take eggs for money? No, my lord, Ill fight. You will? why, happy man be his dole! My brother, Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours? If at home, sir, Hes all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy; My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all: He makes a Julys day short as December, And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood. So stands this squire Officd with me. We two will walk, my lord, And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione, How thou lovst us, show in our brothers welcome: Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap: Next to thyself and my young rover, hes Apparent to my heart. If you would seek us, We are yours i the garden: shalls attend you there? To your own bents dispose you: youll be found, Be you beneath the sky. I am angling now, Though you perceive me not how I give line. Go to, go to! How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband! Gone already! Inch-thick, knee-deep, oer head and ears a forkd one! Go play, boy, play; thy mother plays, and I Play too, but so disgracd a part, whose issue Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play. There have been, Or I am much deceivd, cuckolds ere now; And many a man there is even at this present, Now, while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm, That little thinks she has been sluicd ins absence, And his pond fishd by his next neighbour, by Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, theres comfort int, Whiles other men have gates, and those gates opend, As mine, against their will. Should all despair That have revolted wives the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves. Physic fort there is none; It is a bawdy planet, that will strike Where tis predominant; and tis powerful, think it, From east, west, north, and south: be it concluded, No barricado for a belly: knowt; It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage. Many a thousand ons Have the disease, and feelt not. How now, boy! I am like you, they say. Why, thats some comfort. What! Camillo there? Ay, my good lord. Go play, Mamillius; thourt an honest man. Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
You had much ado to make his anchor hold: When you cast out, it still came home. Didst note it? He would not stay at your petitions; made His business more material. Didst perceive it? Theyre here with me already, whispering, rounding Sicilia is a so-forth. Tis far gone, When I shall gust it last. How camet, Camillo, That he did stay? At the good queens entreaty. At the queens, bet: good should be pertinent; But so it is, it is not. Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine? For thy conceit is soaking; will draw in More than the common blocks: not noted, ist, But of the finer natures? by some severals Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind? say. Business, my lord! I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer. Ha! Stays here longer. Ay, but why? To satisfy your highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress. Satisfy! The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy! Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo, With all the nearest things to my heart, as well My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou Hast cleansd my bosom: I from thee departed Thy penitent reformd; but we have been Deceivd in thy integrity, deceivd In that which seems so. Be it forbid, my lord!
To bide upon t, thou art not honest; or, If thou inclinst that way, thou art a coward, Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining From course requird; or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust, And therein negligent; or else a fool That seest a game playd home, the rich stake drawn, And takst it all for jest. My gracious lord, I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful; In every one of these no man is free, But that his negligence, his folly, fear, Among the infinite doings of the world, Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, If ever I were wilful-negligent, It was my folly; if industriously I playd the fool, it was my negligence, Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, Whereof the execution did cry out Against the non-performance, twas a fear Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord, Are such allowd infirmities that honesty Is never free of: but, beseech your Grace, Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass By its own visage; if I then deny it, Tis none of mine.
Ha not you seen, Camillo, But thats past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass Is thicker than a cuckolds horn,or heard, For to a vision so apparent rumour Cannot be mute,or thought,for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think, My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess, Or else be impudently negative, To have nor eyes, nor ears, nor thought,then say My wifes a hobby-horse; deserves a name As rank as any flax-wench that puts to Before her troth-plight: sayt and justifyt. I would not be a stander-by, to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so, without My present vengeance taken: shrew my heart, You never spoke what did become you less Than this; which to reiterate were sin As deep as that, though true. Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career Of laughter with a sigh?a note infallible Of breaking honesty,horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? Why, then the world and all thats int is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, If this be nothing. Good my lord, be curd Of this diseasd opinion, and betimes; For tis most dangerous. Say it be, tis true. No, no, my lord.
It is; you lie, you lie: I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee; Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, Or else a hovering temporizer, that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, Inclining to them both: were my wifes liver Infected as her life, she would not live The running of one glass. Who does infect her? Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I Had servants true about me, that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits, Their own particular thrifts, they would do that Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, His cup-bearer,whom I from meaner form Have benchd and reard to worship, who mayst see Plainly, as heaven sees earth, and earth sees heaven, How I am galled,mightst bespice a cup, To give mine enemy a lasting wink; Which draught to me were cordial. Sir, my lord, I could do this, and that with no rash potion, But with a lingering dram that should not work Maliciously like poison: but I cannot Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, So sovereingly being honourable: I have lovd thee, Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, To appoint myself in this vexation; sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets, Which to preserve is sleep; which being spotted Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps? Give scandal to the blood o the prince my son, Who I do think is mine, and love as mine, Without ripe moving tot? Would I do this? Could man so blench? I must believe you, sir: I do; and will fetch off Bohemia fort; Provided that when hes removd, your highness Will take again your queen as yours at first, Even for your sons sake; and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours. Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down: Ill give no blemish to her honour, none. My lord, Go then; and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia, And with your queen. I am his cupbearer; If from me he have wholesome beverage, Account me not your servant. This is all: Dot, and thou hast the one half of my heart; Dot not, thou splitst thine own. Ill dot, my lord. I will seem friendly, as thou hast advisd me. O miserable lady! But, for me, What case stand I in?
I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes; and my ground to dot Is the obedience to a master; one Who, in rebellion with himself will have All that are his so too. To do this deed Promotion follows. If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings, And flourishd after, Id not dot; but since Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, Let villany itself forsweart. I must Forsake the court: to dot, or no, is certain To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now! Here comes Bohemia. This is strange: methinks My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? Good day, Camillo. Hail, most royal sir! What is the news i the court? None rare, my lord. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province and a region Lovd as he loves himself: even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes, to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners. I dare not know, my lord. How! dare not! do not! Do you know, and dare not Be intelligent to me? Tis thereabouts: For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not.
Good Camillo, Your changd complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine changd too; for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus alterd witht. There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper; but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well. How! caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk: I have lookd on thousands, who have sped the better By my regard, but killd none so. Camillo, As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto Clerk-like experiencd, which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents noble names, In whose success we are gentle,I beseech you, If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be informd, imprison it not In ignorant concealment. I may not answer. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well! I must be answerd. Dost thou hear, Camillo; I conjure thee, by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge,whereof the least Is not this suit of mine,that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; Which way to be prevented if to be; If not, how best to bear it. Sir, I will tell you; Since I am chargd in honour and by him That I think honourable.
Therefore mark my counsel, Which must be even as swiftly followd as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me Cry lost, and so good night! On, good Camillo. I am appointed him to murder you. By whom, Camillo? By the king. For what? He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, As he had seent or been an instrument To vice you tot, that you have touchd his queen Forbiddenly. O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly, and my name Be yokd with his that did betray the Best! Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour, that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive; and my approach be shunnd, Nay, hated too, worse than the greatst infection That eer was heard or read! Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences, you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly, whose foundation Is pild upon his faith, and will continue The standing of his body. How should this grow? I know not: but I am sure tis safer to Avoid whats grown than question how tis born. If therefore you dare trust my honesty, That lies enclosed in this trunk, which you Shall bear along impawnd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business, And will by twos and threes at several posterns Clear them othe city. For myself, Ill put My fortunes to your service, which are here By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain; For, by the honour of my parents, I Have utterd truth, which, if you seek to prove, I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer Than one condemnd by the kings own mouth, thereon His execution sworn. I do believe thee: I saw his heart ins face. Give me thy hand: Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago. This jealousy Is for a precious creature: as shes rare Must it be great, and, as his persons mighty Must it be violent, and, as he does conceive He is dishonourd by a man which ever Professd to him, why, his revenges must In that be made more bitter. Fear oershades me: Good expedition be my friend, and comfort The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing Of his ill-taen suspicion! Come. Camillo; I will respect thee as a father if Thou bearst my life off hence: let us avoid. It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns: please your highness To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away! Take the boy to you: he so troubles me, Tis past enduring.
Come, my gracious lord, Shall I be your playfellow? No, Ill none of you. Why, my sweet lord? Youll kiss me hard and speak to me as if I were a baby still. I love you better. And why so, my lord? Not for because Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, Become some women best, so that there be not Too much hair there, but in a semicircle, Or a half-moon made with a pen. Who taught you this? I learnd it out of womens faces. Pray now, What colour are your eyebrows? Blue, my lord. Nay, thats a mock: I have seen a ladys nose That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. Hark ye; The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days; and then youd wanton with us, If we would have you. She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come sir, now I am for you again: pray you, sit by us, And tells a tale. Merry or sad shallt be? As merry as you will. A sad tales best for winter. I have one of sprites and goblins. Lets have that, good sir. Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best To fright me with your sprites; youre powerful at it. There was a man, Nay, come, sit down; then on.
Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly; Yond crickets shall not hear it. Come on then, And givet me in mine ear. Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? Behind the tuft of pines I met them: never Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyd them Even to their ships How blest am I In my just censure, in my true opinion! Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursd In being so blest! There may be in the cup A spider steepd, and one may drink, depart, And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge Is not infected; but if one present The abhorrd ingredient to his eye, make known How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider. Camillo was his help in this, his pandar: There is a plot against my life, my crown; Alls true that is mistrusted: that false villain Whom I employd was pre-employd by him: He has discoverd my design, and I Remain a pinchd thing; yea, a very trick For them to play at will. How came the posterns So easily open? By his great authority; Which often hath no less prevaild than so On your command. I knowt too well. Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him: Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you Have too much blood in him. What is this? sport?
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her; Away with him! and let her sport herself With that shes big with; for tis Polixenes Has made thee swell thus. But Id say he had not, And Ill be sworn you would believe my saying, Howeer you lean to the nayward. You, my lords, Look on her, mark her well; be but about To say, she is a goodly lady, and The justice of your hearts will thereto add Tis pity shes not honest, honourable: Praise her but for this her without-door form, Which, on my faith deserves high speech,and straight The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands That calumny doth use,O, I am out! That mercy does, for calumny will sear Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and has, When you have said shes goodly, come between, Ere you can say shes honest. But bet known, From him that has most cause to grieve it should be, Shes an adulteress. Should a villain say so, The most replenishd villain in the world, He were as much more villain: you, my lord, Do but mistake. You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing!
Which Ill not call a creature of thy place, Lest barbarism, making me the precedent, Should a like language use to all degrees, And mannerly distinguishment leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said Shes an adulteress; I have said with whom: More, shes a traitor, and Camillo is A federary with her, and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile principal, that shes A bed-swerver, even as bad as those That vulgars give boldst titles; ay, and privy To this their late escape. No, by my life, Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you When you shall come to clearer knowledge that You thus have publishd me! Gentle my lord, You scarce can right me throughly then to say You did mistake. No; if I mistake In those foundations which I build upon, The centre is not big enough to bear A schoolboys top. Away with her to prison! He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty But that he speaks. Theres some ill planet reigns: I must be patient till the heavens look With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords, I am not prone to weeping, as our sex Commonly are; the want of which vain dew Perchance shall dry your pities; but I have That honourable grief lodgd here which burns Worse than tears drown.
Beseech you all, my lords, With thoughts so qualified as your charities Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so The kings will be performd! Shall I be heard? Who ist that goes with me? Beseech your highness, My women may be with me; for you see My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress Has deservd prison, then abound in tears As I come out: this action I now go on Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord: I never wishd to see you sorry; now I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave. Go, do our bidding: hence! Beseech your highness call the queen again. Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice Prove violence: in the which three great ones suffer, Yourself, your queen, your son. For her, my lord, I dare my life lay down, and will dot, sir, Please you to accept it,that the queen is spotless I the eyes of heaven and to you: I mean, In this which you accuse her. If it prove Shes otherwise, Ill keep my stables where I lodge my wife; Ill go in couples with her; Than when I feel and see her no further trust her; For every inch of woman in the world, Ay, every dram of womans flesh is false, If she be. Hold your peaces!
Good my lord, It is for you we speak, not for ourselves. You are abusd, and by some putter-on That will be damnd fort; would I knew the villain, I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flawd, I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven, The second and the third, nine and some five; If this prove true, theyll pay fort: by mine honour, Ill geld them all; fourteen they shall not see, To bring false generations: they are co-heirs; And I had rather glib myself than they Should not produce fair issue. Cease! no more. You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead mans nose; but I do seet and feelt, As you feel doing thus, and see withal The instruments that feel. If it be so, We need no grave to bury honesty: Theres not a grain of it the face to sweeten Of the whole dungy earth. What! lack I credit? I had rather you did lack than I, my lord, Upon this ground; and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion, Be blamd fort how you might. Why, what need we Commune with you of this, but rather follow Our forceful instigation?
Our prerogative Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness Imparts this; which if you,or stupified Or seeming so in skill,cannot or will not Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves We need no more of your advice: the matter, The loss, the gain, the ordering ont, is all Properly ours. And I wish, my liege, You had only in your silent judgment tried it, Without more overture. How could that be? Either thou art most ignorant by age, Or thou wert born a fool. Camillos flight, Added to their familiarity, Which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture, That lackd sight only, nought for approbation But only seeing, all other circumstances Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding: Yet, for a greater confirmation, For in an act of this importance twere Most piteous to be wild,I have dispatchd in post To sacred Delphos, to Apollos temple, Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know Of stuffd sufficiency. Now, from the oracle They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had, Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well? Well done, my lord. Though I am satisfied and need no more Than what I know, yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others, such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to the truth.
So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confind, Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform. Come, follow us: We are to speak in public; for this business Will raise us all. To laughter, as I take it, If the good truth were known. The keeper of the prison, call to him; Let him have knowledge who I am. Good lady, No court in Europe is too good for thee; What dost thou then in prison? Now, good sir, You know me, do you not? For a worthy lady And one whom much I honour. Pray you then, Conduct me to the queen. I may not, madam: to the contrary I have express commandment. Heres ado, To lock up honesty and honour from The access of gentle visitors! Ist lawful, pray you, To see her women? any of them? Emilia? So please you, madam, To put apart these your attendants, I Shall bring Emilia forth. I pray now, call her. Withdraw yourselves. And, madam, I must be present at your conference. Well, bet so, prithee. Heres such ado to make no stain a stain, As passes colouring. Dear gentlewoman, How fares our gracious lady? As well as one so great and so forlorn May hold together. On her frights and griefs, Which never tender lady hath borne greater, She is something before her time deliverd. A boy?
A daughter; and a goodly babe, Lusty and like to live: the queen receives Much comfort int; says, My poor prisoner, I am innocent as you. I dare be sworn: These dangerous unsafe lunes i the king, beshrew them! He must be told ont, and he shall: the office Becomes a woman best; Ill taket upon me. If I prove honey-mouthd, let my tongue blister, And never to my red-lookd anger be The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia, Commend my best obedience to the queen: If she dares trust me with her little babe, Ill show it to the king and undertake to be Her advocate to the loudst. We do not know How he may soften at the sight of the child: The silence often of pure innocence Persuades when speaking fails. Most worthy madam, Your honour and your goodness is so evident That your free undertaking cannot miss A thriving issue: there is no lady living So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship To visit the next room, Ill presently Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer, Who but to-day hammerd of this design, But durst not tempt a minister of honour, Lest she should be denied. Tell her, Emilia, Ill use that tongue I have: if wit flow fromt As boldness from my bosom, let it not be doubted I shall do good. Now be you blest for it! Ill to the queen. Please you, come something nearer.
Madam, ift please the queen to send the babe, I know not what I shall incur to pass it, Having no warrant. You need not fear it, sir: The child was prisoner to the womb, and is By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchisd; not a party to The anger of the king, nor guilty of, If any be, the trespass of the queen. I do believe it. Do not you fear: upon mine honour, I Will stand betwixt you and danger. Nor night, nor day, no rest; it is but weakness To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If The cause were not in being,part o the cause, She the adultress; for the harlot king Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she I can hook to me: say, that she were gone, Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest Might come to me again. Whos there? My lord? How does the boy? He took good rest to-night; Tis hopd his sickness is dischargd. To see his nobleness! Conceiving the dishonour of his mother, He straight declind, droopd, took it deeply, Fastend and fixd the shame ont in himself, Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, And downright languishd. Leave me solely: go, See how he fares. Fie, fie!
no thought of him; The very thought of my revenges that way Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty, And in his parties, his alliance; let him be Until a time may serve: for present vengeance, Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes Laugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow: They should not laugh, if I could reach them, nor Shall she within my power. You must not enter. Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me: Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas, Than the queens life? a gracious innocent soul, More free than he is jealous. Thats enough. Madam, he hath not slept to-night; commanded None should come at him. Not so hot, good sir; I come to bring him sleep. Tis such as you, That creep like shadows by him and do sigh At each his needless heavings, such as you Nourish the cause of his awaking: I Do come with words as medcinal as true, Honest as either, to purge him of that humour That presses him from sleep. What noise there, ho? No noise, my lord; but needful conference About some gossips for your highness. How! Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus, I chargd thee that she should not come about me: I knew she would. I told her so, my lord, On your displeasures peril, and on mine, She should not visit you. What! canst not rule her?
From all dishonesty he can: in this, Unless he take the course that you have done, Commit me for committing honour, trust it, He shall not rule me. La you now! you hear; When she will take the rein I let her run; But shell not stumble. Good my liege, I come, And I beseech you, hear me, who professes Myself your loyal servant, your physician, Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dares Less appear so in comforting your evils Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come From your good queen. Good queen! Good queen, my lord, good queen; I say, good queen; And would by combat make her good, so were I A man, the worst about you. Force her hence. Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes First hand me: on mine own accord Ill off; But first Ill do my errand. The good queen, For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter: Here tis; commends it to your blessing. Out! A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o door: A most intelligencing bawd! Not so; I am as ignorant in that as you In so entitling me, and no less honest Than you are mad; which is enough, Ill warrant, As this world goes, to pass for honest. Traitors! Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard. Thou dotard!
thou art woman-tird, unroosted By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard; Taket up, I say; givet to thy crone. For ever Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou Takst up the princess by that forced baseness Which he has put upont! He dreads his wife. So I would you did; then, twere past all doubt, Youd call your children yours. A nest of traitors! I am none, by this good light. Nor I; nor any But one thats here, and thats himself; for he The sacred honour of himself, his queens, His hopeful sons, his babes, betrays to slander, Whose sting is sharper than the swords; and will not, For, as the case now stands, it is a curse He cannot be compelld tot,once remove The root of his opinion, which is rotten As ever oak or stone was sound. A callat Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband And now baits me! This brat is none of mine; It is the issue of Polixenes: Hence with it; and, together with the dam Commit them to the fire! It is yours; And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, So like you, tis the worse.
Behold, my lords, Although the print be little, the whole matter And copy of the father; eye, nose, lip, The trick ofs frown, his forehead, nay, the valley, The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his smiles, The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger: And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it So like to him that got it, if thou hast The ordering of the mind too, mongst all colours No yellow int; lest she suspect, as he does, Her children not her husbands. A gross hag! And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hangd, That wilt not stay her tongue. Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat, youll leave yourself Hardly one subject. Once more, take her hence. A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more. Ill ha thee burnd. I care not: It is a heretic that makes the fire, Not she which burns int. Ill not call you tyrant; But this most cruel usage of your queen, Not able to produce more accusation Than your own weak-hingd fancy,something savours Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you, Yea, scandalous to the world. On your allegiance, Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant, Where were her life? she durst not call me so If she did know me one. Away with her! I pray you do not push me; Ill be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; tis yours: Jove send her A better guiding spirit! What need these hands? You, that are thus so tender oer his follies, Will never do him good, not one of you. So, so: farewell; we are gone. Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this. My child! away witht!even thou, that hast A heart so tender oer it, take it hence And see it instantly consumd with fire: Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight: Within this hour bring me word tis done, And by good testimony,or Ill seize thy life, With what thou else callst thine. If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire; For thou settst on thy wife. I did not, sir: These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, Can clear me int. We can, my royal liege, He is not guilty of her coming hither. You are liars all. Beseech your highness, give us better credit: We have always truly servd you, and beseech you So to esteem of us; and on our knees we beg, As recompense of our dear services Past and to come, that you do change this purpose, Which being so horrible, so bloody, must Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel. I am a feather for each wind that blows.
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father? Better burn it now Than curse it then. But, be it; let it live: It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither; You that have been so tenderly officious With Lady Margery, your midwife there, To save this bastards life,for tis a bastard, So sure as thy beards grey,what will you adventure To save this brats life? Any thing, my lord, That my ability may undergo, And nobleness impose: at least, thus much: Ill pawn the little blood which I have left, To save the innocent: any thing possible. It shall be possible. Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding. I will, my lord. Mark and perform it,seest thou!for the fail Of any point int shall not only be Death to thyself, but to thy lewd-tongud wife, Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee, As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry This female bastard hence; and that thou bear it To some remote and desart place quite out Of our dominions; and that there thou leave it, Without more mercy, to its own protection, And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune It came to us, I do in justice charge thee, On thy souls peril and thy bodys torture, That thou commend it strangely to some place, Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
I swear to do this, though a present death Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe: Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say, Casting their savageness aside have done Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous In more than this deed doth require! And blessing Against this cruelty fight on thy side, Poor thing, condemnd to loss! No; Ill not rear Anothers issue. Please your highness, posts From those you sent to the oracle are come An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, Being well arrivd from Delphos, are both landed, Hasting to the court. So please you, sir, their speed Hath been beyond account. Twenty-three days They have been absent: tis good speed; foretells The great Apollo suddenly will have The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords; Summon a session, that we may arraign Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath Been publicly accusd, so shall she have A just and open trial. While she lives My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me, And think upon my bidding. The climates delicate, the air most sweet, Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing The common praise it bears. I shall report, For most it caught me, the celestial habits, Methinks I so should term them,and the reverence Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice! How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly It was i the offering!
But of all, the burst And the ear-deafening voice o the oracle, Kin to Joves thunder, so surprisd my sense, That I was nothing. If the event o the journey Prove as successful to the queen,O, bet so! As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy, The time is worth the use ont. Great Apollo Turn all to the best! These proclamations, So forcing faults upon Hermione, I little like. The violent carriage of it Will clear or end the business: when the oracle, Thus by Apollos great divine seald up, Shall the contents discover, something rare Even then will rush to knowledge.Go:fresh horses! And gracious be the issue! This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce, Even pushes gainst our heart: the party tried The daughter of a king, our wife, and one Of us too much belovd. Let us be cleard Of being tyrannous, since we so openly Proceed in justice, which shall have due course, Even to the guilt or the purgation. Produce the prisoner. It is his highness pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court. Silence! Read the indictment.
Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night. Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation, and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me To say Not guilty: mine integrity Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it, Be so receivd. But thus: if powers divine Behold our human actions, as they do, I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush, and tyranny Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know, Who least will seem to do so,my past life Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true, As I am now unhappy; which is more Than history can pattern, though devisd And playd to take spectators. For behold me, A fellow of the royal bed, which owe A moiety of the throne, a great kings daughter, The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing To prate and talk for life and honour fore Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it.
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, Tis a derivative from me to mine, And only that I stand for. I appeal To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes Came to your court, how I was in your grace, How merited to be so; since he came, With what encounter so uncurrent I Have straind, to appear thus: if one jot beyond The bound of honour, or in act or will That way inclining, hardend be the hearts Of all that hear me, and my nearst of kin Cry fie upon my grave! I neer heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first. Thats true enough; Though tis a saying, sir, not due to me. You will not own it. More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not At all acknowledge.
For Polixenes, With whom I am accusd,I do confess I lovd him as in honour he requird, With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me; with a love even such, So and no other, as yourself commanded: Which not to have done I think had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy, I know not how it tastes, though it be dishd For me to try how: all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man; And why he left your court, the gods themselves, Wotting no more than I, are ignorant. You knew of his departure, as you know What you have undertaen to do ins absence. Sir, You speak a language that I understand not: My life stands in the level of your dreams, Which Ill lay down. Your actions are my dreams: You had a bastard by Polixenes, And I but dreamd it.
As you were past all shame, Those of your fact are so,so past all truth: Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself, No father owning it,which is, indeed, More criminal in thee than it,so thou Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage Look for no less than death. Sir, spare your threats: The bug which you would fright me with I seek. To me can life be no commodity: The crown and comfort of my life, your favour, I do give lost; for I do feel it gone, But know not how it went. My second joy, And first-fruits of my body, from his presence I am barrd, like one infectious. My third comfort, Starrd most unluckily, is from my breast, The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth, Hald out to murder: myself on every post Proclaimd a strumpet: with immodest hatred The child-bed privilege denied, which longs To women of all fashion: lastly, hurried Here to this place, ithe open air, before I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege, Tell me what blessings I have here alive, That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this; mistake me not; no life, I prize it not a straw:but for mine honour, Which I would free, if I shall be condemnd Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake, I tell you Tis rigour and not law. Your honours all, I do refer me to the oracle: Apollo be my judge! This your request Is altogether just: therefore, bring forth, And in Apollos name, his oracle. The Emperor of Russia was my father: O! that he were alive, and here beholding His daughters trial; that he did but see The flatness of my misery; yet with eyes Of pity, not revenge! You here shall swear upon this sword of justice, That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought This seald-up oracle, by the hand deliverd Of great Apollos priest, and that since then You have not dard to break the holy seal, Nor read the secrets int. All this we swear. All this we swear. Break up the seals, and read. Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found! Now blessed be the great Apollo! Praised! Hast thou read truth? Ay, my lord; even so As it is here set down.
There is no truth at all i the oracle: The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood. My lord the king, the king! What is the business? O sir! I shall be hated to report it: The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear Of the queens speed, is gone. How! gone! Is dead. Apollos angry; and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice. How now, there! This news is mortal to the queen: look down, And see what death is doing. Take her hence: Her heart is but oerchargd; she will recover: I have too much believd mine own suspicion: Beseech you, tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life. Apollo, pardon My great profaneness gainst thine oracle!
Ill reconcile me to Polixenes, New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo, Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy; For, being transported by my jealousies To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes: which had been done, But that the good mind of Camillo tardied My swift command; though I with death and with Reward did threaten and encourage him, Not doing it, and being done: he, most humane And filld with honour, to my kingly guest Unclaspd my practice, quit his fortunes here, Which you knew great, and to the certain hazard Of all incertainties himself commended, No richer than his honour: how he glisters Thorough my rust! and how his piety Does my deeds make the blacker! Woe the while! O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, Break too! What fit is this, good lady? What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? What wheels? racks? fires? What flaying? or what boiling In leads, or oils? what old or newer torture Must I receive, whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny, Together working with thy jealousies, Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle For girls of nine, O! think what they have done, And then run mad indeed, stark mad; for all Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betraydst Polixenes, twas nothing; That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant And damnable ingrateful; nor wast much Thou wouldst have poisond good Camillos honour To have him kill a king; poor trespasses, More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter To be or none or little; though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere donet: Nor ist directly laid to thee, the death Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, Thoughts high for one so tender,cleft the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemishd his gracious dam: this is not, no, Laid to thy answer: but the last,O lords! When I have said, cry, woe!the queen, the queen, The sweetest, dearest creatures dead, and vengeance fort Not droppd down yet. The higher powers forbid! I say shes dead; Ill sweart: if word nor oath Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye, Heat outwardly, or breath within, Ill serve you As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant! Do not repent these things, for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee To nothing but despair. A thousand knees Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, Upon a barren mountain, and still winter In storm perpetual, could not move the gods To look that way thou wert.
Go on, go on; Thou canst not speak too much: I have deservd All tongues to talk their bitterest. Say no more: Howeer the business goes, you have made fault I the boldness of your speech. I am sorry fort: All faults I make, when I shall come to know them, I do repent. Alas! I have showd too much The rashness of a woman: he is touchd To the noble heart. Whats gone and whats past help Should be past grief: do not receive affliction At my petition; I beseech you, rather Let me be punishd, that have minded you Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege, Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: The love I bore your queen,lo, fool again! Ill speak of her no more, nor of your children; Ill not remember you of my own lord, Who is lost too: take your patience to you, And Ill say nothing. Thou didst speak but well, When most the truth, which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son: One grave shall be for both: upon them shall The causes of their death appear, unto Our shame perpetual. Once a day Ill visit The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there Shall be my recreation: so long as nature Will bear up with this exercise, so long I daily vow to use it.
Come and lead me Unto these sorrows. Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touchd upon The desarts of Bohemia? Ay, my lord; and fear We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly And threaten present blusters. In my conscience, The heavens with that we have in hand are angry, And frown upons. Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard; Look to thy bark: Ill not be long before I call upon thee. Make your best haste, and go not Too far i the land: tis like to be loud weather; Besides, this place is famous for the creatures Of prey that keep upont. Go thou away: Ill follow instantly. I am glad at heart To be so rid of the business. Come, poor babe: I have heard, but not believd, the spirits o the dead May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother Appeard to me last night, for neer was dream So like a waking.
To me comes a creature, Sometimes her head on one side, some another; I never saw a vessel of like sorrow, So filld, and so becoming: in pure white robes, Like very sanctity, she did approach My cabin where I lay; thrice bowd before me, And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon Did this break from her: Good Antigonus, Since fate, against thy better disposition, Hath made thy person for the thrower-out Of my poor babe, according to thine oath, Places remote enough are in Bohemia, There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, I prithee, callt: for this ungentle business, Put on thee by my lord, thou neer shalt see Thy wife Paulina more: and so, with shrieks, She melted into air. Affrighted much, I did in time collect myself, and thought This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys; Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously, I will be squard by this. I do believe Hermione hath sufferd death; and that Apollo would, this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid, Either for life or death, upon the earth Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! There lie; and there thy character: there these; Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, And still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch!
That for thy mothers fault art thus exposd To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot, But my heart bleeds, and most accursd am I To be by oath enjoind to this. Farewell! The day frowns more and more: thou art like to have A lullaby too rough. I never saw The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour! Well may I get aboard! This is the chase: I am gone for ever. I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting. Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my best sheep; which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if anywhere I have them, tis by the sea-side, browsing of ivy. Good luck, ant be thy will! what have we here? Mercy ons, a barne; a very pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty one; a very pretty one; sure some scape: though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work; they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here.
Ill take it up for pity; yet Ill tarry till my son come; he hollaed but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa! Hilloa, loa! What! art so near? If thoult see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What ailest thou, man? I have seen two such sights by sea and by land! but I am not to say it is a see, for it is now the sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkins point. Why, boy, how is it? I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! but thats not to the point. O! the most piteous cry of the poor souls; sometimes to see em, and not to see em; now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yest and froth, as youd thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land-service: to see how the bear tore out his shoulderbone; how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather. Name of mercy! when was this, boy?
Now, now; I have not winked since I saw these sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman: hes at it now. Would I had been by, to have helped the old man! I would you had been by the ships side, to have helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things dying, I with things new born. Heres a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squires child! Look thee here: take up, take up, boy; opent. So, lets see: it was told me, I should be rich by the fairies: this is some changeling.Opent. Whats within, boy? Youre a made old man: if the sins of your youth are forgiven you, youre well to live. Gold! all gold! This is fairy gold, boy, and twill prove so: up witht, keep it close: home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy; and to be so still, requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good boy, the next way home. Go you the next way with your findings. Ill go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they are hungry. If there be any of him left, Ill bury it. Thats a good deed.
If thou mayst discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the sight of him. Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i the ground. Tis a lucky day, boy, and well do good deeds ont. I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror Of good and bad, that make and unfold error, Now take upon me, in the name of Time, To use my wings. Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage, that I slide Oer sixteen years, and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap; since it is in my power To oerthrow law, and in one self-born hour To plant and oerwhelm custom. Let me pass The same I am, ere ancientst order was Or what is now receivd: I witness to The times that brought them in; so shall I do To the freshest things now reigning, and make stale The glistering of this present, as my tale Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between.
Leontes leaving, The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving, That he shuts up himself,imagine me, Gentle spectators, that I now may be In fair Bohemia; and remember well, I mentiond a son o the kings, which Florizel I now name to you; and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace Equal with wondering: what of her ensues I list not prophesy; but let Times news Be known when tis brought forth. A shepherds daughter, And what to her adheres, which follows after, Is th argument of Time. Of this allow, If ever you have spent time worse ere now: If never, yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may. I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this. It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I oerween to think so, which is another spur to my departure. As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made: better not to have had thee than thus to want thee.
Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough considered,as too much I cannot,to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein, the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues. Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far, that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate. I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. Thats likewise part of my intelligence; but I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. I willingly obey your command. My best Camillo!We must disguise ourselves. When daffodils begin to peer, With heigh! the doxy, over the dale, Why, then comes in the sweet o the year; For the red blood reigns in the winters pale. The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; For a quart of ale is a dish for a king The lark, that tirra-lirra chants, With, heigh! with, heigh! the thrush and the jay, Are summer songs for me and my aunts, While we lie tumbling in the hay. I have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile; but now I am out of service: But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines by night; And when I wander here and there, I then do most go right. If tinkers may have leave to live, And bear the sow-skin bowget, Then my account I well may give, And in the stocks avouch it My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A prize! a prize! Let me see: Every leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd shilling: fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to? If the springe hold, the cocks mine. I cannot dot without compters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast?
Three pound of sugar; five pound of currants; rice, what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and bases: but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron, to colour the warden pies; mace, dates,none; thats out of my note:nutmegs seven; a race or two of ginger,but that I may beg;four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o the sun. O! that ever I was born! I the name of me! O! help me, help me! pluck but off these rags, and then death, death! Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather than have these off. O, sir! the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions. Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter. I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel taen from me, and these detestable things put upon me. What, by a horseman or a footman? A footman, sweet sir, a footman. Indeed, he should be a footman, by the garments he hath left with thee: if this be a horsemans coat, it hath seen very hot service.
Lend me thy hand, Ill help thee: come, lend me thy hand. O! good sir, tenderly, O! Alas, poor soul! O! good sir; softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my shoulder-blade is out. How now! canst stand? Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha done me a charitable office. Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee. No, good sweet sir: no, I beseech you, sir. I have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going: I shall there have money, or anything I want: offer me no money, I pray you! that kills my heart. What manner of fellow was he that robbed you? A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with trol-my-dames: I knew him once a servant of the prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court. His vices, you would say: theres no virtue whipped out of the court: they cherish it, to make it stay there, and yet it will no more but abide. Vices, I would say, sir.
I know this man well: he hath been since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinkers wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus. Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings. Very true, sir; he, sir, he: thats the rogue that put me into this apparel. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had but looked big and spit at him, hed have run. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am false of heart that way, and that he knew, I warrant him. How do you now? Sweet sir, much better than I was: I can stand and walk. I will even take my leave of you, and pace softly towards my kinsmans. Shall I bring thee on the way? No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir. Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing. Prosper you, sweet sir! Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. Ill be with you at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled, and my name put in the book of virtue.
Jog on, jog on, the footpath way, And merrily hent the stile-a: A merry heart goes all the day, Your sad tares in a mile-a. These your unusual weeds to each part of you Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora Peering in Aprils front. This your sheep-shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods, And you the queen ont. Sir, my gracious lord, To chide at your extremes it not becomes me: O! pardon, that I name them. Your high self, The gracious mark o the land, you have obscurd With a swains wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, Most goddess-like prankd up. But that our feasts In every mess have folly, and the feeders Digest it with a custom, I should blush To see you so attired,swoon, I think, To show myself a glass. I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy fathers ground. Now, Jove afford you cause! To me the difference forges dread; your greatness Hath not been usd to fear. Even now I tremble To think, your father, by some accident, Should pass this way as you did. O, the Fates! How would he look, to see his work, so noble, Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how Should I, in these my borrowd flaunts, behold The sternness of his presence? Apprehend Nothing but jollity.
The gods themselves, Humbling their deities to love, have taken The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter Became a bull, and bellowd; the green Neptune A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robd god, Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain, As I seem now. Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer, Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith. O! but, sir, Your resolution cannot hold, when tis Opposd, as it must be, by the power of the king. One of these two must be necessities, Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose, Or I my life. Thou dearest Perdita, With these forcd thoughts, I prithee, darken not The mirth o the feast: or Ill be thine, my fair, Or not my fathers; for I cannot be Mine own, nor anything to any, if I be not thine: to this I am most constant, Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle; Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing That you behold the while. Your guests are coming: Lift up your countenance, as it were the day Of celebration of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come. O lady Fortune, Stand you auspicious! See, your guests approach: Address yourself to entertain them sprightly, And lets be red with mirth. Fie, daughter!
when my old wife livd, upon This day she was both pantler, butler, cook; Both dame and servant; welcomd all, servd all, Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here, At upper end o the table, now i the middle; On his shoulder, and his; her face o fire With labour and the thing she took to quench it, She would to each one sip. You are retird, As if you were a feasted one and not The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid These unknown friends tos welcome; for it is A way to make us better friends, more known. Come, quench your blushes and present yourself That which you are, mistress o the feast: come on, And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, As your good flock shall prosper. Sir, welcome: It is my fathers will I should take on me The hostess-ship o the day: Youre welcome, sir. Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs, For you theres rosemary and rue; these keep Seeming and savour all the winter long: Grace and remembrance be to you both, And welcome to our shearing! Shepherdess, A fair one are you,well you fit our ages With flowers of winter.
Sir, the year growing ancient, Not yet on summers death, nor on the birth Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o the season Are our carnations, and streakd gillyvors, Which some call natures bastards: of that kind Our rustic gardens barren, and I care not To get slips of them. Wherefore, gentle maiden, Do you neglect them? For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares With great creating nature. Say there be; Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean: so, over that art, Which you say adds to nature, is an art That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock, And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race: this is an art Which does mend nature, change it rather, but The art itself is nature. So it is. Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, And do not call them bastards. Ill not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them; No more than, were I painted, I would wish This youth should say, twere well, and only therefore Desire to breed by me.
Heres flowers for you; Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram; The marigold, that goes to bed wi the sun, And with him rises weeping: these are flowers Of middle summer, and I think they are given To men of middle age. Youre very welcome. I should leave grazing, were I of your flock, And only live by gazing. Out, alas! Youd be so lean, that blasts of January Would blow you through and through. Now, my fairst friend, I would I had some flowers o the spring that might Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina! For the flowers now that frighted thou letst fall From Diss waggon! daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, But sweeter than the lids of Junos eyes Or Cythereas breath; pale prime-roses, That die unmarried, ere they can behold Bright Phbus in his strength, a malady Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, The flower-de-luce being one. O! these I lack To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend, To strew him oer and oer! What! like a corse? No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; Not like a corse; or if,not to be buried, But quick and in mine arms.
Come, take your flowers: Methinks I play as I have seen them do In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition. What you do Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet, Id have you do it ever: when you sing, Id have you buy and sell so; so give alms; Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you A wave o the sea, that you might ever do Nothing but that; move still, still so, And own no other function: each your doing, So singular in each particular, Crowns what you are doing in the present deed, That all your acts are queens. O Doricles! Your praises are too large: but that your youth, And the true blood which fairly peeps through it, Do plainly give you out an unstaind shepherd, With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles, You wood me the false way. I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you tot. But, come; our dance, I pray. Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair That never mean to part. Ill swear for em. This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever Ran on the green-sord: nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself; Too noble for this place. He tells her something That makes her blood look out.
Good sooth, she is The queen of curds and cream. Come on, strike up. Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, To mend her kissing with. Now, in good time! Not a word, a word: we stand upon our manners. Come, strike up. Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter? They call him Doricles, and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding; but I have it Upon his own report and I believe it: He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter: I think so too; for never gazd the moon Upon the water as hell stand and read As twere my daughters eyes; and, to be plain, I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best. She dances featly. So she does any thing, though I report it That should be silent. If young Doricles Do light upon her, she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of. O master! if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than youll tell money; he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all mens ears grew to his tunes.
He could never come better: he shall come in: I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably. He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings, jump her and thump her; and where some stretchmouthed rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer, Whoop, do me no harm, good man; puts him off, slights him with Whoop, do me no harm, good man. This is a brave fellow. Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided wares? He hath ribands of all the colours i the rainbow; points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by the gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he sings em over, as they were gods or goddesses. You would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square ont. Prithee, bring him in, and let him approach singing. Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words ins tunes. You have of these pedlars, that have more in them than youd think, sister.
Ay, good brother, or go about to think. Lawn as white as driven snow; Cyprus black as eer was crow; Gloves as sweet as damask roses; Masks for faces and for noses; Bugle-bracelet, necklace-amber, Perfume for a ladys chamber; Golden quoifs and stomachers, For my lads to give their dears; Pins and poking-sticks of steel; What maids lack from head to heel: Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy; Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy. If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain ribands and gloves. I was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now. He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars. He hath paid you all he promised you: may be he has paid you more, which will shame you to give him again. Is there no manners left among maids? will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests? Tis well they are whispering: clamour your tongues, and not a word more. I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves.
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way, and lost all my money? And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to be wary. Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here. I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge. What hast here? ballads? Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print, a-life, for then we are sure they are true. Heres one to a very doleful tune, how a usurers wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden; and how she longed to eat adders heads and toads carbonadoed. Is it true, think you? Very true, and but a month old. Bless me from marrying a usurer! Heres the midwifes name tot, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad? Pray you now, buy it. Come on, lay it by: and lets first see moe ballads; well buy the other things anon. Heres another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful and as true. Is it true too, think you?
Five justices hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold. Lay it by too: another. This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one. Lets have some merry ones. Why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune of Two maids wooing a man: theres scarce a maid westward but she sings it: tis in request, I can tell you. We can both sing it: if thoult bear a part thou shalt hear; tis in three parts. We had the tune ont a month ago. I can bear my part; you must know tis my occupation: have at it with you. Get you hence, for I must go, Where it fits not you to know. Whither? O! whither? Whither? It becomes thy oath full woll, Thou to me thy secrets tell. Me too: let me go thither. Or thou gost to the grange or mill. If to either, thou dost ill. Neither. What, neither? Neither. Thou hast sworn my love to be Thou hast sworn it more to me: Then whither gost? say whither? Well have this song out anon by ourselves: my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and well not trouble them: come, bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, Ill buy for you both. Pedlar, lets have the first choice. Follow me, girls. And you shall pay well for em.
Will you buy any tape, Or lace for your cape, My dainty duck, my dear-a? Any silk, any thread, Any toys for your head, Of the newst and finst, finst wear-a? Come to the pedlar; Moneys a meddler, That doth utter all mens ware-a. Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair; they call themselves Saltiers; and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not int; but they themselves are o the mind,if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling,it will please plentifully. Away! well none ont: here has been too much homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you. You weary those that refresh us: pray, lets see these four threes of herdsmen. One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the king; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier. Leave your prating: since these good men are pleased let them come in: but quickly now. Why, they stay at door, sir. O, father! youll know more of that hereafter. Is it not too far gone? Tis time to part them. Hes simple and tells much. How now, fair shepherd! Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from feasting.
Sooth, when I was young, And handed love as you do, I was wont To load my she with knacks: I would have ransackd The pedlars silken treasury and have pourd it To her acceptance; you have let him go And nothing marted with him. If your lass Interpretation should abuse and call this Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited For a reply, at least if you make a care Of happy holding her. Old sir, I know She prizes not such trifles as these are. The gifts she looks from me are packd and lockd Up in my heart, which I have given already, But not deliverd. O! hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, Hath sometime lovd: I take thy hand; this hand, As soft as doves down, and as white as it, Or Ethiopians tooth, or the fannd snow Thats bolted by the northern blasts twice oer. What follows this? How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before! I have put you out: But to your protestation: let me hear What you profess. Do, and be witness tot. And this my neighbour too?
And he, and more Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all; That, were I crownd the most imperial monarch, Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge More than was ever mans, I would not prize them Without her love: for her employ them all; Commend them and condemn them to her service Or to their own perdition. Fairly offerd. This shows a sound affection. But, my daughter, Say you the like to him? I cannot speak So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his. Take hands; a bargain; And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness tot: I give my daughter to him, and will make Her portion equal his. O! that must be I the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, I shall have more than you can dream of yet; Enough then for your wonder. But, come on; Contract us fore these witnesses. Come, your hand; And, daughter, yours. Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you. Have you a father? I have; but what of him? Knows he of this? He neither does nor shall. Methinks a father Is, at the nuptial of his son, a guest That best becomes the table. Pray you, once more, Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate? Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing But what he did being childish? No, good sir: He has his health and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age. By my white beard, You offer him, if this be so, a wrong Something unfilial. Reason my son Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason The father,all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity,should hold some counsel In such a business. I yield all this; But for some other reasons, my grave sir, Which tis not fit you know, I not acquaint My father of this business. Let him knowt. He shall not. Prithee, let him. No, he must not. Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice. Come, come, he must not. Mark our contract. Mark your divorce, young sir, Whom son I dare not call: thou art too base To be acknowledgd: thou a sceptres heir, That thus affectst a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor, I am sorry that by hanging thee I can But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know The royal fool thou copst with, O, my heart! Ill have thy beauty scratchd with briers, and made More homely than thy state.
For thee, fond boy, If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this knack,as never I mean thou shalt,well bar thee from succession; Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin, Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words: Follow us to the court. Thou, churl, for this time, Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment, Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too, That makes himself, but for our honour therein, Unworthy thee,if ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open, Or hoop his body more with thy embraces, I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender tot. Even here undone! I was not much afeard; for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly, The self-same sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage, but Looks on alike. Willt please you, sir, be gone? I told you what would come of this: beseech you, Of your own state take care: this dream of mine Being now awake, Ill queen it no inch further, But milk my ewes and weep. Why, how now, father! Speak, ere thou diest. I cannot speak, nor think, Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three, That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, To die upon the bed my father died, To lie close by his honest bones: but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch! That knewst this was the prince, and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him. Undone! undone! If I might die within this hour, I have livd To die when I desire. Why look you so upon me? I am but sorry, not afeard; delayd, But nothing alterd. What I was, I am: More straining on for plucking back; not following My leash unwillingly. Gracious my lord, You know your fathers temper: at this time He will allow no speech, which I do guess You do not purpose to him; and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: Then, till the fury of his highness settle, Come not before him. I not purpose it. I think, Camillo? Even he, my lord. How often have I told you twould be thus! How often said my dignity would last But till twere known! It cannot fail but by The violation of my faith; and then Let nature crush the sides o the earth together And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks: From my succession wipe me, father; I Am heir to my affection. Be advisd.
I am; and by my fancy: if my reason Will thereto be obedient, I have reason; If not, my senses, better pleasd with madness, Do bid it welcome. This is desperate, sir. So call it; but it does fulfil my vow, I needs must think it honesty. Camillo, Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may Be thereat gleand, for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath To this my fair belovd. Therefore, I pray you, As you have ever been my fathers honourd friend, When he shall miss me,as, in faith, I mean not To see him any more,cast your good counsels Upon his passion: let myself and fortune Tug for the time to come. This you may know And so deliver, I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore; And most opportune to our need, I have A vessel rides fast by, but not prepard For this design. What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor Concern me the reporting. O my lord! I would your spirit were easier for advice, Or stronger for your need. Hark, Perdita. Ill hear you by and by. Hes irremovable, Resolvd for flight.
Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn, Save him from danger, do him love and honour, Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king, my master, whom I so much thirst to see. Now, good Camillo, I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony. Sir, I think You have heard of my poor services, i the love That I have borne your father? Very nobly Have you deservd: it is my fathers music To speak your deeds, not little of his care To have them recompensd as thought on. Well, my lord, If you may please to think I love the king And through him whats nearest to him, which is Your gracious self, embrace but my direction, If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration, on mine honour Ill point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your highness; where you may Enjoy your mistress,from the whom, I see, Theres no disjunction to be made, but by, As, heavens forfend! your ruin,marry her; And with my best endeavours in your absence Your discontenting father strive to qualify, And bring him up to liking. How, Camillo, May this, almost a miracle, be done? That I may call thee something more than man, And, after that trust to thee. Have you thought on A place whereto youll go?
Not any yet; But as the unthought-on accident is guilty To what we wildly do, so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies Of every wind that blows. Then list to me: This follows; if you will not change your purpose But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, And there present yourself and your fair princess, For so, I see, she must be,fore Leontes; She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed. Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness As twere i the fathers person; kisses the hands Of your fresh princess; oer and oer divides him Twixt his unkindness and his kindness: the one He chides to hell, and bids the other grow Faster than thought or time. Worthy Camillo, What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him? Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir, The manner of your bearing towards him, with What you as from your father shall deliver, Things known betwixt us three, Ill write you down: The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say; that he shall not perceive But that you have your fathers bosom there And speak his very heart. I am bound to you. There is some sap in this.
A course more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpathd waters, undreamd shores, most certain To miseries enough: no hope to help you, But as you shake off one to take another; Nothing so certain as your anchors, who Do their best office, if they can but stay you Where youll be loath to be. Besides, you know Prosperitys the very bond of love, Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters. One of these is true: I think affliction may subdue the cheek, But not take in the mind. Yea, say you so? There shall not at your fathers house these seven years Be born another such. My good Camillo, She is as forward of her breeding as She is i the rear o her birth. I cannot say tis pity She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress To most that teach. Your pardon, sir; for this Ill blush you thanks. My prettiest Perdita! But O! the thorns we stand upon. Camillo, Preserver of my father, now of me, The medcine of our house, how shall we do? We are not furnishd like Bohemias son, Nor shall appear in Sicilia. My lord, Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there: it shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir, That you may know you shall not want, one word. Ha, ha!
what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery: not a counterfeit stone, not a riband, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered.
My clown,who wants but something to be a reasonable man,grew so in love with the wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sirs song, and admiring the nothing of it; so that, in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the kings son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army. Nay, but my letters, by this means being there So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt. And those that youll procure from King Leontes Shall satisfy your father. Happy be you! All that you speak shows fair. Whom have we here? Well make an instrument of this: omit Nothing may give us aid. If they have overheard me now, why, hanging. How now, good fellow! Why shakest thou so? Fear not, man; heres no harm intended to thee. I am a poor fellow, sir.
Why, be so still; heres nobody will steal that from thee; yet, for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore, discase thee instantly,thou must think, theres a necessity int,and change garments with this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, theres some boot. I am a poor fellow, sir. I know ye well enough. Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already. Are you in earnest, sir? I smell the trick ont. Dispatch, I prithee. Indeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot with conscience take it. Unbuckle, unbuckle. Fortunate mistress,let my prophecy Come home to ye!you must retire yourself Into some covert: take your sweethearts hat And pluck it oer your brows; muffle your face; Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken The truth of your own seeming; that you may, For I do fear eyes over you,to shipboard Get undescried. I see the play so lies That I must bear a part. No remedy. Have you done there? Should I now meet my father He would not call me son. Nay, you shall have no hat. Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend. Adieu, sir. O Perdita, what have we twain forgot! Pray you, a word.
What I do next shall be to tell the king Of this escape, and whither they are bound; Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after: in whose company I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight I have a womans longing. Fortune speed us! Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side. The swifter speed the better. I understand the business; I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse: a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! what a boot is here with this exchange! Sure, the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity; stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not dot: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it, and therein am I constant to my profession. Aside, aside: here is more matter for a hot brain. Every lanes end, every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work. See, see, what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king shes a changeling and none of your flesh and blood. Nay, but hear me. Nay, but hear me. Go to, then. She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show those things you found about her; those secret things, all but what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you. I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his sons pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the kings brother-in-law. Indeed, brother-in-law was the furthest off you could have been to him, and then your blood had been the dearer by I know not how much an ounce. Very wisely, puppies! Well, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard. I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master. Pray heartily he be at palace. Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlars excrement. How now, rustics! whither are you bound? To the palace, an it like your worship.
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known, discover. We are but plain fellows, sir. A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying; it becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie; but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not give us the lie. Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner. Are you a courtier, ant like you, sir? Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me? reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkst thou, for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier, cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to open thy affair. My business, sir, is to the king. What advocate hast thou to him? I know not, ant like you. Advocates the court-word for a pheasant: say you have none. None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen. How blessd are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are, Therefore Ill not disdain. This cannot be but a great courtier. His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely. He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, Ill warrant; I know by the picking ons teeth. The fardel there? whats i the fardel? Wherefore that box? Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to the speech of him. Age, thou hast lost thy labour. Why, sir? The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou best capable of things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief. So tis said, sir, about his son, that should have married a shepherds daughter. If that shepherd be not now in hand-fast, let him fly: the curses he shall have, the torture he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster. Think you so, sir? Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall all come under the hangman: which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary.
An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death is too soft for him, say I: draw our throne into a sheep cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy. Has the old man eer a son, sir, do you hear, ant like you, sir? He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasps nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vit or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set against a brick-wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me,for you seem to be honest plain men,what you have to the king: being something gently considered, Ill bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits, here is a man shall do it.
He seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember, stoned, and flayed alive! Ant please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have: Ill make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you. After I have done what I promised? Ay, sir. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business? In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it. O! thats the case of the shepherds son: hang him, hell be made an example. Comfort, good comfort! we must to the king and show our strange sights: he must know tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed; and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be brought you. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the right hand, I will but look upon the hedge and follow you. We are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed. Lets before as he bids us. He was provided to do us good.
If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion, gold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he think it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs tot. To him will I present them: there may be matter in it. Sir, you have done enough, and have performd A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make Which you have not redeemd; indeed, paid down More penitence than done trespass. At the last, Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; With them forgive yourself. Whilst I remember Her and her virtues, I cannot forget My blemishes in them, and so still think of The wrong I did myself; which was so much, That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and Destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man Bred his hopes out of.
True, too true, my lord; If one by one you wedded all the world, Or from the all that are took something good, To make a perfect woman, she you killd Would be unparalleld. I think so. Killd! She I killd! I did so; but thou strikst me Sorely to say I did: it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now Say so but seldom. Not at all, good lady: You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit, and gracd Your kindness better. You are one of those Would have him wed again. If you would not so, You pity not the state, nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name; consider little What dangers, by his highness fail of issue, May drop upon his kingdom and devour Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well? What holier than for royaltys repair, For present comfort, and for future good, To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow tot? There is none worthy, Respecting her thats gone. Besides, the gods Will have fulfilld their secret purposes; For has not the divine Apollo said, Ist not the tenour of his oracle, That King Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found?
which that it shall, Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me; who, on my life, Did perish with the infant. Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary, Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue; The crown will find an heir: great Alexander Left his to the worthiest, so his successor Was like to be the best. Good Paulina, Who hast the memory of Hermione, I know, in honour; O! that ever I Had squard me to thy counsel! then, even now, I might have lookd upon my queens full eyes, Have taken treasure from her lips, And left them More rich, for what they yielded. Thou speakst truth. No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, And better usd, would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse and on this stage, Where were offenders now,appear soul-vexd, And begin, Why to me? Had she such power, She had just cause. She had; and would incense me To murder her I married. I should so: Were I the ghost that walkd, Id bid you mark Her eye, and tell me for what dull part int You chose her; then Id shriek, that even your ears Should rift to hear me; and the words that followd Should be Remember mine. Stars, stars! And all eyes else dead coals. Fear thou no wife; Ill have no wife, Paulina.
Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave? Never, Paulina: so be blessd my spirit! Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. You tempt him over much. Unless another, As like Hermione as is her picture, Affront his eye. Good madam, I have done. Yet, if my lord will marry,if you will, sir, No remedy, but you will,give me the office To choose you a queen, she shall not be so young As was your former; but she shall be such As, walkd your first queens ghost, it should take joy To see her in your arms. My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou biddst us. That Shall be when your first queens again in breath; Never till then. One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, Son of Polixenes, with his princess,she The fairest I have yet beheld,desires access To your high presence. What with him? he comes not Like to his fathers greatness; his approach, So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us Tis not a visitation framd, but forcd By need and accident. What train? But few, And those but mean. His princess, say you, with him? Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, That eer the sun shone bright on. O Hermione! As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone, so must thy grave Give way to whats seen now.
Sir, you yourself Have said and writ so,but your writing now Is colder than that theme,She had not been, Nor was not to be equalld; thus your verse Flowd with her beauty once: tis shrewdly ebbd To say you have seen a better. Pardon, madam: The one I have almost forgotyour pardon The other, when she has obtaind your eye, Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal Of all professors else, make proselytes Of who she but bid follow. How! not women? Women will love her, that she is a woman More worth than any man; men, that she is The rarest of all women. Go, Cleomenes; Yourself, assisted with your honourd friends, Bring them to our embracement. Still tis strange, He thus should steal upon us. Had our prince Jewel of childrenseen this hour, he had paird Well with this lord: there was not full a month Between their births. Prithee, no more: cease! thou knowst He dies to me again when talkd of: sure, When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may Unfurnish me of reason. They are come. Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; For she did print your royal father off, Conceiving you.
Were I but twenty-one, Your fathers image is so hit in you, His very air, that I should call you brother, As I did him; and speak of something wildly By us performd before. Most dearly welcome! And you, fair princess,goddess! O, alas! I lost a couple, that twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood begetting wonder as You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost All mine own follythe society, Amity too, of your brave father, whom, Though bearing misery, I desire my life Once more to look on him. By his command Have I here touchd Sicilia; and from him Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, Can send his brother: and, but infirmity, Which waits upon worn times,hath something seizd His wishd ability, he had himself The land and waters twixt your throne and his Measurd to look upon you, whom he loves He bade me say somore than all the sceptres And those that bear them living. O, my brother! Good gentleman,the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me, and these thy offices So rarely kind, are as interpreters Of my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither, As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too Exposd this paragon to the fearful usage At least ungentleof the dreadful Neptune, To greet a man not worth her pains, much less The adventure of her person? Good my lord, She came from Libya.
Where the war-like Smalus, That noble honourd lord, is feard and lovd? Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter His tears proclaimd his, parting with her: thence A prosperous south-wind friendlywe have crossd, To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your highness: my best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismissd; Who for Bohemia bend, to signify Not only my success in Libya, sir, But my arrival and my wifes, in safety Here where we are. The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here! You have a holy father, A graceful gentleman; against whose person, So sacred as it is, I have done sin: For which the heavens, taking angry note, Have left me issueless; and your fathers blessd As he from heaven merits itwith you, Worthy his goodness. What might I have been, Might I a son and daughter now have lookd on, Such goodly things as you! Most noble sir, That which I shall report will bear no credit, Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, Bohemia greets you from himself by me; Desires you to attach his son, who has His dignity and duty both cast off Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with A shepherds daughter. Wheres Bohemia? speak. Here in your city; I now came from him: I speak amazedly, and it becomes My marvel and my message.
To your court Whiles he was hastening,in the chase it seems Of this fair couple,meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother, having both their country quitted With this young prince. Camillo has betrayd me; Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endurd all weathers. Layt so to his charge: Hes with the king your father. Who? Camillo? Camillo, sir: I spake with him, who now Has these poor men in question. Never saw I Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth, Forswear themselves as often as they speak: Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them With divers deaths in death. O my poor father! The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated. You are married? We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first: The odds for high and lows alike. My lord, Is this the daughter of a king? She is, When once she is my wife. That once, I see, by your good fathers speed, Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, Most sorry, you have broken from his liking Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, That you might well enjoy her.
Dear, look up: Though Fortune, visible an enemy, Should chase us with my father, power no jot Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, Remember since you owd no more to time Than I do now; with thought of such affections, Step forth mine advocate; at your request My father will grant precious things as trifles Would he do so, Id beg your precious mistress, Which he counts but a trifle. Sir, my liege, Your eye hath too much youth int: not a month Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now. I thought of her, Even in these looks I made. But your petition Is yet unanswerd. I will to your father: Your honour not oerthrown by your desires, I am friend to them and you; upon which errand I now go toward him. Therefore follow me, And mark what way I make: come, good my lord. Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation? I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I heard the shepherd say, he found the child. I would most gladly know the issue of it.
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one it must needs be. Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero? Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the kings daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the lady Paulinas steward: he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news which is called true is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king found his heir? Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance: that which you hear youll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs.
The mantle of Queen Hermione, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings? No. Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so, and in such manner that, it seemed, sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, O, thy mother, thy mother! then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it. What, pray you, became of Antigonus that carried hence the child?
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this avouches the shepherds son, who has not only his innocencewhich seems muchto justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. What became of his bark and his followers? Wracked, the same instant of their masters death, and in the view of the shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But, O! the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina. She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing. The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.
One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes,caught the water though not the fish,was when at the relation of the queens death, with the manner how she came to it,bravely confessed and lamented by the king,how attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an alas! I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swounded, all sorrowed: if all the world could have seent, the woe had been universal. Are they returned to the court? No; the princess hearing of her mothers statue, which is in the keeping of Paulinaa piece many years in doing, and now newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano; who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer: thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup. I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately, twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing? Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born: our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Lets along. Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what; but he at that time, overfond of the shepherds daughter,so he then took her to be,who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscovered. But tis all one to me; for had I been the finder out of this secret, it would not have relished among my other discredits. Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born. You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born: see you these clothes? say, you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these robes are not gentleman born. Give me the lie, do, and try whether I am not now gentleman born. I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. And so have I, boy.
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the kings son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father; and so we wept: and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed. We may live, son, to shed many more. Ay; or else twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are. I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my master. Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen. Thou wilt amend thy life? Ay, an it like your good worship. Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia. You may say it, but not swear it. Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, Ill swear it. How if it be false, son?
If it be neer so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend: and Ill swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but Ill swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands. I will prove so, sir, to my power. Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the queens picture. Come, follow us: well be thy good masters. O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort That I have had of thee! What, sovereign sir, I did not well, I meant well. All my services You have paid home; but that you have vouchsafd, With your crownd brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, It is a surplus of your grace, which never My life may last to answer. O Paulina!
We honour you with trouble: but we came To see the statue of our queen: your gallery Have we passd through, not without much content In many singularities, but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon, The statue of her mother. As she livd peerless, So her dead likeness, I do well believe, Excels whatever yet you lookd upon Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare To see the life as lively mockd as ever Still sleep mockd death: behold! and say tis well. I like your silence: it the more shows off Your wonder; but yet speak: first you, my liege. Comes it not something near? Her natural posture! Chide me, dear stone, that I may say, indeed Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she In thy not chiding, for she was as tender As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina, Hermione was not so much wrinkled; nothing So aged as this seems. O! not by much. So much the more our carvers excellence; Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she livd now. As now she might have done, So much to my good comfort, as it is Now piercing to my soul. O! thus she stood, Even with such life of majesty,warm life, As now it coldly stands,when first I wood her.
I am ashamd: does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it? O, royal piece! Theres magic in thy majesty, which has My evils conjurd to remembrance, and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, Standing like stone with thee. And give me leave, And do not say tis superstition, that I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady, Dear queen, that ended when I but began, Give me that hand of yours to kiss. O, patience! The statue is but newly fixd, the colours Not dry. My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, So many summers dry: scarce any joy Did ever so long live; no sorrow But killd itself much sooner. Dear my brother, Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself. Indeed, my lord, If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you,for the stone is mine, Id not have showd it. Do not draw the curtain. No longer shall you gaze ont, lest your fancy May think anon it moves. Let be, let be! Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already What was he that did make it? See, my lord, Would you not deem it breathd, and that those veins Did verily bear blood? Masterly done: The very life seems warm upon her lip.
The fixure of her eye has motion int, As we are mockd with art. Ill draw the curtain; My lords almost so far transported that Hell think anon it lives. O sweet Paulina! Make me to think so twenty years together: No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness. Lett alone. I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirrd you: but I could afflict you further. Do, Paulina; For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks, There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, For I will kiss her. Good my lord, forbear. The ruddiness upon her lip is wet: Youll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? No, not these twenty years. So long could I Stand by, a looker-on. Either forbear, Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you For more amazement. If you can behold it, Ill make the statue move indeed, descend, And take you by the hand; but then youll think, Which I protest against,I am assisted By wicked powers. What you can make her do, I am content to look on: what to speak, I am content to hear; for tis as easy To make her speak as move. It is requird You do awake your faith.
Then, all stand still; Or those that think it is unlawful business I am about, let them depart. Proceed: No foot shall stir. Music, awake her: strike! Tis time; descend; be stone no more: approach; Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come; Ill fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away; Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs: Start not; her actions shall be holy as You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her Until you see her die again, for then You kill her double. Nay, present your hand: When she was young you wood her; now in age Is she become the suitor! O! shes warm. If this be magic, let it be an art Lawful as eating. She embraces him. She hangs about his neck: If she pertain to life let her speak too. Ay; and maket manifest where she has livd, Or how stoln from the dead. That she is living, Were it but told you, should be hooted at Like an old tale; but it appears she lives, Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while. Please you to interpose, fair madam. kneel And pray your mothers blessing. Turn, good lady; Our Perdita is found. You gods, look down, And from your sacred vials pour your graces Upon my daughters head! Tell me, mine own, Where hast thou been preservd? where livd? how found Thy fathers court?
for thou shalt hear that I, Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being, have preservd Myself to see the issue. Theres time enough for that; Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation. Go together, You precious winners all: your exultation Partake to every one. I, an old turtle, Will wing me to some witherd bough, and there My mate, thats never to be found again, Lament till I am lost. O! peace, Paulina. Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, As I by thine a wife: this is a match, And made betweens by vows. Thou hast found mine; But how, is to be questiond; for I saw her, As I thought dead, and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave. Ill not seek far, For him, I partly know his mind,to find thee An honourable husband. Come, Camillo, And take her by the hand; whose worth and honesty Is richly noted, and here justified By us, a pair of kings. Lets from this place. What! look upon my brother: both your pardons, That eer I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law, And son unto the king,whom heavens directing, Is troth-plight to your daughter.
Good Paulina, Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely Each one demand and answer to his part Performd in this wide gap of time since first We were disseverd: hastily lead away.
To sing a song that old was sung, From ashes ancient Gower is come, Assuming mans infirmities, To glad your ear, and please your eyes. It hath been sung at festivals, On ember-eves, and holy-ales; And lords and ladies in their lives Have read it for restoratives: The purchase is to make men glorious; Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius. If you, born in these latter times, When wits more ripe, accept my rimes, And that to hear an old man sing May to your wishes pleasure bring, I life would wish, and that I might Waste it for you like taper-light. This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat, The fairest in all Syria, I tell you what mine authors say: This king unto him took a fere, Who died and left a female heir, So buxom, blithe, and full of face As heaven had lent her all his grace; With whom the father liking took, And her to incest did provoke. Bad child, worse father! to entice his own To evil should be done by none. By custom what they did begin Was with long use account no sin.
The beauty of this sinful dame Made many princes thither frame, To seek her as a bed-fellow, In marriage-pleasures play-fellow: Which to prevent, he made a law, To keep her still, and men in awe, That whoso askd her for his wife, His riddle told not, lost his life: So for her many a wight did die, As yon grim looks do testify. What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye I give, my cause who best can justify. Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large receivd The danger of the task you undertake. I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul Emboldend with the glory of her praise, Think death no hazard in this enterprise. Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride, For the embracements even of Jove himself; At whose conception, till Lucina reignd, Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence, The senate-house of planets all did sit, To knit in her their best perfections. See, where she comes apparelld like the spring, Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king Of every virtue gives renown to men! Her face the book of praises, where is read Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence Sorrow were ever razd, and testy wrath Could never be her mild companion.
You gods, that made me man, and sway in love, That hath inflamd desire in my breast To taste the fruit of you celestial tree Or die in the adventure, be my helps, As I am son and servant to your will, To compass such a boundless happiness! Prince Pericles, That would be son to great Antiochus. Before thee stands this fair Hesperides, With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touchd; For death-like dragons here affright thee hard: Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view Her countless glory, which desert must gain; And which, without desert, because thine eye Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die. Yon sometime famous princes, like thyself, Drawn by report, adventurous by desire, Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale, That without covering, save yon field of stars, They here stand martyrs, slain in Cupids wars; And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist For going on deaths net, whom none resist. Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught My frail mortality to know itself, And by those fearful objects to prepare This body, like to them, to what I must; For death rememberd should be like a mirror, Who tells us lifes but breath, to trust it error.
Ill make my will then; and as sick men do, Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe, Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did: So I bequeath a happy peace to you And all good men, as every prince should do; My riches to the earth from whence they came, But my unspotted fire of love to you. Thus ready for the way of life or death, I wait the sharpest blow. Scorning advice, read the conclusion then; Which read and not expounded, tis decreed, As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed. Of all sayd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous! Of all sayd yet, I wish thee happiness! Like a bold champion, I assume the lists, Nor ask advice of any other thought But faithfulness and courage. I am no viper, yet I feed On mothers flesh which did me breed; I sought a husband, in which labour I found that kindness in a father. Hes father, son, and husband mild, I mother, wife, and yet his child. How they may be, and yet in two, As you will live, resolve it you. Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers! That give heaven countless eyes to view mens acts, Why cloud they not their sights perpetually, If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
Fair glass of light, I lovd you, and could still, Were not this glorious casket stord with ill: But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt; For hes no man on whom perfections wait That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate. Youre a fair viol, and your sense the strings, Who, fingerd to make men his lawful music, Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken; But being playd upon before your time, Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime. Good sooth, I care not for you. Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life, For thats an article within our law, As dangerous as the rest. Your times expird: Either expound now or receive your sentence. Great king, Few love to hear the sins they love to act; Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it. Who has a book of all that monarchs do, Hes more secure to keep it shut than shown; For vice repeated is like the wandering wind, Blows dust in others eyes, to spread itself; And yet the end of all is bought thus dear, The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear To stop the air would hurt them.
The blind mole casts Coppd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throngd By mans oppression; and the poor worm doth die for t. Kings are earths gods; in vice their laws their will; And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill? It is enough you know; and it is fit, What being more known grows worse, to smother it. All love the womb that their first being bred, Then give my tongue like leave to love my head. Heaven! that I had thy head; he has found the meaning; But I will gloze with him. Young Prince of Tyre, Though by the tenour of our strict edict, Your exposition misinterpreting, We might proceed to cancel of your days; Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise: Forty days longer we do respite you; If by which time our secret be undone, This mercy shows well joy in such a son: And until then your entertain shall be As doth befit our honour and your worth. How courtesy would seem to cover sin, When what is done is like a hypocrite, The which is good in nothing but in sight!
If it be true that I interpret false, Then were it certain you were not so bad As with foul incest to abuse your soul; Where now youre both a father and a son, By your untimely claspings with your child, Which pleasure fits a husband, not a father; And she an eater of her mothers flesh, By the defiling of her parents bed; And both like serpents are, who though they feed On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed. Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men Blush not in actions blacker than the night, Will shun no course to keep them from the light. One sin, I know, another doth provoke; Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke. Poison and treason are the hands of sin, Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame: Then, lest my life be croppd to keep you clear, By flight Ill shun the danger which I fear. He hath found the meaning, for which we mean To take his head. He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy, Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin In such a loathed manner; And therefore instantly this prince must die, For by his fall my honour must keep high. Who attends us there? Doth your highness call? Thaliard, Youre of our chamber, and our mind partakes Her private actions to your secrecy; And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
Thaliard, behold, heres poison, and heres gold; We hate the Prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him: It fits thee not to ask the reason why, Because we bid it. Say, is it done? My lord, tis done. Enough. Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste. My lord, Prince Pericles is fled. As thou Wilt live, fly after; and, as an arrow shot From a well-experiencd archer hits the mark His eye doth level at, so thou neer return Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead. My lord, If I can get him within my pistols length, Ill make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness. Thaliard, adieu! Till Pericles be dead, My heart can lend no succour to my head. Let none disturb us. Why should this change of thoughts, The sad companion, dull-eyd melancholy, Be my so usd a guest, as not an hour In the days glorious walk or peaceful night The tomb where grief should sleepcan breed me quiet? Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them, And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch, Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here; Yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits, Nor yet the others distance comfort me.
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind, That have their first conception by mis-dread, Have after-nourishment and life by care; And what was first but fear what might be done, Grows elder now and cares it be not done. And so with me: the great Antiochus, Gainst whom I am too little to contend, Since hes so great can make his will his act, Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence; Nor boots it me to say I honour him, If he suspect I may dishonour him; And what may make him blush in being known, Hell stop the course by which it might be known. With hostile forces hell oerspread the land, And with the ostent of war will look so huge, Amazement shall drive courage from the state, Our men be vanquishd ere they do resist, And subjects punishd that neer thought offence: Which care of them, not pity of myself, Who am no more but as the tops of trees, Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them, Make both my body pine and soul to languish, And punish that before that he would punish. Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast! And keep your mind, till you return to us, Peaceful and comfortable. Peace, peace! and give experience tongue.
They do abuse the king that flatter him; For flattery is the bellows blows up sin; The thing the which is flatterd, but a spark, To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing; Whereas reproof, obedient and in order, Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err: When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace, He flatters you, makes war upon your life. Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please; I cannot be much lower than my knees. All leave us else; but let your cares oerlook What shipping and what ladings in our haven, And then return to us. Helicanus, thou Hast movd us; what seest thou in our looks? An angry brow, dread lord. If there be such a dart in princes frowns, How durst thy tongue move anger to our face? How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence They have their nourishment? Thou knowst I have power To take thy life from thee. I have ground the axe myself; Do you but strike the blow. Rise, prithee, rise; Sit down; thou art no flatterer: I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid! Fit counsellor and servant for a prince, Who by thy wisdom makst a prince thy servant, What wouldst thou have me do? To bear with patience Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
Thou speakst like a physician, Helicanus, That ministerst a potion unto me That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself. Attend me then: I went to Antioch, Where as thou knowst, against the face of death I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty, From whence an issue I might propagate Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects. Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder; The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest; Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father Seemd not to strike, but smooth; but thou knowst this, Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss. Which fear so grew in me I hither fled, Under the covering of a careful night, Who seemd my good protector; and, being here, Bethought me what was past, what might succeed. I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants fears Decrease not, but grow faster than the years.
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth, That I should open to the listening air How many worthy princes bloods were shed, To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope, To lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms, And make pretence of wrong that I have done him; When all, for mine, if I may call t, offence, Must feel wars blow, who spares not innocence: Which love to all, of which thyself art one, Who now reprovst me for it, Alas! sir. Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks, Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts How I might stop this tempest, ere it came; And finding little comfort to relieve them, I thought it princely charity to grieve them. Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak, Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear, And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant, Who either by public war or private treason Will take away your life. Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while, Till that his rage and anger be forgot, Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life. Your rule direct to any; if to me, Day serves not light more faithful than Ill be. I do not doubt thy faith; But should he wrong my liberties in my absence? Well mingle our bloods together in the earth, From whence we had our being and our birth.
Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus Intend my travel, where Ill hear from thee, And by whose letters Ill dispose myself. The care I had and have of subjects good On thee Ill lay, whose wisdoms strength can bear it. Ill take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath; Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both. But in our orbs well live so round and safe, That time of both this truth shall neer convince, Thou showdst a subjects shine, I a true prince. So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do not, I am sure to be hanged at home: tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for it; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Hush! here come the lords of Tyre. You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre, Further to question me of your kings departure: His seald commission, left in trust with me, Doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel. How! the king gone!
If further yet you will be satisfied, Why, as it were unlicensd of your loves, He would depart, Ill give some light unto you. Being at Antioch What from Antioch? Royal Antiochuson what cause I know not Took some displeasure at him, at least he judgd so; And doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd, To show his sorrow hed correct himself; So puts himself unto the shipmans toil, With whom each minute threatens life or death. Well, I perceive I shall not be hangd now, although I would; But since hes gone, the king it sure must please: He scapd the land, to perish at the sea. Ill present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre. Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome. From him I come, With message unto princely Pericles; But since my landing I have understood Your lord hath betook himself to unknown travels, My message must return from whence it came. We have no reason to desire it, Commended to our master, not to us: Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire, As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre. My Dionyza, shall we rest us here, And by relating tales of others griefs, See if twill teach us to forget our own? That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it; For who digs hills because they do aspire Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher. O my distressed lord!
even such our griefs are; Here theyre but felt, and seen with mischiefs eyes, But like to groves, being toppd, they higher rise. O Dionyza, Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it, Or can conceal his hunger till he famish? Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder; That if heaven slumber while their creatures want, They may awake their helps to comfort them. Ill then discourse our woes, felt several years, And wanting breath to speak help me with tears. Ill do my best, sir. This Tarsus, oer which I have the government, A city on whom plenty held full hand, For riches strewd herself even in the streets; Whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds, And strangers neer beheld but wonderd at; Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd, Like one anothers glass to trim them by: Their tables were stord full to glad the sight, And not so much to feed on as delight; All poverty was scornd, and pride so great, The name of help grew odious to repeat. O! tis too true, But see what heaven can do!
By this our change, These mouths, whom but of late earth, sea, and air Were all too little to content and please, Although they gave their creatures in abundance, As houses are defild for want of use, They are now starvd for want of exercise; Those palates who, not yet two summers younger, Must have inventions to delight the taste, Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it; Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes, Thought nought too curious, are ready now To eat those little darlings whom they lovd. So sharp are hungers teeth, that man and wife Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life. Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping; Here many sink, yet those which see them fall Have scarce strength left to give them burial. Is not this true? Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it. O! let those cities that of plentys cup And her prosperities so largely taste, With their superfluous riots, hear these tears: The misery of Tarsus may be theirs. Wheres the lord governor? Here. Speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste, For comfort is too far for us to expect. We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore, A portly sail of ships make hitherward. I thought as much. One sorrow never comes but brings an heir That may succeed as his inberitor; And so in ours.
Some neighbouring nation, Taking advantage of our misery, Hath stuffd these hollow vessels with their power, To beat us down, the which are down already; And make a conquest of unhappy me, Whereas no glorys got to overcome. Thats the least fear; for by the semblance Of their white flags displayd, they bring us peace, And come to us as favourers, not as foes. Thou speakst like him s untutord to repeat: Who makes the fairest show means most deceit. But bring they what they will and what they can, What need we fear? The grounds the lowest and we are half way there. Go tell their general we attend him here, To know for what he comes, and whence he comes, And what he craves. I go, my lord. Welcome is peace if he on peace consist; If wars we are unable to resist. Lord governor, for so we hear you are, Let not our ships and number of our men, Be like a beacon fird to amaze your eyes.
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre, And seen the desolation of your streets: Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears, But to relieve them of their heavy load; And these our ships, you happily may think Are like the Trojan horse was stuffd within With bloody veins, expecting overthrow, Are stord with corn to make your needy bread, And give them life whom hunger starvd half dead. The gods of Greece protect you! And well pray for you. Arise, I pray you, rise: We do not look for reverence, but for love, And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men. The which when any shall not gratify, Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought, Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves, The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils! Till whenthe which, I hope, shall neer be seen Your Grace is welcome to our town and us. Which welcome well accept; feast here awhile, Until our stars that frown lend us a smile. Here have you seen a mighty king His child, I wis, to incest bring; A better prince and benign lord, That will prove awful both in deed and word. Be quiet, then, as men should be, Till he hath passd necessity. Ill show you those in troubles reign, Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
The good in conversation, To whom I give my benison, Is still at Tarsus, where each man Thinks all is writ he speken can; And, to remember what he does, Build his statue to make him glorious: But tidings to the contrary Are brought your eyes; what need speak I? Good Helicane hath stayd at home, Not to eat honey like a drone From others labours; for though he strive To killen bad, keep good alive, And to fulfil his prince desire, Sends word of all that haps in Tyre: How Thaliard came full bent with sin And had intent to murder him; And that in Tarsus was not best Longer for him to make his rest. He, doing so, put forth to seas, Where when men been, theres seldom ease; For now the wind begins to blow; Thunder above and deeps below Make such unquiet, that the ship Should house him safe is wrackd and split; And he, good prince, having all lost, By waves from coast to coast is tost. All perishen of man, of pelf, Ne aught escapen but himself; Till Fortune, tird with doing bad, Threw him ashore, to give him glad; And here he comes. What shall be next, Pardon old Gower, this longs the text. Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man Is but a substance that must yield to you; And I, as fits my nature, do obey you. Alas! the sea hath cast me on the rocks, Washd me from shore to shore, and left me breath Nothing to think on but ensuing death: Let it suffice the greatness of your powers To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes; And having thrown him from your watery grave, Here to have death in peace is all hell crave. What, ho, Pilch! Ha! come and bring away the nets. What, Patch-breech, I say! What say you, master? Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or Ill fetch thee with a wannion. Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now. Alas! poor souls; it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when, well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves. Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say theyre half fish half flesh; a plague on them! they neer come but I look to be washed. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones; I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale; a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on o the land, who never leave gaping till theyve swallowed the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all. A pretty moral. But master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in the belfry. Why, man? Because he should have swallowed me too; and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish, up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind, Simonides! We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey. How from the finny subject of the sea These fishers tell the infirmities of men; And from their watery empire recollect All that may men approve or men detect! Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen. Honest! good fellow, whats that? if it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody look after it. Y may see the sea hath cast me on your coast. What a drunken knave was the sea, to cast thee in our way!
A man whom both the waters and the wind, In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball For them to play upon, entreats you pity him; He asks of you, that never usd to beg. No, friend, cannot you beg? heres them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working. Canst thou catch any fishes then? I never practised it. Nay then thou wilt starve, sure; for heres nothing to be got now-a-days unless thou canst fish for t. What I have been I have forgot to know, But what I am want teaches me to think on; A man throngd up with cold; my veins are chill, And have no more of life than may suffice To give my tongue that heat to ask your help; Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead, For that I am a man, pray see me buried. Die, quoth-a? Now, gods forbid! I have a gown here; come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and well have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreoer puddings and flap-jacks; and thou shalt be welcome. I thank you, sir. Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg. I did but crave. But crave! Then Ill turn craver too, and so I shall scape whipping. Why, are all your beggars whipped, then? O!
not all, my friend, not all; for if all your beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office than to be beadle. But, master, Ill go draw up the net. How well this honest mirth becomes their labour! Hark you, sir; do you know where ye are? Not well. Why, Ill tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and our king the good Simonides. The good King Simonides do you call him? Ay, sir; and he deserves to be so called for his peaceable reign and good government. He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government. How far is his court distant from this shore? Marry, sir, half a days journey; and Ill tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her birthday; and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love. Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish to make one there. O! sir, things must be as they may; and what a man cannot get, he may lawfully deal for his wifes soul, Help, master, help! heres a fish hangs in the net, like a poor mans right in the law; twill hardly come out. Ha! bots on t, tis come at last, and tis turned to a rusty armour. An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.
Thanks, Fortune, yet, that after all my crosses Thou givst me somewhat to repair myself; And though it was mine own, part of mine heritage, Which my dead father did bequeath to me, With this strict charge, even as he left his life, Keep it, my Pericles, it hath been a shield Twixt me and death;and pointed to this brace; For that it savd me, keep it; in like necessity The which the gods protect thee from!t may defend thee. It kept where I kept, I so dearly lovd it; Till the rough seas, that spare not any man, Took it in rage, though calmd they have given t again. I thank thee for t; my shipwrack now s no ill, Since I have here my fathers gift in s will. What mean you, sir? To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth, For it was sometime target to a king; I know it by this mark. He lovd me dearly, And for his sake I wish the having of it; And that youd guide me to your sovereigns court, Where with it I may appear a gentleman; And if that ever my low fortunes better, Ill pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor. Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady? Ill show the virtue I have borne in arms. Why, doe take it; and the gods give thee good on t!
Ay, but hark you, my friend; twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the water; there are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, youll remember from whence you had it. Believe it, I will. By your furtherance I am clothd in steel; And spite of all the rapture of the sea, This jewel holds his biding on my arm: Unto thy value will I mount myself Upon a courser, whose delightful steps Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread. Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided Of a pair of bases. Well sure provide; thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair, and Ill bring thee to the court myself. Then honour be but a goal to my will! This day Ill rise, or else add ill to ill. Are the knights ready to begin the triumph? They are, my liege; And stay your coming to present themselves. Return them, we are ready; and our daughter, In honour of whose birth these triumphs are, Sits here, like beautys child, whom nature gat For men to see, and seeing wonder at. It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express My commendations great, whose merits less. Tis fit it should be so; for princes are A model, which heaven makes like to itself: As jewels lose their glory if neglected, So princes their renowns if not respected.
Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain The labour of each knight in his device. Which, to preserve mine honour, Ill perform. Who is the first that doth prefer himself? A knight of Sparta, my renowned father; And the device he bears upon his shield Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun; The word, Lux tua vita mihi. He loves you well that holds his life of you. Who is the second that presents himself? A prince of Macedon, my royal father; And the device he bears upon his shield Is an armd knight thats conquerd by a lady; The motto thus, in Spanish, Piu por dulzura que por fuerza. And whats the third? The third of Antioch; And his device, a wreath of chivalry; The word, Me pomp provexit apex. What is the fourth? A burning torch thats turned upside down; The word, Quod me alit me extinguit. Which shows that beauty hath his power and will, Which can as well inflame as it can kill. The fifth, a hand environed with clouds, Holding out gold thats by the touchstone tried; The motto thus, Sic spectanda fides. And what s The sixth and last, the which the knight himself With such a graceful courtesy deliverd? He seems to be a stranger; but his present is A witherd branch, thats only green at top; The motto, In hac spe vivo.
A pretty moral; From the dejected state wherein he is, He hopes by you his fortune yet may flourish. He had need mean better than his outward show Can any way speak in his just commend; For, by his rusty outside he appears To have practisd more the whipstock than the lance. He well may be a stranger, for he comes To an honourd triumph strangely furnished. And on set purpose let his armour rust Until this day, to scour it in the dust. Opinions but a fool, that makes us scan The outward habit by the inward man. But stay, the knights are coming; well withdraw Into the gallery. Knights, To say youre welcome were superfluous. To place upon the volume of your deeds, As in a title-page, your worth in arms, Were more than you expect, or more thans fit, Since every worth in show commends itself. Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast: You are princes and my guests. But you, my knight and guest; To whom this wreath of victory I give, And crown you king of this days happiness. Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit. Call it by what you will, the day is yours; And here, I hope, is none that envies it. In framing an artist art hath thus decreed, To make some good, but others to exceed; And youre her labourd scholar.
Come, queen o the feast, For, daughter, so you are,here take your place; Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace. We are honourd much by good Simonides. Your presence glads our days; honour we love, For who hates honour, hates the gods above. Sir, yonder is your place. Some other is more fit. Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes Envy the great nor do the low despise. You are right courteous knights. Sit, sir; sit. By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts, These cates resist me, she but thought upon. By Juno, that is queen of marriage, All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury, Wishing him my meat. Sure, hes a gallant gentleman. Hes but a country gentleman; He has done no more than other knights have done; He has broken a staff or so; so let it pass. To me he seems like diamond to glass. Yon kings to me like to my fathers picture, Which tells me in that glory once he was; Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne, And he the sun for them to reverence.
None that beheld him, but like lesser lights Did vail their crowns to his supremacy; Where now his sons like a glow-worm in the night, The which hath fire in darkness, none in light: Whereby I see that Times the king of men; Hes both their parent, and he is their grave, And gives them what he will, not what they crave. What, are you merry, knights? Who can be other in this royal presence? Here, with a cup thats stord unto the brim, As you do love, fill to your mistress lips, We drink this health to you. We thank your Grace. Yet pause awhile; Yon knight doth sit too melancholy, As if the entertainment in our court Had not a show might countervail his worth. Note it not you, Thaisa? What is it To me, my father? O! attend, my daughter: Princes in this should live like gods above, Who freely give to every one that comes To honour them; And princes not doing so are like to gnats, Which make a sound, but killd are wonderd at. Therefore to make his entrance more sweet, Here say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him. Alas! my father, it befits not me Unto a stranger knight to be so bold; He may my proffer take for an offence, Since men take womens gifts for impudence. How! Do as I bid you, or youll move me else.
Now, by the gods, he could not please me better. And further tell him, we desire to know of him, Of whence he is, his name, and parentage. The king, my father, sir, has drunk to you. I thank him. Wishing it so much blood unto your life. I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely. And further he desires to know of you, Of whence you are, your name and parentage. A gentleman of Tyre, my name, Pericles; My education been in arts and arms; Who, looking for adventures in the world, Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men, And after shipwrack, driven upon this shore. He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles, A gentleman of Tyre, Who only by misfortune of the seas Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore. Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune, And will awake him from his melancholy. Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles, And waste the time which looks for other revels. Even in your armours, as you are addressd, Will very well become a soldiers dance. I will not have excuse, with saying this Loud music is too harsh for ladies heads Since they love men in arms as well as beds. So this was well askd, twas so well performd.
Come, sir; Here is a lady that wants breathing too: And I have often heard, you knights of Tyre Are excellent in making ladies trip, And that their measures are as excellent. In those that practise them they are, my lord. O! thats as much as you would be denied Of your fair courtesy. Unclasp, unclasp; Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well, But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct These knights unto their several lodgings! Yours, sir, We have given order to be next our own. I am at your Graces pleasure. Princes, it is too late to talk of love, And thats the mark I know you level at; Therefore each one betake him to his rest; To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
No, Escanes, know this of me, Antiochus from incest livd not free; For which, the most high gods not minding longer To withhold the vengeance that they had in store, Due to this heinous capital offence, Even in the height and pride of all his glory, When he was seated in a chariot Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him, A fire from heaven came and shrivelld up Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk, That all those eyes adord them ere their fall Scorn now their hand should give them burial. Twas very strange. And yet but just; for though This king were great, his greatness was no guard To bar heavens shaft, but sin had his reward. Tis very true. See, not a man in private conference Or council has respect with him but he. It shall no longer grieve without reproof. And cursd be he that will not second it. Follow me then. Lord Helicane, a word. With me? and welcome. Happy day, my lords. Know that our griefs are risen to the top, And now at length they overflow their banks. Your griefs! for what? wrong not the prince you love. Wrong not yourself then, noble Helicane; But if the prince do live, let us salute him, Or know what grounds made happy by his breath.
If in the world he live, well seek him out; If in his grave he rest, well find him there; And be resolvd he lives to govern us, Or dead, give s cause to mourn his funeral, And leaves us to our free election. Whose deaths indeed the strongest in our censure: And knowing this kingdom is without a head, Like goodly buildings left without a roof Soon fall to ruin, your noble self, That best knowst how to rule and how to reign, We thus submit unto, our sovereign. Live, noble Helicane! For honours cause forbear your suffrages: If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear. Take I your wish, I leap into the seas, Wheres hourly trouble for a minutes ease. A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you To forbear the absence of your king; If in which time expird he not return, I shall with aged patience bear your yoke. But if I cannot win you to this love, Go search like nobles, like noble subjects, And in your search spend your adventurous worth; Whom if you find, and win unto return, You shall like diamonds sit about his crown. To wisdom hes a fool that will not yield; And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us, We with our travels will endeavour it. Then you love us, we you, and well clasp hands: When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands. Good morrow to the good Simonides.
Knights, from my daughter this I let you know, That for this twelvemonth shell not undertake A married life. Her reason to herself is only known, Which yet from her by no means can I get. May we not get access to her, my lord? Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied Her to her chamber that tis impossible. One twelve moons more shell wear Dianas livery; This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowd, And on her virgin honour will not break it. Though loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves. So, Theyre well dispatchd; now to my daughters letter. She tells me here, shell wed the stranger knight, Or never more to view nor day nor light. Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine; I like that well: how absolute shes in t, Not minding whether I dislike or no! Well, I do commend her choice; And will no longer have it be delayd. Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it. All fortune to the good Simonides! To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you For your sweet music this last night: I do Protest my ears were never better fed With such delightful pleasing harmony It is your Graces pleasure to commend, Not my desert. Sir, you are musics master. The worst of all her scholars, my good lord. Let me ask you one thing. What do you think of my daughter, sir? A most virtuous princess.
And she is fair too, is she not? As a fair day in summer; wondrous fair. My daughter, sir, thinks very well of you; Ay, so well, that you must be her master, And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it. I am unworthy for her schoolmaster. She thinks not so; peruse this writing else. Whats here? A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre! Tis the kings subtilty to have my life. O! seek not to entrap me, gracious lord, A stranger and distressed gentleman, That never aimd so high to love your daughter, But bent all offices to honour her. Thou hast bewitchd my daughter, and thou art A villain. By the gods, I have not: Never did thought of mine levy offence; Nor never did my actions yet commence A deed might gain her love or your displeasure. Traitor, thou liest. Traitor! Ay, traitor. Even in his throat, unless it be the king, That calls me traitor, I return the lie. Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage. My actions are as noble as my thoughts, That never relishd of a base descent. I came unto your court for honours cause, And not to be a rebel to her state; And he that otherwise accounts of me, This sword shall prove hes honours enemy. No? Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
Then, as you are as virtuous as fair, Resolve your angry father, if my tongue Did eer solicit, or my hand subscribe To any syllable that made love to you. Why, sir, say if you had, Who takes offence at that would make me glad? Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory? I am glad on t, with all my heart. Ill tame you; Ill bring you in subjection. Will you, not having my consent, Bestow your love and your affections Upon a stranger? who, for aught I know, May be, nor can I think the contrary, As great in blood as I myself. Therefore, hear you, mistress; either frame Your will to mine; and you, sir, hear you, Either be ruld by me, or I will make you Man and wife: Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too; And being joind, Ill thus your hopes destroy; And for a further grief,God give you joy! What! are you both pleasd? Yes, if you love me, sir. Even as my life, or blood that fosters it. What! are you both agreed? Yes, if t please your majesty. Yes, if t please your majesty. It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed; Then with what haste you can get you to bed.
Now sleep yslaked hath the rout; No din but snores the house about, Made louder by the oer-fed breast Of this most pompous marriage-feast. The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now couches fore the mouses hole; And crickets sing at the ovens mouth, Eer the blither for their drouth. Hymen hath brought the bride to bed, Where, by the loss of maidenhead, A babe is moulded. Be attent; And time that is so briefly spent With your fine fancies quaintly eche; Whats dumb in show Ill plain with speech. By many a dern and painful perch, Of Pericles the careful search By the four opposing coigns, Which the world together joins, Is made with all due diligence That horse and sail and high expense, Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre, Fame answering the most strange inquire To the court of King Simonides Are letters brought, the tenour these: Antiochus and his daughter dead; The men of Tyrus on the head Of Helicanus would set on The crown of Tyre, but he will none: The mutiny he there hastes t oppress; Says to em, if King Pericles Come not home in twice six moons, He, obedient to their dooms, Will take the crown. The sum of this, Brought hither to Pentapolis, Yravished the regions round, And every one with claps can sound, Our heir-apparent is a king! Who dreamd, who thought of such a thing?
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre: His queen, with child, makes her desire, Which who shall cross?along to go; Omit we all their dole and woe: Lychorida, her nurse, she takes, And so to sea. Their vessel shakes On Neptunes billow; half the flood Hath their keel cut: but Fortunes mood Varies again; the grisled north Disgorges such a tempest forth, That, as a duck for life that dives, So up and down the poor ship drives. The lady shrieks, and well-a-near Does fall in travail with her fear; And what ensues in this fell storm Shall for itself itself perform. I nill relate, action may Conveniently the rest convey, Which might not what by me is told. In your imagination hold This stage the ship, upon whose deck The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak. Thou God of this great vast, rebuke these surges, Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast Upon the winds command, bind them in brass, Having calld them from the deep. O! still Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes. O! how Lychorida, How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously; Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seamans whistle Is as a whisper in the ears of death, Unheard. Lychorida! Lucina, O! Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle To those that cry by night, convey thy deity Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs Of my queens travails! Now, Lychorida!
Here is a thing too young for such a place, Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I Am like to do: take in your arms this piece Of your dead queen. How, how, Lychorida! Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm. Heres all that is left living of your queen, A little daughter: for the sake of it, Be manly, and take comfort. O you gods! Why do you make us love your goodly gifts, And snatch them straight away? We here below, Recall not what we give, and therein may Use honour with you. Patience, good sir, Even for this charge. Now, mild may be thy life! For a more blustrous birth had never babe: Quiet and gentle thy conditions! For thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world That eer was princes child. Happy what follows! Thou hast as chiding a nativity As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make, To herald thee from the womb; even at the first Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit, With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods Throw their best eyes upon t! What courage, sir? God save you! Courage enough. I do not fear the flaw; It hath done to me the worst. Yet for the love Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer, I would it would be quiet. Slack the bolins there! thou wilt not, wilt thou? Blow, and split thyself.
But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care not. Sir, you queen must overboard: the sea works high, the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead. Thats your superstition. Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still observed, and we are strong in custom. Therefore briefly yield her, for she must overboard straight. As you think meet. Most wretched queen! Here she lies, sir. A terrible child-bed hast thou had, my dear; No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements Forgot thee utterly; nor have I time To give thee hallowd to thy grave, but straight Must cast thee, scarcely coffind, in the ooze; Where, for a monument upon thy bones, And aye-remaining lamps, the belching whale And humming water must oerwhelm thy corpse, Lying with simple shells! O Lychorida! Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper, My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe Upon the pillow. Hie thee, whiles I say A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman. Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulkd and bitumed ready. I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this? We are near Tarsus. Thither, gentle mariner, Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it? By break of day, if the wind cease. O! make for Tarsus.
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe Cannot hold out to Tyrus; there Ill leave it At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner; Ill bring the body presently. Philemon, ho! Doth my lord call? Get fire and meat for these poor men; T has been a turbulent and stormy night. I have been in many; but such a night as this Till now I neer endurd. Your master will be dead ere you return; Theres nothing can be ministerd to nature That can recover him. Give this to the pothecary, And tell me how it works. Good morrow, sir. Good morrow to your lordship. Gentlemen, Why do you stir so early? Sir, Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea, Shook as the earth did quake; The very principals did seem to rend, And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear Made me to quit the house. That is the cause we trouble you so early; Tis not our husbandry. O! you say well. But I much marvel that your lordship, having Rich tire about you, should at these early hours Shake off the golden slumber of repose. Tis most strange, Nature should be so conversant with pain, Being thereto not compelld. I hold it ever, Virtue and cunning were endowments greater Than nobleness and riches; careless heirs May the two latter darken and expend, But immortality attends the former, Making a man a god.
Tis known I ever Have studied physic, through which secret art, By turning oer authorities, I have Together with my practicemade familiar To me and to my aid the blest infusions That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones; And can speak of the disturbances That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me A more content in course of true delight Than to be thirsty after tottering honour, Or tie my treasure up in silken bags, To please the fool and death. Your honour has through Ephesus pourd forth Your charity, and hundreds call themselves Your creatures, who by you have been restord: And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon Such strong renown as time shall neer decay. So; lift there. What is that? Sir, even now Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest: Tis of some wrack. Set it down; lets look upon t. Tis like a coffin, sir. Whateer it be, Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight; If the seas stomach be oerchargd with gold, Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us. Tis so, my lord. How close tis caulkd and bitumed! Did the sea cast it up? I never saw so huge a billow, sir, As tossd it upon shore. Come, wrench it open. Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense. A delicate odour. As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
O you most potent gods! whats here? a corse! Most strange! Shrouded in cloth of state; balmd and entreasurd With full bags of spices! A passport too! Apollo, perfect me i the characters! Here I give to understand, If eer this coffin drive a-land, I, King Pericles, have lost This queen worth all our mundane cost. Who finds her, give her burying; She was the daughter of a king: Besides this treasure for a fee, The gods requite his charity! If thou livst, Pericles, thou hast a heart That even cracks for woe! This chancd to-night. Most likely, sir. Nay, certainly to-night; For look, how fresh she looks. They were too rough That threw her in the sea. Make fire within; Fetch hither all the boxes in my closet. Death may usurp on nature many hours, And yet the fire of life kindle again The overpressd spirits. I heard Of an Egyptian, that had nine hours lien dead, Who was by good appliances recovered. Well said, well said; the fire and cloths. The rough and woeful music that we have, Cause it to sound, beseech you. The viol once more;how thou stirrst, thou block! The music there! I pray you, give her air. Gentlemen, This queen will live; nature awakes, a warmth Breathes out of her; she hath not been entrancd Above five hours. See! how she gins to blow Into lifes flower again. The heavens Through you increase our wonder and set up Your fame for ever.
She is alive! behold, Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels Which Pericles hath lost, Begin to part their fringes of bright gold; The diamonds of a most praised water Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live, And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature, Rare as you seem to be! O dear Diana! Where am I? Wheres my lord? What world is this? Is not this strange? Most rare. Hush, gentle neighbours! Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her. Get linen; now this matter must be lookd to, For her relapse is mortal, Come, come; And sculapius guide us! Most honourd Cleon, I must needs be gone; My twelve months are expird, and Tyrus stands In a litigious peace. You and your lady Take from my heart all thankfulness; the gods Make up the rest upon you! Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally, Yet glance full wanderingly on us. O your sweet queen! That the strict fates had pleasd you had brought her hither, To have blessd mine eyes with her! We cannot but obey The powers above us. Could I rage and roar As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end Must be as tis.
My gentle babe Marinawhom, For she was born at sea, I have namd sohere I charge your charity withal, and leave her The infant of your care, beseeching you To give her princely training, that she may be Mannerd as she is born. Fear not, my lord, but think Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn For which the peoples prayers still fall upon you Must in your child be thought on. If neglection Should therein make me vile, the common body, By you relievd, would force me to my duty; But if to that my nature need a spur, The gods revenge it upon me and mine, To the end of generation! I believe you; Your honour and your goodness teach me to t, Without your vows. Till she be married, madam, By bright Diana, whom we honour, all Unscissard shall this hair of mine remain, Though I show ill in t. So I take my leave. Good madam, make me blessed in your care In bringing up my child. I have one myself, Who shall not be more dear to my respect Than yours, my lord. Madam, my thanks and prayers. Well bring your Grace een to the edge o the shore; Then give you up to the maskd Neptune and The gentlest winds of heaven. I will embrace Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O!
no tears, Lychorida, no tears: Look to your little mistress, on whose grace You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord. Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels, Lay with you in your coffer; which are now At your command. Know you the character? It is my lords. That I was shippd at sea, I well remember, Even on my eaning time; but whether there Deliverd, by the holy gods, I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles, My wedded lord, I neer shall see again, A vestal livery will I take me to, And never more have joy. Madam, if this you purpose as you speak, Dianas temple is not distant far, Where you may abide till your date expire. Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine Shall there attend you. My recompense is thanks, thats all; Yet my good will is great, though the gift small. Imagine Pericles arrivd at Tyre, Welcomd and settled to his own desire. His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus, Unto Diana there a votaress. Now to Marina bend your mind, Whom our fast-growing scene must find At Tarsus, and by Cleon traind In music, letters; who hath gaind Of education all the grace, Which makes her bath the heart and places Of general wonder. But, alack! That monster envy, oft the wrack Of earned praise, Marinas life Seeks to take off by treasons knife.
And in this kind hath our Cleon One daughter, and a wench full grown, Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid Hight Philoten, and it is said For certain in our story, she Would ever with Marina be: Be t when she weavd the sleided silk With fingers, long, small, white as milk, Or when she would with sharp neeld wound The cambric, which she made more sound By hurting it; when to the lute She sung, and made the night-bird mute, That still records with moan; or when She would with rich and constant pen Vail to her mistress Dian; still This Philoten contends in skill With absolute Marina: so With the dove of Paphos might the crow Vie feathers white. Marina gets All praises, which are paid as debts, And not as given. This so darks In Philoten all graceful marks, That Cleons wife, with envy rare, A present murderer does prepare For good Marina, that her daughter Might stand peerless by this slaughter. The sooner her vile thoughts to stead, Lychorida, our nurse, is dead: And cursed Dionyza hath The pregnant instrument of wrath Prest for this blow. The unborn event I do commend to your content: Only I carry winged time Post on the lame feet of my rime; Which never could I so convey, Unless your thoughts went on my way. Dionyza doth appear, With Leonine, a murderer.
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do t: Tis but a blow, which never shall be known. Thou canst not do a thing i the world so soon, To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience, Which is but cold, inflaming love i thy bosom, Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which Even women have cast off, melt thee, but he A soldier to thy purpose. Ill do t; but yet she is a goodly creature. The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here She comes weeping for her only mistress death. Thou art resolvd? I am resolvd. No, I will rob Tellus of her weed, To strew thy green with flowers; the yellows, blues, The purple violets, and marigolds, Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave, While summer days do last. Ay me! poor maid, Born in a tempest, when my mother died, This world to me is like a lasting storm, Whirring me from my friends. How now, Marina! why do you keep alone? How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not Consume your blood with sorrowing; you have A nurse of me. Lord! how your favours changd With this unprofitable woe. Come, Give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it. Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there, And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come, Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her. No, I pray you; Ill not bereave you of your servant.
Come, come; I love the king your father, and yourself, With more than foreign heart. We every day Expect him here; when he shall come and find Our paragon to all reports thus blasted, He will repent the breadth of his great voyage; Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you; Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve That excellent complexion, which did steal The eyes of young and old. Care not for me; I can go home alone. Well, I will go; But yet I have no desire to it. Come, come, I know tis good for you. Walk half an hour, Leonine, at least. Remember what I have said. I warrant you, madam. Ill leave you, my sweet lady, for a while; Pray you walk softly, do not heat your blood: What! I must have care of you. My thanks, sweet madam. Is this wind westerly that blows? South-west. When I was born, the wind was north. Was t so? My father, as nurse said, did never fear, But cried Good seamen! to the sailors, galling His kingly hands haling ropes; And, clasping to the mast, endurd a sea That almost burst the deck. When was this? When I was born: Never were waves nor wind more violent; And from the ladder-tackle washes off A canvas-climber. Ha! says one, wilt out?
And with a dropping industry they skip From stem to stern; the boatswain whistles, and The master calls, and trebles their confusion. Come; say your prayers. What mean you? If you require a little space for prayer, I grant it. Pray; but be not tedious, For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn To do my work with haste. Why will you kill me? To satisfy my lady. Why would she have me killd? Now, as I can remember, by my troth, I never did her hurt in all my life. I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn To any living creature; believe me, la, I never killd a mouse, nor hurt a fly; I trod upon a worm against my will, But I wept for it. How have I offended, Wherein my death might yield her any profit, Or my life imply her any danger? My commission Is not to reason of the deed, but do t. You will not do t for all the world, I hope. You are well favourd, and your looks foreshow You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately, When you caught hurt in parting two that fought; Good sooth, it showd well in you; do so now; Your lady seeks my life; come you between, And save poor me, the weaker. I am sworn, And will dispatch. Hold, villain! A prize! a prize! Half-part, mates, half-part. Come, lets have her aboard suddenly.
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes; And they have seizd Marina. Let her go; Theres no hope shell return. Ill swear shes dead, And thrown into the sea. But Ill see further; Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, Not carry her aboard. If she remain, Whom they have ravishd must by me be slain. Boult. Sir? Search the market narrowly; Mitylene is full of gallants; we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless. We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten. Therefore, lets have fresh ones, whateer we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper. Thou sayst true; tis not the bringing up of poor bastards, as, I think, I have brought up some eleven Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the market? What else, man? The stuff we have a strong wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden. Thou sayst true; theyre too unwholesome, o conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage. Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But Ill go search the market.
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over. Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get when we are old? O! our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over. Come, other sorts offend as well as we. As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our profession any trade; its no calling. But here comes Boult. Come your ways. My masters, you say shes a virgin? O! sir, we doubt it not. Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest. Boult, has she any qualities? She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes; theres no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused. Whats her price, Boult? I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces. Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her entertainment.
Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry, He that will give most, shall have her first. Such a maiden-head were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you. Performance shall follow. Alack! that Leonine was so slack, so slow. He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates Not enough barbaroushad not oerboard thrown me For to seek my mother! Why lament you, pretty one? That I am pretty. Come, the gods have done their part in you. I accuse them not. You are lit into my hands, where you are like to live. The more my fault To scape his hands where I was like to die. Ay, and you shall live in pleasure. No. Yes, indeed, shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions. You shall fare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears? Are you a woman? What would you have me be, an I be not a woman? An honest woman, or not a woman. Marry, whip thee, gosling; I think I shall have something to do with you. Come, you are a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have you. The gods defend me!
If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir you up. Boults returned. Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market? I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice. And I prithee, tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort? Faith, they listened to me, as they would have hearkened to their fathers testament. There was a Spaniards mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description. We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on. To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i the hams? Who? Monsieur Veroles? Ay; he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow. Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun. Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign. Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully, which you commit willingly; to despise profit where you have most gain.
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers; seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit. I understand you not. O! take her home, mistress, take her home; these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice. Thou sayst true, i faith, so they must; for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant. Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint, Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit. I may so? Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the manner of your garments well. Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet. Boult, spend thou that in the town; report what a sojourner we have; youll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report. I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined. Ill bring home some to-night. Come your ways; follow me. If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep, Untied I still my virgin knot will keep. Diana, aid my purpose! What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us? Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
O Dionyza! such a piece of slaughter The sun and moon neer lookd upon. I think Youll turn a child again. Were I chief lord of all this spacious world, Id give it to undo the deed. O lady! Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess To equal any single crown o the earth I the justice of compare. O villain Leonine! Whom thou hast poisond too; If thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness Becoming well thy fact; what canst thou say When noble Pericles shall demand his child? That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates, To foster it, nor ever to preserve. She died at night; Ill say so. Who can cross it? Unless you play the pious innocent, And for an honest attribute cry out She died by foul play. O! go to. Well, well, Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods Do like this worst. Be one of those that think The pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence, And open this to Pericles. I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are, And of how coward a spirit. To such proceeding Who ever but his approbation added, Though not his prime consent, he did not flow From honourable sources. Be it so, then; Yet none does know but you how she came dead, Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
She did distain my child, and stood between Her and her fortunes; none would look on her, But cast their gazes on Marinas face, Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day. It piercd me thorough; And though you call my course unnatural, You not your child well loving, yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Performd to your sole daughter. Heavens forgive it! And as for Pericles, What should he say? We wept after her hearse, And even yet we mourn; her monument Is almost finishd, and her epitaphs In glittering golden characters express A general praise to her, and care in us At whose expense tis done. Thou art like the harpy, Which, to betray, dost with thine angels face, Seize with thine eagles talons. You are like one that superstitiously Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies; But yet I know youll do as I advise. Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short; Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for t; Makingto take your imagination From bourn to bourn, region to region. By you being pardond, we commit no crime To use one language in each several clime Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you To learn of me, who stand i the gaps to teach you, The stages of our story.
Pericles Is now again thwarting the wayward seas, Attended on by many a lord and knight, To see his daughter, all his lifes delight. Old Helicanus goes along. Behind Is left to govern it, you bear in mind, Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late Advancd in time to great and high estate. Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought This king to Tarsus, think his pilot thought, So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on, To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone. Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; Your ears unto your eyes Ill reconcile. See how belief may suffer by foul show! This borrowd passion stands for true old woe; And Pericles, in sorrow all devourd, With sighs shot through, and biggest tears oershowerd, Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs; He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears, And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza. the fairest, sweetst, and best lies here, who witherd in her spring of year: she was of tyrus the kings daughter, on whom foul death hath made this slaughter.
marina was she calld; and at her birth, thetis, being proud, swallowd some part o the earth: therefore the earth, fearing to be oerflowd, hath thetis birth-child on the heavens bestowd: wherefore she does, and swears shell never stint, make raging battery upon shores of flint. No visor does become black villany So well as soft and tender flattery. Let Pericles believe his daughters dead, And bear his courses to be ordered By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play His daughters woe and heavy well-a-day In her unholy service. Patience then, And think you now are all in Mitylen. Did you ever hear the like? No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone. But to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a thing? No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses. Shalls go hear the vestals sing? Ill do any thing now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of rutting for ever. Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had neer come here. Fie, fie upon her! she is able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation; we must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.
When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master-reasons, her prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her. Faith, I must ravish her, or shell disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make all our swearers priests. Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me! Faith, theres no way to be rid on t but by the way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus, disguised. We should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers. How now! How a dozen of virginities? Now, the gods to-bless your honour! I am glad to see your honour in good health. You may so; tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now! wholesome iniquity, have you that a man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon? We have here one, sir, if she wouldbut there never came her like in Mitylene. If shed do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say. Your honour knows what tis to say well enough. Well; call forth, call forth. For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she were a rose indeed if she had but What, prithee? O! sir, I can be modest.
That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste. Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, I can assure you. Is she not a fair creature? Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. Well, theres for you; leave us. I beseech your honour, give me leave; a word, and Ill have done presently. I beseech you do. First, I would have you note, this is an honourable man. I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him. Next, hes the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to. If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how honourable he is in that I know not. Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold. What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive. Ha you done? My lord, shes not paced yet; you must take some pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways. Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade? What trade, sir? Why, I cannot name t but I shall offend. I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it. How long have you been of this profession? Eer since I can remember.
Did you go to t so young? Were you a gamester at five or at seven? Earlier too, sir, if now I be one. Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale. Do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come into t? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of this place. Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am? Who is my principal? Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O! you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place; come, come. If you were born to honour, show it now; If put upon you, make the judgment good That thought you worthy of it. Hows this? hows this? Some more; be sage. For me, That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune Hath placd me in this sty, where, since I came, Diseases have been sold dearer than physic, O! that the gods Would set me free from this unhallowd place, Though they did change me to the meanest bird That flies i the purer air! I did not think Thou couldst have spoke so well; neer dreamd thou couldst.
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind, Thy speech had alterd it. Hold, heres gold for thee; Persever in that clear way thou goest, And the gods strengthen thee! The good gods preserve you! For me, be you thoughten That I came with no ill intent, for to me The very doors and windows savour vilely. Farewell. Thou art a piece of virtue, and I doubt not but thy training hath been noble. Hold, heres more gold for thee. A curse upon him, die he like a thief, That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost Hear from me, it shall be for thy good. I beseech your honour, one piece for me. Avaunt! thou damned door-keeper. Your house, But for this virgin that doth prop it, would Sink and overwhelm you. Away! Hows this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel. Come your ways. Whither would you have me? I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. Well have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say. How now! whats the matter? Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus. O! abominable. She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods.
Marry, hang her up for ever! The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too. Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure; crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable. An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall be ploughed. Hark, hark, you gods! She conjures; away with her! Would she had never come within my doors! Marry, hang you! Shes born to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind? Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays! Come, mistress; come your ways with me. Whither wilt thou have me? To take from you the jewel you hold so dear. Prithee, tell me one thing first. Come now, your one thing. What canst thou wish thine enemy to be? Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress. Neither of these are so bad as thou art, Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou holdst a place, for which the painedst fiend Of hell would not in reputation change; Thou art the damned door-keeper to every Coystril that comes inquiring for his Tib, To the choleric fisting of every rogue Thy ear is liable, thy food is such As hath been belchd on by infected lungs. What would you have me do? go to the wars, would you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one? Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty. Old receptacles, or common sewers, of filth; Serve by indenture to the common hangman: Any of these ways are yet better than this; For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak, Would own a name too dear. O! that the gods Would safely deliver me from this place. Here, heres gold for thee. If that thy master would gain by me, Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance, With other virtues, which Ill keep from boast; And I will undertake all these to teach. I doubt not but this populous city will Yield many scholars. But can you teach all this you speak of? Prove that I cannot, take me home again, And prostitute me to the basest groom That doth frequent your house. Well, I will see what I can do for thee; if I can place thee, I will. But, amongst honest women.
Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master and mistress have bought you, theres no going but by their consent; therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come; Ill do for thee what I can; come your ways. Marina thus the brothel scapes, and chances Into an honest house, our story says. She sings like one immortal, and she dances As goddess-like to her admired lays; Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her neeld composes Natures own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry, That even her art sisters the natural roses; Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry; That pupils lacks she none of noble race, Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place; And to her father turn our thoughts again, Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost, Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrivd Here where his daughter dwells: and on this coast Suppose him now at anchor. The city strivd God Neptunes annual feast to keep; from whence Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies, His banners sable, trimmd with rich expense; And to him in his barge with fervour hies.
In your supposing once more put your sight Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark: Where what is done in action, more, if might, Shall be discoverd; please you, sit and hark. Wheres the Lord Helicanus? he can resolve you. O! here he is. Sir, theres a barge put off from Mitylene, And in it is Lysimachus, the governor, Who craves to come aboard. What is your will? That he have his. Call up some gentlemen. Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls. Doth your lordship call? Gentlemen, theres some of worth would come aboard; I pray ye, greet them fairly. Sir, This is the man that can, in aught you would, Resolve you. Hail, reverend sir! The gods preserve you! And you, sir, to outlive the age I am, And die as I would do. You wish me well. Being on shore, honouring of Neptunes triumphs, Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us, I made to it to know of whence you are. First, what is your place? I am the governor of this place you lie before. Sir, Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king; A man who for this three months hath not spoken To any one, nor taken sustenance But to prorogue his grief. Upon what ground is his distemperature? Twould be too tedious to repeat; But the main grief springs from the loss Of a beloved daughter and a wife. May we not see him?
You may; But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any. Yet let me obtain my wish. Behold him. This was a goodly person, Till the disaster that, one mortal night, Drove him to this. Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you! Hall, royal sir! It is in vain; he will not speak to you. Sir, We have a maid in Mitylene, I durst wager, Would win some words of him. Tis well bethought. She questionless with her sweet harmony And other chosen attractions, would allure, And make a battery through his deafend ports Which now are midway stoppd: She is all happy as the fairst of all, And with her fellow maids is now upon The leafy shelter that abuts against The islands side. Sure, alls effectless; yet nothing well omit, That bears recoverys name. But, since your kindness We have stretchd thus far, let us beseech you, That for our gold we may provision have, Wherein we are not destitute for want, But weary for the staleness. O! sir, a courtesy, Which if we should deny, the most just gods For every graff would send a caterpillar, And so afflict our province. Yet once more Let me entreat to know at large the cause Of your kings sorrow. Sit, sir, I will recount it to you; But see, I am prevented. O! here is The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one! Ist not a goodly presence? Shes a gallant lady.
Shes such a one, that were I well assurd Came of a gentle kind and noble stock, Id wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed. Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty Expect even here, where is a kingly patient: If that thy prosperous and artificial feat Can draw him but to answer thee in aught, Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay As thy desires can wish. Sir, I will use My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided That none but I and my companion maid Be sufferd to come near him. Come, let us leave her; And the gods make her prosperous! Markd he your music? No, nor lookd on us. See, she will speak to him. Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear. Hum! ha! I am a maid, My lord, that neer before invited eyes, But have been gazd on like a comet; she speaks, My lord, that, may be, hath endurd a grief Might equal yours, if both were justly weighd. Though wayward Fortune did malign my state, My derivation was from ancestors Who stood equivalent with mighty kings; But time hath rooted out my parentage, And to the world and awkward casualties Bound me in servitude. I will desist; But there is something glows upon my cheek, And whispers in mine ear, Go not till he speak. My fortunesparentagegood parentage To equal mine!was it not thus? what say you?
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage, You would not do me violence. I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me. You are like something thatWhat country-woman? Here of these shores? No, nor of any shores; Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am No other than I appear. I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping. My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one My daughter might have been: my queens square brows; Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight; As silver-voicd; her eyes as jewel-like, And casd as richly; in pace another Juno; Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry, The more she gives them speech. Where do you live? Where I am but a stranger; from the deck You may discern the place. Where were you bred? And how achievd you these endowments, which You make more rich to owe? Should I tell my history, it would seem Like lies, disdaind in the reporting. Prithee, speak; Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou lookst Modest as justice, and thou seemst a palace For the crownd truth to dwell in. I believe thee, And make my senses credit thy relation To points that seem impossible; for thou lookest Like one I lovd indeed. What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say when I did push thee back, Which was when I perceivd thee,that thou camst From good descending? So indeed I did. Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst Thou hadst been tossd from wrong to injury, And that thou thoughtst thy griefs might equal mine, If both were opend. Some such thing I said, and said no more but what my thoughts Did warrant me was likely. Tell thy story; If thine considerd prove the thousandth part Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I Have sufferd like a girl; yet thou dost look Like Patience gazing on kings graves, and smiling Extremity out of act. What were thy friends? How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin? Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me. My name is Marina. O! I am mockd, And thou by some incensed god sent hither To make the world to laugh at me. Patience, good sir, Or here Ill cease. Nay, Ill be patient. Thou little knowst how thou dost startle me, To call thyself Marina. The name Was given me by one that had some power; My father, and a king. How! a kings daughter? And calld Marina? You said you would believe me; But, not to be a troubler of your peace, I will end here. But are you flesh and blood? Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy? Motion!Well; speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore calld Marina? Calld Marina For I was born at sea. At sea! what mother? My mother was the daughter of a king; Who died the minute I was born, As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft Deliverd weeping. O! stop there a little. This is the rarest dream that eer dull sleep Did mock sad fools withal; this cannot be. My daughters buried. Well; where were you bred? Ill hear you more, to the bottom of your story, And never interrupt you. Youll scorn to believe me; twere best I did give oer. I will believe you by the syllable Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave: How came you in these parts? where were you bred? The king my father did in Tarsus leave me, Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife, Did seek to murder me; and having wood A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do t, A crew of pirates came and rescud me; Brought me to Mitylene. But, good sir, Whither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be You think me an impostor; no, good faith; I am the daughter to King Pericles, If good King Pericles be. Ho, Helicanus! Calls my lord?
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor, Most wise in general; tell me, if thou canst, What this maid is, or what is like to be, That thus hath made me weep? I know not; but Here is the regent, sir, of Mitylene, Speaks nobly of her. She never would tell Her parentage; being demanded that, She would sit still and weep. O Helicanus! strike me, honourd sir; Give me a gash, put me to present pain, Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me Oerbear the shores of my mortality, And drown me with their sweetness. O! come hither, Thou that begettst him that did thee beget; Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus, And found at sea again. O Helicanus! Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud As thunder threatens us; this is Marina. What was thy mothers name? tell me but that, For truth can never be confirmd enough, Though doubts did ever sleep. First, sir, I pray, What is your title? I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now My drownd queens name, as in the rest you said Thou hast been god-like perfect; Thourt heir of kingdoms, and another life To Pericles thy father. Is it no more to be your daughter than To say my mothers name was Thaisa? Thaisa was my mother, who did end The minute I began. Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child, Give me fresh garments.
Mine own, Helicanus; She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been, By savage Cleon; she shall tell thee all; When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge She is thy very princess. Who is this? Sir, tis the governor of Mitylene, Who, hearing of your melancholy state, Did come to see you. I embrace you. Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding. O heavens! bless my girl. But, hark! what music? Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him Oer, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt, How sure you are my daughter. But, what music? My lord, I hear none. None! The music of the spheres! List, my Marina. It is not good to cross him; give him way. Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear? My lord, I hear. Most heavenly music: It nips me unto listning, and thick slumber Hangs upon mine eyes; let me rest. A pillow for his head. So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends, If this but answer to my just belief, Ill well remember you. My temple stands in Ephesus; hie thee thither, And do upon mine altar sacrifice. There, when my maiden priests are met together, Before the people all, Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife; To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughters, call And give them repetition to the life.
Perform my bidding, or thou livst in woe; Do it, and happy; by my silver bow! Awake, and tell thy dream! Celestial Dian, goddess argentine, I will obey thee! Helicanus! Sir? My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike The inhospitable Cleon: but I am For other service first: toward Ephesus Turn our blown sails; eftsoons Ill tell thee why. Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore, And give you gold for such provision As our intents will need? Sir, With all my heart; and when you come ashore, I have another suit. You shall prevail, Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems You have been noble towards her. Sir, lend me your arm. Come, my Marina. Now our sands are almost run; More a little, and then dumb. This, my last boon, give me, For such kindness must relieve me, That you aptly will suppose What pageantry, what feats, what shows, What minstrelsy, and pretty din, The regent made in Mitylen To greet the king. So he thrivd, That he is promisd to be wivd To fair Marina; but in no wise Till he had done his sacrifice, As Dian bade: whereto being bound, The interim, pray you, all confound. In featherd briefness sails are filld, And wishes fall out as theyre willd. At Ephesus, the temple see, Our king and all his company. That he can hither come so soon, Is by your fancys thankful doom. Hail, Dian!
to perform thy just command, I here confess myself the King of Tyre; Who, frighted from my country, did wed At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa. At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth A maid-child calld Marina; who, O goddess! Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus Was nursd with Cleon, whom at fourteen years He sought to murder; but her better stars Brought her to Mitylene, gainst whose shore Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us, Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she Made known herself my daughter. Voice and favour! You are, you areO royal Pericles! What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen! Noble sir, If you have told Dianas altar true, This is your wife. Reverend appearer, no; I threw her oerboard with these very arms. Upon this coast, I warrant you. Tis most certain. Look to the lady. O! shes but oerjoyd. Early in blustering morn this lady was Thrown upon this shore. I opd the coffin, Found there rich jewels; recoverd her, and placd her Here in Dianas temple. May we see them? Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house, Whither I invite you. Look! Thaisa is Recovered. O! let me look! If he be none of mine, my sanctity Will to my sense bend no licentious ear, But curb it, spite of seeing. O! my lord, Are you not Pericles? Like him you speak, Like him you are.
Did you not name a tempest, A birth, and death? The voice of dead Thaisa! That Thaisa am I, supposed dead And drownd. Immortal Dian! Now I know you better. When we with tears parted Pentapolis, The king my father gave you such a ring. This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness Makes my past miseries sport: you shall do well, That on the touching of her lips I may Melt and no more be seen. O! come, be buried A second time within these arms. My heart Leaps to be gone into my mothers bosom. Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa; Thy burden at the sea, and calld Marina, For she was yielded there. Blessd, and mine own! Hail, madam, and my queen! I know you not. You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre, I left behind an ancient substitute; Can you remember what I calld the man? I have namd him oft. Twas Helicanus then. Still confirmation! Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he. Now do I long to hear how you were found, How possibly preservd, and whom to thank, Besides the gods, for this great miracle. Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man, Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can From first to last resolve you. Reverend sir, The gods can have no mortal officer More like a god than you. Will you deliver How this dead queen re-lives? I will, my lord.
Beseech you, first go with me to my house. Where shall be shown you all was found with her; How she came placed here in the temple; No needful thing omitted. Pure Dian! bless thee for thy vision; I Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa, This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter, Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now This ornament Makes me look dismal will I clip to form; And what this fourteen years no rasor touchd, To grace thy marriage-day Ill beautify. Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir, My fathers dead. Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen, Well celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves Will in that kingdom spend our following days; Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign. Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay To hear the rest untold. Sir, leads the way. In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard Of monstrous lust the due and just reward: In Pericles, his queen, and daughter, seen Although assaild with fortune fierce and keen Virtue preservd from fell destructions blast, Led on by heaven, and crownd with joy at last. In Helicanus may you well descry A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty. In reverend Cerimon there well appears The worth that learned charity aye wears.
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame Had spread their cursed deed, and honourd name Of Pericles, to rage the city turn, That him and his they in his palace burn: The gods for murder seemed so content To punish them; although not done, but meant. So on your patience evermore attending, New joy wait on you! Here our play hath ending.
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. And I, in going, madam, weep oer my fathers death anew; but I must attend his majestys command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance. What hope is there of his majestys amendment? He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. This young gentlewoman had a father,O, that had! how sad a passage tis!whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the kings sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the kings disease. How called you the man you speak of, madam? He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? A fistula, my lord. I heard not of it before. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? His sole child, my lord; and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises: her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too: in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena, go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, than have it. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal. Madam, I desire your holy wishes. How understand we that? Be thou blest, Bertram; and succeed thy father In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee; and thy goodness Share with thy birthright!
Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend Under thy own lifes key: be checkd for silence, But never taxd for speech. What heaven more will That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; Tis an unseasond courtier; good my lord, Advise him. He cannot want the best That shall attend his love. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram. The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her. Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. O! were that all. I think not on my father; And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him: my imagination Carries no favour int but Bertrams. I am undone: there is no living, none, If Bertram be away. It were all one That I should love a bright particular star And think to wed it, he is so above me: In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love.
Twas pretty, though a plague, To see him every hour; to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our hearts table; heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: But now hes gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? One that goes with him: I love him for his sake; And yet I know him a notorious liar, Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; Yet these fixd evils sit so fit in him, That they take place, when virtues steely bones Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. Save you, fair queen! And you, monarch! No. And no. Are you meditating on virginity? Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him? Keep him out. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some war-like resistance. There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men? Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city.
It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found: by being ever kept, it is ever lost.Tis too cold a companion: away witht! I will stand fort a little, though therefore I die a virgin. Theres little can be said int; tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose byt! Out witht! within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away witht! How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that neer it likes.
Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off witht, while tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion; richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek: and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it? Not my virginity yet. There shall your master have a thousand loves, A mother, and a mistress, and a friend, A phnix, captain, and an enemy, A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; His humble ambition, proud humility, His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he I know not what he shall. God send him well! The courts a learning-place, and he is one What one, i faith? That I wish well. Tis pity Whats pity?
That wishing well had not a body int, Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends, And show what we alone must think, which never Returns us thanks. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you. Little Helen, farewell: if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. Under Mars, I. I especially think, under Mars. Why under Mars? The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars. When he was predominant. When he was retrograde, I think rather. Why think you so? You go so much backward when you fight. Thats for advantage. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well. I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee: so, farewell.
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. What power is it which mounts my love so high; That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes, and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose What hath been cannot be: who ever strove To show her merit, that did miss her love? The kings disease,my project may deceive me, But my intents are fixd and will not leave me. The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears; Have fought with equal fortune, and continue A braving war. So tis reported, sir. Nay, tis most credible: we here receive it A certainty, vouchd from our cousin Austria, With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business, and would seem To have us make denial. His love and wisdom, Approvd so to your majesty, may plead For amplest credence. He hath armd our answer, And Florence is denied before he comes: Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part. It well may serve A nursery to our gentry, who are sick For breathing and exploit. Whats he comes here?
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord, Young Betram. Youth, thou bearst thy fathers face; Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well composd thee. Thy fathers moral parts Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris. My thanks and duty are your majestys. I would I had that corporal soundness now, As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership! He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long; But on us both did haggish age steal on, And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father. In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe To-day in our young lords; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour. So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, His equal had awakd them; and his honour, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obeyd his hand: who were below him He usd as creatures of another place, And bowd his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times, Which, followd well, would demonstrate them now But goers backward.
His good remembrance, sir, Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech. Would I were with him! He would always say, Methinks I hear him now: his plausive words He scatterd not in ears, but grafted them, To grow there and to bear. Let me not live, Thus his good melancholy oft began, On the catastrophe and heel of pastime, When it was out,Let me not live, quoth he, After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain; whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies Expire before their fashions. This he wishd: I, after him, do after him wish too, Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home, I quickly were dissolved from my hive, To give some labourers room. You are lovd, sir; They that least lend it you shall lack you first. I fill a place, I knowt. How long ist, count, Since the physician at your fathers died? He was much famd. Some six months since, my lord. If he were living, I would try him yet: Lend me an arm: the rest have worn me out With several applications: nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count; My sons no dearer. Thank your majesty. I will now hear: what say you of this gentlewoman?
Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah: the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe: tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow. Well, sir. No, madam, tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned. But, if I may have your ladyships good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may. Wilt thou needs be a beggar? I do beg your good will in this case. In what case? In Isbels case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o my body, for they say barnes are blessings. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry. My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives. Is this all your worships reason? Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are. May the world know them?
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness. I am out o friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wifes sake. Such friends are thine enemies, knave. Youre shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, hes my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan, and old Poysam the papist, howsomeer their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may joul horns together like any deer i the herd. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave? A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way: For I the ballad will repeat, Which men full true shall find; Your marriage comes by destiny, Your cuckoo sings by kind. Get you gone, sir: Ill talk with you more anon.
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to speak. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean. Was this fair face the cause, quoth she, Why the Grecians sacked Troy? Fond done, done fond, Was this King Priams joy? With that she sighed as she stood, With that she sighed as she stood, And gave this sentence then; Among nine bad if one be good, Among nine bad if one be good, Theres yet one good in ten. What! one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah. One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! wed find no fault with the tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a! An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star, or at an earthquake,twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out ere a pluck one. Youll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you! That man should be at womans command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither. Well, now. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than shell demand. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that eer I heard virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal, sithence in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. You have discharged this honestly: keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.
Even so it was with me when I was young: If ever we are natures, these are ours; this thorn Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; Our blood to us, this to our blood is born: It is the show and seal of natures truth, Where loves strong passion is impressd in youth: By our remembrances of days foregone, Such were our faults; or then we thought them none. Her eye is sick ont: I observe her now. What is your pleasure, madam? You know, Helen, I am a mother to you. Mine honourable mistress. Nay, a mother: Why not a mother? When I said, a mother, Methought you saw a serpent: whats in mother That you start at it? I say, I am your mother; And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine: tis often seen Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds; You neer oppressd me with a mothers groan, Yet I express to you a mothers care. Gods mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood To say I am thy mother? Whats the matter, That this distemperd messenger of wet, The many-colourd Iris, rounds thine eye? Why? that you are my daughter? That I am not. I say, I am your mother.
Pardon, madam; The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother: I am from humble, he from honourd name; No note upon my parents, his all noble: My master, my dear lord he is; and I His servant live, and will his vassal die. He must not be my brother. Nor I your mother? You are my mother, madam: would you were, So that my lord your son were not my brother, Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, I care no more for than I do for heaven, So I were not his sister. Cant no other, But, I your daughter, he must be my brother? Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law: God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
My fear hath catchd your fondness: now I see The mystery of your loneliness, and find Your salt tears head: now to all sense tis gross You love my son: invention is ashamd, Against the proclamation of thy passion, To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true; But tell me then, tis so; for, look, thy cheeks Confess it, th one to th other; and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours That in their kind they speak it: only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, That truth should be suspected. Speak, ist so? If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; If it be not, forsweart: howeer, I charge thee, As heaven shall work in me for thine avail, To tell me truly. Good madam, pardon me! Do you love my son? Your pardon, noble mistress! Love you my son? Do not you love him, madam? Go not about; my love hath int a bond Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose The state of your affection, for your passions Have to the full appeachd. Then, I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son.
My friends were poor, but honest; sos my love: Be not offended, for it hurts not him That he is lovd of me: I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit; Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; Yet never know how that desert should be. I know I love in vain, strive against hope; Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love, And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, Religious in mine error, I adore The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, Let not your hate encounter with my love For loving where you do: but, if yourself, Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, Did ever in so true a flame of liking Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity To her, whose state is such that cannot choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose; That seeks not to find that her search implies, But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies. Had you not lately an intent, speak truly, To go to Paris? Madam, I had. Wherefore? tell true. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and provd effects, such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty; and that he willd me In heedfullst reservation to bestow them, As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note. Amongst the rest, There is a remedy, approvd, set down To cure the desperate languishings whereof The king is renderd lost. This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak. My lord your son made me to think of this; Else Paris, and the medicine, and the king, Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then. But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it? He and his physicians Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him, They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, Embowelld of their doctrine, have left off The danger to itself? Theres something int, More than my fathers skill, which was the greatst Of his profession, that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour But give me leave to try success, Id venture The well-lost life of mine on his Graces cure, By such a day, and hour. Dost thou believet? Ay, madam, knowingly.
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, Means, and attendants, and my loving greetings To those of mine in court. Ill stay at home And pray Gods blessing into thy attempt. Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this, What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss. Farewell, young lords: these war-like principles Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell: Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all The gift doth stretch itself as tis receivd, And is enough for both. Tis our hope, sir, After well enterd soldiers, to return And find your Grace in health. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart Will not confess he owes the malady That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords; Whether I live or die, be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy Those bated that inherit but the fall Of the last monarchysee that you come Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell. Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty! Those girls of Italy, take heed of them: They say, our French lack language to deny If they demand: beware of being captives, Before you serve. Our hearts receive your warnings. Farewell. Come hither to me. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us! Tis not his fault, the spark. O! tis brave wars.
Most admirable: I have seen those wars. I am commanded here, and kept a coil with Too young, and the next year, and tis too early. An thy mind stand tot, boy, steal away bravely. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, Till honour be bought up and no sword worn But one to dance with! By heaven! Ill steal away. Theres honour in the theft. Commit it, count. I am your accessary; and so farewell. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body. Farewell, captain. Sweet Monsieur Parolles! Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii, one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek: it was this very sword entrenched it: say to him, I live, and observe his reports for me We shall, noble captain. Mars dote on you for his novices! What will ye do? Stay; the king.
Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and move under the influence of the most received star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell. And I will do so. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy swordmen. Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings. Ill fee thee to stand up. Then heres a man stands that has brought his pardon. I would you had kneeld, my lord, to ask me mercy, And that at my bidding you could so stand up. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate, And askd thee mercy fort. Good faith, across: but, my good lord, tis thus; Will you be curd of your infirmity? No. O! will you eat no grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will my noble grapes an if My royal fox could reach them.
I have seen a medicine Thats able to breathe life into a stone, Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay, To give great Charlemain a pen ins hand And write to her a love-line. What her is this? Why, Doctor She. My lord, theres one arrivd If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour, If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance, I have spoke With one, that in her sex, her years, profession, Wisdom, and constancy, hath amazd me more Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her, For that is her demand, and know her business? That done, laugh well at me. Now, good Lafeu, Bring in the admiration, that we with thee May spend our wonder too, or take off thine By wondring how thou tookst it. Nay, Ill fit you, And not be all day neither. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues. Nay, come your ways. This haste hath wings indeed. Nay, come your ways; This is his majesty, say your mind to him: A traitor you do look like; but such traitors His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressids uncle, That dare leave two together. Fare you well. Now, fair one, does your business follow us? Ay, my good lord. Gerard de Narbon was my father; In what he did profess well found. I knew him.
The rather will I spare my praises towards him; Knowing him is enough. Ons bed of death Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one, Which, as the dearest issue of his practice, And of his old experience the only darling, He bade me store up as a triple eye, Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so; And, hearing your high majesty is touchd With that malignant cause wherein the honour Of my dear fathers gift stands chief in power, I come to tender it and my appliance, With all bound humbleness. We thank you, maiden; But may not be so credulous of cure, When our most learned doctors leave us, and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estate; I say we must not So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, To prostitute our past-cure malady To empirics, or to dissever so Our great self and our credit, to esteem A senseless help when help past sense we deem. My duty then, shall pay me for my pains: I will no more enforce mine office on you; Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one, to bear me back again. I cannot give thee less, to be calld grateful.
Thou thoughtst to help me, and such thanks I give As one near death to those that wish him live; But what at full I know, thou knowst no part, I knowing all my peril, thou no art. What I can do can do no hurt to try, Since you set up your rest gainst remedy. He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister: So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, When judges have been babes; great floods have flown From simple sources; and great seas have dried When miracles have by the greatest been denied. Oft expectation fails, and most oft there Where most it promises; and oft it hits Where hope is coldest and despair most fits. I must not hear thee: fare thee well, kind maid. Thy pains, not usd, must by thyself be paid: Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward. Inspired merit so by breath is barrd. It is not so with Him that all things knows, As tis with us that square our guess by shows; But most it is presumption in us when The help of heaven we count the act of men. Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor that proclaim Myself against the level of mine aim; But know I think, and think I know most sure, My art is not past power nor you past cure. Art thou so confident? Within what space Hopst thou my cure? The greatst grace lending grace, Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, Ere twice in murk and occidental damp Moist Hesperus hath quenchd his sleepy lamp, Or four and twenty times the pilots glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass, What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, Health shall live free, and sickness freely die. Upon thy certainty and confidence What darst thou venture? Tax of impudence, A strumpets boldness, a divulged shame, Traducd by odious ballads: my maidens name Seard otherwise; nay worseif worseextended With vilest torture let my life be ended. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak, His powerful sound within an organ weak; And what impossibility would slay In common sense, sense saves another way. Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate Worth name of life in thee hath estimate; Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, virtue, all That happiness and prime can happy call: Thou this to hazard needs must intimate Skill infinite or monstrous desperate. Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try, That ministers thine own death if I die.
If I break time, or flinch in property Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die, And well deservd. Not helping, deaths my fee; But, if I help, what do you promise me? Make thy demand. But will you make it even? Ay, by my sceptre, and my hopes of heaven. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand What husband in thy power I will command: Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France, My low and humble name to propagate With any branch or image of thy state; But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow. Here is my hand; the premises observd, Thy will by my performance shall be servd: So make the choice of thy own time, for I, Thy resolvd patient, on thee still rely. More should I question thee, and more I must, Though more to know could not be more to trust, From whence thou camst, how tended on; but rest Unquestiond welcome and undoubted blest. Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court. To the court!
why what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court! Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put offs cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer will serve all men. Marry, thats a bountiful answer that fits all questions. It is like a barbers chair that fits all buttocks; the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock. Will your answer serve fit to all questions? As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tibs rush for Toms forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for Mayday, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nuns lip to the friars mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin. Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions? From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it.
Here it is, and all that belongs tot: ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn. To be young again, if we could. I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier? O Lord, sir! theres a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you. O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. O Lord, sir! Nay, put me tot, I warrant you. You were lately whipped, sir, as I think. O Lord, sir! Spare not me. Do you cry, O Lord, sir! at your whipping, and Spare not me? Indeed your O Lord, sir! is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound tot. I neer had worse luck in my life in my O Lord, sir! I see things may serve long, but not serve ever. I play the noble housewife with the time, To entertaint so merrily with a fool. O Lord, sir! why, theret serves well again. An end, sir: to your business. Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back: Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much. Not much commendation to them. Not much employment for you: you understand me?
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs. Haste you again. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear. Why, tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times. And so tis. To be relinquished of the artists, So I say. Both of Galen and Paracelsus. So I say. Of all the learned and authentic fellows, Right; so I say. That gave him out incurable, Why, there tis; so say I too. Not to be helped, Right; as twere, a man assured of a Uncertain life, and sure death. Just, you say well: so would I have said. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world. It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you shall read it inwhat do you call there A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor. Thats it I would have said; the very same.
Why, your dolphin is not lustier: fore me, I speak in respect Nay, tis strange, tis very strange, that is the brief and the tedious of it; and he is of a most facinorous spirit, that will not acknowledge it to be the Very hand of heaven Ay, so I say. In a most weak and debile minister, great power, great transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king, as to be generally thankful. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king. Lustig, as the Dutchman says: Ill like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, hes able to lead her a coranto. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen? Fore God, I think so. Go, call before me all the lords in court. Sit, my preserver, by thy patients side: And with this healthful hand, whose banishd sense Thou hast repeald, a second time receive The confirmation of my promised gift, Which but attends thy naming. Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, Oer whom both sovreign power and fathers voice I have to use: thy frank election make; Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one.
Id give bay Curtal, and his furniture, My mouth no more were broken than these boys And writ as little beard. Peruse them well: Not one of those but had a noble father. Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me restord the king to health. We understand it, and thank heaven for you. I am a simple maid; and therein wealthiest That I protest I simply am a maid. Please it your majesty, I have done already: The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me, We blush, that thou shouldst choose; but, be refusd, Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever; Well neer come there again. Make choice; and see, Who shuns thy love, shuns all his love in me. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, And to imperial Love, that god most high, Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit? And grant it. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, Before I speak, too threateningly replies: Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes, and her humble love! No better, if you please. My wish receive, Which great Love grant! and so I take my leave. Do all they deny her?
An they were sons of mine, Id have them whippd or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of. Be not afraid that I your hand should take; Ill never do you wrong for your own sake: Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed! These boys are boys of ice, theyll none have her: sure, they are bastards to the English; the French neer got em. You are too young, too happy, and too good, To make yourself a son out of my blood. Fair one, I think not so. Theres one grape yet. I am sure thy father drunk wine. But if thou best not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen: I have known thee already. I dare not say I take you; but I give Me and my service, ever whilst I live, Into your guiding power. This is the man. Why then, young Bertram, take her; shes thy wife. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes. Knowst thou not, Bertram, What she has done for me? Yes, my good lord; But never hope to know why I should marry her. Thou knowst she has raisd me from my sickly bed. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising?
I know her well: She had her breeding at my fathers charge. A poor physicians daughter my wife! Disdain Rather corrupt me ever! Tis only title thou disdainst in her, the which I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods, Of colour, weight, and heat, pourd all together, Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off In differences so mighty. If she be All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikst, A poor physicians daughter, thou dislikst Of virtue for the name; but do not so: From lowest place when virtuous things proceed, The place is dignified by the doers deed: Where great additions swells, and virtue none, It is a dropsied honour. Good alone Is good without a name: vileness is so: The property by what it is should go, Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; In these to nature shes immediate heir, And these breed honour: that is honours scorn Which challenges itself as honours born, And is not like the sire: honours thrive When rather from our acts we them derive Than our foregoers. The mere words a slave, Deboshd on every tomb, on every grave A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb Where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb Of honourd bones indeed. What should be said? If thou canst like this creature as a maid, I can create the rest: virtue and she Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
I cannot love her, nor will strive to dot. Thou wrongst thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose. That you are well restord, my lord, Im glad: Let the rest go. My honours at the stake, which to defeat I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift, That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert; thou canst not dream We, poising us in her defective scale, Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know, It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt: Obey our will, which travails in thy good: Believe not thy disdain, but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims; Or I will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice, Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit My fancy to your eyes. When I consider What great creation and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now The praised of the king; who, so ennobled, Is, as twere, born so.
Take her by the hand, And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise A counterpoise, if not to thy estate A balance more replete. I take her hand. Good fortune and the favour of the king Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, And be performd to-night: the solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space, Expecting absent friends. As thou lovst her, Thy loves to me religious; else, does err. Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you. Your pleasure, sir? Your lord and master did well to make his recantation. Recantation! My lord! my master! Ay; is it not a language I speak? A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master! Are you companion to the Count Rousillon? To any count; to all counts; to what is man. To what is counts man: counts master is of another style. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow: thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care not; yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and that thourt scarce worth. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee, Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which ifLord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it. I have not, my lord, deserved it. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple. Well, I shall be wiser. Een as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o the contrary. If ever thou best bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal: for doing I am past; as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. Ill beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. Ill have no more pity of his age than I would have ofIll beat him, an if I could but meet him again! Sirrah, your lord and masters married; theres news for you: you have a new mistress. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master. Who? God? Ay, sir. The devil it is thats thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o this fashion? dost make hose of thy sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, Id beat thee: methinks thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee: I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission. You are not worth another word, else Id call you knave. I leave you. Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good. Let it be concealed awhile. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever! What is the matter, sweet heart? Although before the solemn priest I have sworn, I will not bed her. What, what, sweet heart? O my Parolles, they have married me! Ill to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits The tread of a mans foot. To the wars! Theres letters from my mother: what the import is I know not yet. Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy! to the wars! He wears his honour in a box, unseen, That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Marss fiery steed. To other regions! France is a stable; we that dwell int jades; Therefore, to the war!
It shall be so: Ill send her to my house, Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, And wherefore I am fled; write to the king That which I durst not speak: his present gift Shall furnish me to those Italian fields, Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife To the dark house and the detested wife. Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure? Go with me to my chamber, and advise me. Ill send her straight away: to-morrow Ill to the wars, she to her single sorrow. Why, these balls bound; theres noise in it. Tis hard: A young man married is a man thats marrd: Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go: The king has done you wrong: but, hush! tis so. My mother greets me kindly: is she well? She is not well; but yet she has her health; shes very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be given, shes very well, and wants nothing i the world; but yet she is not well. If she be very well, what does she ail that shes not very well? Truly, shes very well indeed, but for two things. What two things? One, that shes not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! the other, that shes in earth, from whence God send her quickly! Bless you, my fortunate lady! I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O! my knave, how does my old lady? So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money, I would she did as you say. Why, I say nothing. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a mans tongue shakes out his masters undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing. Away! thourt a knave. You should have said, sir, before a knave thourt a knave; that is, before me thourt a knave: this had been truth, sir. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee. Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the worlds pleasure and the increase of laughter. A good knave, i faith, and well fed. Madam, my lord will go away to-night; A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love, Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge, But puts it off to a compelld restraint; Whose want, and whose delay, is strewd with sweets, Which they distil now in the curbed time, To make the coming hour oerflow with joy, And pleasure drown the brim. Whats his will else? That you will take your instant leave o the king, And make this haste as your own good proceeding, Strengthend with what apology you think May make it probable need. What more commands he? That, having this obtaind, you presently Attend his further pleasure. In everything I wait upon his will. I shall report it so. I pray you. Come, sirrah. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof. You have it from his own deliverance. And by other warranted testimony. Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant. I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you, make us friends; I will pursue the amity. These things shall be done, sir. Pray you, sir, whos his tailor? Sir? O! I know him well.
Ay, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a very good tailor. Is she gone to the king? She is. Will she away to-night? As youll have her. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, Given orders for our horses; and to-night, When I should take possession of the bride, End ere I do begin. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one that lies three thirds, and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur? I know not how I have deserved to run into my lords displeasure. You have made shift to run intot, boots and spurs and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and out of it youll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord. And shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures.
Farewell, monsieur: I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil. An idle lord, I swear. I think not so. Why, do you not know him? Yes, I do know him well; and common speech Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, Spoke with the king, and have procurd his leave For present parting; only, he desires Some private speech with you. I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, Which holds not colour with the time, nor does The ministration and required office On my particular: prepard I was not For such a business; therefore am I found So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you That presently you take your way for home; And rather muse than ask why I entreat you; For my respects are better than they seem, And my appointments have in them a need Greater than shows itself at the first view To you that know them not. This to my mother. Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so I leave you to your wisdom. Sir, I can nothing say, But that I am your most obedient servant. Come, come, no more of that.
And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have faild To equal my great fortune. Let that go: My haste is very great. Farewell: hie home. Pray sir, your pardon. Well, what would you say? I am not worthy of the wealth I owe, Nor dare I say tis mine, and yet it is; But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal What law does vouch mine own. What would you have? Something, and scarce so much: nothing, indeed. I would not tell you what I would, my lord: Faith, yes; Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord. Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell. Go thou toward home; where I will never come Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum. Away! and for our flight. Bravely, coragio! So that from point to point now have you heard The fundamental reasons of this war, Whose great decision hath much blood let forth, And more thirsts after. Holy seems the quarrel Upon your Graces part; black and fearful On the opposer. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France Would in so just a business shut his bosom Against our borrowing prayers.
Good my lord, The reasons of our state I cannot yield, But like a common and an outward man, That the great figure of a council frames By self-unable motion: therefore dare not Say what I think of it, since I have found Myself in my incertain grounds to fail As often as I guessd. Be it his pleasure. But I am sure the younger of our nature, That surfeit on their ease, will day by day Come here for physic. Welcome shall they be, And all the honours that can fly from us Shall on them settle. You know your places well; When better fall, for your avails they fell. To-morrow to the field. It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man. By what observance, I pray you? Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court.
Our old ling and our Isbels o the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o the court: the brains of my Cupids knocked out, and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach. What have we here? Een that you have there. I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the not eternal. You shall hear I am ran away: know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, BERTRAM. This is not well: rash and unbridled boy, To fly the favours of so good a king! To pluck his indignation on thy head By the misprising of a maid too virtuous For the contempt of empire! O madam! yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady. What is the matter? Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would. Why should he be killed? So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does: the danger is in standing tot; thats the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more; for my part, I only hear your son was run away.
Save you, good madam. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone. Do not say so. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen, I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief, That the first face of neither, on the start, Can woman me unto t: where is my son, I pray you? Madam, hes gone to serve the Duke of Florence: We met him thitherward; for thence we came, And, after some dispatch in hand at court, Thither we bend again. Look on his letter, madam; heres my passport. When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a then I write a never. This is a dreadful sentence. Brought you this letter, gentlemen? Ay, madam; And for the contents sake are sorry for our pains. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer; If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine, Thou robbst me of a moiety: he was my son, But I do wash his name out of my blood, And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he? Ay, madam. And to be a soldier? Such is his noble purpose; and, believet, The duke will lay upon him all the honour That good convenience claims. Return you thither? Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed. Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France. Tis bitter.
Find you that there? Ay, madam. Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his heart was not consenting to. Nothing in France until he have no wife! Theres nothing here that is too good for him But only she; and she deserves a lord That twenty such rude boys might tend upon, And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him? A servant only, and a gentleman Which I have some time known. Parolles, was it not? Ay, my good lady, he. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness. My son corrupts a well-derived nature With his inducement. Indeed, good lady, The fellow has a deal of that too much, Which holds him much to have. Yare welcome, gentlemen. I will entreat you, when you see my son, To tell him that his sword can never win The honour that he loses: more Ill entreat you Written to bear along. We serve you, madam, In that and all your worthiest affairs. Not so, but as we change our courtesies. Will you draw near? Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France. Nothing in France until he has no wife! Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France; Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! ist I That chase thee from thy country, and expose Those tender limbs of thine to the event Of the non-sparing war?
and is it I That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers, That ride upon the violent speed of fire, Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air, That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord! Whoever shoots at him, I set him there; Whoever charges on his forward breast, I am the caitiff that do hold him tot; And, though I kill him not, I am the cause His death was so effected: better twere I met the ravin lion when he roard With sharp constraint of hunger; better twere That all the miseries which nature owes Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon, Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, As oft it loses all: I will be gone; My being here it is that holds thee hence: Shall I stay here to dot? no, no, although The air of paradise did fan the house, And angels officd all: I will be gone, That pitiful rumour may report my flight, To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day! For with the dark, poor thief, Ill steal away. The general of our horse thou art; and we, Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence Upon thy promising fortune.
Sir, it is A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet Well strive to bear it for your worthy sake To the extreme edge of hazard. Then go thou forth, And fortune play upon thy prosprous helm As thy auspicious mistress! This very day, Great Mars, I put myself into thy file: Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove A lover of thy drum, hater of love. Alas! and would you take the letter of her? Might you not know she would do as she has done, By sending me a letter? Read it again. I am Saint Jaques pilgrim, thither gone: Ambitious love hath so in me offended That bare-foot plod I the cold ground upon With sainted vow my faults to have amended. Write, write, that from the bloody course of war, My dearest master, your dear son, may hie: Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far His name with zealous fervour sanctify: His taken labours bid him me forgive; I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth From courtly friends, with camping foes to live, Where death and danger dog the heels of worth: He is too good and fair for Death and me; Whom I myself embrace, to set him free. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much, As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her, I could have well diverted her intents, Which thus she hath prevented. Pardon me, madam: If I had given you this at over-night She might have been oertaen; and yet she writes, Pursuit would be but vain. What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive, Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear, And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo, To this unworthy husband of his wife; Let every word weigh heavy of her worth That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief, Though little he do feel it, set down sharply. Dispatch the most convenient messenger: When haply he shall hear that she is gone, He will return; and hope I may that she, Hearing so much, will speed her foot again, Led hither by pure love. Which of them both Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense To make distinction. Provide this messenger. My heart is heavy and mine age is weak; Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight. They say the French Count has done most honourable service. It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander, and that with his own hand he slew the dukes brother.
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may know by their trumpets. Come; lets return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl: the honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as honesty. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion. I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost. You shall not need to fear me. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another. Ill question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound? To Saint Jaques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you? At the Saint Francis, here beside the port.
Is this the way? Ay, marry, ist. Hark you! They come this way. If you will tarry, holy pilgrim, But till the troops come by, I will conduct you where you shall be lodgd: The rather, for I think I know your hostess As ample as myself. Is it yourself? If you shall please so, pilgrim. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure. You came, I think, from France? I did so. Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service. His name, I pray you. The Count Rousillon: know you such a one? But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him; His face I know not. Whatsoeer he is, Hes bravely taken here. He stole from France, As tis reported, for the king had married him Against his liking. Think you it is so? Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady. There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her. Whats his name? Monsieur Parolles. O! I believe with him, In argument of praise, or to the worth Of the great count himself, she is too mean To have her name repeated: all her deserving Is a reserved honesty, and that I have not heard examind. Alas, poor lady! Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord. Ay, right; good creature, wheresoeer she is, Her heart weighs sadly.
This young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleasd. How do you mean? May be the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose. He does, indeed; And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid: But she is armd for him and keeps her guard In honestest defence. The gods forbid else! So, now they come. That is Antonio, the dukes eldest son; That, Escalus. Which is the Frenchman? He; That with the plume: tis a most gallant fellow; I would he lovd his wife. If he were honester, He were much goodlier; ist not a handsome gentleman? I like him well. Tis pity he is not honest. Yonds that same knave That leads him to these places: were I his lady I would poison that vile rascal. Which is he? That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy? Perchance hes hurt i the battle. Lose our drum! well. Hes shrewdly vexed at something. Look, he has spied us. Marry, hang you! And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you Where you shall host: of enjoind penitents Theres four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound, Already at my house. I humbly thank you.
Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking Shall be for me; and, to requite you further, I will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the note. Well take your offer kindly. Nay, good my lord, put him tot: let him have his way. If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect. On my life, my lord, a bubble. Do you think I am so far deceived in him? Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, hes a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainment. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him: such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
We will bind and hood wink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything. O! for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum: he says he has a stratagem fort. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success int, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drums entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes. O! for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand. How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. A pox ont! let it go: tis but a drum. But a drum! Ist but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that Csar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered. It might have been recovered. It might; but it is not now. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or hic jacet. Why, if you have a stomach tot, monsieur, if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it, and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it. But you must not now slumber in it. Ill about it this evening: and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation, and by midnight look to hear further from me. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
I know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt I vow. I know thourt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell. I love not many words. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damned than to dot? You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is, that he will steal himself into a mans favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out you have him ever after. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto? None in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost embossed him, you shall see his fall to-night; for, indeed, he is not for your lordships respect. Well make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old Lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night. I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught. Your brother he shall go along with me.
Ast please your lordship: Ill leave you. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you The lass I spoke of. But you say shes honest. Thats all the fault. I spoke with her but once, And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her, By this same coxcomb that we have i the wind, Tokens and letters which she did re-send; And this is all I have done. Shes a fair creature; Will you go see her? With all my heart, my lord. If you misdoubt me that I am not she, I know not how I shall assure you further, But I shall lose the grounds I work upon. Though my estate be falln, I was well born, Nothing acquainted with these businesses; And would not put my reputation now In any staining act. Nor would I wish you. First, give me trust, the county is my husband, And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken Is so from word to word; and then you cannot, By the good aid that I of you shall borrow, Err in bestowing it. I should believe you: For you have showd me that which well approves Youre great in fortune. Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which I will over-pay and pay again When I have found it.
The county woos your daughter, Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, Resolvd to carry her: let her in fine consent, As well direct her how tis best to bear it. Now, his important blood will nought deny That shell demand: a ring the county wears, That down ward hath succeeded in his house From son to son, some four or five descents Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire, To buy his will, it would not seem too dear, Howeer repented after. Now I see The bottom of your purpose. You see it lawful then. It is no more, But that your daughter, ere she seems as won, Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter, In fine, delivers me to fill the time, Herself most chastely absent. After this, To marry her, Ill add three thousand crowns To what is past already. I have yielded. Instruct my daughter how she shall persever, That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent. Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs composd To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves, for he persists As if his life lay ont.
Why then to-night Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed, And lawful meaning in a lawful act, Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. But lets about it. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter. Good captain, let me be the interpreter. Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice? No, sir, I warrant you. But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? Even such as you speak to me. He must think us some band of strangers i the adversarys entertainment. Now, he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. Ten oclock: within these three hours twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done?
It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue. This is the first truth that eer thine own tongue was guilty of. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it: they will say, Came you off with so little? and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, whats the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-womans mouth, and buy myself another of Bajazets mute, if you prattle me into these perils. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is? I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword. We cannot afford you so. Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem. Twould not do. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped. Hardly serve. Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel How deep? Thirty fathom. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
I would I had any drum of the enemys: I would swear I recovered it. Thou shalt hear one anon. A drum now of the enemys! Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. Cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo. O! ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes. Boskos thromuldo boskos. I know you are the Muskos regiment; And I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me: I will discover that which shall undo The Florentine. Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue: Kerelybonto: Sir, Betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards Are at thy bosom. O! O! pray, pray, pray. Manka revania dulche. Oscorbidulchos volivorco. The general is content to spare thee yet; And, hoodwinkd as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform Something to save thy life. O! let me live, And all the secrets of our camp Ill show, Their force, their purposes; nay, Ill speak that Which you will wonder at. But wilt thou faithfully? If I do not, damn me. Acordo linta. Come on; thou art granted space. Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother, We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them. Captain, I will. A will betray us all unto ourselves: Inform on that. So I will, sir.
Till then, Ill keep him dark and safely lockd. They told me that your name was Fontibell. No, my good lord, Diana. Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden, but a monument: When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now, for you are cold and stern; And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got. She then was honest. So should you be. No: My mother did but duty; such, my lord, As you owe to your wife. No more o that! I prithee do not strive against my vows. I was compelld to her; but I love thee By loves own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service. Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you; but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness. How have I sworn! Tis not the many oaths that make the truth, But the plain single vow that is vowd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the Highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me, If I should swear by Gods great attributes I lovd you dearly, would you believe my oaths, When I did love you ill? this has no holding, To swear by him whom I protest to love, That I will work against him: therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions, but unseald; At least in my opinion. Change it, change it. Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; And my integrity neer knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever. I see that men make ropes in such a scarr That well forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. Ill lend it thee, my dear; but have no power To give it from me. Will you not, my lord? It is an honour longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i the world In me to lose. Mine honours such a ring: My chastitys the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i the world In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion honour on my part Against your vain assault.
Here, take my ring: My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, And Ill be bid by thee. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: Ill order take my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquerd my yet maiden bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me. My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliverd: And on your finger in the night Ill put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won A wife of me, though there my hope be done. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo As if she sat in s heart; she says all men Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me When his wifes dead; therefore Ill lie with him When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, I live and die a maid: Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win. You have not given him his mothers letter?
I have delivered it an hour since: there is something int that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. When you have spoken it, tis dead, and I am the grave of it. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we! Merely our own traitors: and as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream oerflows himself. Is it not most damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night? Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour.
That approaches apace: I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. We will not meddle with him till he come, for his presence must be the whip of the other. In the meantime what near you of these wars? I hear there is an overture of peace. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded. What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into France? I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council. Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal of his act. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven. How is this justified? The stronger part of it by her own letters, which make her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place. Hath the count all this intelligence? Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.
I am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses! And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues. How now! wheres your master? He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend. They cannot be too sweet for the kings tartness. Heres his lordship now. How now, my lord! ist not after midnight?
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a months length a-piece, by an abstract of success: I have conged with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet. If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit model: he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. Bring him forth. Has sat i the stocks all night, poor gallant knave. No matter; his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself? I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to Morgan,whom he supposes to be a friar,from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed? Nothing of me, has a?
His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be int, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush! hush! Hoodman comes! Porto tartarossa. He calls for the tortures: what will you say without em? I will confess what I know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more. Bosko chimurcho. Boblibindo chicurmurco. You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note. And truly, as I hope to live. First, demand of him how many horse the duke is strong. What say you to that? Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live. Shall I set down your answer so? Do: Ill take the sacrament ont, how and which way you will. Alls one to him. What a past-saving slave is this! You are deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist,that was his own phrase,that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.
Well, thats set down. Five or six thousand horse, I said,I will say true,or thereabouts, set down, for Ill speak truth. Hes very near the truth in this. But I con him no thanks fort, in the nature he delivers it. Poor rogues, I pray you, say. Well, thats set down. I humbly thank you, sir. A truths a truth; the rogues are marvellous poor. Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot. What say you to that? By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. What shall be done to him? Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke. Well, thats set down.
You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain be i the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt. What say you to this? what do you know of it? I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the intergatories: demand them singly. Do you know this Captain Dumain? I know him: a was a botchers prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieves fool with child; a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florences camp? Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon. What is his reputation with the duke? The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket. Marry, well search. In good sadness, I do not know: either it is there, or it is upon a file with the dukes other letters in my tent. Here tis; heres a paper; shall I read it to you?
I do not know if it be it or no. Our interpreter does it well. Excellently. Dian, the counts a fool, and full of gold That is not the dukes letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again. Nay, Ill read it first, by your favour. My meaning int, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds. Damnable both-sides rogue! When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; After he scores, he never pays the score: Half won is match well made; match, and well make it; He neer pays after-debts; take it before, And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this, Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss; For count of this, the counts a fool, I know it, Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vowd to thee in thine ear, PAROLLES. He shall be whipped through the army with this rime ins forehead. This is your devoted friend, sir; the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.
I could endure anything before but a cat, and now hes a cat to me. I perceive, sir, by our generals looks, we shall be fain to hang you. My life, sir, in any case! not that I am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live. Well see what may be done, so you confess freely: therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain. You have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty? He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus; he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking em he is stronger than Hercules; he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool; drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing. I begin to love him for this. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me! he is more and more a cat.
What say you to his expertness in war? Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians,to belie him I will not,and more of his soldiership I know not; except, in that country, he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain. He hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him. A pox on him! hes a cat still. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not ask you, if gold will corrupt him to revolt. Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. Whats his brother, the other Captain Dumain? Why does he ask him or me? Whats he? Een a crow o the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he out-runs any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine? Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon. Ill whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
Ill no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken? There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says, you, that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death! That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. So, look about you: know you any here? Good morrow, noble captain. God bless you, Captain Parolles. God save you, noble captain. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France. Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? an I were not a very coward Id compel it of you; but fare you well. You are undone, captain; all but your scarf; that has a knot ont yet. Who cannot be crushed with a plot? If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation.
Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too: we shall speak of you there. Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great Twould burst at this. Captain Ill be no more; But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft As captain shall: simply the thing I am Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart, Let him fear this; for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass. Rust, sword! cool, blushes! and Parolles, live Safest in shame! being foold, by foolery thrive! Theres place and means for every man alive. Ill after them. That you may well perceive I have not wrongd you, One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety; fore whose throne tis needful, Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. Time was I did him a desired office, Dear almost as his life; which gratitude Through flinty Tartars bosom would peep forth, And answer, thanks. I duly am informd His Grace is at Marseilles; to which place We have convenient convoy. You must know, I am supposed dead: the army breaking, My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding, And by the leave of my good lord the king, Well be before our welcome. Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome. Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love.
Doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughters dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband. But, O strange men! That can such sweet use make of what they hate, When saucy trusting of the cozend thoughts Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play With what it loathes for that which is away. But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf. Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am yours Upon your will to suffer. Yet, I pray you: But with the word the time will bring on summer, When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; Our waggon is prepard, and time revives us: Alls well that ends well: still the fines the crown; Whateer the course, the end is the renown. No, no, no; your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of. I would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating.
If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love. Twas a good lady, twas a good lady: we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the salad, or, rather the herb of grace. They are not salad-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass. Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave, or a fool? A fool, sir, at a womans service, and a knave at a mans. Your distinction? I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service. So you were a knave at his service, indeed. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service. I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool. At your service. No, no, no. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are. Whos that? a Frenchman? Faith, sir, a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there. What prince is that? The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of darkness; alias, the devil. Hold thee, theres my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of: serve him still.
I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master I speak of, ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain ins court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may; but the many will be too chill and tender, and theyll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well looked to, without any tricks. If I put any tricks upon em, sir, they shall be jades tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature. A shrewd knave and an unhappy. So he is. My lord thats gone made himself much sport out of him: by his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will. I like him well; tis not amiss.
And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good ladys death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did first propose. His highness hath promised me to do it; and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it? With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected. His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted. You need but plead your honourable privilege. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I thank my God it holds yet. O madam! yonders my lord your son with a patch of velvet ons face: whether there be a scar under it or no, the velvet knows; but tis a goodly patch of velvet.
His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is that. But it is your carbonadoed face. Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk with the young noble soldier. Faith, theres a dozen of em, with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man. But this exceeding posting, day and night, Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it: But since you have made the days and nights as one, To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs, Be bold you do so grow in my requital As nothing can unroot you. In happy time; This man may help me to his majestys ear, If he would spend his power. God save you, sir. And you. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France. I have been sometimes there. I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness; And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions, Which lay nice manners by, I put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which I shall continue thankful. Whats your will?
That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king, And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence. The kings not here. Not here, sir! Not, indeed: He hence removd last night, and with more haste Than is his use. Lord, how we lose our pains! Alls well that ends well yet, Though time seems so adverse and means unfit. I do beseech you, whither is he gone? Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon; Whither I am going. I do beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the king before me, Commend the paper to his gracious hand; Which I presume shall render you no blame But rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means. This Ill do for you. And you shall find yourself to be well thankd, Whateer falls more. We must to horse again: Go, go, provide. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in Fortunes mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure. Truly, Fortunes displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortunes buttering. Prithee, allow the wind.
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir: I spake but by a metaphor. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any mans metaphor. Prithee, get thee further. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper. Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from Fortunes close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself. Here is a purr of Fortunes, sir, or of Fortunes catbut not a musk-catthat has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratched. And what would you have me to do? tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive long under her? Theres a cardecu for you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for other business. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word. You beg a single penny more: come, you shall hat; save your word. My name, my good lord, is Parolles. You beg more than one word then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your drum?
O, my good lord! you were the first that found me. Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out. The kings coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had talk of you last night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat: go to, follow. I praise God for you. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem Was made much poorer by it: but your son, As mad in folly, lackd the sense to know Her estimation home. Tis past, my liege; And I beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion, done i the blaze of youth; When oil and fire, too strong for reasons force, Oerbears it and burns on. My honourd lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all, Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watchd the time to shoot.
This I must say, But first I beg my pardon,the young lord Did to his majesty, his mother, and his lady, Offence of mighty note, but to himself The greatest wrong of all: he lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive, Whose dear perfection hearts that scornd to serve Humbly calld mistress. Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither; We are reconcild, and the first view shall kill All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon: The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion we do bury The incensing relics of it: let him approach, A stranger, no offender; and inform him So tis our will he should. I shall, my liege. What says he to your daughter? have you spoke? All that he is hath reference to your highness. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me, That set him high in fame. He looks well ont. I am not a day of season, For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once; but to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way: so stand thou forth; The time is fair again. My high-repented blames, Dear sovereign, pardon to me. All is whole; Not one word more of the consumed time.
Lets take the instant by the forward top, For we are old, and on our quickst decrees The inaudible and noiseless foot of time Steals ere we can effect them. You remember The daughter of this lord? Admiringly, my liege: At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue, Where the impression of mine eye infixing, Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, Which warpd the line of every other favour; Scornd a fair colour, or expressd it stolen; Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object: thence it came That she, whom all men praisd, and whom myself, Since I have lost, have lovd, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it. Well excusd: That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away From the great compt. But love that comes too late, Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, To the great sender turns a sour offence, Crying, Thats good thats gone. Our rasher faults Make trivial price of serious things we have, Not knowing them until we know their grave: Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, Destroy our friends and after weep their dust: Our own love waking cries to see whats done, While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helens knell, and now forget her.
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin: The main consents are had; and here well stay To see our widowers second marriage-day. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse! Come on, my son, in whom my houses name Must be digested, give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, That she may quickly come. And every hair thats ont, Helen, thats dead, Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this, The last that eer I took her leave at court, I saw upon her finger. Hers it was not. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, While I was speaking, oft was fastend tot. This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen, I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her Of what should stead her most? My gracious sovereign, Howeer it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it; and she reckond it At her lifes rate. I am sure I saw her wear it.
You are deceivd, my lord, she never saw it: In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrappd in a paper, which containd the name Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought I stood engagd: but when I had subscribd To mine own fortune, and informd her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceasd, In heavy satisfaction, and would never Receive the ring again. Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in natures mystery more science Than I have in this ring: twas mine, twas Helens, Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess twas hers, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her. She calld the saints to surety, That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed, Where you have never come, or sent it us Upon her great disaster. She never saw it. Thou speakst it falsely, as I love mine honour; And makst conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out.
If it should prove That thou art so inhuman,twill not prove so; And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly, And she is dead; which nothing, but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe, More than to see this ring. Take him away. My fore-past proofs, howeer the matter fall, Shall tax my fears of little vanity, Having vainly feard too little. Away with him! Well sift this matter further. If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, Where yet she never was. I am wrappd in dismal thinkings. Gracious sovereign, Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not: Heres a petition from a Florentine, Who hath, for four or five removes come short To tender it herself. I undertook it, Vanquishd thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know Is here attending: her business looks in her With an importing visage, and she told me, In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern Your highness with herself. Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honours paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king!
in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. DIANA CAPILET. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: Ill none of him. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu, To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors: Go speedily and bring again the count. I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, Was foully snatchd. Now, justice on the doers! I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you, And that you fly them as you swear them lordship, Yet you desire to marry. What womans that? I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, Derived from the ancient Capilet: My suit, as I do understand, you know, And therefore know how far I may be pitied. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring, And both shall cease, without your remedy. Come hither, county; do you know these women? My lord, I neither can nor will deny But that I know them: do they charge me further? Why do you look so strange upon your wife? Shes none of mine, my lord.
If you shall marry, You give away this hand, and that is mine; You give away heavens vows, and those are mine; You give away myself, which is known mine; For I by vow am so embodied yours That she which marries you must marry me; Either both or none. Your reputation comes too short for my daughter: you are no husband for her. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, Whom sometime I have laughd with: let your highness Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour Than for to think that I would sink it here. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend, Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour, Than in my thought it lies. Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity. What sayst thou to her? Shes impudent, my lord; And was a common gamester to the camp. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so, He might have bought me at a common price: Do not believe him. O! behold this ring, Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel; yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o the camp, If I be one. He blushes, and tis it: Of six preceding ancestors, that gem Conferrd by testament to the sequent issue, Hath it been owd and worn. This is his wife: That rings a thousand proofs.
Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce So bad an instrument: his names Parolles. I saw the man to-day, if man he be. Find him, and bring him hither. What of him? Hes quoted for a most perfidious slave, With all the spots of the world taxd and deboshd, Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. Am I or that or this for what hell utter, That will speak anything? She hath that ring of yours. I think she has: certain it is I likd her, And boarded her i the wanton way of youth. She knew her distance and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint, As all impediments in fancys course Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace, Subdued me to her rate; she got the ring, And I had that which any inferior might At market-price have bought. I must be patient; You, that have turnd off a first so noble wife, May justly diet me. I pray you yet, Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband, Send for your ring; I will return it home, And give me mine again. I have it not. What ring was yours, I pray you? Sir, much like The same upon your finger. Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
And this was it I gave him, being a-bed. The story then goes false you threw it him Out of a casement. I have spoke the truth. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers. You boggle shrewdly, every feather starts you. Is this the man you speak of? Ay, my lord. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you, Not fearing the displeasure of your master, Which, on your just proceeding Ill keep off, By him and by this woman here what know you? So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman? Faith, sir, he did love her; but how? How, I pray you? He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. How is that? He loved her, sir, and loved her not. As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this! I am a poor man, and at your majestys command. He is a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. Do you know he promised me marriage? Faith, I know more than Ill speak. But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest? Yes, so please your majesty.
I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for, indeed, he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time, that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of: therefore I will not speak what I know. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours? Ay, my good lord. Where did you buy it? or who gave it you? It was not given me, nor I did not buy it. Who lent it you? It was not lent me neither. Where did you find it, then? I found it not. If it were yours by none of all these ways, How could you give it him? I never gave it him. This womans an easy glove, my lord: she goes off and on at pleasure. This ring was mine: I gave it his first wife. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know. Take her away; I do not like her now. To prison with her; and away with him. Unless thou tellst me where thou hadst this ring Thou diest within this hour. Ill never tell you.
Take her away. Ill put in bail, my liege. I think thee now some common customer. By Jove, if ever I knew man, twas you. Wherefore hast thou accusd him all this while? Because hes guilty, and he is not guilty. He knows I am no maid, and hell swear tot; Ill swear I am a maid, and he knows not. Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life; I am either maid, or else this old mans wife. She does abuse our ears: to prison with her! Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me. But for this lord, Who hath abusd me, as he knows himself, Though yet he never harmd me, here I quit him: He knows himself my bed he hath defild, And at that time he got his wife with child: Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick: So theres my riddle: one thats dead is quick; And now behold the meaning. Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Ist real that I see? No, my good lord; Tis but the shadow of a wife you see; The name and not the thing. Both, both. O! pardon. O my good lord! when I was like this maid, I found you wondrous kind.
There is your ring; And, look you, heres your letter; this it says: When from my finger you can get this ring, And are by me with child, c. This is done: Will you be mine, now you are doubly won? If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, Ill love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you! O! my dear mother; do I see you living? Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so, I thank thee. Wait on me home, Ill make sport with thee: let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones. Let us from point to point this story know, To make the even truth in pleasure flow. If thou best yet a fresh uncropped flower, Choose thou thy husband, and Ill pay thy dower; For I can guess that by thy honest aid Thou keptst a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that, and all the progress, more and less, Resolvedly more leisure shall express: All yet seems well; and if it end so meet, The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. Spoken by the KING.
The kings a beggar, now the play is done: All is well ended if this suit be won That you express content; which we will pay, With strife to please you, day exceeding day: Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
If music be the food of love, play on; Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again! it had a dying fall: O! it came oer my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour. Enough! no more: Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou, That, notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soeer, But falls into abatement and low price, Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical. Will you go hunt, my lord? What, Curio? The hart. Why, so I do, the noblest that I have. O! when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purgd the air of pestilence. That instant was I turnd into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, Eer since pursue me. How now! what news from her?
So please my lord, I might not be admitted; But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk, And water once a day her chamber round With eve-offending brine: all this, to season A brothers dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance. O! she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath killd the flock of all affections else That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filld Her sweet perfections with one self king. Away before me to sweet beds of flowers; Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers. What country, friends, is this? This is Illyria, lady. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drownd: what think you sailors? It is perchance that you yourself were savd. O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you and those poor number savd with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, Courage and hope both teaching him the practice, To a strong mast that livd upon the sea; Where, like Arion on the dolphins back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see. For saying so theres gold. Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Knowst thou this country? Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born Not three hours travel from this very place. Who governs here? A noble duke, in nature as in name. What is his name? Orsino. Orsino! I have heard my father name him: He was a bachelor then. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then twas fresh in murmur,as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of, That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. Whats she? A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died: for whose dear love, They say she hath abjurd the company And sight of men. O!
that I servd that lady, And might not be deliverd to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the dukes. There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I prithee,and Ill pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. Ill serve this duke: Thou shalt present me as a eunuch to him: It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap to time I will commit; Only shape thou thy silence to my wit. Be you his eunuch, and your mute Ill be: When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see. I thank thee: lead me on. What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure cares an enemy to life. By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours. Why, let her except before excepted.
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order. Confine! Ill confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too: an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer. Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek? Ay, he. Hes as tall a man as anys in Illyria. Whats that to the purpose? Why, he has three thousand ducats a year. Ay, but hell have but a year in all these ducats: hes a very fool and a prodigal. Fie, that youll say so! he plays o the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature. He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that hes a fool, hes a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave. By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? They that add, moreover, hes drunk nightly in your company. With drinking healths to my niece.
Ill drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. Hes a coward and a coystril, that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o the toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface. Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch! Sweet Sir Andrew! Bless you, fair shrew. And you too, sir. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost. Whats that? My nieces chambermaid. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance. My name is Mary, sir. Good Mistress Mary Accost, You mistake, knight: accost is, front her, board her, woo her, assail her. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of accost? Fare you well, gentlemen. An thou let her part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again! An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand? Sir, I have not you by the hand. Marry, but you shall have; and heres my hand. Now, sir, thought is free: I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink. Wherefore, sweetheart? whats your metaphor? Its dry, sir. Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But whats your jest? A dry jest, sir. Are you full of them?
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. O knight! thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I see thee so put down? Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit. No question. An I thought that, Id forswear it. Ill ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Pourquoi, my dear knight? What is pourquoi? do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O! had I but followed the arts! Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. Why, would that have mended my hair? Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature. But it becomes me well enough, doest not? Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs, and spin it off. Faith, Ill home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece will not be seen; or if she be, its four to one shell none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her.
Shell none o the count; shell not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear it. Tut, theres life int, man. Ill stay a month longer. I am a fellow o the strangest mind i the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether. Art thou good at these kickchawses, knight? As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters: and yet I will not compare with an old man. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? Faith, I can cut a caper. And I can cut the mutton tot. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a curtain before em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress Malls picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig: I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard. Ay, tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels? What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus? Taurus! thats sides and heart.
No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent! If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours? No, believe me. I thank you. Here comes the count. Who saw Cesario? ho! On your attendance, my lord; here. Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario, Thou knowst no less but all; I have unclaspd To thee the book even of my secret soul: Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her, Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience. Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandond to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then? O! then unfold the passion of my love; Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith: It shall become thee well to act my woes; She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio of more grave aspect. I think not so, my lord.
Dear lad, believe it; For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man: Dianas lip Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is as the maidens organ, shrill and sound; And all is semblative a womans part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair. Some four or five attend him; All, if you will; for I myself am best When least in company. Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine. Ill do my best To woo your lady: yet, a barful strife! Whoeer I woo, myself would be his wife. Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence. Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours. Make that good. He shall see none to fear. A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that saying was born, of, I fear no colours. Where, good Mistress Mary? In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery. Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or, to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you? Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning away, let summer bear it out. You are resolute then? Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points. That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your gaskins fall. Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way: if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eves flesh as any in Illyria. Peace, you rogue, no more o that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best. Wit, ant be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady! Take the fool away. Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady. Go to, youre a dry fool; Ill no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest.
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing thats mended is but patched: virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beautys a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away. Sir, I bade them take away you. Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit monachum; thats as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool. Can you do it? Dexteriously, good madonna. Make your proof. I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse of virtue, answer me. Well, sir, for want of other idleness, Ill bide your proof. Good madonna, why mournest thou? Good fool, for my brothers death. I think his soul is in hell, madonna. I know his soul is in heaven, fool. The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brothers soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen. What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him: infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool. How say you to that, Malvolio? I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, hes out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools zanies. O! you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove. Now, Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools! Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you. From the Count Orsino, is it? I know not, madam: tis a fair young man, and well attended.
Who of my people hold him in delay? Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman. Fetch him off, I pray you: he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him! Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it. Thou hast spoken for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! for here comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater. By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin? A gentleman. A gentleman! what gentleman? Tis a gentleman here,a plague o these pickle herring! How now, sot! Good Sir Toby. Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy? Lechery! I defy lechery! Theres one at the gate. Ay, marry, what is he? Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I. Well, its all one. Whats a drunken man like, fool? Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him. Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o my coz; for hes in the third degree of drink, hes drowned: go, look after him.
He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman. Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick: he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep: he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? hes fortified against any denial. Tell him he shall not speak with me. Has been told so; and he says, hell stand at your door like a sheriffs post, and be the supporter to a bench, but hell speak with you. What kind o man is he? Why, of mankind. What manner of man? Of very ill manner: hell speak with you, will you or no. Of what personage and years is he? Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before tis a peascod, or a codling when tis almost an apple: tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly: one would think his mothers milk were scarce out of him. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman. Gentlewoman, my lady calls. Give me my veil: come, throw it oer my face. Well once more hear Orsinos embassy. The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will? Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage. Whence came you, sir? I can say little more than I have studied, and that questions out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. Are you a comedian? No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? If I do not usurp myself, I am. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for, what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. Come to what is important int: I forgive you the praise. Alas! I took great pains to study it, and tis poetical. It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you keep it in.
I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way. No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office. It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as full of peace as matter. Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you? The rudeness that hath appeard in me have I learnd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden-head; to your ears, divinity; to any others, profanation. Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity. Now, sir; what is your text? Most sweet lady, A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text? In Orsinos bosom. In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom? To answer by the method, in the first of his heart. O! I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
Good madam, let me see your face. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? you are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was as this present: ist not well done? Excellently done, if God did all. Tis in grain, sir; twill endure wind and weather. Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Natures own sweet and cunning hand laid on: Lady, you are tho cruellst she alive, If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy. O! sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as Item, Two lips, indifferent red; Item, Two grey eyes, with lids to them; Item, One neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me? I see you what you are: you are too proud; But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you: O! such love Could be but recompensd, though you were crownd The nonpareil of beauty. How does he love me? With adorations, with fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him; Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulgd, free, learnd, and valiant; And, in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him: He might have took his answer long ago. If I did love you in my masters flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it. Why, what would you? Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love, And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Holla your name to the reverberate hills, And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out, Olivia! O! you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me! You might do much. What is your parentage? Above my fortune, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman. Get you to your lord: I cannot love him. Let him send no more, Unless, perchance, you come to me again, To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well: I thank you for your pains: spend this for me. I am no feed post, lady; keep your purse: My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervour, like my masters, be Placd in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty. What is your parentage? Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman. Ill be sworn thou art: Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit, Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft! soft! Unless the master were the man. How now! Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youths perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be. What, ho! Malvolio! Here, madam, at your service. Run after that same peevish messenger, The countys man: he left this ring behind him, Would I, or not: tell him Ill none of it. Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes: Im not for him. If that the youth will come this way to-morrow, Ill give him reasons fort. Hie thee, Malvolio. Madam, I will. I do I know not what, and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe; What is decreed must be, and be this so! Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you? By your patience, no.
My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you. Let me yet know of you whither you are bound. No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore, it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. Alas the day! A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but, though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. O good Antonio! forgive me your trouble! If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness; and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsinos court: farewell. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsinos court, Else would I very shortly see thee there; But, come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia? Even now, sir: on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more; that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lords taking of this. Receive it so. She took the ring of me; Ill none of it.
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be so returned: if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it. I left no ring with her: what means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charmd her! She made good view of me; indeed, so much, That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lords ring! why, he sent her none. I am the man: if it be so, as tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness, Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper-false In womens waxen hearts to set their forms! Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we! For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly; And I, poor monster, fond as much on him; And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my masters love; As I am woman,now alas the day! What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe! O time! thou must untangle this, not I; It is too hard a knot for me to untie.
Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be a-bed after midnight is to be up betimes; and diluculo surgere, thou knowest, Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know, to be up late is to be up late. A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements? Faith, so they say; but, I think, it rather consists of eating and drinking. Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoup of wine! Here comes the fool, i faith. How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of we three? Welcome, ass. Now lets have a catch. By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: twas very good, i faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman: hadst it? I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolios nose is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottleale houses. Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song.
Come on; there is sixpence for you: lets have a song. Theres a testril of me too: if one knight give a Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life? A love-song, a love-song. Ay, ay; I care not for good life. O mistress mine! where are you roaming? O! stay and hear; your true loves coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further, pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise mans son doth know. Excellent good, i faith. Good, good. What is love? tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter; Whats to come is still unsure: In delay there lies no plenty; Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty, Youths a stuff will not endure. A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight. A contagious breath. Very sweet and contagious, i faith. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall we do that? An you love me, lets dot: I am dog at a catch. Byr lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well. Most certain. Let our catch be, Thou knave. Hold thy peace, thou knave, knight? I shall be constraind int to call thee knave, knight. Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins, Hold thy peace.
I shall never begin if I hold my peace. Good, i faith. Come, begin. What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me. My ladys a Cataian; we are politicians; Malvolios a Peg-a-Ramsey, and Three merry men be we. Am not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tillyvally, lady! There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady! Beshrew me, the knights in admirable fooling. Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural. O! the twelfth day of December, For the love o God, peace! My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an alehouse of my ladys house, that ye squeak out your coziers catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you? We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up! Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbours you as her kinsman, shes nothing allied to your disorders.
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell. Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone. Nay, good Sir Toby. His eyes do show his days are almost done. Ist even so? But I will never die. Sir Toby, there you lie. This is much credit to you. Shall I bid him go? What an if you do? Shall I bid him go, and spare not? O! no, no, no, no, you dare not. Out o time! Sir, ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale? Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i the mouth too. Thourt i the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria! Mistress Mary, if you prized my ladys favour at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand. Go shake your ears. Twere as good a deed as to drink when a mans a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him. Dot, knight: Ill write thee a challenge; or Ill deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night: since the youth of the counts was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him: if I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it. Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him. Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan. O! if I thought that, Id beat him like a dog. What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight? I have no exquisite reason fort, but I have reason good enough. The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass, that cons state without book, and utters it by great swarths: the best persuaded of himself; so crammed, as he thinks, with excellences, that it is his ground of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. What wilt thou do? I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated.
I can write very like my lady your niece; on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands. Excellent! I smell a device. I havet in my nose too. He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she is in love with him. My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour. And your horse now would make him an ass. Ass, I doubt not. O! twill be admirable. Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter: observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell. Good night, Penthesilea. Before me, shes a good wench. Shes a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me: what o that? I was adored once too. Lets to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out. Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i the end, call me cut. If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will. Come, come: Ill go burn some sack; tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight. Give me some music.
Now, good morrow, friends: Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times: Come; but one verse. He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. Who was it? Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the Lady Olivias father took much delight in. He is about the house. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am all true lovers are: Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is belovd. How dost thou like this tune? It gives a very echo to the seat Where love is thrond. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upont, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stayd upon some favour that it loves; Hath it not, boy? A little, by your favour. What kind of woman ist? Of your complexion. She is not worth thee, then. What years, i faith? About your years, my lord. Too old, by heaven.
Let still the woman take An elder than herself, so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husbands heart: For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than womens are. I think it well, my lord. Then, let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent; For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayd, doth fall that very hour. And so they are: alas, that they are so; To die, even when they to perfection grow! O, fellow! come, the song we had last night. Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, And the free maids that weave their thread with bones, Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love, Like the old age. Are you ready, sir? Ay; prithee, sing. Come away, come away, death, And in sad cypress let me be laid; Fly away, fly away, breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O! prepare it My part of death, no one so true Did share it. Not a flower, not a flower sweet, On my black coffin let there be strown, Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corse, where my bones shall be thrown.
A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O! where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there. Theres for thy pains. No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir. Ill pay thy pleasure then. Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another. Give me now leave to leave thee. Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal! I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere; for thats it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell. Let all the rest give place. Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty: Tell her, my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowd upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul. But if she cannot love you, sir? I cannot be so answerd. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps, there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so; must she not then be answerd?
There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart; no womans heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas! their love may be calld appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. Ay, but I know, What dost thou know? Too well what love women to men may owe: In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter lovd a man, As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. And whats her history? A blank, my lord. She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i the bud, Feed on her damask cheek: she pind in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy, She sat like Patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more; but indeed Our shows are more than will, for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love. But died thy sister of her love, my boy? I am all the daughters of my fathers house, And all the brothers too; and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady?
Ay, thats the theme. To her in haste; give her this jewel; say My love can give no place, bide no denay. Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. Nay, Ill come: if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? I would exult, man: you know he brought me out o favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here. To anger him well have the bear again; and we will fool him black and blue; shall we not, Sir Andrew? An we do not, it is pity of our lives. Here comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India! Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolios coming down this walk: he has been yonder i the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half-hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there: for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling. Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think ont?
Heres an over-weening rogue! O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes! Slight, I could so beat the rogue! Peace! I say. To be Count Malvolio! Ah, rogue! Pistol him, pistol him. Peace! peace! There is example fort: the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe. Fie on him, Jezebel! O, peace! now hes deeply in; look how imagination blows him. Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state, O! for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye! Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come from a daybed, where I have left Olivia sleeping, Fire and brimstone! O, peace! peace! And then to have the humour of state: and after a demure travel of regard, telling them I know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby, Bolts and shackles! O, peace, peace, peace! now, now. Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while; and perchance wind up my watch, or play with mysome rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me, Shall this fellow live? Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace! I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control, And does not Toby take you a blow o the lips then?
Saying, Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech, What, what? You must amend your drunkenness. Out, scab! Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot. Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight, Thats me, I warrant you. One Sir Andrew, I knew twas I; for many do call me fool. What employment have we here? Now is the woodcock near the gin. O, peace! and the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him! By my life, this is my ladys hand! these be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts; and thus makes she her great Ps. It is, in contempt of question, her hand. Her Cs, her Us, and her Ts: why that To the unknown beloved, this and my good wishes: her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: tis my lady. To whom should this be? This wins him, liver and all. Jove knows I love; But who? Lips, do not move No man must know. No man must know. What follows? the numbers altered! No man must know: if this should be thee, Malvolio! Marry, hang thee, brock!
I may command where I adore; But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life. A fustian riddle! Excellent wench, say I. M, O, A, I, doth sway my life. Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see. What dish o poison has she dressed him! And with what wing the staniel checks at it! I may command where I adore. Why, she may command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no obstruction in this. And the end, what should that alphabetical position portend? if I could make that resemble something in me,Softly!M, O, A, I, O! ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent. Sowter will cry upon t, for all this, though it be as rank as a fox. M, Malvolio; M, why, that begins my name. Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is excellent at faults. M,But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under probation: A should follow, but O does. And O shall end, I hope. Ay, or Ill cudgel him, and make him cry, O! And then I comes behind. Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.
M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former; and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft! here follows prose. If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough, and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortunes fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee. THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY. Daylight and champian discovers not more: this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and, with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript. Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee. Jove, I thank thee. I will smile: I will do everything that thou wilt have me. I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy. I could marry this wench for this device. So could I too. And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest. Nor I neither. Here comes my noble gull-catcher. Wilt thou set thy foot o my neck? Or o mine either? Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave? I faith, or I either? Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
Nay, but say true; does it work upon him? Like aqua-vit with a midwife. If you will, then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady; he will come to her in yellow stockings, and tis a colour she abhors; and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me. To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit! Ill make one too. Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor? No, sir, I live by the church. Art thou a churchman? No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church. So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church. You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward! Nay, thats certain: they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton. I would therefore my sister had had no name, sir. Why, man?
Why, sir, her names a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them. Thy reason, man? Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them. I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing. Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible. Art not thou the Lady Olivias fool? No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herringsthe husbands the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words. I saw thee late at the Count Orsinos. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there. Nay, an thou pass upon me, Ill no more with thee. Hold, theres sixpence for thee. Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
By my troth, Ill tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within? Would not a pair of these have bred, sir? Yes, being kept together and put to use. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus. I understand you, sir; tis well beggd. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin; I might say element, but the word is overworn. This fellows wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit: He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And, like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice As full of labour as a wise mans art; For folly that he wisely shows is fit; But wise men folly-falln, quite taint their wit. Save you, gentleman. And you, sir. Dieu vous garde, monsieur. Et vous aussi; votre serviteur. I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours. Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
I am bound to your niece, sir: I mean, she is the list of my voyage. Taste your legs, sir: put them to motion. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs. I mean, to go, sir, to enter. I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented. Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you! That youths a rare courtier. Rain odours! well. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear. Odours, pregnant, and vouchsafed. Ill get em all three all ready. Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing. Give me your hand, sir. My duty, madam, and most humble service. What is your name? Cesario is your servants name, fair princess. My servant, sir! Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was calld compliment. Youre servant to the Count Orsino, youth. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours: Your servants servant is your servant, madam. For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blanks rather than filld with me! Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf. O! by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him: But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.
Dear lady, Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you: Under your hard construction must I sit, To force that on you, in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours: what might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake, And baited it with all th unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom, Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak. I pity you. Thats a degree to love. No, not a grize; for tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies. Why, then methinks tis time to smile again. O world! how apt the poor are to be proud. If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you: And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man: There lies your way, due west. Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! Youll nothing, madam, to my lord by me? Stay: I prithee, tell me what thou thinkst of me. That you do think you are not what you are.
If I think so, I think the same of you. Then think you right: I am not what I am. I would you were as I would have you be! Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool. O! what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip. A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid; loves night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing, I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause; But rather reason thus with reason fetter, Love sought is good, but givn unsought is better. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam: never more Will I my masters tears to you deplore. Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love. No, faith, Ill not stay a jot longer. Thy reason, dear venom; give thy reason. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the counts serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me; I sawt i the orchard. Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that. As plain as I see you now. This was a great argument of love in her toward you. Slight! will you make an ass o me? I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason. And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor. She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, firenew from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchmans beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy. Ant be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour: challenge me the counts youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valour. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him? Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent, and full of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink: if thou thoust him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set em down: go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it. Where shall I find you? Well call thee at the cubiculo: go. This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby. I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so. We shall have a rare letter from him; but youll not deliver it. Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.
For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, Ill eat the rest of the anatomy. And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty. Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. Hes in yellow stockings. And cross-gartered? Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school i the church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his face into more lines than are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as tis; I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do, hell smile and taket for a great favour. Come, bring us, bring us where he is. I would not by my will have troubled you; But since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you.
I could not stay behind you: my desire, More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth; And not all love to see you,though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable: my willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit. My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks; for oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay: But, were my worth, as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing. Whats to do? Shall we go see the reliques of this town? To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging. I am not weary, and tis long to night: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city. Would youd pardon me; I do not without danger walk these streets: Once, in a sea-fight gainst the Count his galleys, I did some service; of such note indeed, That were I taen here it would scarce be answerd. Belike you slew great number of his people? The offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument.
It might have since been answerd in repaying What we took from them; which, for traffics sake, Most of our city did: only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. Do not then walk too open. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir; heres my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet, Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town: there shall you have me. Why I your purse? Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. Ill be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour. To the Elephant. I do remember. I have sent after him: he says hell come; How shall I feast him? what bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than beggd or borrowd. I speak too loud. Where is Malvolio? he is sad, and civil, And suits well for a servant with my fortunes: Where is Malvolio? Hes coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is sure possessd, madam. Why, whats the matter? does he rave? No, madam; he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted ins wits. Go call him hither.
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be. How now, Malvolio! Sweet lady, ho, ho. Smilst thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this crossgartering; but what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, Please one and please all. Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee? Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? To bed! ay, sweetheart; and Ill come to thee. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft? How do you, Malvolio? At your request! Yes; nightingales answer daws. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? Be not afraid of greatness: Twas well writ. What meanest thou by that, Malvolio? Some are born great, Ha! Some achieve greatness, What sayst thou? And some have greatness thrust upon them. Heaven restore thee! Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, Thy yellow stockings! And wished to see thee cross-gartered. Cross-gartered! Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so, Am I made? If not, let me see thee a servant still. Why, this is very midsummer madness.
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsinos is returned. I could hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyships pleasure. Ill come to him. Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Wheres my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. Oh, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. Cast thy humble slough, says she; be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity; and consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is Joves doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, Let this fellow be looked to; fellow! not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but fellow. Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstanceWhat can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes.
Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked. Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils in hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessd him, yet Ill speak to him. Here he is, here he is. How ist with you, sir? how ist with you, man? Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private; go off. Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him. Ah, ha! does she so? Go to, go to: peace! peace! we must deal gently with him; let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how ist with you? What, man! defy the devil: consider, hes an enemy to mankind. Do you know what you say? La you! an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart. Pray God, he be not bewitched! Carry his water to the wise-woman. Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than Ill say. How now, mistress! O Lord! Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you move him? let me alone with him. No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used. Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck? Sir!
Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang him, foul collier! Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray. My prayers, minx! No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness. Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter. Ist possible? If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction. His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air, and taint. Why, we shall make him mad indeed. The house will be the quieter. Come, well have him in a dark room, and bound. My niece is already in the belief that hes mad: we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see. More matter for a May morning. Heres the challenge; read it: I warrant theres vinegar and pepper int. Ist so saucy? Ay, ist, I warrant him: do but read. Give me. Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow. Good, and valiant.
Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason fort, A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law. Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for. Very brief, and to exceeding good senseless. I will waylay thee going home; where, if it be thy chance to kill me, Good. Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain. Still you keep o the windy side of the law: good. Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better; and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy, If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. Ill givet him. You may have very fit occasion for fort: he is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and, as thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away! Nay, let me alone for swearing. Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman,as I know his youth will aptly receive it,into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices. Here he comes with your niece: give them way till he take leave, and presently after him. I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.
I have said too much unto a heart of stone, And laid mine honour too unchary out: Theres something in me that reproves my fault, But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof. With the same haviour that your passion bears Goes on my masters griefs. Here; wear this jewel for me, tis my picture; Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you; And I beseech you come again to-morrow. What shall you ask of me that Ill deny, That honour savd may upon asking give? Nothing but this; your true love for my master. How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you? I will acquit you. Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well: A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell. Gentleman, God save thee. And you, sir. That defence thou hast, betake thee tot: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly. You mistake, sir: I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.
Youll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal. I pray you, sir, what is he? He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word: givet or taket. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady: I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk. Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury: therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, thats certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. This is as uncivil as strange.
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose. I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return. Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter? I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more. I beseech you, what manner of man is he? Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can. I shall be much bound to you fort: I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of my mettle. Why, man, hes a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy. Pox ont, Ill not meddle with him.
Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder. Plague ont; an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence Id have seen him damned ere Id have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and Ill give him my horse, grey Capilet. Ill make the motion. Stand here; make a good show ont: this shall end without the perdition of souls. Marry, Ill ride your horse as well as I ride you. I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youths a devil. He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels. Theres no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for his oaths sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vow: he protests he will not hurt you. Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man. Give ground, if you see him furious. Come, Sir Andrew, theres no remedy: the gentleman will, for his honours sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; tot. Pray God, he keep his oath!
I do assure you, tis against my will. Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me: If you offend him, I for him defy you. You, sir! why, what are you? One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will. Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you. O, good sir Toby, hold! here come the officers. Ill be with you anon. Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please. Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you, Ill be as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well. This is the man; do thy office. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit Of Count Orsino. You do mistake me, sir. No, sir, no jot: I know your favour well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. Take him away: he knows I know him well. I must obey. This comes with seeking you: But theres no remedy: I shall answer it. What will you do, now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you Than what befalls myself. You stand amazd: But be of comfort. Come, sir, away. I must entreat of you some of that money. What money, sir?
For the fair kindness you have showd me here, And part, being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability Ill lend you something: my having is not much: Ill make division of my present with you. Hold, there is half my coffer. Will you deny me now? Ist possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you. I know of none; Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood. O heavens themselves! Come, sir: I pray you, go. Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here I snatchd one-half out of the jaws of death, Relievd him with such sanctity of love, And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion. Whats that to us? The time goes by: away! But O! how vile an idol proves this god. Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature theres no blemish but the mind; None can be calld deformd but the unkind: Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks oerflourishd by the devil. The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir. Lead me on.
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself; so do not I. Prove true, imagination, O, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now taen for you! Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: well whisper oer a couplet or two of most sage saws. He namd Sebastian: I my brother know Yet living in my glass; even such and so In favour was my brother; and he went Still in this fashion, colour, ornament, For him I imitate. O! if it prove, Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love! A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian. A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it. Slid, Ill after him again and beat him. Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword. An I do not, Come, lets see the event. I dare lay any money twill be nothing yet. Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you? Go to, go to; thou art a foolish fellow: Let me be clear of thee. Well held out, i faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou knowst not me. Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming? I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: Theres money for thee: if you tarry longer I shall give worse payment. By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years purchase. Now, sir, have I met you again? theres for you. Why, theres for thee, and there, and there, and there! Are all the people mad? Hold, sir, or Ill throw your dagger oer the house. This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats for twopence. Come on, sir: hold. Nay, let him alone; Ill go another way to work with him: Ill have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet its no matter for that. Let go thy hand. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on. I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?
If thou darst tempt me further, draw thy sword. What, what! Nay then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. Hold, Toby! on thy life I charge thee, hold! Madam! Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch! Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners neer were preachd. Out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone! I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botchd up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go: Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me, He started one poor heart of mine in thee. What relish is in this? how runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream: Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep! Nay; come, I prithee. Would thoudst be ruld by me! Madam, I will. O! say so, and so be! Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do it quickly; Ill call Sir Toby the whilst.
Well, Ill put it on and I will dissemble myself int: and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student; but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter. God bless thee, Master parson. Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, That, that is, is; so I, being Master parson, am Master parson; for, what is that, but that, and is, but is? To him, Sir Topas. What ho! I say. Peace in this prison! The knave counterfeits well; a good knave. Who calls there? Sir Topas, the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic. Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady. Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies? Well said, Master Parson. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me here in hideous darkness. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayst thou that house is dark?
As hell, Sir Topas. Why, it hath bay-windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction? I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you, this house is dark. Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog. I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are: make the trial of it in any constant question. What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl? That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird. What thinkest thou of his opinion? I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion. Fare thee well: remain thou still in darkness: thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well. Sir Topas! Sir Topas! My most exquisite Sir Topas! Nay, I am for all waters. Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown: he sees thee not. To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this knavery.
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were; for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber. Hey Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does. Fool! My lady is unkind, perdy! Fool! Alas, why is she so? Fool, I say! She loves another. Who calls, ha? Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee fort. Master Malvoliol Ay, good fool. Alas, sir, how fell you beside your five wits? Fool, there was never man so notoriously abused: I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art. But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool. They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses! and do all they can to face me out of my wits. Advise you what you say: the minister is here. Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble. Sir Topas! Maintain no words with him, good fellow.Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi you, good Sir Topas. Marry, amen. I will, sir, I will. Fool, fool, fool, I say! Alas, sir, be patient.
What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to you. Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria. Well-a-day, that you were, sir! By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to my lady: it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did. I will help you tot. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit? Believe me, I am not: I tell thee true. Nay, Ill neer believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink. Fool, Ill requite it in the highest degree: I prithee, be gone. I am gone, sir, And anon, sir, Ill be with you again In a trice, Like to the old Vice, Your need to sustain; Who with dagger of lath, In his rage and his wrath, Cries, Ah, ah! to the devil: Like a mad lad, Pare thy nails, dad; Adieu, goodman drivel. This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feelt and seet; And though tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet tis not madness. Wheres Antonio then?
I could not find him at the Elephant; Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service; For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes, And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad Or else the ladys mad: yet, if twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing As I perceive she does. Theres something int That is deceivable. But here the lady comes. Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by; there, before him, And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith; That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say? Ill follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine! Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter. Good Master Fabian, grant me another request. Anything. Do not desire to see this letter. This is, to give a dog, and, in recompense desire my dog again. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends? Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings. I know thee well: how dost thou, my good fellow? Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends. Just the contrary; the better for thy friends. No, sir, the worse. How can that be? Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me; now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused: so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends and the better for my foes. Why, this is excellent. By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends. Thou shalt not be the worse for me: theres gold. But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another. O, you give me ill counsel.
Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it. Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: theres another. Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three. You can fool no more money out of me at this throw: if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness; but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon. Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me. That face of his I do remember well; Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeard As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A bawbling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and hulk unprizable; With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honour on him. Whats the matter?
Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the Phnix and her fraught from Candy; And this is he that did the Tiger board, When your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In private brabble did we apprehend him. He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side; But in conclusion put strange speech upon me: I know not what twas but distraction. Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief! What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies? Orsino, noble sir, Be pleasd that I shake off these names you give me: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsinos enemy.
A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingrateful boy there by your side, From the rude seas enragd and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was: His life I gave him, and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication; for his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset: Where being apprehended, his false cunning, Not meaning to partake with me in danger, Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink, denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before. How can this be? When came he to this town? To-day, my lord; and for three months before, No interim, not a minutes vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company. Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth! But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness: Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. Madam! Gracious Olivia. What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord, My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. Still so cruel? Still so constant, lord. What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfullst offerings hath breathd out That eer devotion tenderd! What shall I do? Even what it please my lord, that shall become him. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love? a savage jealousy That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour, Live you, the marble-breasted tyrant still; But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye, Where he sits crowned in his masters spite. Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief; Ill sacrifice the lamb that I do love, To spite a ravens heart within a dove. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die. Where goes Cesario? After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than eer I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love! Ah me, detested! how am I beguild! Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong? Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long? Call forth the holy father. Come away. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay. Husband? Ay, husband: can he that deny? Her husband, sirrah? No, my lord, not I. Alas! it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up; Be that thou knowst thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fearst. O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold,though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before tis ripe,what thou dost know Hath newly passd between this youth and me. A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmd by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthend by interchangement of your rings; And all the ceremony of this compact Seald in my function, by my testimony: Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have travelld but two hours. O, thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be When time hath sowd a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. My lord, I do protest, O! do not swear: Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear. For the love of God, a surgeon! send one presently to Sir Toby. Whats the matter? He has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? The counts gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for a coward, but hes the very devil incardinate. My gentleman, Cesario? Ods lifelings! here he is. You broke my head for nothing! and that that I did, I was set on to dot by Sir Toby. Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you: You drew your sword upon me without cause; But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not. If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more: but if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did. How now, gentleman! how ist with you? Thats all one: he has hurt me, and theres the end ont. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot? O!
hes drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone: his eyes were set at eight i the morning. Then hes a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue. Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them? Ill help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together. Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull! Get him to bed, and let his hurt be lookd to. I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman; But, had it been the brother of my blood, I must have done no less with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you: Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago. One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons; A natural perspective, that is, and is not! Antonio! O my dear Antonio! How have the hours rackd and torturd me Since I have lost thee! Sebastian are you? Fearst thou that, Antonio? How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian? Most wonderful! Do I stand there? I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature, Of here and every where. I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devourd. Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman? what name? what parentage? Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us. A spirit I am indeed; But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, And say, Thrice welcome, drowned Viola! My father had a mole upon his brow. And so had mine. And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numberd thirteen years. O! that record is lively in my soul. He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years. If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurpd attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola: which to confirm, Ill bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds: by whose gentle help I was preservd to serve this noble count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord. So comes it, lady, you have been mistook: But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceivd, You are betrothd both to a maid and man. Be not amazd; right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wrack. Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me. And all those sayings will I over-swear, And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night. Give me thy hand; And let me see thee in thy womans weeds. The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maids garments: he upon some action Is now in durance at Malvolios suit, A gentleman and follower of my ladys. He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither. And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, hes much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banishd his. How does he, sirrah? Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves end as well as a man in his case may do. He has here writ a letter to you: I should have given it to you to-day morning; but as a madmans epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered. Open it, and read it.
Look then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the madman. By the Lord, madam, How now! art thou mad? No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox. Prithee, read i thy right wits. So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear. Read it you, sirrah. By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it: though you have put me into darkness, and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury. THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO. Did he write this? Ay, madam. This savours not much of distraction. See him deliverd, Fabian; bring him hither. My lord, so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown the alliance ont, so please you, Here at my house and at my proper cost. Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
Your master quits you; and, for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding; And since you calld me master for so long, Here is my hand: you shall from this time be Your masters mistress. A sister! you are she. Is this the madman? Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio! Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong. Have I, Malvolio? no. Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand: Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase, Or say tis not your seal nor your invention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then, And tell me, in the modesty of honour, Why you have given me such clear lights of favour, Bade me come smiling and cross-garterd to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people; And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you sufferd me to be imprisond, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That eer invention playd on? tell me why. Alas!
Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character; But, out of question, tis Marias hand: And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then camst in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposd Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content: This practice hath most shrewdly passd upon thee; But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonderd at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceivd against him. Maria writ The letter at Sir Tobys great importance; In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was followd, May rather pluck on laughter than revenge, If that the injuries be justly weighd That have on both sides past. Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee! Why, some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them. I was one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but thats all one. By the Lord, fool, I am not mad: But do you remember? Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal?
an you smile not, hes gagged: and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges. Ill be revengd on the whole pack of you. He hath been most notoriously abusd. Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace; He hath not told us of the captain yet: When that is known and golden time convents, A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario, come; For so you shall be, while you are a man; But when in other habits you are seen, Orsinos mistress, and his fancys queen. When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to mans estate, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gates, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; With toss-pots still had drunken heads, For the rain it raineth every day.
A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; But thats all one, our play is done, And well strive to please you every day.
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus: Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits. Weret not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honourd love, I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than, living dully sluggardizd at home, Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness. But since thou lovst, love still, and thrive therein, Even as I would when I to love begin. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu! Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel: Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger, If ever danger do environ thee, Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers, For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine. And on a love-book pray for my success? Upon some book I love Ill pray for thee. Thats on some shallow story of deep love, How young Leander crossd the Hellespont. Thats a deep story of a deeper love; For he was more than over shoes in love. Tis true; for you are over boots in love, And yet you never swum the Hellespont. Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots. No, I will not, for it boots thee not. What?
To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans; Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moments mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights: If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain; If lost, why then a grievous labour won: However, but a folly bought with wit, Or else a wit by folly vanquished. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool. So, by your circumstance, I fear youll prove. Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love. Love is your master, for he masters you; And he that is so yoked by a fool, Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise. Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells, so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all. And writers say, as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow, Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud, Losing his verdure even in the prime, And all the fair effects of future hopes. But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee That art a votary to fond desire? Once more adieu! my father at the road Expects my coming, there to see me shippd. And thither will I bring thee, Valentine. Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love, and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend; And I likewise will visit thee with mine. All happiness bechance to thee in Milan! As much to you at home! and so, farewell. He after honour hunts, I after love: He leaves his friends to dignify them more; I leave myself, my friends and all, for love. Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosd me; Made me neglect my studies, lose my time, War with good counsel, set the world at nought; Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master? But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan. Twenty to one, then, he is shippd already, And I have playd the sheep, in losing him. Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray, An if the shepherd be a while away. You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, and I a sheep? I do. Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep. This proves me still a sheep. True, and thy master a shepherd. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance. It shall go hard but Ill prove it by another.
The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep. Such another proof will make me cry baa. But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia? Ay, sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton; and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour. Heres too small a pasture for such store of muttons. If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her. Nay, in that you are astray; twere best pound you. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter. You mistake: I mean the pound,a pinfold. From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over, Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover. But what said she? Did she nod? Ay. Nod, ay? why, thats noddy. You mistook, sir: I say she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod; and I say, Ay. And that set together isnoddy. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you. Why, sir, how do you bear with me? Marry, sir, the letter very orderly; having nothing but the word noddy for my pains. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse. Come, come; open the matter in brief: what said she? Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered. Well, sir, here is for your pains What said she? Truly, sir, I think youll hardly win her. Why? couldst thou perceive so much from her? Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear shell prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for shes as hard as steel. What! said she nothing? No, not so much as Take this for thy pains. To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, Ill commend you to my master. Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack; Which cannot perish, having thee aboard, Being destind to a drier death on shore. I must go send some better messenger: I fear my Julia would not deign my lines, Receiving them from such a worthless post.
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone, Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love? Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me, In thy opinion which is worthiest love? Please you repeat their names, Ill show my mind According to my shallow simple skill. What thinkst thou of the fair Sir Eglamour? As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine; But, were I you, he never should be mine. What thinkst thou of the rich Mercatio? Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so. What thinkst thou of the gentle Proteus? Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us! How now! what means this passion at his name? Pardon, dear madam; tis a passing shame That I, unworthy body as I am, Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest? Then thus,of many good I think him best. Your reason? I have no other but a womans reason: I think him so because I think him so. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him? Ay, if you thought your love not cast away. Why, he, of all the rest hath never movd me. Yet he of all the rest, I think, best loves ye. His little speaking shows his love but small. Fire thats closest kept burns most of all. They do not love that do not show their love. O!
they love least that let men know their love. I would I knew his mind. Peruse this paper, madam. To Julia.Say from whom? That the contents will show. Say, say, who gave it thee? Sir Valentines page, and sent, I think, from Proteus. He would have given it you, but I, being in the way, Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker! Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines? To whisper and conspire against my youth? Now, trust me, tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place. There, take the paper: see it be returnd; Or else return no more into my sight. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate. Will ye be gone? That you may ruminate. And yet I would I had oerlookd the letter. It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her. What fool is she, that knows I am a maid, And would not force the letter to my view! Since maids, in modesty, say No to that Which they would have the profferer construe Ay. Fie, fie! how wayward is this foolish love That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
How churlishly I child Lucetta hence, When willingly I would have had her here: How angerly I taught my brow to frown, When inward joy enforcd my heart to smile. My penance is, to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past. What ho! Lucetta! What would your ladyship? Is it near dinner-time? I would it were; That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid. What ist that you took up so gingerly? Nothing. Why didst thou stoop, then? To take a paper up That I let fall. And is that paper nothing? Nothing concerning me. Then let it lie for those that it concerns. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns, Unless it have a false interpreter. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rime. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune: Give me a note: your ladyship can set. As little by such toys as may be possible; Best sing it to the tune of Light o Love. It is too heavy for so light a tune. Heavy! belike it hath some burden, then? Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it. And why not you? I cannot reach so high. Lets see your song. How now, minion! Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out: And yet methinks, I do not like this tune. You do not? No, madam; it is too sharp.
You, minion, are too saucy. Nay, now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant: There wanteth but a mean to fill your song. The mean is drownd with your unruly bass. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me. Here is a coil with protestation! Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie: You would be fingering them, to anger me. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleasd To be so angerd with another letter. Nay, would I were so angerd with the same! O hateful hands, to tear such loving words! Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings! Ill kiss each several paper for amends. Look, here is writ kind Julia: unkind Julia! As in revenge of thy ingratitude, I throw thy name against the bruising stones, Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain. And here is writ love-wounded Proteus: Poor wounded name! my bosom, as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heald; And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was Proteus written down: Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter, Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged, fearful hanging rock, And throw it thence into the raging sea! Lo! here in one line is his name twice writ, Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus, To the sweet Julia:that Ill tear away; And yet I will not, sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names: Thus will I fold them one upon another: Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will. Madam, Dinner is ready, and your father stays. Well, let us go. What! shall these papers he like tell-tales here? If you respect them, best to take them up. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down; Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold. I see you have a months mind to them. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see; I see things too, although you judge I wink. Come, come; willt please you go? Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister? Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son. Why, what of him?
He wonderd that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home, While other men, of slender reputation, Put forth their sons to seek preferment out: Some to the wars, to try their fortune there; Some to discover islands far away; Some to the studious universities. For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet, And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home, Which would be great impeachment to his age, In having known to travel in his youth. Nor needst thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering. I have considerd well his loss of time, And how he cannot be a perfect man, Not being tried and tutord in the world: Experience is by industry achievd And perfected by the swift course of time. Then tell me, whither were I best to send him? I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion, youthful Valentine, Attends the emperor in his royal court. I know it well. Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither: There shall be practise tilts and tournaments, Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen, And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth. I like thy counsel, well hast thou advisd: And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it The execution of it shall make known.
Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the emperors court. To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem, Are journeying to salute the emperor And to commend their service to his will. Good company; with them shall Proteus go: And in good time:now will we break with him. Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life! Here is her hand, the agent of her heart; Here is her oath for love, her honours pawn. O! that our fathers would applaud our loves, To seal our happiness with their consents! O heavenly Julia! How now! what letter are you reading there? Mayt please your lordship, tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine, Deliverd by a friend that came from him. Lend me the letter; let me see what news. There is no news, my lord; but that he writes How happily he lives, how well belovd And daily graced by the emperor; Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune. And how stand you affected to his wish? As one relying on your lordships will And not depending on his friendly wish. My will is something sorted with his wish. Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed; For what I will, I will, and there an end.
I am resolvd that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the emperors court: What maintenance he from his friends receives, Like exhibition thou shalt have from me. To-morrow be in readiness to go: Excuse it not, for I am peremptory. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided: Please you, deliberate a day or two. Look, what thou wantst shall be sent after thee: No more of stay; to-morrow thou must go. Come on, Panthino: you shall be employd To hasten on his expedition. Thus have I shunnd the fire for fear of burning, And drenchd me in the sea, where I am drownd. I feard to show my father Julias letter, Lest he should take exceptions to my love; And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love. O! how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day, Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by and by a cloud takes all away! Sir Proteus, your father calls for you: He is in haste; therefore, I pray you, go. Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto, And yet a thousand times it answers, no. Sir, your glove. Not mine; my gloves are on. Why, then this may be yours, for this is but one. Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, its mine; Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine! Ah Silvia! Silvia! Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
How now, sirrah? She is not within hearing, sir. Why, sir, who bade you call her? Your worship, sir; or else I mistook. Well, youll still be too forward. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow. Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Silvia? She that your worship loves? Why, how know you that I am in love? Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master. Are all these things perceived in me? They are all perceived without ye. Without me? they cannot. Without you?
nay, thats certain; for, without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady. But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia? She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper? Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean. Why, sir, I know her not. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not? Is she not hard-favoured, sir? Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured. Sir, I know that well enough. What dost thou know? That she is not so fair, as, of you, well-favoured. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite. Thats because the one is painted and the other out of all count. How painted? and how out of count? Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty. How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty. You never saw her since she was deformed. How long hath she been deformed? Ever since you loved her. I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful. If you love her you cannot see her. Why? Because Love is blind. O!
that you had mine eyes; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered! What should I see then? Your own present folly and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose. Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours. In conclusion, I stand affected to her. I would you were set, so your affection would cease. Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves. And have you? I have. Are they not lamely writ? No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace! here she comes. O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet! now will he interpret to her. Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows. O! give ye good even: heres a million of manners. Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand. He should give her interest, and she gives it him. As you enjoind me, I have writ your letter Unto the secret nameless friend of yours; Which I was much unwilling to proceed in But for my duty to your ladyship. I thank you, gentle servant.
Tis very clerkly done. Now, trust me, madam, it came hardly off; For, being ignorant to whom it goes I writ at random, very doubtfully. Perchance you think too much of so much pains? No, madam; so it stead you, I will write, Please you command, a thousand times as much. And yet A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel; And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not; And yet take this again; and yet I thank you, Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more. And yet you will; and yet another yet. What means your ladyship? do you not like it? Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ, But since unwillingly, take them again: Nay, take them. Madam, they are for you. Ay, ay; you writ them, sir, at my request, But I will none of them; they are for you. I would have had them writ more movingly. Please you, Ill write your ladyship another. And when its writ, for my sake read it over: And if it please you, so; if not, why, so. If it please me, madam, what then? Why, if it please you, take it for your labour: And so, good morrow, servant. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible, As a nose on a mans face, or a weathercock on a steeple! My master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor, He being her pupil, to become her tutor. O excellent device!
was there ever heard a better, That my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter? How now, sir! what are you reasoning with yourself? Nay, I was riming: tis you that have the reason. To do what? To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia. To whom? To yourself. Why, she wooes you by a figure. What figure? By a letter, I should say. Why, she hath not writ to me? What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest? No, believe me. No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest? She gave me none, except an angry word. Why, she hath given you a letter. Thats the letter I writ to her friend. And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end. I would it were no worse. Ill warrant you, tis as well: For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty, Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply; Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover, Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover. All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you, sir? tis dinner-time. I have dined.
Ay, but hearken, sir: though the chameleon Love can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat. O! be not like your mistress: be moved, be moved. Have patience, gentle Julia. I must, where is no remedy. When possibly I can, I will return. If you turn not, you will return the sooner. Keep this remembrance for thy Julias sake. Why, then, well make exchange: here, take you this. And seal the bargain with a holy kiss. Here is my hand for my true constancy; And when that hour oerslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake, The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my loves forgetfulness! My father stays my coming; answer not. The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears; That tide will stay me longer than I should. Julia, farewell. What! gone without a word? Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak; For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it. Sir Proteus, you are stayd for. Go; I come, I come. Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb. Nay, twill be this hour ere I have done weeping: all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have received my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the imperials court.
I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog; a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting: why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, Ill show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither:yes, it is so; it is so; it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in, is my mother, and this my father. A vengeance ont! there tis: now, sir, this staff is my sister; for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog; no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog,O! the dog is me, and I am myself: ay, so, so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing; now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on.
Now come I to my mother;O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there tis; heres my mothers breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes: Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears. Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. Whats the matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! youll lose the tide if you tarry any longer. It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied. Whats the unkindest tide? Why, he thats tied here, Crab, my dog. Tut, man, I mean thoult lose the flood; and, in losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy master; and, in losing thy master, lose thy service; and, in losing thy service,Why dost thou stop my mouth? For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue. Where should I lose my tongue? In thy tale. In thy tail! Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs. Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
Sir, call me what thou darest. Wilt thou go? Well, I will go. Servant! Mistress? Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you. Ay, boy, its for love. Not of you. Of my mistress, then. Twere good you knockd him. Servant, you are sad. Indeed, madam, I seem so. Seem you that you are not? Haply I do. So do counterfeits. So do you. What seem I that I am not? Wise. What instance of the contrary? Your folly. And how quote you my folly? I quote it in your jerkin. My jerkin is a doublet. Well, then, Ill double your folly. How? What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour? Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon. That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air. You have said, sir. Ay, sir, and done too, for this time. I know it well, sir: you always end ere you begin. A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off. Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver. Who is that, servant? Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyships looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company. Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.
I know it well, sir: you have an exchequer of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words. No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father. Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset. Sir Valentine, your fathers in good health: What say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news? My lord, I will be thankful To any happy messenger from thence. Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman? Ay, my good lord; I know the gentleman To be of worth and worthy estimation, And not without desert so well reputed. Hath he not a son? Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves The honour and regard of such a father. You know him well?
I know him as myself; for from our infancy We have conversd and spent our hours together: And though myself have been an idle truant, Omitting the sweet benefit of time To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection, Yet hath Sir Proteus,for thats his name, Made use and fair advantage of his days: His years but young, but his experience old; His head unmellowd, but his judgment ripe; And, in a word,for far behind his worth Come all the praises that I now bestow, He is complete in feature and in mind With all good grace to grace a gentleman. Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good, He is as worthy for an empress love As meet to be an emperors counsellor. Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me With commendation from great potentates; And here he means to spend his time awhile: I think, tis no unwelcome news to you. Should I have wishd a thing, it had been he. Welcome him then according to his worth. Silvia, I speak to you; and you, Sir Thurio: For Valentine, I need not cite him to it. Ill send him hither to you presently. This is the gentleman I told your ladyship Had come along with me, but that his mistress Did hold his eyes lockd in her crystal looks. Belike that now she hath enfranchisd them Upon some other pawn for fealty. Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind, How could he see his way to seek out you? Why, lady, Love hath twenty pairs of eyes. They say that Love hath not an eye at all. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself: Upon a homely object Love can wink. Have done, have done. Here comes the gentleman. Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you, Confirm his welcome with some special favour. His worth is warrant for his welcome hither, If this be he you oft have wishd to hear from. Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship. Too low a mistress for so high a servant. Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant To have a look of such a worthy mistress. Leave off discourse of disability: Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant. My duty will I boast of, nothing else. And duty never yet did want his meed. Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress. Ill die on him that says so but yourself. That you are welcome? That you are worthless. Madam, my lord your father would speak with you. I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio, Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome: Ill leave you to confer of home-affairs; When you have done, we look to hear from you. Well both attend upon your ladyship. Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
Your friends are well and have them much commended. And how do yours? I left them all in health. How does your lady and how thrives your love? My tales of love were wont to weary you; I know you joy not in a love-discourse. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alterd now: I have done penance for contemning love; Whose high imperious thoughts have punishd me With bitter fasts, with penitential groans, With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs; For, in revenge of my contempt of love, Love hath chasd sleep from my enthralled eyes, And made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow. O, gentle Proteus! Loves a mighty lord, And hath so humbled me as I confess, There is no woe to his correction, Nor to his service no such joy on earth. Now no discourse, except it be of love; Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep, Upon the very naked name of love. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye. Was this the idol that you worship so? Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint? No; but she is an earthly paragon. Call her divine. I will not flatter her. O! flatter me, for love delights in praises. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills, And I must minister the like to you.
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine, Yet let her be a principality, Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth. Except my mistress. Sweet, except not any, Except thou wilt except against my love. Have I not reason to prefer mine own? And I will help thee to prefer her too: She shall be dignified with this high honour, To bear my ladys train, lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss, And, of so great a favour growing proud, Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower, And make rough winter everlastingly. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this? Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing. She is alone. Then, let her alone. Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own, And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl, The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold. Forgive me that I do not dream on thee, Because thou seest me dote upon my love. My foolish rival, that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge, Is gone with her along, and I must after, For love, thou knowst, is full of jealousy. But she loves you?
Ay, and we are betrothd: nay, more, our marriage-hour, With all the cunning manner of our flight, Determind of: how I must climb her window, The ladder made of cords, and all the means Plotted and greed on for my happiness. Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber, In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel. Go on before, I shall inquire you forth: I must unto the road, to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use, And then Ill presently attend you. Will you make haste? I will. Even as one heat another heat expels, Or as one nail by strength drives out another, So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten. Is it mine eye, or Valentinus praise, Her true perfection, or my false transgression, That makes me reasonless to reason thus? Shes fair; and so is Julia that I love, That I did love, for now my love is thawd, Which, like a waxen image gainst a fire, Bears no impression of the thing it was. Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold, And that I love him not as I was wont: O! but I love his lady too-too much; And thats the reason I love him so little. How shall I dote on her with more advice, That thus without advice begin to love her?
Tis but her picture I have yet beheld, And that hath dazzled my reasons light; But when I look on her perfections, There is no reason but I shall be blind. If I can check my erring love, I will; If not, to compass her Ill use my skill. Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan! Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged; nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say, Welcome! Come on, you madcap, Ill to the alehouse with you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia? Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest. But shall she marry him? No. How then? Shall he marry her? No, neither. What, are they broken? No, they are both as whole as a fish. Why then, how stands the matter with them? Marry, thus; when it stands well with him, it stands well with her. What an ass art thou! I understand thee not. What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My staff understands me. What thou sayest? Ay, and what I do too: look thee, Ill but lean, and my staff understands me. It stands under thee, indeed. Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
But tell me true, willt be a match? Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will. The conclusion is, then, that it will. Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable. Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest thou, that my master is become a notable lover? I never knew him otherwise. Than how? A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be. Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me. Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master. I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover. Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse so; if not, thou art a Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian. Why? Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go? At thy service.
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn; To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn; To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn; And even that power which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury: Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear. O sweet-suggesting Love! if thou hast sinnd, Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it. At first I did adore a twinkling star, But now I worship a celestial sun. Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken; And he wants wit that wants resolved will To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better. Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad, Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths. I cannot leave to love, and yet I do; But there I leave to love where I should love. Julia I lose and Valentine I lose: If I keep them, I needs must lose myself; If I lose them, thus find I by their loss, For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia. I to myself am dearer than a friend, For love is still most precious in itself; And Silviawitness heaven that made her fair! Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope. I will forget that Julia is alive, Remembering that my love to her is dead; And Valentine Ill hold an enemy, Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
I cannot now prove constant to myself Without some treachery usd to Valentine: This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Silvias chamber-window, Myself in counsel, his competitor. Now presently, Ill give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight; Who, all enragd, will banish Valentine; For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter; But, Valentine being gone, Ill quickly cross, By some sly trick blunt Thurios dull proceeding. Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift, As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift! Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me: And een in kind love I do conjure thee, Who art the table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly characterd and engravd, To lesson me and tell me some good mean How, with my honour, I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus. Alas! the way is wearisome and long. A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps; Much less shall she that hath Loves wings to fly, And when the flight is made to one so dear, Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus. Better forbear till Proteus make return. O! knowst thou not his looks are my souls food? Pity the dearth that I have pined in, By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love, Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words. I do not seek to quench your loves hot fire, But qualify the fires extreme rage, Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason. The more thou dammst it up, the more it burns. The current that with gentle murmur glides, Thou knowst, being stoppd, impatiently doth rage; But when his fair course is not hindered, He makes sweet music with th enamelld stones, Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage; And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport, to the wild ocean. Then let me go and hinder not my course: Ill be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step, Till the last step have brought me to my love; And there Ill rest, as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in Elysium. But in what habit will you go along? Not like a woman; for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men. Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds As may beseem some well-reputed page. Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
No, girl; Ill knit it up in silken strings With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots: To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be. What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches? That fits as well as Tell me, good my lord, What compass will you wear your farthingale? Why, even what fashion thou best likst, Lucetta. You must needs have them with a cod-piece, madam. Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favourd. A round hose, madam, nows not worth a pin, Unless you have a cod-piece to stick pins on. Lucetta, as thou lovst me, let me have What thou thinkst meet and is most mannerly. But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey? I fear me, it will make me scandalizd. If you think so, then stay at home and go not. Nay, that I will not. Then never dream on infamy, but go. If Proteus like your journey when you come, No matter whos displeasd when you are gone. I fear me, he will scarce be pleasd withal. That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear: A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears, And instances of infinite of love Warrant me welcome to my Proteus. All these are servants to deceitful men.
Base men, that use them to so base effect; But truer stars did govern Proteus birth: His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles, His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate, His tears pure messengers sent from his heart, His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth. Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him! Now, as thou lovst me, do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth: Only deserve my love by loving him, And presently go with me to my chamber, To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey. All that is mine I leave at thy dispose, My goods, my lands, my reputation; Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence. Come, answer not, but to it presently! I am impatient of my tarriance. Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile; We have some secrets to confer about. Now tell me, Proteus, whats your will with me? My gracious lord, that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal; But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me, undeserving as I am, My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me. Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend, This night intends to steal away your daughter: Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determind to bestow her On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates; And should she thus be stoln away from you It would be much vexation to your age. Thus, for my dutys sake, I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift, Than, by concealing it, heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down, Being unprevented, to your timeless grave. Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care, Which to requite, command me while I live. This love of theirs myself have often seen, Haply, when they have judgd me fast asleep, And oftentimes have purposd to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court; But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man, A rashness that I ever yet have shunnd, I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosd to me. And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this, Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested, I nightly lodge her in an upper tower, The key whereof myself have ever kept; And thence she cannot be conveyd away. Know, noble lord, they have devisd a mean How he her chamber-window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down; For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently; Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
But, good my lord, do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at; For love of you, not hate unto my friend, Hath made me publisher of this pretence. Upon mine honour, he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this. Adieu, my lord: Sir Valentine is coming. Sir Valentine, whither away so fast? Please it your Grace, there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends, And I am going to deliver them. Be they of much import? The tenour of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court. Nay then, no matter: stay with me awhile; I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret. Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter. I know it well, my lord; and sure, the match Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter. Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
No, trust me: she is peevish, sullen, froward, Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty; Neither regarding that she is my child, Nor fearing me as if I were her father: And, may I say to thee this pride of hers, Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her; And, where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherishd by her child-like duty, I now am full resolvd to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in: Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower; For me and my possessions she esteems not. What would your Grace have me to do in this? There is a lady of Verona here, Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence: Now therefore, would I have thee to my tutor, For long agone I have forgot to court; Besides, the fashion of the time is changd, How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sun-bright eye. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words: Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a womans mind. But she did scorn a present that I sent her. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her. Send her another; never give her oer, For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown, tis not in hate of you, But rather to beget more love in you; If she do chide, tis not to have you gone; For why the fools are mad if left alone. Take no repulse, whatever she doth say; For, get you gone, she doth not mean, away! Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces; Though neer so black, say they have angels faces. That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man, If with his tongue he cannot win a woman. But she I mean is promisd by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth, And kept severely from resort of men, That no man hath access by day to her. Why then, I would resort to her by night. Ay, but the doors be lockd and keys kept safe, That no man hath recourse to her by night. What lets but one may enter at her window? Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground, And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life. Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords, To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks, Would serve to scale another Heros tower, So bold Leander would adventure it. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood, Advise me where I may have such a ladder. When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
This very night; for Love is like a child, That longs for every thing that he can come by. By seven oclock Ill get you such a ladder. But hark thee; I will go to her alone: How shall I best convey the ladder thither? It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn? Ay, my good lord. Then let me see thy cloak: Ill get me one of such another length. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak? I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me. What letter is this same? Whats here?To Silvia! And here an engine fit for my proceeding! Ill be so bold to break the seal for once. My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly; And slaves they are to me that send them flying O! could their master come and go as lightly, Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying! My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them; While I, their king, that thither them importune, Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessd them, Because myself do want my servants fortune: I curse myself, for they are sent by me, That they should harbour where their lord would be. Whats here?
Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee Tis so; and heres the ladder for the purpose. Why, Phaethon,for thou art Merops son, Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world? Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee? Go, basc intruder! overweening slave! Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates, And think my patience, more than thy desert, Is privilege for thy departure hence. Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which all too much I have bestowd on thee. But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court, By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever borc my daughter or thyself. Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse; But, as thou lovst thy life, make speed from hence. And why not death rather than living torment? To die is to be banishd from myself; And Silvia is myself: banishd from her Is self from self,a deadly banishment! What light is light, if Silvia be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection. Except I be by Silvia in the night, There is no music in the nightingale; Unless I look on Silvia in the day, There is no day for me to look upon.
She is my essence; and I leave to be, If I be not by her fair influence Fosterd, illumind, cherishd, kept alive. I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom: Tarry I here, I but attend on death; But, fly I hence, I fly away from life. Run, boy; run, run, and seek him out. Soho! soho! What seest thou? Him we go to find: theres not a hair ons head but tis a Valentine. Valentine? No. Who then? his spirit? Neither. What then? Nothing. Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike? Who wouldst thou strike? Nothing. Villain, forbear. Why, sir, Ill strike nothing: I pray you, Sirrah, I say, forbear.Friend Valentine, a word. My ears are stoppd and cannot hear good news, So much of bad already hath possessd them. Then in dumb silence will I bury mine, For they are harsh, untuneable and bad. Is Silvia dead? No, Valentine. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia! Hath she forsworn me? No, Valentine. No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me! What is your news? Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished. That thou art banished, O, thats the news, From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend. O, I have fed upon this woe already, And now excess of it will make me surfeit. Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
Ay, ay; and she hath offerd to the doom Which, unreversd, stands in effectual force A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears: Those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd; With them, upon her knees, her humble self; Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe: But neither bended knees, pure hands held up, Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears, Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire; But Valentine, if he be taen, must die. Besides, her intercession chafd him so, When she for thy repeal was suppliant, That to close prison he commanded her, With many bitter threats of biding there. No more; unless the next word that thou speakst Have some malignant power upon my life: If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear, As ending anthem of my endless dolour. Cease to lament for that thou canst not help, And study help for that which thou lamentst. Time is the nurse and breeder of all good. Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love; Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life. Hope is a lovers staff; walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts. Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence; Which, being writ to me, shall be deliverd Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
The time now serves not to expostulate: Come, Ill convey thee through the city-gate, And, ere I part with thee, confer at large Of all that may concern thy love-affairs. As thou lovst Silvia, though not for thyself, Regard thy danger, and along with me! I pray thee, Launce, and if thou seest my boy, Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate. Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine. O my dear Silvia! hapless Valentine! I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave: but thats all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love: yet I am in love; but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who tis I love; and yet tis a woman; but what woman, I will not tell myself; and yet tis a milkmaid; yet tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet tis a maid, for she is her masters maid, and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel,which is much in a bare Christian. Here is the catelog of her condition. Imprimis, She can fetch and carry. Why, a horse can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry; therefore, is she better than a jade.
Item, She can milk; look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands. How now, Signior Launce! what news with your mastership? With my masters ship? why, it is at sea. Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What news, then, in your paper? The blackest news that ever thou heardest. Why, man, how black? Why, as black as ink. Let me read them. Fie on thee, jolthead! thou canst not read. Thou liest; I can. I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee? Marry, the son of my grandfather. O, illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy grandmother. This proves that thou canst not read. Come, fool, come: try me in thy paper. There; and Saint Nicholas be thy speed! Imprimis, She can milk. Ay, that she can. Item, She brews good ale. And thereof comes the proverb, Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale. Item, She can sew. Thats as much as to say, Can she so? Item, She can knit. What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock? Item, She can wash and scour. A special virtue; for then she need not be washed and scoured. Item, She can spin. Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living. Item, She hath many nameless virtues.
Thats as much as to say, bastard virtues; that, indeed, know not their fathers, and therefore have no names. Here follow her vices. Close at the heels of her virtues. Item, She is not to be kissed fasting, in respect of her breath. Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on. Item, She hath a sweet mouth. That makes amends for her sour breath. Item, She doth talk in her sleep. Its no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk. Item, She is slow in words. O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a womans only virtue: I pray thee, out witht, and place it for her chief virtue. Item, She is proud. Out with that too: it was Eves legacy, and cannot be taen from her. Item, She hath no teeth. I care not for that neither, because I love crusts. Item, She is curst. Well; the best is, she hath no teeth to bite. Item, She will often praise her liquor. If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I will; for good things should be praised. Item, She is too liberal. Of her tongue she cannot, for thats writ down she is slow of: of her purse she shall not, for that Ill keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults. Stop there; Ill have her: she was mine, and not mine, twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more. Item, She hath more hair than wit. More hair than wit it may be; Ill prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair, that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. Whats next? And more faults than hairs. Thats monstrous! O, that that were out! And more wealth than faults. Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, Ill have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible, What then? Why, then will I tell thee,that thy master stays for thee at the North-gate. For me? For thee! ay; who art thou? he hath stayed for a better man than thee. And must I go to him? Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn. Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love-letters! Now will he be swingd for reading my letter. An unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. Ill after, to rejoice in the boys correction. Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you, Now Valentine is banishd from her sight.
Since his exile she hath despisd me most, Forsworn my company and raild at me, That I am desperate of obtaining her. This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice, which with an hours heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form. A little time will melt her frozen thoughts, And worthless Valentine shall be forgot. How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman According to our proclamation gone? Gone, my good lord. My daughter takes his going grievously. A little time, my lord, will kill that grief. So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so. Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee, For thou hast shown some sign of good desert, Makes me the better to confer with thee. Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace Let me not live to look upon your Grace. Thou knowst how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter. I do, my lord. And also, I think, thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my will. She did, my lord, when Valentine was here. Ay, and perversely she persevers so. What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio? The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent, Three things that women highly hold in hate. Ay, but shell think that it is spoke in hate.
Ay, if his enemy deliver it: Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friend. Then you must undertake to slander him. And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do: Tis an ill office for a gentleman, Especially against his very friend. Where your good word cannot advantage him, Your slander never can endamage him: Therefore the office is indifferent, Being entreated to it by your friend. You have prevaild, my lord. If I can do it, By aught that I can speak in his dispraise, She shall not long continue love to him. But say this weed her love from Valentine, It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio. Therefore, as you unwind her love from him, Lest it should ravel and be good to none, You must provide to bottom it on me; Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine. And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind, Because we know, on Valentines report, You are already Loves firm votary And cannot soon revolt and change your mind. Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Silvia may confer at large; For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy, And, for your friends sake, will be glad of you; Where you may temper her, by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friend. As much as I can do I will effect.
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough; You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets, whose composed rimes Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows. Ay, Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy. Say that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart. Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears Moist it again, and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity: For Orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews, Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones, Make tigers tame and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands. After your dire-lamenting elegies, Visit by night your ladys chamber-window With some sweet consort: to their instruments Tune a deploring dump; the nights dead silence Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance. This, or else nothing, will inherit her. This discipline shows thou hast been in love. And thy advice this night Ill put in practice. Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver, Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skilld in music. I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice. About it, gentlemen! Well wait upon your grace till aftersupper, And afterward determine our proceedings. Even now about it! I will pardon you. Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger. If there be ten, shrink not, but down with em.
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye; If not, well make you sit and rifle you. Sir, we are undone: these are the villains That all the travellers do fear so much. My friends, Thats not so, sir; we are your enemies. Peace! well hear him. Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man. Then know, that I have little wealth to lose. A man I am crossd with adversity: My riches are these poor habiliments, Of which if you should here disfurnish me, You take the sum and substance that I have. Whither travel you? To Verona. Whence came you? From Milan. Have you long sojournd there? Some sixteen months; and longer might have stayd If crooked fortune had not thwarted me. What! were you banishd thence? I was. For what offence? For that which now torments me to rehearse. I killd a man, whose death I much repent; But yet I slew him manfully, in fight, Without false vantage or base treachery. Why, neer repent it, if it were done so. But were you banishd for so small a fault? I was, and held me glad of such a doom. Have you the tongues? My youthful travel therein made me happy, Or else I often had been miserable. By the bare scalp of Robin Hoods fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction! Well have him: Sirs, a word.
Master, be one of them; It is an honourable kind of thievery. Peace, villain! Tell us this: have you anything to take to? Nothing, but my fortune. Know then, that some of us are gentlemen, Such as the fury of ungovernd youth Thrust from the company of awful men: Myself was from Verona banished For practising to steal away a lady, An heir, and near allied unto the duke. And I from Mantua, for a gentleman, Who, in my mood, I stabbd unto the heart. And I for such like petty crimes as these. But to the purpose; for we cite our faults, That they may hold excusd our lawless lives; And, partly, seeing you are beautified With goodly shape, and by your own report A linguist, and a man of such perfection As we do in our quality much want Indeed, because you are a banishd man, Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you. Are you content to be our general? To make a virtue of necessity And live, as we do, in this wilderness? What sayst thou? wilt thou be of our consort? Say ay, and be the captain of us all: Well do thee homage and be ruld by thee, Love thee as our commander and our king. But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest. Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offerd.
I take your offer and will live with you, Provided that you do no outrages On silly women, or poor passengers. No; we detest such vile, base practices. Come, go with us; well bring thee to our crews, And show thee all the treasure we have got, Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose. Already have I been false to Valentine, And now I must be as unjust to Thurio. Under the colour of commending him, I have access my own love to prefer: But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy, To be corrupted with my worthless gifts. When I protest true loyalty to her, She twits me with my falsehood to my friend; When to her beauty I commend my vows, She bids me think how I have been forsworn In breaking faith with Julia whom I lovd: And notwithstanding all her sudden quips, The least whereof would quell a lovers hope, Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love, The more it grows, and fawneth on her still. But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window, And give some evening music to her ear. How now, Sir Proteus! are you crept before us? Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love Will creep in service where it cannot go. Ay; but I hope, sir, that you love not here. Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence. Who? Silvia? Ay, Silvia, for your sake. I thank you for your own.
Now, gentlemen, Lets tune, and to it lustily a while. Now, my young guest, methinks youre allycholly: I pray you, why is it? Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry. Come, well have you merry. Ill bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for. But shall I hear him speak? Ay, that you shall. That will be music. Hark! hark! Is he among these? Ay; but peace! lets hear em. Who is Silvia? what is she? That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she; The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admired be. Is she kind as she is fair? For beauty lives with kindness: Love doth to her eyes repair, To help him of his blindness; And, being helpd, inhabits there. Then to Silvia let us sing, That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling; To her let us garlands bring. How now! are you sadder than you were before? How do you, man? the music likes you not. You mistake; the musician likes me not. Why, my pretty youth? He plays false, father. How? out of tune on the strings? Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings. You have a quick ear. Ay; I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart. I perceive you delight not in music. Not a whit,when it jars so. Hark!
what fine change is in the music! Ay, that change is the spite. You would have them always play but one thing? I would always have one play but one thing. But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on Often resort unto this gentlewoman? I will tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lovd her out of all nick. Where is Launce? Gone to seek his dog; which, to-morrow, by his masters command, he must carry for a present to his lady. Peace! stand aside: the company parts. Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels. Where meet we? At Saint Gregorys well. Farewell. Madam, good even to your ladyship. I thank you for your music, gentlemen. Who is that that spake? One, lady, if you knew his pure hearts truth, You would quickly learn to know him by his voice. Sir Proteus, as I take it. Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant. What is your will? That I may compass yours. You have your wish; my will is even this: That presently you hie you home to bed. Thou subtle, perjurd, false, disloyal man! Thinkst thou I am so shallow, so conceitless, To be seduced by thy flattery, That hast deceivd so many with thy vows? Return, return, and make thy love amends.
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear, I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit, And by and by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee. I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady; But she is dead. Tware false, if I should speak it; For I am sure she is not buried. Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend Survives; to whom, thyself art witness I am betrothd: and art thou not ashamd To wrong him with thy importunacy? I likewise hear that Valentine is dead. And so suppose am I; for in his grave, Assure thyself my love is buried. Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth. Go to thy ladys grave and call hers thence; Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine. He heard not that. Madam, if your heart be so obdurate, Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love, The picture that is hanging in your chamber: To that Ill speak, to that Ill sigh and weep; For since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted, I am but a shadow, And to your shadow will I make true love. If twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it, And make it but a shadow, as I am.
I am very loath to be your idol, sir; But, since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes, Send to me in the morning and Ill send it. And so, good rest. As wretches have oer night That wait for execution in the morn. Host, will you go? By my halidom, I was fast asleep. Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus? Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think tis almost day. Not so; but it hath been the longest night That eer I watchd and the most heaviest. This is the hour that Madam Silvia Entreated me to call, and know her mind: Theres some great matter shed employ me in. Madam, Madam! Who calls? Your servant, and your friend; One that attends your ladyships command. Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow. As many, worthy lady, to yourself. According to your ladyships impose, I am thus early come to know what service It is your pleasure to command me in. O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not Valiant, wise, remorseful, well-accomplishd. Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banishd Valentine, Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
Thyself hast lovd; and I have heard thee say No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died, Upon whose grave thou vowdst pure chastity. Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine, To Mantua, where, I hear he makes abode; And, for the ways are dangerous to pass, I do desire thy worthy company, Upon whose faith and honour I repose. Urge not my fathers anger, Eglamour, But think upon my grief, a ladys grief, And on the justice of my flying hence, To keep me from a most unholy match, Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues. I do desire thee, even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands, To bear me company and go with me: If not, to hide what I have said to thee, That I may venture to depart alone. Madam, I pity much your grievances; Which since I know they virtuously are placd, I give consent to go along with you, Recking as little what betideth me As much I wish all good befortune you. When will you go? This evening coming. Where shall I meet you? At Friar Patricks cell, Where I intend holy confession. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
When a mans servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard; one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, Thus would I teach a dog. I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master, and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg. O! tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies. I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged fort: sure as I live, he had suffered fort: you shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the dukes table: he had not been therebless the marka pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. Out with the dog! says one; What cur is that? says another; Whip him out, says the third; Hang him up, says the duke.
I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: Friend, quoth I, you mean to whip the dog? Ay, marry, do I, quoth he. You do him the more wrong, quoth I; twas I did the thing you wot of. He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, Ill be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered fort; thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick? Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well And will employ thee in some service presently. In what you please: I will do what I can. I hope thou wilt. How now, you whoreson peasant! Where have you been these two days loitering? Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me. And what says she to my little jewel?
Marry, she says, your dog was a cur, and tells you, currish thanks is good enough for such a present. But she received my dog? No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him back again. What! didst thou offer her this from me? Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace; and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater. Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again, Or neer return again into my sight. Away, I say! Stayst thou to vex me here? A slave that still an end turns me to shame. Sebastian, I have entertained thee Partly, that I have need of such a youth, That can with some discretion do my business, Fort is no trusting to yond foolish lout; But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour, Which, if my augury deceive me not, Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth: Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee. Go presently, and take this ring with thee. Deliver it to Madam Silvia: She lovd me well deliverd it to me. It seems, you lovd not her, to leave her token. Shes dead, belike? Not so: I think, she lives. Alas! Why dost thou cry alas? I cannot choose But pity her. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
Because methinks that she lovd you as well As you do love your lady Silvia. She dreams on him that has forgot her love; You dote on her, that cares not for your love. Tis pity, love should be so contrary; And thinking on it makes me cry, alas! Well, well, give her that ring and therewithal This letter: thats her chamber. Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture. Your message done, hie home unto my chamber, Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary. How many women would do such a message? Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertaind A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs. Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me? Because he loves her, he despiseth me; Because I love him, I must pity him. This ring I gave him when he parted from me, To bind him to remember my good will; And now am Iunhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain, To carry that which I would have refusd, To praise his faith which I would have dispraisd. I am my masters true-confirmed love, But cannot be true servant to my master, Unless I prove false traitor to myself. Yet will I woo for him; but yet so coldly As heaven it knows, I would not have him speed. Gentlewoman, good day!
I pray you, be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia. What would you with her, if that I be she? If you be she, I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on. From whom? From my master, Sir Proteus, madam. O! he sends you for a picture? Ay, madam. Ursula, bring my picture there. Go, give your master this: tell him from me, One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget, Would better fit his chamber than this shadow. Madam, please you peruse this letter. Pardon me, madam, I have unadvisd Deliverd you a paper that I should not: This is the letter to your ladyship. I pray thee, let me look on that again. It may not be: good madam, pardon me. There, hold. I will not look upon your masters lines: I know, they are stuffd with protestations And full of new-found oaths, which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring. The more shame for him that he sends it me; For, I have heard him say a thousand times, His Julia gave it him at his departure. Though his false finger have profand the ring, Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong. She thanks you. What sayst thou? I thank you, madam, that you tender her. Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much. Dost thou know her?
Almost as well as I do know myself: To think upon her woes, I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times. Belike, she thinks, that Proteus hath forsook her. I think she doth, and thats her cause of sorrow. Is she not passing fair? She hath been fairer, madam, than she is. When she did think my master lovd her well, She, in my judgment, was as fair as you; But since she did neglect her looking-glass And threw her sun-expelling mask away, The air hath starvd the roses in her cheeks And pinchd the lily-tincture of her face, That now she is become as black as I. How tall was she? About my stature; for, at Pentecost, When all our pageants of delight were playd, Our youth got me to play the womans part, And I was trimmd in Madam Julias gown, Which served me as fit, by all mens judgments, As if the garment had been made for me: Therefore I know she is about my height. And at that time I made her weep agood; For I did play a lamentable part. Madam, twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight; Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress, moved therewithal, Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow! She is beholding to thee, gentle youth. Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself to think upon thy words. Here, youth, there is my purse: I give thee this For thy sweet mistress sake, because thou lovst her. Farewell. And she shall thank you fort, if eer you know her. A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful. I hope my masters suit will be but cold, Since she respects my mistress love so much. Alas, how love can trifle with itself! Here is her picture: let me see; I think, If I had such a tire, this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers; And yet the painter flatterd her a little, Unless I flatter with myself too much. Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow: If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a colourd periwig. Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine: Ay, but her foreheads low, and mines as high. What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself, If this fond Love were not a blinded god? Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up, For tis thy rival. O thou senseless form! Thou shalt be worshippd, kissd, lovd, and adord, And, were there sense in his idolatry, My substance should be statue in thy stead.
Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake, That usd me so; or else, by Jove I vow, I should have scratchd out your unseeing eyes, To make my master out of love with thee. The sun begins to gild the western sky, And now it is about the very hour That Silvia at Friar Patricks cell should meet me. She will not fail; for lovers break not hours, Unless it be to come before their time, So much they spur their expedition. See, where she comes. Lady, a happy evening! Amen, amen! go on, good Eglamour, Out at the postern by the abbey-wall. I fear I am attended by some spies. Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off; If we recover that, were sure enough. Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit? O, sir, I find her milder than she was; And yet she takes exceptions at your person. What! that my leg is too long? No, that it is too little. Ill wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder. But love will not be spurrd to what it loathes. What says she to my face? She says it is a fair one. Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black. But pearls are fair, and the old saying is, Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes. Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies eyes; For I had rather wink than look on them. How likes she my discourse?
Ill, when you talk of war. But well, when I discourse of love and peace? But better, indeed, when you hold your peace. What says she to my valour? O, sir, she makes no doubt of that. She needs not, when she knows it cowardice. What says she to my birth? That you are well derivd. True; from a gentleman to a fool. Considers she my possessions? O, ay; and pities them. Wherefore? That such an ass should owe them. That they are out by lease. Here comes the duke. How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio! Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late? Not I. Nor I. Saw you my daughter? Neither. Why then, Shes fled unto that peasant Valentine, And Eglamour is in her company. Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both, As he in penance wanderd through the forest; Him he knew well, and guessd that it was she, But, being maskd, he was not sure of it; Besides, she did intend confession At Patricks cell this even, and there she was not. These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence. Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse, But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain-foot, That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled. Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me. Why, this it is to be a peevish girl, That flies her fortune when it follows her.
Ill after, more to be revengd on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia. And I will follow, more for Silvias love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her. And I will follow, more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love. Come, come, Be patient; we must bring you to our captain. A thousand more mischances than this one Have learnd me how to brook this patiently. Come, bring her away. Where is the gentleman that was with her? Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us; But Moyses and Valerius follow him. Go thou with her to the west end of the wood; There is our captain. Well follow him thats fled: The thicket is beset; he cannot scape. Come, I must bring you to our captains cave. Fear not; he bears an honourable mind, And will not use a woman lawlessly. O Valentine! this I endure for thee. How use doth breed a habit in a man! This shadowy desart, unfrequented woods, I better brook than flourishing peopled towns. Here can I sit alone, unseen of any, And to the nightingales complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes. O thou that dost inhabit in my breast, Leave not the mansion so long tenantless, Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall And leave no memory of what it was! Repair me with thy presence, Silvia! Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
What halloing and what stir is this to-day? These are my mates, that make their wills their law, Have some unhappy passenger in chase. They love me well; yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages. Withdraw thee, Valentine: whos this comes here? Madam, this service I have done for you Though you respect not aught your servant doth To hazard life and rescue you from him That would have forcd your honour and your love. Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look; A smaller boon than this I cannot beg, And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give. How like a dream is this I see and hear! Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile. O, miserable, unhappy that I am! Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came; But by my coming I have made you happy. By thy approach thou makst me most unhappy. And me, when he approacheth to your presence. Had I been seized by a hungry lion, I would have been a breakfast to the beast, Rather than have false Proteus rescue me. O! heaven be judge how I love Valentine, Whose lifes as tender to me as my soul, And full as muchfor more there cannot be I do detest false perjurd Proteus. Therefore be gone, solicit me no more. What dangerous action, stood it next to death, Would I not undergo for one calm look!
O, tis the curse in love, and still approvd, When women cannot love where theyre belovd! When Proteus cannot love where hes belovd. Read over Julias heart, thy first best love, For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me. Thou hast no faith left now, unless thoudst two, And thats far worse than none: better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one. Thou counterfeit to thy true friend! In love Who respects friend? All men but Proteus. Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form, Ill woo you like a soldier, at arms end, And love you gainst the nature of love,force ye. O heaven! Ill force thee yield to my desire. Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch; Thou friend of an ill fashion! Valentine! Thou common friend, thats without faith or love For such is a friend nowtreachrous man! Thou hast beguild my hopes: naught but mine eye Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say I have one friend alive: thou wouldst disprove me. Who should be trusted now, when ones right hand Is perjurd to the bosom? Proteus, I am sorry I must never trust thee more, But count the world a stranger for thy sake. The private wound is deepst. O time most curst!
Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst! My shame and guilt confound me. Forgive me, Valentine. If hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tendert here: I do as truly suffer As eer I did commit. Then, I am paid; And once again I do receive thee honest. Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven, nor earth; for these are pleasd. By penitence the Eternals wraths appeasd: And, that my love may appear plain and free, All that was mine in Silvia I give thee. O me unhappy! Look to the boy. Why, boy! why, wag! how now! whats the matter? Look up; speak. O good sir, my master chargd me To deliver a ring to Madam Silvia, Which out of my neglect was never done. Where is that ring, boy? Here tis this is it. How! let me see. Why this is the ring I gave to Julia. O, cry you mercy, sir; I have mistook: This is the ring you sent to Silvia. But how camst thou by this ring? At my depart I gave this unto Julia. And Julia herself did give it me; And Julia herself hath brought it hither. How! Julia! Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths, And entertaind them deeply in her heart: How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root! O Proteus! let this habit make thee blush.
Be thou ashamd that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment; if shame live In a disguise of love. It is the lesser blot, modesty finds, Women to change their shapes than men their minds. Than men their minds! tis true. O heaven! were man But constant, he were perfect: that one error Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins: Inconstancy falls off ere it begins. What is in Silvias face, but I may spy More fresh in Julias with a constant eye? Come, come, a hand from either. Let me be blest to make this happy close: Twere pity two such friends should be long foes. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish, for ever. And I mine. A prize! a prize! a prize! Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the duke. Your Grace is welcome to a man disgracd, Banished Valentine. Sir Valentine! Yonder is Silvia; and Silvias mine. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death; Come not within the measure of my wrath; Do not name Silvia thine; if once again, Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands; Take but possession of her with a touch; I dare thee but to breathe upon my love. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I. I hold him but a fool that will endanger His body for a girl that loves him not: I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
The more degenerate and base art thou, To make such means for her as thou hast done, And leave her on such slight conditions. Now, by the honour of my ancestry, I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine, And think thee worthy of an empress love. Know then, I here forget all former griefs, Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again, Plead a new state in thy unrivalld merit, To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine, Thou art a gentleman and well derivd; Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deservd her. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy. I now beseech you, for your daughters sake, To grant one boon that I shall ask of you. I grant it, for thine own, whateer it be. These banishd men, that I have kept withal Are men endud with worthy qualities: Forgive them what they have committed here, And let them be recalld from their exile. They are reformed, civil, full of good, And fit for great employment, worthy lord. Thou hast prevaild; I pardon them, and thee: Dispose of them as thou knowst their deserts. Come, let us go: we will include all jars With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity. And as we walk along, I dare be bold With our discourse to make your Grace to smile. What think you of this page, my lord? I think the boy hath grace in him: he blushes. I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
What mean you by that saying? Please you, Ill tell you as we pass along, That you will wonder what hath fortuned. Come, Proteus; tis your penance, but to hear The story of your loves discovered: That done, our day of marriage shall be yours; One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me, his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up. Now, sir! what make you here? Nothing: I am not taught to make anything. What mar you then, sir? Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should come to such penury? Know you where you are, sir? O! sir, very well: here in your orchard. Know you before whom, sir? Ay, better than he I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence. What, boy! Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain? I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself. Sweet masters, be patient: for your fathers remembrance, be at accord. Let me go, I say. I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education: you have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes. And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will: I pray you, leave me. I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good. Get you with him, you old dog. Is old dog my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master! he would not have spoke such a word. Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis! Calls your worship?
Was not Charles the dukes wrestler here to speak with me? So please you, he is here at the door, and importunes access to you. Call him in. Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is. Good morrow to your worship. Good Monsieur Charles, whats the new news at the new court? Theres no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander. Can you tell if Rosalind, the dukes daughter, be banished with her father? O, no; for the dukes daughter, her cousin, so loves her,being ever from their cradles bred together,that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do. Where will the old duke live? They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would be loath to foil him as I must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it, but he is resolute. Ill tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of ambition, an envious emulator of every mans good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
And thou wert best look tot; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I assure thee,and almost with tears I speak it,there is not one so young and so villanous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, Ill give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, Ill never wrestle for prize more; and so God keep your worship! Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet hes gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and, indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now Ill go about.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure. Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir: for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport neither, than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again. What shall be our sport then? Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally. I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women. Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly. Nay, now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature. No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument? Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Natures natural the cutter-off of Natures wit. Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither, but Natures; who, perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this natural for our whetstone: for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit! whither wander you? Mistress, you must come away to your father. Were you made the messenger?
No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you. Where learned you that oath, fool? Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught: now, Ill stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge? Ay, marry: now unmuzzle your wisdom. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave. By our beards, if we had them, thou art. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no more was this knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard. Prithee, who ist that thou meanest? One that old Frederick, your father, loves. My fathers love is enough to honour him. Enough! speak no more of him; youll be whipped for taxation one of these days. The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau. With his mouth full of news.
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young. Then we shall be news-crammd. All the better; we shall be more marketable. Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: whats the news? Fair princess, you have lost much good sport. Sport! Of what colour? What colour, madam! How shall I answer you? As wit and fortune will. Or as the Destinies decree. Well said: that was laid on with a trowel. Nay, if I keep not my rank, Thou losest thy old smell. You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling. I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried. There comes an old man and his three sons, I could match this beginning with an old tale. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence; With bills on their necks, Be it known unto all men by these presents. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the dukes wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him: so he served the second, and so the third.
Yonder they lie; the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping. Alas! But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost? Why, this that I speak of. Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies. Or I, I promise thee. But is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin? You must, if you stay here; for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it. Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it. Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness. Is yonder the man? Even he, madam. Alas! he is too young: yet he looks successfully. How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to see the wrestling? Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man: in pity of the challengers youth I would fam dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him. Call him hither, good Monsieur le Beau. Do so: Ill not be by.
Monsieur the challenger, the princes call for you. I attend them with all respect and duty. Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler? No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this mans strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt. Do, young sir: your reputation shall not therefore be misprised. We will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you. And mine, to eke out hers. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you! Your hearts desires be with you! Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth? Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working. You shall try but one fall. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before: but come your ways. Now Hercules be thy speed, young man! I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg. O excellent young man! If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down. No more, no more. Yes, I beseech your Grace: I am not yet well breathed. How dost thou, Charles? He cannot speak, my lord. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man? Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. I would thou hadst been son to some man else: The world esteemd thy father honourable, But I did find him still mine enemy: Thou shouldst have better pleasd me with this deed, Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth: I would thou hadst told me of another father. Were I my father, coz, would I do this? I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son, His youngest son; and would not change that calling, To be adopted heir to Frederick. My father lovd Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my fathers mind: Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties, Ere he should thus have venturd. Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him: My fathers rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deservd: If you do keep your promises in love But justly, as you have exceeded all promise, Your mistress shall be happy. Gentleman, Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune, That could give more, but that her hand lacks means. Shall we go, coz? Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman. Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block. He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes; Ill ask him what he would. Did you call, sir? Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown More than your enemies. Will you go, coz? Have with you. Fare you well. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urgd conference. O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown! Or Charles or something weaker masters thee. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place. Albeit you have deservd High commendation, true applause and love, Yet such is now the dukes condition That he misconstrues all that you have done. The duke is humorous: what he is indeed, More suits you to conceive than I to speak of. I thank you, sir; and pray you, tell me this; Which of the two was daughter of the duke, That here was at the wrestling? Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners: But yet, indeed the smaller is his daughter: The other is daughter to the banishd duke, And here detaind by her usurping uncle, To keep his daughter company; whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues, And pity her for her good fathers sake; And, on my life, his malice gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well: Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you. I rest much bounden to you: fare you well. Thus must I from the smoke into the smother; From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.
But heavenly Rosalind! Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word? Not one to throw at a dog. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons. Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any. But is all this for your father? No, some of it is for my childs father: O, how full of briers is this working-day world! They are but burrs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them. I could shake them off my coat: these burrs are in my heart. Hem them away. I would try, if I could cry hem, and have him. Come, come; wrestle with thy affections. O! they take the part of a better wrestler than myself! O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest: is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowlands youngest son? The duke my father loved his father dearly. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
By this kind of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake. Why should I not? doth he not deserve well? Let me love him for that; and do you love him, because I do. Look, here comes the duke. With his eyes full of anger. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court. Me, uncle? You, cousin: Within these ten days if that thou best found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it. I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. If with myself I hold intelligence, Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic, As I do trust I am not,then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your highness. Thus do all traitors: If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself: Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor: Tell me whereon the likelihood depends. Thou art thy fathers daughter; theres enough. So was I when your highness took his dukedom; So was I when your highness banishd him.
Treason is not inherited, my lord; Or, if we did derive it from our friends, Whats that to me? my father was no traitor: Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous. Dear sovereign, hear me speak. Ay, Celia; we stayd her for your sake; Else had she with her father rangd along. I did not then entreat to have her stay: It was your pleasure and your own remorse. I was too young that time to value her; But now I know her: if she be a traitor, Why so am I; we still have slept together, Rose at an instant, learnd, playd, eat together; And wheresoeer we went, like Junos swans, Still we went coupled and inseparable. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness, Her very silence and her patience, Speak to the people, and they pity her. Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name; And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone. Then open not thy lips: Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passd upon her; she is banishd. Pronounce that sentence then, on me, my liege: I cannot live out of her company. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself: If you outstay the time, upon mine honour, And in the greatness of my word, you die. O my poor Rosalind! whither wilt thou go? Wilt thou change fathers?
I will give thee mine. I charge thee, be not thou more grievd than I am. I have more cause. Thou hast not, cousin; Prithee, be cheerful; knowst thou not, the duke Hath banishd me, his daughter? That he hath not. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one: Shall we be sunderd? shall we part, sweet girl? No: let my father seek another heir. Therefore devise with me how we may fly, Whither to go, and what to bear with us: And do not seek to take your change upon you, To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out; For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, Ill go along with thee. Why, whither shall we go? To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden. Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far! Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold. Ill put myself in poor and mean attire, And with a kind of umber smirch my face; The like do you: so shall we pass along And never stir assailants. Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand; and,in my heart Lie there what hidden womans fear there will, Well have a swashing and a martial outside, As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances. What shall I call thee when thou art a man? Ill have no worse a name than Joves own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede. But what will you be calld? Something that hath a reference to my state: No longer Celia, but Aliena. But, cousin, what if we assayd to steal The clownish fool out of your fathers court? Would he not be a comfort to our travel? Hell go along oer the wide world with me; Leave me alone to woo him. Lets away, And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam, The seasons difference; as, the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winters wind, Which, when it bites and blows upon my body, Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say This is no flattery: these are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am. Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; And this our life exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in every thing. I would not change it. Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style. Come, shall we go and kill us venison? And yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gord. Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that; And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banishd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood; To the which place a poor sequesterd stag, That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt, Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heavd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle? O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream; Poor deer, quoth he, thou makst a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much: then, being there alone, Left and abandond of his velvet friends; Tis right, quoth he; thus misery doth part The flux of company: anon, a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him; Ay, quoth Jaques, Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens; Tis just the fashion; wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there? Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and whats worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assignd and native dwelling-place. And did you leave him in this contemplation? We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer. Show me the place. I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then hes full of matter. Ill bring you to him straight. Can it be possible that no man saw them? It cannot be: some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this. I cannot hear of any that did see her. The ladies, her attendants of her chamber, Saw her a-bed; and, in the morning early They found the bed untreasurd of their mistress.
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. Hisperia, the princess gentlewoman, Confesses that she secretly oerheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; And she believes, wherever they are gone, That youth is surely in their company. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither; If he be absent, bring his brother to me; Ill make him find him. Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways. Whos there? What! my young master? O my gentle master! O my sweet master! O you memory Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here? Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you? And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bony priser of the humorous duke? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies? No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. O, what a world is this, when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it! Why, whats the matter? O unhappy youth! Come not within these doors; within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.
Your brother,no, no brother; yet the son, Yet not the son, I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father, Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it: if he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off. I overheard him and his practices. This is no place; this house is but a butchery: Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go? No matter whither, so you come not here. What! wouldst thou have me go and beg my food? Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road? This I must do, or know not what to do: Yet this I will not do, do how I can; I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I savd under your father, Which I did store to be my foster-nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame, And unregarded age in corners thrown. Take that; and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow, Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold; All this I give you.
Let me be your servant: Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty; For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility; Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you; Ill do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities. O good old man! how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed! Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that, do choke their service up Even with the having: it is not so with thee. But, poor old man, thou prunst a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossom yield, In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. But come thy ways, well go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, Well light upon some settled low content. Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years many their fortunes seek; But at fourscore it is too late a week: Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my masters debtor. O Jupiter! how weary are my spirits.
I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary. I could find it in my heart to disgrace my mans apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat: therefore, courage, good Aliena. I pray you, bear with me: I cannot go no further. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse. Well, this is the forest of Arden. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I: when I was at home, I was in a better place: but travellers must be content. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in solemn talk. That is the way to make her scorn you still. O Corin, that thou knewst how I do love her! I partly guess, for I have lovd ere now. No, Corin; being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighd upon a midnight pillow: But if thy love were ever like to mine, As sure I think did never man love so, How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy? Into a thousand that I have forgotten. O!
thou didst then neer love so heartily. If thou rememberst not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not lovd: Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearing thy hearer with thy mistress praise, Thou hast not lovd: Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not lovd. O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe! Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cows dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods, and giving her them again, said with weeping tears, Wear these for my sake. We that are true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly. Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of. Nay, I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it. Jove, Jove! this shepherds passion Is much upon my fashion. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, If he for gold will give us any food: I faint almost to death. Holla, you clown! Peace, fool: hes not thy kinsman. Who calls? Your betters, sir. Else are they very wretched. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed. Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd, And faints for succour. Fair sir, I pity her, And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her; But I am shepherd to another man, And do not shear the fleeces that I graze: My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality. Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on; but what is, come see, And in my voice most welcome shall you be. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture? That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place, And willingly could waste my time in it. Assuredly the thing is to be sold: Go with me: if you like upon report The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be, And buy it with your gold right suddenly. Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me, And turn his merry note Unto the sweet birds throat, Come hither, come hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More! I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More! I prithee, more. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you them stanzos? What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, Ill thank you: but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. Well, Ill end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company: I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble; come. Who doth ambition shun, And loves to live i the sun, Secking the food he eats, And pleasd with what he gets. Come hither, come hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. Ill give you a verse to this note, that I made yesterday in despite of my invention. And Ill sing it. Thus it goes: If it do come to pass That any man turn ass, Leaving his wealth and ease, A stubborn will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame: Here shall he see Gross fools as he, An if he will come to me. Whats that ducdame? Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle.
Ill go sleep if I can; if I cannot, Ill rail against all the first-born of Egypt. And Ill go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared. Dear master, I can go no further: O! I die for food. Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master. Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it, or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake be comfortable, hold death awhile at the arms end, I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said! thou lookest cheerly, and Ill be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come I will bear thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam. I think he be transformd into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man. My lord, he is but even now gone hence: Here was he merry, hearing of a song. If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him. He saves my labour by his own approach. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company? What, you look merrily! A fool, a fool! I met a fool i the forest, A motley fool; a miserable world! As I do live by food, I met a fool; Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun, And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms, and yet a motley fool. Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he, Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune. And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, It is ten oclock; Thus may we see, quoth he, how the world wags: Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more twill be eleven; And so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motleys the only wear. What fool is this? O worthy fool!
One that hath been a courtier, And says, if ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it; and in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage,he hath strange places crammd With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! I am ambitious for a motley coat. Thou shalt have one. It is my only suit; Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please; for so fools have: And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? The why is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, The wise mans folly is anatomizd Even by the squandering glances of the fool. Invest me in my motley; give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do. What, for a counter, would I do, but good?
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin: For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself; And all the embossed sores and headed evils, That thou with licence of free foot hast caught, Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. Why, who cries out on pride, That can therein tax any private party? Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, Till that the weary very means do ebb? What woman in the city do I name, When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbour? Or what is he of basest function, That says his bravery is not on my cost, Thinking that I mean him,but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech? There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrongd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrongd himself; if he be free, Why then, my taxing like a wild goose flies, Unclaimd of any man. But who comes here? Forbear, and eat no more. Why, I have eat none yet. Nor shalt not, till necessity be servd. Of what kind should this cock come of?
Art thou thus boldend, man, by thy distress, Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seemst so empty? You touchd my vein at first: the thorny point Of bare distress hath taen from me the show Of smooth civility; yet I am inland bred And know some nurture. But forbear, I say: He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered. An you will not be answered with reason, I must die. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness. I almost die for food; and let me have it. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment.
But whateer you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If ever you have lookd on better days, If ever been where bells have knolld to church, If ever sat at any good mans feast, If ever from your eyelids wipd a tear, And know what tis to pity, and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. True is it that we have seen better days, And have with holy bell been knolld to church, And sat at good mens feasts, and wipd our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd; And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministerd. Then but forbear your food a little while, Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food. There is an old poor man, Who after me hath many a weary step Limpd in pure love: till he be first sufficd, Oppressd with two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit. Go find him out, And we will nothing waste till you return. I thank ye; and be blessd for your good comfort! Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy: This wide and universal theatre Presents more woful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in.
All the worlds a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurses arms. And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel, And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad Made to his mistress eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannons mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lind, With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose well savd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed. I thank you most for him. So had you need: I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you As yet, to question you about your fortunes. Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing. Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As mans ingratitude; Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen, Although thy breath be rude. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly. Then heigh-ho! the holly! This life is most jolly. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot: Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so sharp As friend rememberd not. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly. Then heigh-ho! the holly! This life is most jolly. If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son, As you have whisperd faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limnd and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke That lovd your father: the residue of your fortune, Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is. Support him by the arm. Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand. Not seen him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be: But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present.
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoeer he is; Seek him with candle; bring him, dead or living, Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory. Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth Of what we think against thee. O that your highness knew my heart in this! I never lovd my brother in my life. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors; And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands. Do this expediently and turn him going. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love: And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above, Thy huntress name, that my full life doth sway. O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books, And in their barks my thoughts Ill character, That every eye, which in this forest looks, Shall see thy virtue witnessd everywhere. Run, run, Orlando: carve on every tree The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she. And how like you this shepherds life, Master Touchstone? Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherds life, it is naught.
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd? No, truly. Then thou art damned. Nay, I hope. Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side. For not being at court? Your reason. Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest good manners; if thou never sawest good manners, then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners at the court, are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds. Instance, briefly; come, instance. Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy. Why, do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come. Besides, our hands are hard. Your lips will feel them the sooner: shallow again. A more sounder instance; come. And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtiers hands are perfumed with civet. Most shallow man! Thou worms-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd. You have too courtly a wit for me: Ill rest. Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no mans happiness, glad of other mens good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck. That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldy ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou best not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds: I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistresss brother. From the east to western Ind, No jewel is like Rosalind Her worth, being mounted on the wind, Through all the world bears Rosalind. All the pictures fairest lind Are but black to Rosalind. Let no face be kept in mind, But the fair of Rosalind. Ill rime you so, eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted: it is the right butter-womens rank to market. Out, fool! For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind. If the cat will after kind, So be sure will Rosalind. Winter-garments must be lind, So must slender Rosalind.
They that reap must sheaf and bind, Then to cart with Rosalind. Sweetest nut hath sourest rind, Such a nut is Rosalind. He that sweetest rose will find Must find loves prick and Rosalind. This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you infect yourself with them? Peace! you dull fool: I found them on a tree. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit. Ill graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit i the country; for youll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and thats the right virtue of the medlar. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge. Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside. Why should this a desert be? For it is unpeopled? No; Tongues Ill hang on every tree, That shall civil sayings show. Some, how brief the life of man Runs his erring pilgrimage, That the stretching of a span Buckles in his sum of age; Some, of violated vows Twixt the souls of friend and friend: But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I Rosalinda write; Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show.
Therefore Heaven Nature chargd That one body should be filld With all graces wide enlargd: Nature presently distilld Helens cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatras majesty, Atalantas better part, Sad Lucretias modesty. Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devisd Of many faces, eyes, and hearts, To have the touches dearest prizd. Heaven would that she these gifts should have, And I to live and die her slave. O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried, Have patience, good people! How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little: go with him, sirrah. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. Didst thou hear these verses? O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear. Thats no matter: the feet might bear the verses. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse. But didst thou hear without wondering, how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree: I was never so be-rimed since Pythagoras time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember. Trow you who hath done this? Is it a man? And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour? I prithee, who? O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes, and so encounter. Nay, but who is it? Is it possible? Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is. O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! and yet again wonderful! and after that, out of all whooping! Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am caparisond like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthd bottle; either too much at once, or none at all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings. So you may put a man in your belly. Is he of Gods making? What manner of man?
Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard? Nay, he hath but a little beard. Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin. It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestlers heels and your heart both, in an instant. Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and true maid. I faith, coz, tis he. Orlando? Orlando. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee, and when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word. You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first: tis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. But doth he know that I am in this forest and in mans apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled? It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
It may well be called Joves tree, when it drops forth such fruit. Give me audience, good madam. Proceed. There lay he, stretchd along like a wounded knight. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground. Cry holla! to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets unseasonably. He was furnishd like a hunter. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart. I would sing my song without a burthen: thou bringest me out of tune. Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here? Tis he: slink by, and note him. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society. God be wi you: lets meet as little as we can. I do desire we may be better strangers. I pray you, mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly. Rosalind is your loves name? Yes, just. I do not like her name. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened. What stature is she of? Just as high as my heart. You are full of pretty answers.
Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives, and connd them out of rings? Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions. You have a nimble wit: I think twas made of Atalantas heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults. The worst fault you have is to be in love. Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you. He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you shall see him. There I shall see mine own figure. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher. Ill tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love. I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy. I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him. Do you hear, forester? Very well: what would you? I pray you, what ist oclock? You should ask me, what time o day; theres no clock in the forest. Then there is no true lover in the forest; else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that been as proper? By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. Ill tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal. I prithee, who doth he trot withal? Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized; if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year. Who ambles Time withal? With a priest that lacks Latin, and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles withal. Who doth he gallop withal? With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there. Who stays it still withal? With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves. Where dwell you, pretty youth? With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat. Are you native of this place? As the cony, that you see dwell where she is kindled.
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling. I have been told so of many: but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God, I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women? There were none principal; they were all like one another as half-pence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it. I prithee, recount some of them. No, I will not cast away my physic, but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him. I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you, tell me your remedy.
There is none of my uncles marks upon you: he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner. What were his marks? A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not: but I pardon you for that, for, simply, your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue. Then, your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man: you are rather point-device in your accoutrements; as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love. Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does; that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired? I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he. But are you so much in love as your rimes speak? Neither rime nor reason can express how much.
Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel. Did you ever cure any so? Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking; proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart, that there shall not be one spot of love int. I would not be cured, youth.
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me. Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me where it is. Go with me to it and Ill show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go? With all my heart, good youth. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go? Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet? doth my simple feature content you? Your features! Lord warrant us! what features? I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths. O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatchd house! When a mans verses cannot be understood, nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical. I do not know what poetical is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing? No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign. Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign. Would you not have me honest? No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favourd; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar. A material fool. Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness! sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest, and to couple us. I would fain see this meeting. Well, the gods give us joy! Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, many a man knows no end of his goods: right; many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so.
Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want. Here comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel? Is there none here to give the woman? I will not take her on gift of any man. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful. Proceed, proceed: Ill give her. Good even, good Master What-ye-callt. how do you, sir? You are very well met: God ild you for your last company: I am very glad to see you: even a toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered. Will you be married, motley? As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush, like a beggar?
Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is: this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp. I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another: for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee. Come, sweet Audrey: We must be married, or we must live in bawdry. Farewell, good Master Oliver: not O sweet Oliver! O brave Oliver! Leave me not behind thee: but, Wind away, Begone, I say, I will not to wedding with thee. Tis no matter: neer a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling. Never talk to me: I will weep. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man. But have I not cause to weep? As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep. His very hair is of the dissembling colour. Something browner than Judass; marry, his kisses are Judass own children. I faith, his hair is of a good colour. An excellent colour: your chesnut was ever the only colour. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not? Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him. Do you think so? Yes: I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut. Not true in love? Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in. You have heard him swear downright he was. Was is not is: besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmers of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the duke your father. I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as he; so he laughed, and let me go. But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando? O, thats a brave man!
he writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here? Mistress and master, you have oft inquird After the shepherd that complaind of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress. Well, and what of him? If you will see a pageant truly playd, Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you, If you will mark it. O! come, let us remove: The sight of lovers feedeth those in love. Bring us to this sight, and you shall say Ill prove a busy actor in their play. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe: Say that you love me not, but say not so In bitterness. The common executioner, Whose heart the accustomd sight of death makes hard, Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon: will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops? I would not be thy executioner: I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye: Tis pretty, sure, and very probable, That eyes, that are the frailst and softest things, Who shut their coward gates on atomies, Should be calld tyrants, butchers, murderers! Now I do frown on thee with all my heart; And, if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee; Now counterfeit to swound; why now fall down; Or, if thou canst not, O! for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers. Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee; Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush, The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not, Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt. O dear Phebe, If ever,as that ever may be near, You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That loves keen arrows make. But, till that time Come not thou near me; and, when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not; As, till that time I shall not pity thee. And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother, That you insult, exult, and all at once, Over the wretched?
What though you have no beauty, As by my faith, I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed, Must you be therefore proud and pitiless? Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of natures sale-work. Ods my little life! I think she means to tangle my eyes too. No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it: Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, That can entame my spirits to your worship. You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman: tis such fools as you That make the world full of ill-favourd children: Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her; And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her. But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees, And thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love: For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can; you are not for all markets. Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer: Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together: I had rather hear you chide than this man woo. Hes fallen in love with her foulness, and shell fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, Ill sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me? For no ill will I bear you. I pray you, do not fall in love with me, For I am falser than vows made in wine: Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house, Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard. Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud: though all the world could see, None could be so abusd in sight as he. Come, to our flock. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: Who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight? Sweet Phebe, Ha! what sayst thou, Silvius? Sweet Phebe, pity me. Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be: If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermind. Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly? I would have you. Why, that were covetousness.
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee; And yet it is not that I bear thee love: But since that thou canst talk of love so well, Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, I will endure, and Ill employ thee too; But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employd. So holy and so perfect is my love, And I in such a poverty of grace, That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then A scatterd smile, and that Ill live upon. Knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile? Not very well, but I have met him oft; And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of. Think not I love him, though I ask for him. Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well; But what care I for words? yet words do well, When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. It is a pretty youth: not very pretty: But, sure, hes proud; and yet his pride becomes him: Hell make a proper man: the best thing in him Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years hes tall: His leg is but so so; and yet tis well: There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixd in his cheek; twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they markd him In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him; but, for my part, I love him not nor hate him not; and yet Have more cause to hate him than to love him: For what had he to do to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black; And, now I am rememberd, scornd at me. I marvel why I answerd not again: But thats all one; omittance is no quittance. Ill write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius? Phebe, with all my heart. Ill write it straight; The matters in my head and in my heart: I will be bitter with him and passing short. Go with me, Silvius. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee. They say you are a melancholy fellow. I am so; I do love it better than laughing. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
Why, tis good to be sad and say nothing. Why, then, tis good to be a post. I have neither the scholars melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musicians, which is fantastical; nor the courtiers, which is proud; nor the soldiers, which is ambitious; nor the lawyers, which is politic; nor the ladys, which is nice; nor the lovers, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, which, by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadness. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens; then, to have seen much and to have nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands. Yes, I have gained my experience. And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad: and to travel for it too! Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind! Nay then, God be wi you, an you talk in blank verse.
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp, and wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise. Break an hours promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder, but Ill warrant him heart-whole. Pardon me, dear Rosalind. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I had as lief be wooed of a snail. Of a snail! Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head; a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman: besides, he brings his destiny with him. Whats that? Why, horns; that such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous. And I am your Rosalind?
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind? I would kiss before I spoke. Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking,God warn us!matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss. How if the kiss be denied? Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress? Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit. What, of my suit? Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind? I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of her. Well, in her person I say I will not have you. Then in mine own person I die. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause.
Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot mid-summer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drowned; and the foolish coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I protest, her frown might kill me. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, I will grant it. Then love me, Rosalind. Yes, faith will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all. And wilt thou have me? Ay, and twenty such. What sayest thou? Are you not good? I hope so. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister? Pray thee, marry us. I cannot say the words.
You must begin,Will you, Orlando, Go to.Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind? I will. Ay, but when? Why now; as fast as she can marry us. Then you must say, I take thee, Rosalind, for wife. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife. I might ask you for your commission; but, I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband: theres a girl goes before the priest; and, certainly, a womans thought runs before her actions. So do all thoughts; they are winged. Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her? For ever and a day. Say a day, without the ever. No, no, Orlando; men are April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot against rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my desires than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou art inclined to sleep. But will my Rosalind do so? By my life, she will do as I do. O! but she is wise.
Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a womans wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and twill out at the key-hole; stop that, twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney. A man that hath a wife with such a wit, he might say, Wit, whither wilt? Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed. And what wit could wit have to excuse that? Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O! that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee. Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours. I must attend the duke at dinner: by two oclock I will be with thee again. Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you would prove, my friends told me as much, and I thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours won me: tis but one cast away, and so, come, death! Two oclock is your hour? Ay, sweet Rosalind.
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore, beware my censure, and keep your promise. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind: so, adieu. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let Time try. Adieu. You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate: we must have your doublot and hose plucked over your head, and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the bay of Portugal. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.
Ill tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando: Ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come. And Ill sleep. Which is he that killed the deer? Sir, it was I. Lets present him to the duke, like a Roman conqueror; and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose? Yes, sir. Sing it: tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough. What shall he have that killd the deer? His leather skin and horns to wear. Then sing him home Take thou no scorn to wear the horn; It was a crest ere thou wast born: Thy fathers father wore it, And thy father bore it: The horn, the horn, the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn How say you now? Is it not past two oclock? And here much Orlando! I warrant you, with pure love and a troubled brain, he hath taen his bow and arrows, and is gone forth to sleep. Look, who comes here. My errand is to you, fair youth.
My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this: I know not the contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenour: pardon me; I am but as a guiltless messenger. Patience herself would startle at this letter, And play the swaggerer: bear this, bear all: She says I am not fair; that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phnix. Ods my will! Her love is not the hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents: Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool, And turnd into the extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand, A freestone-colourd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but twas her hands: She has a housewifes hand; but thats no matter: I say she never did invent this letter; This is a mans invention, and his hand. Sure, it is hers.
Why, tis a boisterous and a cruel style, A style for challengers; why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian: womans gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter? So please you, for I never heard it yet; Yet heard too much of Phebes cruelty. She Phebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes. Art thou god to shepherd turnd, That a maidens heart hath burnd? Can a woman rail thus? Call you this railing? Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warrst thou with a womans heart? Did you ever hear such railing? Whiles the eye of man did woo me, That could do no vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast. If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine, Alack! in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect. Whiles you chid me, I did love, How then might your prayers move! He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me; And by him seal up thy mind; Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make; Or else by him my love deny, And then Ill study how to die. Call you this chiding? Alas, poor shepherd! Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman?
What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee: if she will not, I will never have her, unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more company. Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fencd about with olive-trees? West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the house doth keep itself; Theres none within. If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description; Such garments, and such years: The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a ripe sister: but the woman low, And browner than her brother. Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for? It is no boast, being askd, to say, we are. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he? I am: what must we understand by this?
Some of my shame; if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was staind. I pray you, tell it. When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell!
he threw his eye aside, And mark what object did present itself: Under an oak, whose boughs were mossd with age, And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged man, oergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathd itself, Who with her head nimble in threats approachd The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlinkd itself, And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush; under which bushs shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, When that the sleeping man should stir; for tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: This seen, Orlando did approach the man, And found it was his brother, his elder brother. O! I have heard him speak of that same brother; And he did render him the most unnatural That livd mongst men. And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the suckd and hungry lioness? Twice did he turn his back and purposd so; But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awakd. Are you his brother? Was it you he rescud?
Wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him? Twas I; but tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. But, for the bloody napkin? By and by. When from the first to last, betwixt us two, Tears our recountments had most kindly bathd, As how I came into that desert place: In brief, he led me to the gentle duke, Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, Committing me unto my brothers love; Who led me instantly unto his cave, There strippd himself; and here, upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away, Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted, And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. Brief, I recoverd him, bound up his wound; And, after some small space, being strong at heart, He sent me hither, stranger as I am, To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise; and to give this napkin, Dyd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede! Many will swoon when they do look on blood. There is more in it. Cousin! Ganymede! Look, he recovers. I would I were at home. Well lead you thither. I pray you, will you take him by the arm? Be of good cheer, youth. You a man! You lack a mans heart.
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah! a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you, tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho! This was not counterfeit: there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest. Counterfeit, I assure you. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man. So I do; but, i faith, I should have been a woman by right. Come; you look paler and paler: pray you, draw homewards. Good sir, go with us. That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind. I shall devise something. But, I pray you, commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go? We shall find a time, Audrey: patience, gentle Audrey. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentlemans saying. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey; a most vile Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you. Ay, I know who tis: he hath no interest in me in the world. Here comes the man you mean. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be flouting; we cannot hold. Good even, Audrey. God ye good even, William. And good even to you, sir. Good even, gentle friend.
Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend? Five-and-twenty, sir. A ripe age. Is thy name William? William, sir. A fair name. Wast born i the forest here? Ay, sir, I thank God. Thank God; a good answer. Art rich? Faith, sir, so so. So so, is good, very good, very excellent good: and yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise? Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit. Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying, The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid? I do, sir. Give me your hand. Art thou learned? No, sir. Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it is a figure in rhetoric, that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he. Which he, sir? He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Therefore, you clown, abandon,which is in the vulgar, leave,the society,which in the boorish is, company,of this female,which in the common is, woman; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; I will oerrun thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways: therefore tremble, and depart. Do, good William. God rest you merry, sir. Our master and mistress seek you: come, away, away! Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend. Ist possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? that, but seeing, you should love her? and, loving, woo? and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her, that she loves me; consent with both, that we may enjoy each other: it shall be to your good; for my fathers house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowlands will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow: thither will I invite the duke and alls contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind. God save you, brother. And you, fair sister. O! my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf. It is my arm. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swound when he showed me your handkercher? Ay, and greater wonders than that. O! I know where you are.
Nay, tis true: there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Csars thrasonical brag of I came, saw, and overcame: for your brother and my sister no sooner met, but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together: clubs cannot part them. They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial. But, O! how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes. By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind? I can live no longer by thinking. I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then,for now I speak to some purpose,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit.
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three years old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any danger. Speakest thou in sober meanings? By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your best array; bid your friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to Rosalind, if you will. Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness, To show the letter that I writ to you. I care not if I have: it is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
You are there followd by a faithful shepherd: Look upon him, love him; he worships you. Good shepherd, tell this youth what tis to love. It is to be all made of sighs and tears; And so am I for Phebe. And I for Ganymede. And I for Rosalind. And I for no woman. It is to be all made of faith and service; And so am I for Phebe. And I for Ganymede. And I for Rosalind. And I for no woman. It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion, and all made of wishes; All adoration, duty, and observance; All humbleness, all patience, and impatience; All purity, all trial, all obeisance; And so am I for Phebe. And so am I for Ganymede. And so am I for Rosalind. And so am I for no woman. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? If this be so, why blame you me to love you? If this be so, why blame you me to love you? Who do you speak to, Why blame you me to love you? To her that is not here, nor doth not hear. Pray you, no more of this: tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon. I will help you, if I can: I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
I will marry you, if... ... ever I marry woman, and Ill be married to-morrow:... I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied... ... man, and you shall be married to-morrow: ... I will content you, if what pleases you contents... ... you, and you shall be married to-morrow. As you love Rosalind, meet: As you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman, Ill meet. So, fare you well: I have left you commands. Ill not fail, if I live. Nor I. Nor I. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will we be married. I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come two of the banished dukes pages. Well met, honest gentleman. By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song. We are for you: sit i the middle. Shall we clap intot roundly, without hawking or spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice? Ifaith, ifaith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse.
It was a lover and his lass, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, That oer the green corn-field did pass, In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; Sweet lovers love the spring. Between the acres of the rye, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, These pretty country folks would lie, In the spring time, c. This carol they began that hour, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, How that a life was but a flower In the spring time, c. And therefore take the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino; For love is crowned with the prime In the spring time, c. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable. You are deceived, sir: we kept time; we lost not our time. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God be wi you; and God mend your voices! Come, Audrey. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised? I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not; As those that fear they hope, and know they fear. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urgd. You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, You will bestow her on Orlando here?
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her. And you say, you will have her when I bring her? That would I, were I of all kingdoms king. You say, that youll marry me, if I be willing? That will I, should I die the hour after. But if you do refuse to marry me, Youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd? So is the bargain. You say, that youll have Phebe, if she will? Though to have her and death were both one thing. I have promisd to make all this matter even. Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter; You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter; Keep your word, Phebe, that youll marry me, Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd; Keep your word, Silvius, that youll marry her, If she refuse me: and from hence I go, To make these doubts all even. I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughters favour. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him, Methought he was a brother to your daughter; But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born, And hath been tutord in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician, Obscured in the circle of this forest. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark.
Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools. Salutation and greeting to you all! Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one. And how was that taen up? Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow. I like him very well. God ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear, and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own: a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious. According to the fools bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases. But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
Upon a lie seven times removed:bear your body more seeming, Audrey:as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is called the retort courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the quip modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is called the reply churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer, I spake not true: this is called the reproof valiant: if again, it was not well cut, he would say, I lie: this is called the countercheck quarrelsome: and so to the lie circumstantial, and the lie direct. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut? I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie? O sir, we quarrel in print; by the book, as you have books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
The first, the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct; and you may avoid that too, with an if. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an if, as If you said so, then I said so; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your if is the only peace-maker; much virtue in if. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? hes as good at any thing, and yet a fool. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit. Then is there mirth in heaven, When earthly things made even Atone together. Good duke, receive thy daughter; Hymen from heaven brought her; Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his, Whose heart within her bosom is. To you I give myself, for I am yours. To you I give myself, for I am yours. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind. If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu! Ill have no father, if you be not he.
Ill have no husband, if you be not he: Nor neer wed woman, if you be not she. Peace, ho! I bar confusion: Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange events: Heres eight that must take hands To join in Hymens bands, If truth holds true contents. You and you no cross shall part: You and you are heart in heart: You to his love must accord, Or have a woman to your lord: You and you are sure together, As the winter to foul weather. Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing, Feed yourselves with questioning, That reason wonder may diminish, How thus we met, and these things finish. Wedding is great Junos crown: O blessed bond of board and bed! Tis Hymen peoples every town; High wedlock then be honoured. Honour, high honour, and renown, To Hymen, god of every town! O my dear niece! welcome thou art to me: Even daughter, welcome in no less degree. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine; Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine. Let me have audience for a word or two: I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressd a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword: And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where, meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world; His crown bequeathing to his banishd brother, And all their lands restord to them again That were with him exild. This to be true, I do engage my life. Welcome, young man; Thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding: To one, his lands withheld; and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. First, in this forest, let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot; And after, every of this happy number That have endurd shrewd days and nights with us, Shall share the good of our returned fortune, According to the measure of their states. Meantime, forget this new-falln dignity, And fall into our rustic revelry. Play, music! and you, brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heapd in joy, to the measures fall. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life, And thrown into neglect the pompous court? He hath. To him will I: out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learnd.
You to your former honour I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserve it: You to a love that your true faith doth merit: You to your land, and love, and great allies: You to a long and well-deserved bed: And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuald. So, to your pleasures: I am for other than for dancing measures. Stay, Jaques, stay. To see no pastime, I: what you would have Ill stay to know at your abandond cave. Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites, As we do trust theyll end, in true delights. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, tis true that a good play needs no epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me: my way is, to conjure you; and Ill begin with the women. I charge you, O women! for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you: and I charge you, O men!
for the love you bear to women,as I perceive by your simpering none of you hate them,that between you and the women, the play may please. If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina. He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him. How many gentlemen have you lost in this action? But few of any sort, and none of name. A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio. Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how. He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it. I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness. Did he break out into tears? In great measure. A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed: how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping! I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no? I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort. What is he that you ask for, niece?
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua. O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was. He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncles fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing. Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but hell be meet with you, I doubt it not. He hath done good service, lady, in these wars. You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it: he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach. And a good soldier too, lady. And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord? A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honourable virtues. It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,well, we are all mortal. You must not, sir, mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but theres a skirmish of wit between them. Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one!
so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother. Ist possible? Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books. No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil? He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio. O Lord! he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured. I will hold friends with you, lady. Do, good friend. You will never run mad, niece. No, not till a hot January. Don Pedro is approached. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave. You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter. Her mother hath many times told me so. Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her? Signior Benedick, no; for then you were a child. You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is. I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you. What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living? Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none. A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me. God keep your ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face. Scratching could not make it worse, an twere such a face as yours were. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher. A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i Gods name; I have done. You always end with a jades trick: I know you of old. This is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart. If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the prince your brother, I owe you all duty. I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you. Please it your Grace lead on? Your hand, Leonato; we will go together. Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato? I noted her not; but I looked on her.
Is she not a modest young lady? Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex? No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment. Why, i faith, methinks shes too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise: only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her. Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her. Would you buy her, that you inquire after her? Can the world buy such a jewel? Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song? In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on. I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: theres her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife. Ist come to this, i faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you. What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonatos? I would your Grace would constrain me to tell. I charge thee on thy allegiance. You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Graces part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonatos short daughter. If this were so, so were it uttered. Like the old tale, my lord: it is not so, nor twas not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord. By my troth, I speak my thought. And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine. And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
That I love her, I feel. That she is worthy, I know. That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake. Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty. And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will. That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,for the which I may go the finer,I will live a bachelor. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love. With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-makers pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid. Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder, and called Adam. Well, as time shall try: In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke. The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, Here is good horse to hire, let them signify under my sign Here you may see Benedick the married man. If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad. Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly. I look for an earthquake too then. Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonatos: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation. I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it, The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick. Nay, mock not, mock not.
The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you. My liege, your highness now may do me good. My love is thine to teach: teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good. Hath Leonato any son, my lord? No child but Hero; shes his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio? O! my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldiers eye, That likd, but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love; But now I am returnd, and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying, I likd her ere I went to wars. Thou wilt be like a lover presently, And tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her, and with her father, And thou shalt have her. Wast not to this end That thou beganst to twist so fine a story? How sweetly do you minister to love, That know loves grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salvd it with a longer treatise. What need the bridge much broader than the flood? The fairest grant is the necessity. Look, what will serve is fit: tis once, thou lovst, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have revelling to-night: I will assume thy part in some disguise, And tell fair Hero I am Claudio; And in her bosom Ill unclasp my heart, And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale: Then, after to her father will I break; And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. In practice let us put it presently. How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music? He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not of. Are they good? As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward.
The prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and, if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself. No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you, and tell her of it. Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time. What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad? There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit. You should hear reason. And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it? It not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance. I wonder that thou, being,as thou sayst thou art,born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief.
I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no mans jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no mans leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no mans business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour. Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath taen you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me. Can you make no use of your discontent?
I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here? What news, Borachio? I came yonder from a great supper: the prince, your brother, is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage. Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness? Marry, it is your brothers right hand. Who? the most exquisite Claudio? Even he. A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he? Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato. A very forward March-chick! How came you to this? Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio. Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me? To the death, my lord. To the death, my lord. Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go prove whats to be done? Well wait upon your lordship.
Was not Count John here at supper? I saw him not. How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after. He is of a very melancholy disposition. He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my ladys eldest son, evermore tattling. Then half Signior Benedicks tongue in Count Johns mouth, and half Count Johns melancholy in Signior Benedicks face, With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if a could get her good will. By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue. In faith, shes too curst. Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen Gods sending that way; for it is said, God sends a curst cow short horns; but to a cow too curst he sends none. So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns? Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen. You may light on a husband that hath no beard. What should I do with him?
dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell. Well then, go you into hell? No; but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; heres no place for you maids: so deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long. Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father. Yes, faith; it is my cousins duty to make curtsy, and say, Father, as it please you:but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, Father, as it please me. Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband. Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust?
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, Ill none: Adams sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred. Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer. The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave. Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly. I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight. The revellers are entering, brother: make good room. Lady, will you walk about with your friend? So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away. With me in your company? I may say so, when I please. And when please you to say so? When I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case!
My visor is Philemons roof; within the house is Jove. Why, then, your visor should be thatchd. Speak low, if you speak love. Well, I would you did like me. So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities. Which is one? I say my prayers aloud. I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen. God match me with a good dancer! Amen. And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk. No more words: the clerk is answered. I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio. At a word, I am not. I know you by the waggling of your head. To tell you true, I counterfeit him. You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Heres his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he. At a word, I am not. Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and theres an end. Will you not tell me who told you so? No, you shall pardon me. Nor will you not tell me who you are? Not now. That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the Hundred Merry Tales. Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so. Whats he? I am sure you know him well enough.
Not I, believe me. Did he never make you laugh? I pray you, what is he? Why, he is the princes jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me! When I know the gentleman, Ill tell him what you say. Do, do: hell but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then theres a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night. We must follow the leaders. In every good thing. Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor remains. And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing. Are you not Signior Benedick? You know me well; I am he.
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it. How know you he loves her? I heard him swear his affection. So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night. Come, let us to the banquet. Thus answer I in name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. Tis certain so; the prince woos for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love: Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues; Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero! Count Claudio? Yea, the same. Come, will you go with me? Whither? Even to the next willow, about your own business, count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurers chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenants scarf? You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero. I wish him joy of her. Why, thats spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would have served you thus? I pray you, leave me. Ho!
now you strike like the blind man: twas the boy that stole your meat, and youll beat the post. If it will not be, Ill leave you. Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The princes fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, Ill be revenged as I may. Now, signior, wheres the count? Did you see him? Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped. To be whipped! Whats his fault? The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoyd with finding a birds nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it. Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds nest. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you. O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it, would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the princes jester; that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too.
Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her. Look! here she comes. Will your Grace command me any service to the worlds end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester Johns foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Chams beard; do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me? None, but to desire your good company. O God, sir, heres a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue. Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it. You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek. Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad? Not sad, my lord. How then? Sick? Neither, my lord. The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion. I faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, Ill be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy! Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it! Speak, count, tis your cue. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange. Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither. In faith, lady, you have a merry heart. Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
And so she doth, cousin. Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband! Lady Beatrice, I will get you one. I would rather have one of your fathers getting. Hath your Grace neer a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them. Will you have me, lady? No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy! Niece, will you look to those things I told you of? I cry you mercy, uncle. By your Graces pardon. By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady. Theres little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing. She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband. O!
by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit. She were an excellent wife for Benedick. O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad. Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church? To-morrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites. Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction. My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights watchings. And I, my lord. And you too, gentle Hero? I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband. And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty.
I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift. It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato. Yea, my lord; but I can cross it. Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage? Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me. Show me briefly how. I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting-gentlewoman to Hero. I remember. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber-window. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage? The poison of that lies in you to temper.
Go you to the prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,whose estimation do you mightily hold up,to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero. What proof shall I make of that? Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue? Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing. Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio, asin love of your brothers honour, who hath made this match, and his friends reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero; hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Heros disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown. Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice.
Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats. Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me. I will presently go learn their day of marriage. Boy! Signior? In my chamber-window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard. I am here already, sir. I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again. I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known, when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes?
I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but Ill take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, thats certain; wise, or Ill none; virtuous, or Ill never cheapen her; fair, or Ill never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour. Come, shall we hear this music? Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is, As hushd on purpose to grace harmony! See you where Benedick hath hid himself? O! very well, my lord: the music ended, Well fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth. Come, Balthazar, well hear that song again. O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once. It is the witness still of excellency, To put a strange face on his own perfection. I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing; Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy; yet he woos; Yet will he swear he loves. Nay, pray thee, come; Or if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes. Note this before my notes; Theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks; Notes, notes, forsooth, and nothing! Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when alls done. Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, Men were deceivers ever; One foot in sea, and one on shore, To one thing constant never. Then sigh not so, But let them go, And be you blithe and bonny, Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny. Sing no more ditties, sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy; The fraud of men was ever so, Since summer first was leavy. Then sigh not so, But let them go, And be you blithe and bonny, Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny. By my troth, a good song. And an ill singer, my lord. Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it. Yea, marry; dost thou hear, Balthazar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Heros chamber-window. The best I can, my lord. Do so: farewell. Come hither, Leonato: what was it you told me of to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick? O! ay: Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. I did never think that lady would have loved any man. No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor. Ist possible? Sits the wind in that corner? By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of thought. May be she doth but counterfeit. Faith, like enough. O God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it. Why, what effects of passion shows she? Bait the hook well: this fish will bite. What effects, my lord? She will sit you; You heard my daughter tell you how. She did, indeed.
How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection. I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick. I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such reverence. He hath taen the infection: hold it up. Hath she made her affection known to Benedick? No; and swears she never will: thats her torment. Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: Shall I, says she, that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him? This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for shell be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all. Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of. O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet? That. O!
she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: I measure him, says she, by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should. Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; O sweet Benedick! God give me patience! She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true. It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it. To what end? he would but make a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse. An he should, it were an alms to hang him. Shes an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous. And she is exceeding wise. In everything but in loving Benedick. O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian. I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.
I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what a will say. Were it good, think you? Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness. She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, tis very possible hell scorn it; for the man,as you know all,hath a contemptible spirit. he is a very proper man. He hath indeed a good outward happiness. Fore God, and in my mind, very wise. He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit. And I take him to be valiant. As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear. If he do fear God, a must necessarily keep peace: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling. And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love? Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.
Nay, thats impossible: she may wear her heart out first. Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy to have so good a lady. My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready. If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation. Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage, and no such matter: thats the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumbshow. Let us send her to call him in to dinner. This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems, her affections have their full bent. Love me! why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending.
They say the lady is fair: tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! shes a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her. Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner. Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come. You take pleasure then in the message? Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knifes point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well. Ha!
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner, theres a double meaning in that. I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me, thats as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture. Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour; There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the prince and Claudio: Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her; say that thou overheardst us, And bid her steal into the pleached bower, Where honey-suckles, ripend by the sun, Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites, Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her, To listen our propose. This is thy office; Bear thee well in it and leave us alone. Ill make her come, I warrant you, presently. Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick: When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay. Now begin; For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference. The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream, And greedily devour the treacherous bait: So angle we for Beatrice; who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture. Fear you not my part of the dialogue. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it. No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful; I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggerds of the rock. But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? So says the prince, and my new-trothed lord. And did they bid you tell her of it, madam? They did entreat me to acquaint her of it; But I persuaded them, if they lovd Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection, And never to let Beatrice know of it. Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon? O god of love!
I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man; But nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice; Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprising what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly, that to her All matter else seems weak. She cannot love, Nor take no shape nor project of affection, She is so self-endeard. Sure, I think so; And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it. Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featurd, But she would spell him backward: if fair-facd, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick, Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; If low, an agate very vilely cut; If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; If silent, why, a block moved with none. So turns she every man the wrong side out, And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable. No; not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable. But who dare tell her so? If I should speak, She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like coverd fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly: It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling. Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say. No; rather I will go to Benedick, And counsel him to fight against his passion. And, truly, Ill devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with. One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking. O! do not do your cousin such a wrong. She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prizd to have,as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick. He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio. I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valour, Goes foremost in report through Italy. Indeed, he hath an excellent good name. His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. When are you married, madam? Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in: Ill show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow. Shes limd, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam. If it prove so, then loving goes by haps: Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps. What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such. And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand: If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band; For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly. I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon. Ill bring you thither, my lord, if youll vouchsafe me. Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks. Gallants, I am not as I have been. So say I: methinks you are sadder. I hope he be in love. Hang him, truant! theres no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money. I have the tooth-ache. Draw it. Hang it. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards. What!
sigh for the tooth-ache? Where is but a humour or a worm? Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it. Yet say I, he is in love. There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be a Dutchman to-day, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is. If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs: a brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode? Hath any man seen him at the barbers? No, but the barbers man hath been seen with him; and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls. Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard. Nay, a rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that? Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love. The greatest note of it is his melancholy. And when was he wont to wash his face? Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.
Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string, and new-governed by stops. Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love. Nay, but I know who loves him. That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not. Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him. She shall be buried with her face upwards. Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear. For my life, to break with him about Beatrice. Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet. My lord and brother, God save you! Good den, brother. If your leisure served, I would speak with you. In private? If it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him. Whats the matter? Means your lordship to be married to-morrow? You know he does. I know not that, when he knows what I know. If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it. You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent, and labour ill bestowed! Why, whats the matter? I came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,for she hath been too long a talking of,the lady is disloyal. Who, Hero? Even she: Leonatos Hero, your Hero, every mans Hero. Disloyal? The words too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall see her chamber-window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you love her then, to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind. May this be so? I will not think it. If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly. If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow, in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her. And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her. I will disparage her no further till you are my witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself. O day untowardly turned!
O mischief strangely thwarting! O plague right well prevented! So will you say when you have seen the sequel. Are you good men and true? Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul. Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the princes watch. Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry. First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable? Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read. Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature. Both which, Master constable, You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the princes name. How, if a will not stand?
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave. If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the princes subjects. True, and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured. We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch. Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. How if they will not? Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for. Well, sir. If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is, to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company. You have been always called a merciful man, partner. Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him. If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it. How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us? Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never answer a calf when he bleats. Tis very true. This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the princes own person: if you meet the prince in the night, you may stay him. Nay, by r lady, that I think, a cannot. Five shillings to one ont, with any man that knows the statues, he may stay him: marry, not without the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will. By r lady, I think it be so. Ha, ah, ha!
Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour. Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all go to bed. One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about Signior Leonatos door; for the wedding being there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech you. What, Conrade! Peace! stir not. Conrade, I say! Here, man, I am at thy elbow. Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a scab follow. I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale. Stand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee. Some treason, masters; yet stand close. Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats. Is it possible that any villany should be so dear? Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will. I wonder at it. That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man. Yes, it is apparel. I mean, the fashion. Yes, the fashion is the fashion. Tush!
I may as well say the fools the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is? I know that Deformed; a has been a vile thief this seven years; a goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember his name. Didst thou not hear somebody? No: twas the vane on the house. Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers in the reechy painting; sometime like god Bels priests in the old church-window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his cod-piece seems as massy as his club? All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Not so, neither; but know, that I have to-night wooed Margaret, the Lady Heros gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night,I tell this tale vilely:I should first tell thee how the prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. And thought they Margaret was Hero? Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the devil my master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw oer night, and send her home again without a husband. We charge you in the princes name, stand! Call up the right Master constable. We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth. And one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a wears a lock. Masters, masters! Youll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you. Masters, Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these mens bills. A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, well obey you. Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise. I will, lady. And bid her come hither. Well. Troth, I think your other rabato were better. No, pray thee, good Meg, Ill wear this. By my troths not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so. My cousins a fool, and thou art another: Ill wear none but this. I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gowns a most rare fashion, i faith. I saw the Duchess of Milans gown that they praise so. O! that exceeds, they say. By my troths but a night-gown in respect of yours: cloth o gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts round, underborne with a bluish tinsel; but for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten ont. God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy. Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man. Fie upon thee! art not ashamed? Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? is not marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord honourable without marriage?
I think you would have me say, saving your reverence, a husband: an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, Ill offend nobody. Is there any harm in the heavier for a husband? None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife; otherwise tis light, and not heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes. Good morrow, coz. Good morrow, sweet Hero. Why, how now! do you speak in the sick tune? I am out of all other tune, methinks. Claps into Light o love; that goes without a burden: do you sing it, and Ill dance it. Ye light o love with your heels! then, if your husband have stables enough, youll see he shall lack no barns. O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels. Tis almost five oclock, cousin; tis time you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill. Heigh-ho! For a hawk, a horse, or a husband? For the letter that begins them all, H. Well, an you be not turned Turk, theres no more sailing by the star. What means the fool, trow? Nothing I; but God send every one their hearts desire! These gloves the count sent me; they are an excellent perfume. I am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell. A maid, and stuffed! theres goodly catching of cold. O, God help me! God help me! how long have you professed apprehension? Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely!
It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your cap. By my troth, I am sick. Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm. There thou prickst her with a thistle. Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in this Benedictus. Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think, perchance, that I think you are in love: nay, byr lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging: and how you may be converted, I know not; but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do. What pace is this that thy tongue keeps? Not a false gallop. Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town, are come to fetch you to church. Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula. What would you with me, honest neighbour?
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns you nearly. Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me. Marry, this it is, sir. Yes, in truth it is, sir. What is it, my good friends? Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt, as, God help, I would desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows. Yes, I thank God, I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man and no honester than I. Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges. Neighbours, you are tedious. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor dukes officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship. All thy tediousness on me! ha? Yea, ant were a thousand pound more than tis; for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it. And so am I. I would fain know what you have to say. Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your worships presence, ha taen a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.
A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, when the age is in, the wit is out. God help us! it is a world to see! Well said, i faith, neighbour Verges: well, Gods a good man; an two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread: but God is to be worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour. Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you. Gifts that God gives. I must leave you. One word, sir: our watch, sir, hath indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship. Take their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in great haste, as may appear unto you. It shall be suffigance. Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well. My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband. Ill wait upon them: I am ready. Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men. And we must do it wisely. We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; heres that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.
Come, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards. You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady? No. To be married to her, friar; you come to marry her. Lady, you come hither to be married to this count? I do. If either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it. Know you any, Hero? None, my lord. Know you any, count? I dare make his answer; none. O! what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not knowing what they do! How now! Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah! ha! he! Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave: Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter? As freely, son, as God did give her me. And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift? Nothing, unless you render her again. Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness. There, Leonato, take her back again: Give not this rotten orange to your friend; Shes but the sign and semblance of her honour. Behold! how like a maid she blushes here. O! what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal. Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?
Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid, By these exterior shows? But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed; Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty. What do you mean, my lord? Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton. Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof, Have vanquishd the resistance of her youth, And made defeat of her virginity, I know what you would say: if I have known her, Youll say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the forehand sin: No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large; But, as a brother to his sister, showd Bashful sincerity and comely love. And seemd I ever otherwise to you? Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it: You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown; But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pamperd animals That rage in savage sensuality. Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide? Sweet prince, why speak not you? What should I speak? I stand dishonourd, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale. Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true. This looks not like a nuptial. True! O God! Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the prince? Is this the princes brother? Is this face Heros? Are our eyes our own? All this is so; but what of this, my lord? Let me but move one question to your daughter; And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly. I charge thee do so, as thou art my child. O, God defend me! how am I beset! What kind of catechizing call you this? To make you answer truly to your name. Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach? Marry, that can Hero: Hero itself can blot out Heros virtue. What man was he talkd with you yesternight Out at your window, betwixt twelve and one? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this. I talkd with no man at that hour, my lord. Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour, Myself, my brother, and this grieved count, Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night, Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window; Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessd the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret. Fie, fie! they are not to be namd, my lord, Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment. O Hero!
what a Hero hadst thou been, If half thy outward graces had been placd About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell, Thou pure impiety, and impious purity! For thee Ill lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious. Hath no mans dagger here a point for me? Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down? Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up. How doth the lady? Dead, I think! help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar! O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand: Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wishd for. How now, cousin Hero! Have comfort, lady. Dost thou look up? Yea; wherefore should she not? Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood? Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes; For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life. Grievd I, I had but one? Chid I for that at frugal natures frame? O! one too much by thee. Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in mine eyes?
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggars issue at my gates, Who smirched thus, and mird with infamy, I might have said, No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins? But mine, and mine I lovd, and mine I praisd, And mine that I was proud on, mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her; why, sheO! she is fallen Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again, And salt too little which may season give To her foul-tainted flesh. Sir, sir, be patient. For my part, I am so attird in wonder, I know not what to say. O! on my soul, my cousin is belied! Lady, were you her bedfellow last night? No, truly, not; although, until last night, I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow. Confirmd, confirmd! O! that is stronger made, Which was before barrd up with ribs of iron. Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie, Who lovd her so, that, speaking of her foulness, Washd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
Hear me a little; For I have only been silent so long, And given way unto this course of fortune, By noting of the lady: I have markd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness bear away those blushes; And in her eye there hath appeard a fire, To burn the errors that these princess hold Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations, Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenour of my book; trust not my age, My reverence, calling, nor divinity, If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error. Friar, it cannot be. Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is, that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury: she not denies it. Why seekst thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness? Lady, what man is he you are accusd of? They know that do accuse me, I know none; If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy! O, my father! Prove you that any man with me conversd At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintaind the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death. There is some strange misprision in the princes.
Two of them have the very bent of honour; And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies. I know not. If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour, The proudest of them shall well hear of it. Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine. Nor age so eat up my invention, Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, But they shall find, awakd in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly. Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case. Your daughter here the princes left for dead; Let her awhile be secretly kept in, And publish it that she is dead indeed: Maintain a mourning ostentation; And on your familys old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial. What shall become of this? What will this do? Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse; that is some good: But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must be so maintaind, Upon the instant that she was accusd, Shall be lamented, pitied and excusd Of every hearer; for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lackd and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio: When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparelld in more precious habit, More moving-delicate, and full of life Into the eye and prospect of his soul, Than when she livd indeed: then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver, And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true. Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levelld false, The supposition of the ladys death Will quench the wonder of her infamy: And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries. Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you: And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body. Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me. Tis well consented: presently away; For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day Perhaps is but prolongd: have patience and endure. Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while? Yea, and I will weep a while longer. I will not desire that. You have no reason; I do it freely. Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged. Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her. Is there any way to show such friendship? A very even way, but no such friend. May a man do it? It is a mans office, but not yours. I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange? As strange as the thing I know not.
It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as your, but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, not I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin. By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me. Do not swear by it, and eat it. I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you. Will you not eat your word? With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee. Why then, God forgive me! What offence, sweet Beatrice? You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you. And do it with all thy heart. I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest. Come, bid me do anything for thee. Kill Claudio. Ha! not for the wide world. You kill me to deny it. Farewell. Tarry, sweet Beatrice. I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I pray you, let me go. Beatrice, In faith, I will go. Well be friends first. You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy. Is Claudio thine enemy? Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What!
bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place. Hear me, Beatrice, Talk with a man out at a window! a proper saying! Nay, but Beatrice, Sweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone. Beat Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake, or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving. Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee. Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it. Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero? Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul. Enough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead; and so, farewell. Is our whole dissembly appeared? O!
a stool and a cushion for the sexton. Which be the malefactors? Marry, that am I and my partner. Nay, thats certain: we have the exhibition to examine. But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them come before Master constable. Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend? Borachio. Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah? I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade. Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God? Yea, sir, we hope. Yea, sir, we hope. Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first; for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves? Marry, sir, we say we are none. A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false knaves. Sir, I say to you we are none. Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you writ down, that they are none? Master constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call forth the watch that are their accusers. Yea, marry, thats the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you, in the princes name, accuse these men. This man said, sir, that Don John, the princes brother, was a villain. Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to call a princes brother villain. Master constable, Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee. What heard you him say else? Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully. Flat burglary as ever was committed. Yea, by the mass, that it is. What else, fellow? And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her. O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this. What else? This is all. And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonatos: I will go before and show him their examination. Come, let them be opinioned. Let them be in the hands Off, coxcomb! Gods my life! wheres the sexton? let him write down the princes officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty varlet! Away! you are an ass; you are an ass. Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and, which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had been writ down an ass! If you go on thus, you will kill yourself; And tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.
I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve: give not me counsel; Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine: Bring me a father that so lovd his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine, And bid him speak of patience; Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine, And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form: If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard; Bid sorrow wag, cry hem when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience. But there is no such man; for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air and agony with words. No, no; tis all mens office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no mans virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel: My griefs cry louder than advertisement. Therein do men from children nothing differ. I pray thee, peace!
I will be flesh and blood; For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance. Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself; Make those that do offend you suffer too. There thou speakst reason: nay, I will do so. My soul doth tell me Hero is belied; And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince, And all of them that thus dishonour her. Here come the prince and Claudio hastily. Good den, good den. Good day to both of you. Hear you, my lords, We have some haste, Leonato. Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord: Are you so hasty now?well, all is one. Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man. If he could right himself with quarrelling, Some of us would lie low. Who wrongs him? Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou. Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword; I fear thee not. Marry, beshrew my hand, If it should give your age such cause of fear. In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword. Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me: I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As, under privilege of age, to brag What I have done being young, or what would do, Were I not old.
Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wrongd mine innocent child and me That I am forcd to lay my reverence by, And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, Do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say thou hast belied mine innocent child: Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors; O! in a tomb where never scandal slept, Save this of hers, framd by thy villany! My villany? Thine, Claudio; thine, I say. You say not right, old man. My lord, my lord, Ill prove it on his body, if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood. Away! I will not have to do with you. Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast killd my child; If thou killst me, boy, thou shalt kill a man. He shall kill two of us, and men indeed: But thats no matter; let him kill one first: Win me and wear me; let him answer me. Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me. Sir boy, Ill whip you from your foining fence; Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will. Brother, Content yourself. God knows I lovd my niece; And she is dead, slanderd to death by villains, That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops! Brother Antony, Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple, Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go antickly, show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dangerous words, How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst; And this is all! But, brother Antony, Come, tis no matter: Do not you meddle, let me deal in this. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience. My heart is sorry for your daughters death; But, on my honour, she was chargd with nothing But what was true and very full of proof. My lord, my lord I will not hear you. No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard. And shall, or some of us will smart for it. See, see; here comes the man we went to seek. Now, signior, what news? Good day, my lord. Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray. We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth. Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them. In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both. We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it? Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side? Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us. As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry? What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care. Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject. Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross. By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed. If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle. Shall I speak a word in your ear? God bless me from a challenge! You are a villain; I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you. Well I will meet you, so I may have good cheer. What, a feast, a feast?
I faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calfs-head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knifes naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too? Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily. Ill tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. True, says she, a fine little one. No, said I, a great wit. Right, said she, a great gross one. Nay, said I, a good wit. Just, said she, it hurts nobody. Nay, said I, the gentleman is wise. Certain, said she, a wise gentleman. Nay, said I, he hath the tongues. That I believe, said she. for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: theres a double tongue; theres two tongues. Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy. For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not. Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old mans daughter told us all. All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden. But when shall we set the savage bulls horns on the sensible Benedicks head? Yea, and text underneath, Here dwells Benedick the married man!
Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him. He is in earnest. In most profound earnest; and, Ill warrant you, for the love of Beatrice. And hath challenged thee? Most sincerely. What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit! He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man. But, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he not say my brother was fled? Come, you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall neer weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to. How now! two of my brothers men bound! Borachio, one! Hearken after their offence, my lord. Officers, what offence have these men done?
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves. First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee whats their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge? Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, theres one meaning well suited. Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? this learned constable is too cunning to be understood. Whats your offence? Sweet prince, let me go no further to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Heros garments; how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my masters false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain. Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
I have drunk poison whiles he utterd it. But did my brother set thee on to this? Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it. He is composd and framd of treachery: And fled he is upon this villany. Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I lovd it first. Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass. Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too. Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him. Which of these is he? If you would know your wronger, look on me. Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killd Mine innocent child? Yea, even I alone. No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself: Here stand a pair of honourable men; A third is fled, that had a hand in it. I thank you, princes, for my daughters death Record it with your high and worthy deeds. Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it. I know not how to pray your patience; Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself; Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin: yet sinnd I not But in mistaking.
By my soul, nor I: And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That hell enjoin me to. I cannot bid you bid my daughter live; That were impossible: but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died; and if your love Can labour aught in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb, And sing it to her bones: sing it to-night. To-morrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child thats dead, And she alone is heir to both of us: Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge. O noble sir, Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me! I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio. To-morrow then I will expect your coming; To-night I take my leave. This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who, I believe, was packd in all this wrong, Hird to it by your brother. No, by my soul she was not; Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me; But always hath been just and virtuous In anything that I do know by her.
Moreover, sir,which, indeed, is not under white and black,this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in Gods name, the which he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for Gods sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point. I thank thee for thy care and honest pains. Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth, and I praise God for you. Theres for thy pains. God save the foundation! Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee. I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your worship to corect yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour. Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell. Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow. We will not fail. To-night Ill mourn with Hero. Bring you these fellows on. Well talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow. Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty? In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it. To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs? Thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth; it catches. And yours as blunt as the fencers foils, which hit, but hurt not. A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers. Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own. If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs. And therefore will come. The god of love, That sits above, And knows me, and knows me, How pitiful I deserve, I mean, in singing; but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of pandars, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self, in love.
Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to lady but baby, an innocent rime; for scorn, horn, a hard rime; for school, fool, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms. Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee? Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me. O, stay but till then! Then is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio. Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee. Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? For them all together; which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? Suffer love, a good epithet!
I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will. In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates. Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably. It appears not in this confession: theres not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself. An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps. And how long is that think you? Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore it is most expedient for the wise,if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin? Very ill. And how do you? Very ill too. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste. Madam, you must come to your uncle.
Yonders old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently? Will you go hear this news, signior? I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncles. Is this the monument of Leonato? It is, my lord. Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies: Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies. So the life that died with shame Lives in doath with glorious fame. Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb. Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn. Pardon, goddess of the night, Those that slew thy virgin knight; For the which, with songs of woe, Round about her tomb they go. Midnight, assist our moan; Help us to sigh and groan, Heavily, heavily: Graves, yawn and yield your dead, Till death be uttered, Heavily, heavily. Now, unto thy bones good night! Yearly will I do this rite. Good morrow, masters: put your torches out. The wolves have preyd; and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phbus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well Good morrow, masters: each his several way. Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds; And then to Leonatos we will go. And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds, Than this for whom we renderd up this woe! Did I not tell you she was innocent? So are the prince and Claudio, who accusd her Upon the error that you heard debated: But Margaret was in some fault for this, Although against her will, as it appears In the true course of all the question. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well. And so am I, being else by faith enforcd To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it. Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither maskd: The prince and Claudio promisd by this hour To visit me. You know your office, brother; You must be father to your brothers daughter, And give her to young Claudio. Which I will do with confirmd countenance. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think. To do what, signior? To bind me, or undo me; one of them. Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favour. That eye my daughter lent her: tis most true. And I do with an eye of love requite her.
The sight whereof I think, you had from me, From Claudio, and the prince. But whats your will? Your answer, sir, is enigmatical: But, for my will, my will is your good will May stand with ours, this day to be conjoind In the state of honourable marriage: In which, good friar, I shall desire your help. My heart is with your liking. And my help. Here come the prince and Claudio. Good morrow to this fair assembly. Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio: We here attend you. Are you yet determind To-day to marry with my brothers daughter? Ill hold my mind, were she an Ethiop. Call her forth, brother: heres the friar ready. Good morrow, Benedick. Why, whats the matter, That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness? I think he thinks upon the savage bull. Tush! fear not, man, well tip thy horns with gold, And all Europa shall rejoice at thee, As once Europa did at lusty Jove, When he would play the noble beast in love. Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low: And some such strange bull leapd your fathers cow, And got a calf in that same noble feat, Much like to you, for you have just his bleat. For this I owe you: here come other reckonings. Which is the lady I must seize upon? This same is she, and I do give you her. Why, then shes mine.
Sweet, let me see your face. No, that you shall not, till you take her hand Before this friar, and swear to marry her. Give me your hand: before this holy friar, I am your husband, if you like of me. And when I livd, I was your other wife: And when you lovd, you were my other husband. Another Hero! Nothing certainer: One Hero died defild, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid. The former Hero! Hero that is dead! She died, my lord, but whiles her slander livd. All this amazement can I qualify: When after that the holy rites are ended, Ill tell you largely of fair Heros death: Meantime, let wonder seem familiar, And to the chapel let us presently. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice? I answer to that name. What is your will? Do not you love me? Why, no; no more than reason. Why, then, your uncle and the prince and Claudio Have been deceived; for they swore you did. Do not you love me? Troth, no; no more than reason. Why, then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula, Are much deceivd; for they did swear you did. They swore that you were almost sick for me. They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me. Tis no such matter. Then, you do not love me? No, truly, but in friendly recompense. Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
And Ill be sworn upon t that he loves her; For heres a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashiond to Beatrice. And heres another, Writ in my cousins hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick. A miracle! heres our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity. I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption. Peace! I will stop your mouth. How dost thou, Benedick, the married man? Ill tell thee what, prince; a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No; if a man will be beaten with brains, a shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee. Come, come, we are friends. Lets have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heels. Well have dancing afterward. First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn. My lord, your brother John is taen in flight, And brought with armed men back to Messina. Think not on him till to-morrow: Ill devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!
