CNN Police said they are pursuing leads in the death of 8 year old Sandra Cantu, whose body was found Monday stuffed into a suitcase in a dairy farm pond near her Tracy, California, home. Sandra Cantu, 8, disappeared March 27. Her body was found at a dairy farm pond near her Calilfornia home. We are heading in a direction, Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters. To comment on that would compromise the investigation, and I can t do that. A search warrant was executed at the Tracy mobile home park where the girl lived, and a related search was to be conducted Tuesday at a nearby church, he said. He implied more than one person may have been involved in the death of Sandra, who had been missing since March 27. Investigators are looking at additional information they received since yesterday and, hopefully, that will lead us to Sandra s killers, he said. Asked if his use of the plural meant police were looking for more than one person, he responded, We have no specific suspects, ma am. Sheneman also implied the killer likely was familiar with the location where the body was found. He said he himself was unfamiliar with the location where the girl s body was found, despite having lived in the community for nearly 12 years. Someone would have to be familiar with that area to know to go there, he said. Watch how the suitcase was found . Sheneman said police had no one in custody, despite having interviewed hundreds of people regarding the case. Everyone that we speak to right now is being considered a person of interest, he said. We re not eliminating anyone. The autopsy was being conducted Tuesday, but it was not clear when the report would be available. It s going to be some time before we hear from the coroner, Sheneman said. I can t tell you when that s going to be.
More than 10 search warrants have been executed as part of the investigation and a lot of evidence has been recovered, Sheneman said. The day Sandra was last reported seen, she returned home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby. A short time later, wearing a pink Hello Kitty T shirt and black leggings, she left to go to another friend s home, according to a family spokeswoman. Police said Monday the girl s clothing helped them identify the body.
Southampton s extraordinary start to the season, maintained with a brilliant opportunist s goal from Victor Wanyama at the KC Stadium, has been built on the best defensive record in the country. The Saints have kept six clean sheets in 10 Premier League matches and conceded just five goals, two of them at Liverpool in the first match Ronald Koeman s side played together. Nathaniel Clyne is a key component of the division s best back line and the 23 year old right back sees no reason why this dream season cannot continue for club and country. Nathaniel Clyne has been in impressive form for high flying Southampton so far this season . Victor Wanyama s first time effort from 40 yards out gave Southampton an early lead at the KC Stadium . I think I ve got the ability to play for my country. Hopefully I can get the call up next time, he said. England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands as Clyne gave another fine attacking full back display at the KC Stadium. Southampton s five goals conceded is half the next lowest number in the Premier League, and the lowest per game in all of English football. He was an unused substitute in the last squad and hopes for another call up ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on November 15. Last time, I did. Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap. This has been the best season of his career to date. I feel fit, I feel strong, I m getting a lot of game time and I m enjoying it. Another Englishman, Ryan Bertrand, has been a star performer for the Saints this season . Hull boss Steve Bruce hopes Southampton stay near the upper regions of the Premier League . Southampton have another English full back on the opposite flank in Ryan Bertrand, and an England goalkeeper in Fraser Forster.
With centre halves Toby Alderweireld and Jose Fonte and defensive midfielders Wanyama left and Morgan Schneiderlin, Koeman has constructed a sturdy platform on which his flair players have freedom to operate. We work hard on our defensive shape in training and it shows during games, Clyne said. They only had one shot at goal. It s good and hopefully it continues. If you keep a clean sheet, you ve always got a chance of winning a game or getting a result that we need. Hull s manager, Steve Bruce, joined the chorus of praise for Southampton, saying it was refreshing to see them riding high. Let s hope they stay there. There s no reason they can t, if they can stay injury free. To be fair to everyone at Southampton, they can take a big pat on the back.
CNN A 17 year old student was formally charged Tuesday with the kidnapping, sexual assault and murder of 10 year old Jessica Ridgeway, whose body parts were found at a park in a Denver suburb earlier this month. Austin Reed Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, was also charged with attempting to kidnap, sexually assault and murder a female jogger last May. The charges were outlined in a 17 count accusation filed by Jefferson County, Colorado, District Attorney Pam Russell Tuesday. Sigg, who lived about one mile from Ridgeway s home in Westminster, was charged as an adult, a decision that could be challenged by his lawyers. The teen was arrested a week ago and accused of strangling Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing some of her body parts in a crawlspace under his family s home. Police first found parts of her body at a park 5 miles away five days after the bespectacled blonde girl disappeared while walking to Witt Elementary School on October 5. The big break in the investigation came last Tuesday night, when Sigg s mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed. Along with charges related to Jessica s death, Sigg is also accused in the May assault of a 22 year old woman on a hiking trail. Suspect in Jessica Ridgeway death made girls in the area uneasy . CNN s Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.

Donna Savigar was eating breakfast at a Newcastle under Lyme branch of McDonald s when she found a screw in her sausage and egg McMuffin above A grandmother who discovered a metal screw in her 3.39 McDonald s breakfast is outraged after staff did not offer her a refund. Donna Savigar ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin at a Newcastle under Lyme branch of the fast food chain around 9.45am on Friday. The 45 year old was three quarters of the way through her sandwich when she felt metal crunch between her teeth and spat out a screw. Donna s daughter Dayna Bennett, 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail but staff said they could only make her a fresh one. Ms Savigar, who works for a charity, said I could have ended up choking to death imagine if it had happened to a child. A child would start choking and you wouldn t know what to do because you certainly wouldn t be expecting them to have swallowed a screw in the middle of McDonald s. I don t see why they don t just pay up. All I was looking for was a refund. The mother of one, from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn t receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation. She added They need to train staff to deal with that sort of situation. A manager needs to come over and deal with it. We weren t offered a refund and we weren t even told how we could go about complaining to McDonald s about it, we had to Google that for ourselves. Scroll down for video . I had already eaten three quarters of the burger when I felt something weird in between my teeth. Your first instinct is to spit it out, so I did, and I couldn t believe it. It was about an inch big and quite fat. The mother of one above , from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn t receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation .
Ms Bennett, who works as a carer and lives in Alsagers Bank, Stoke on Trent, said It was absolutely outrageous. Imagine if it had been a child who ate it, they could have choked to death. Donna s daughter Dayna Bennett left above , 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail but staff did not offer a refund and instead suggested making a fresh McMuffin . We had gone in for a quick breakfast because we were going out shopping for the day. Mum was eating her McMuffin and then started making a funny face and then spat out the nail. I took a picture straight away so no one could say we had planted it there and then took the McMuffin back to the counter. They just took it away, I don t know what they did with it. Then they just asked if we wanted a fresh one. I said no and went back over to my mum. I couldn t believe they hadn t offered us a refund, but we didn t go and ask again because we just wanted to get out of there by that point. I ve never been to McDonald s before and I won t be going back. McDonald s confirmed it is investigating. A spokesman said We are sorry for Ms Bennett s experience when visiting our restaurant. Food safety and quality are our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products. An investigation is underway following the reporting of this incident and our Customer Service department will be in touch with Ms Bennett to keep her updated. The embarrassing incident comes days after another McDonald s diner, April Gilmour, 24, discovering beard trimmings in her breakfast McMuffin, in Kilmarnock.

But a trio of Chicago teens stand accused of just that after being arrested this week on auto burglary charges. Police have publicly thanked a local resident who called authorities and accurately described the serial thieves, allowing officers to track them down and put an end to the crime spree. Because that one person took the time to call there, there are definitely dozens of other people whose things aren t going to go missing at this point, Park Ridge Deputy Police Chief Lou Jogmen told CBS Chicago. Good at what they do Michael Staples, 17 left , Nikolas Pena, 18 right , and Stevan Bulatovic, 18 below , are accused of stealing cash and valuables from at least 100 cars in a one month Chicago crime spree . Chicago police say the three teens spent less than a minute in each car and were capable of breaking into 12 in one night. Stevan Bulatovic pictured is one of the trio facing charges . Stevan Bulatovic, 18, Nikolas Pena, 18, and Michael T. Staples, 17, all of Harwood Heights, currently face one misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a motor vehicle each, and two counts of burglary to a motor vehicle. But police say the three are responsible for more than 100 car burglaries in Chicago and across surrounding suburbs Park Ridge, Northbrook, Glenview, Niles and are looking to press further charges. Deputy Police Chief Jogmen said the young men typically targeted unlocked vehicles late at night. They moved quickly to take anything they could. The three walked away with cash, laptop computers, cell phones, cameras, GPS systems, wallets and other valuables. They would would hit up to 12 cars a night, according to police.
Chicago Police say the team of three would wait for the cover of darkness before hitting cars late at night . It was in and out, said Jogmen. They were literally in the car for a minute or less and then they moved on to the next one just went up the block and continued to pull on doors and when they found an open one they went inside, saw what they could take, and took it. But it wasn t every night. I m sure they took a couple days off here and there, Jogmen said. All three were held on a 5,000 bond and are due back in court in December.

CNN Several years ago, Satwant Singh Kaleka put a large American flag in the front of his yard, raising the eyebrows of his children, who thought it might be considered an eyesore. Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. The elder Kaleka, 65, served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Milwaukee, scene of Sunday morning s mass shooting. He was one of six community members killed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting . He lived the American dream, Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them.

Anything she did, it was for us, said her older son Kamal Saini, 20. If there wasn t enough to eat it was always us before she ate. When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday, My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave, said Kamal Saini. Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave.
She was just getting up. She was shot in the back. Her dream was for her sons to be educated. She told us education is everything here, said Kamal Saini.

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any indecent or grossly offensive message that causes distress or anxiety to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale i.e. no more than 2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport sky high was charged under the Communications Act 2003. Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed to The Mail on Sunday that the maximum six month sentence for internet abuse will be quadrupled . The tougher new legislation is already being dubbed Chloe s Law after Miss Madeley s public stance against the disturbing messages.

Finnigan apologised several times for causing offence, insisting that rape was an appalling crime , and saying she was merely discussing the legal facts of the case . But the trolls merely turned on her daughter, with one saying Judy s given me her blessing to rape you. Another tweet, directed at her mother, said Hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot. In a message put up via Twitter, Chloe said My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society. The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. While it may anger some that the term non violent rape exists, unfortunately it does. Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable.
To believe that my mother is pro non violent rape is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic. At the time, Madeley used Twitter to warn the trolls he would go to police, saying I have noted every sick troll threat. Do they really think it s ok to wish threaten rape on a woman They re in deep trouble, trust me. He added Trolls who sent sick rape threats Prosecution awaits you. A Scotland Yard spokesman said today An allegation of harassment was made to Barnet police relating to messages received via a social media site. Targeted Stella Creasy MP, left, and historian Mary Beard, right, have both been victims of online trolling . A criminal investigation has commenced. There are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue. Last month Peter Nunn, a 33 year old delivery driver from Bristol, was jailed for 18 weeks for using Twitter to threaten to rape Labour MP Stella Creasy in response to her backing of a campaign to put Jane Austen on the 10 note. Historian Mary Beard was trolled after she appeared on television, with one troll, Cambridge student Oliver Rawlings, 20, calling her a filthy old slut . She later accepted his invitation to lunch to apologise, and said afterwards He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name, that is what comes up. Rape in Britain is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force a decade ago, replacing and refining previous legislation. One of the key changes under the new Act was to define consent. A person consents if they agree to have sex by choice, and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice.
Therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink, the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice, ie did not consent. The law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent. Source rapecrisis.org.uk .

He added The plane remains safely buried in the sand. We know where it is, no one else does. That s the only reason it hasn t been picked apart by looters.

Montreal s Olympic Stadium is known as the Big O, but for many of the city s taxpayers it is really the Big Owe. It took us 30 years to pay it off and as a taxpayer I m not too happy about it, said one Montreal resident, echoing the anger that many here still feel about the way the games were funded in 1976. It was not very well managed as a financial project. And we have a fabulous stadium, but I think it cost more than all the covered stadia in North America put together, said Dick Pound, former International Olympic Committee vice president and a prominent resident of the Canadian city. However, Pound said calling the Montreal games of 1976 the bankrupt Olympics is a bad rap, and pointed out that the games actually made money. He said they paved the way for a new financial structure and the introduction of lucrative new television rights deals. People still come up to him and remember how well the Montreal games were staged and, in the end, how exciting they were, he added. They were pretty magic. All Olympics are magic but we had Comaneci with her first 10 and we had the Spinks brothers and we had Sugar Ray Leonard, he said. I mean we had some magnificent heroes of the modern Olympics. But there is weariness in Montreal about being known for staging the Olympic games that almost bankrupted a city. The city s mayor at the time, Jean Drapeau, famously remarked that if the games end up having a deficit, men will have babies. And it was in large part due to the Olympic Stadium construction that the statement seems so ridiculous now. The Olympic debt was nearly US 1.48 billion, and the stadium itself has been an engineering nightmare the retractable roof has struggled to worked properly over the years and almost forced the closure of the entire arena last year amid safety concerns. But the city s current government insists Montreal has put that legacy behind it and the Olympic stadium is now a key attraction.
Now it is paid, and it s profitable for Montreal to keep it, said Manon Barbe, the councillor in charge of sports and leisure for the city. Barbe pointed out that the legacy of the games has created a sporting city that nurtures hundreds of elite athletes. Today Montreal has more than 1,000 elite athletics and more than 100 coaches. And if it s that high, it s not a coincidence. It is because we decided to keep most of our sporting facilities, said Barbe. One of those facilities is the Claude Robillard Sporting Center, an impressive training facility for more than a dozen sports that nurtures athletes of all ages. During the 76 games, the center hosted handball and water polo and was a training center for athletics, swimming and field hockey. Today, hundreds of aspiring athletes receive access to coaching and equipment, much of it subsidized by the city of Montreal. On most days you will find former Canadian Olympian Hank Palmer here on the track, either indoors or outdoors, or training in the pool or weights room. If I didn t have this center, I probably wouldn t be at the peak I am, I would not have the career I ve been able to have, said the sprinter, who competed at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. This center really helped me develop myself, not only as a track athlete but an athlete in general because I have so many other sports around me. I can cross train, do basketball, soccer, weight training, anything.
Manu Tuilagi is a major doubt for the World Cup after it emerged the England and Leicester star is unlikely to play again this season. The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster s team sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said Manu is improving but it is a long process. The likelihood is, he may not play this season. He may or may not play this season. England coach Stuart Lancaster left has been hit by the news Manu Tuilagi could miss the World Cup . Tuilagi centre has a groin injury that could rule him out of England s tournament in September . Fears that Tuilagi s groin injury is worse than first feared were confirmed by his club Leicester . The 23 year old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as Gilmore s Groin , is now likely to have just three warm up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18. Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations. Tuilagi is considered one of the first names on the England team sheet when he is fit to play . Tuilagi will try to be fit for the start of England s World Cup campaign, which begins on September 18 . Tuilagi right missed the whole of England s Six Nations campaign due to injury .
As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad. But serious questions will now be asked about the management of his injury after surgery was delayed in a bid to get him fit. England had better news last night when Saracens confirmed injured duo Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt as expected to return in the next two to three weeks.
Best selling children s book The Elf On The Shelf is a disturbing cultural phenomenon which instills in young children the idea that a surveillance state is perfectly acceptable, claims a university professor. Laura Pinto, a digital technology professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, has published a paper in which she argues that the elf has a very sinister undertow. In her recently published paper, Who s The Boss, she claims that the idea of the elf reporting back to Santa each night on the child s behavior sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures. Professor Laura Pinto believes that the idea of an elf reporting back to Santa each night on a child s behavior sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has quickly become an integral part of modern Christmas celebrations. It has sold over six million copies and in 2013 was included as a float in the Macy s Thanksgiving parade for the first time. The story describes how Santa s scout elves hide in people s homes to watch over events. Once everyone goes to bed, the scout elf then flies back to the North Pole to report to Santa the activities both naughty and nice that have taken place throughout the day. Before the family wakes up each morning, the scout elf flies back from the North Pole and hides. By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house, the scout elf and the family play an on going game of hide and seek. Pinto has called the elf an external form of non familial surveillance, and says it is potentially conditioning children to accept state surveillance too. Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has sold over 6 million copies and in 2013 it was included as a float in the Macy s Thanksgiving parade for the first time .
If you grow up thinking it s cool for the elves to watch me and report back to Santa, well, then it s cool for the NSA to watch me and report back to the government, she told Inside Halton. Pinto isn t the first person to criticize and question the message that The Elf On The Shelf teaches kids. Atlantic columnist Kate Tuttle called it a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a tradition , and its purpose to spy on kids as inappropriate for the holiday season. Washington Post reviewer Hank Stuever characterized the concept as just another nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes. Writing for Psychology Today, Dr. David Kyle Johnston called it a dangerous parental crutch , with much the same reasoning as what he terms the Santa lie. The best selling book was written and self published by American author Carol Aebersold and her daughter Chanda Bell . In her paper, Pinto also argues that the book teaches children to potentially cater to The Elf On The Shelf as the other, rather than engaging in and honing understandings of social relationships with peers, parents, teachers and real life others. You re teaching kids a bigger lesson, which is that it s OK for other people to spy on you and you re not entitled to privacy, she tells the Toronto Star.
CNN This week marks one of the most exciting non major events of the golf season the Players Championship at the famed TPC Sawgrass. With a deep field and a great course, you won t want to miss any of the action. Before the tournament tees off, we had a chance to catch up with TPC Sawgrass PGA Head Professional Matt Borocz, who provided some inside insight on the home of the PGA Tour. PGA.com Thanks for joining us. This week presents one of the most exciting on the schedule with the Players Championship. What is it that makes the Players such a special event Borocz It s the Players Championship... The Players is crown jewel of the PGA Tour. The world s best golfers are on a course that demands the highest level of shot making and offers an unbelievable fan experience. It s also the highest purse in golf with the champion taking home 1.71 million at the end of the week. The Players Stadium Course was specifically built to host the Players Championship and offer our fans the best possible viewing. Everyone wants to see the action on the final three holes, especially the 17th. It s the lure of the hole and watching the best players in the world challenge the island green. PGA.com We can t talk about the Players without mentioning the world famous, par 3 17th island green, which you just touched on. I recently heard a promo with a player saying, 51 weeks a year, No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass is the easiest hole in the world for Tour players. I don t know if I would agree with that, but of course, that 52nd week is the Players. We know why it s daunting, but it s less than 150 yards. Is there any truth to what that Tour player said Borocz A few stats on the 17thhole it plays 121 yards from the middle of the championship tee to the front of the green.
To the back of the green it s 146 yards. The 17th green is 3,912 square feet compared to the average of 4,500 square feet. The challenge of the 17th hole is its ability to taunt the mental toughness of a player. It s a very calculating shot because you have to factor the wind, firmness of the green and avoid looking at the body of water surrounding the island green. During the Players, you add in the thousands of fans We give tours every day to visitors and the No. 1 comment of amazement is, The green looks so small compared to television. Making a par 3 on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass will bring a smile to all players, whether they are a novice or the best players in the world. PGA.com Henrik Stenson of Sweden is your defending champion. Through the years with the likes of Stenson, Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Stephen Ames, Steve Elkington, Greg Norman, Nick Price the list goes on the Players has had quite a list of international champions. What is it about the course that yields such diverse champions Borocz In the 36 year history of the Players, 10 of the victories have been by international players. The Players Stadium Course does not favor any style of player. The goal of former Commissioner Deane Beman was to create a golf course that had balance in regards to distance, wind direction and shot making. He wanted to create a goal course that was fair and would challenge every skill of the game. The goal at the end of week is to crown the greatest player in world. The diversity of the field allows the Players and PGA Tour to expand the scope of the tournament to a world wide audience. PGA.com In 1994, Greg Norman won the Players with a remarkable 24 under 264. That s by far the best winning score in tournament history.
Is there any chance someone could come within a sniff of that this year Borocz In 1994, when Greg Norman set the overall tournament record, the conditions started off perfect the first round with 76 players shooting under par. Norman started off on Thursday with a course record round of 63, followed by three rounds of 67 s to beat Fuzzy Zoeller by four shots. In 1994, the Players was played in March. With the tournament now being played in May the course is much firmer and faster conditions. In March, we had a lot of inconsistency in weather. It could be in the high 70s and beautiful or in the 50s with rain. The temperatures have become much more consistent, but the golf course plays much differently. When played in March, the golf course was overseeded. It s now Bermuda grass all year. The golf ball has more opportunity to run through the fairways and the greens. The forecast is shaping up to be a beautiful week. PGA.com Final question. What s the best part about working at TPC Sawgrass Borocz Excellent question... TPC Sawgrass is a very special place being that it s the home of the Players and PGA Tour. It is a privilege to work around such a passionate and dedicated group of people. Everyone on our team is focused on creating a magical experience for the Tour players, members and guests. Every team member comes to the club with a positive can do attitude. We have a team that is extremely dedicated and passionate about their role at the club. One of the most special things about TPC Sawgrass is the interaction with all the people that travel from all over the world to visit. Many of them have personal stories and connections why TPC Sawgrass is their favorite course. There are definitely days that you have to pinch yourself. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to work at such a beautiful place that is showcased to the world every year.

Steven Flynn forced open a window at McDiarmid Park with a crowbar in an attempt to find money to pay off drug debts. A court heard that police officers arrived at the stadium at 02 40 after an alarm went off, but did not realise there had been a break in. A cleaner raised the alarm after seeing cupboards had been rummaged through. Perth Sheriff Court was told that Flynn, who has convictions for 120 previous offences, opened a door onto the pitch and walked around the Premier League club s ground until the police went away. It was only when the cleaner turned up several hours later and noticed that Flynn had rummaged around several cupboards and stolen keys and charity cash that a full investigation began. Flynn, 29, was jailed for 16 months after he admitted breaking into St Johnstone s stadium on 14 November last year and stealing keys and a charity box containing Â 20. Fiscal depute Sue Ruta told the court At 02 40 there had been an alarm activation within the stadium. Police attended and noted an insecure window on the ground floor. Officers believed that had been accidentally left open and they left the stadium. When the cleaner arrived, she noticed the alarm was ringing and the cupboard behind reception was open. Police were called and officers saw muddy footprints in the reception area. Ms Ruta said A crowbar covered in mud was recovered beneath the reception desk. CCTV covered this area and police viewed it and positively identified the accused. Solicitor David Holmes, defending, said He told the police he committed the offence because he wanted money. Money was owed to the people from whom he received drugs.

A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Laboratory tests suggest that the drug is likely to be effective in melanoma patients who no longer respond to existing treatments. Known as a panRAF inhibitor, the drug may also help people with a strain of cancer that cannot be treated with standard drugs. Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. Scroll down for video . A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Scientists say it is likely to be effective in patients no longer responding to existing treatments . In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimated that it killed 9,710 people in 2014. The cancer is triggered by short, sharp bursts of sunlight and those who have been burnt at least five times are at double the risk of the disease. Surgery is always the first treatment option. But in more advanced cases patients are given drugs that suppress faulty versions of a protein called BRAF, which fuels the growth of about half of all melanomas. While BRAF inhibitors are initially very effective, the cancers generally become resistant to them within a year. The new drugs, which target a wider range of biological pathways in order to kill cancer cells, have been shown to halt the growth of resistant tumours. They also appear to work against the 20 per cent to 25 per cent of melanomas driven by a different defective protein, RAS. Professor Caroline Springer, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, who co led a study, said Melanomas often respond initially to the current generation of treatments, but they inevitably acquire resistance to them, and there is a desperate need for more effective options. Our new inhibitors are the first in a new family of drugs that attack cancers without allowing them the get out clause of drug resistance, by blocking multiple cancer proteins at once.
We are very hopeful that clinical trials from this series of new inhibitors will begin very soon and that they will ultimately become new first or second line options for patients who, at the moment, exhaust all the available treatments and end up with fatal disease. Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. In the U.S., it killed approximately 9,710 people in 2014 . Her colleague, Professor Richard Marais, director of the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, based at the University of Manchester, added Our laboratory study showed that these new drugs deliver multiple blows to cancer by hitting several cell survival routes at once. It s a step on from the drugs that are currently available which can t multitask in this way. The next step is testing this family of drugs in clinical trials to establish that they are both safe and effective in cancer patients, potentially providing urgently needed new treatments for patients who have run out of options. The trial is likely to involve a small number of patients and focus mainly on safety and dosage, although it might also produce some data about the drug s effectiveness. If you are unhappy with your looks, there is a greater risk of skin cancer, scientists have warned. A study found that people who believe they are unattractive are more likely to gamble with their skin s health by basking in the sun. They are also less likely to use sunscreen. The UK and US researchers say that those with low body confidence may crave a tan in the belief that the golden glow makes them look better. Alternatively, they may simply care less about their health. The finding could be used to improve advertising campaigns about the danger posed by skin cancer. Assuming the results are positive, further larger trials will look more closely at how well the drug performs. Few details of the trial are available at this stage and the number of patients due to take part is yet to be determined.
But Professor Springer said funding had been agreed and an application made for ethical approval. She added We re all very excited and very hopeful, because it s very important to have different therapies to offer patients who have become resistant to existing treatments. Patients will be given one specific drug which was chosen from hundreds of candidates after rigorous testing. In the laboratory study, two drugs code named CCT 196969 and CCT 241161 were tested. Both suppressed drug resistant tumours from patients grown in mice without significant side effects. Dr Richard Seabrook, of Wellcome Trust, which co funded the research together with Cancer Research UK, said Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 people diagnosed in 2011. Doctors already have frontline drugs to treat melanoma, but many patients gradually develop resistance to them and are left with few other treatment options. This research, which discovered how two newly developed compounds could treat drug resistant skin cancer, may give hope to the thousands who find themselves in this situation. The study was published in the journal Cancer Cell.
Mobile, Alabama CNN Brianna Adkins stepped off the Carnival Triumph early Friday and into the arms of her anxious parents, bringing to an end the nightmarish journey aboard a crippled ship that was towed to port days after it was due. It was a big, tight hug between 18 year old Adkins and her mom and dad, the kind filled with the emotion that reflected the days of uncertainty after the cruise ship was left virtually dead in the water after a reported engine fire knocked out power. Just to be with them, just to let them know I m safe, Adkins said, fighting back tears. It means just so much to be with them ... you have no idea. My celebration trup on the Carnival Triumph From joy to misery . A near party atmosphere abounded aboard the cruise ship as it docked late Thursday at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, where some passengers hung over balcony rails, while others danced and waved signs. I kissed the ground when I got off, said Adkins of Noblesville, Indiana, just north of Indianapolis. The saga began unfolding early Sunday morning as the Carnival Triumph, originally carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members, was making its way to Galveston, Texas, when a fire left the vessel listing to the side and drifting in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship drifted nearly 90 miles before enough tugboats arrived to tow the massive cruise ship to Mobile. Almost immediately, reports emerged on social media of deteriorating conditions aboard the ship. Passengers reported sewage sloshing in the hallways and, in some cases, running down the walls of cabins. Still others said the power outage forced people, especially those in the lower decks or inside cabins, to drag their mattresses to outside decks because of stifling heat. The power outage also made it impossible for passengers to call loved ones.
Why did it take five days For those who were able to get messages out drafting on wireless from cruise ships dropping supplies it was a few moments to reassure loved ones they were OK. Still, for Adkins and others there was nothing better than being able to put both feet on firm ground while wrapping their arms around family members. The unknown was the worst part, Adkins mother, Beth, said. About 75 families were on hand, according to a spokesman for the City of Mobile, at the Alabama Cruise Terminal. Family members who spoke to CNN said they had come from Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana and Texas. Some had come in as early as Wednesday but the bulk of people arrived Thursday afternoon, with each hour bringing a few more cars. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court Most of the anxious families couldn t bear the thought of their relatives being on a bus for hours and had gotten hotel rooms in Mobile where the homecoming would include a long shower and a meal. Brooklyn Burgess, 18, got off the ship scanning the crowd for father and brother, who had driven from their Carthage, Mississippi, home to get them and bring them home. There in the crowd, she and her mother, who was traveling with her, found the family. Her father picked her up in a tight hug, and Burgess started to cry. I said I don t have a boyfriend. ... I sure hope somebody who missed me is there waiting for me, she said, her eyes red from tears. Video Passengers spell out help . For others, it will be a little longer before they connect with loved ones. Brittany Ferguson and Kendall Jenkins, both 24, got off the ship cheering and dancing. Jenkins went so far as to lay kneel down and kiss the ground. We won this cruise at a Houston Rockets game. Lucky us, Ferguson said, laughing.
They are among the many who boarded one of the more than 100 motor coaches that were reserved by Carnival to take them to New Orleans where many will overnight before continuing their journey home. The two are headed home to Houston. But that s OK with the Ferguson and Jenkins because they have land under our feet. Spate of fires hits cruise industry . CNN s Erin Burnett and Martin Savidge reported from Mobile, Alabama Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta.

She was hurt when the MR 01 race car she was driving hit a support truck at Duxford airfield in Cambridgeshire on Tuesday. It was the first time the 32 year old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive HSE visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke s Hospital in Cambridge embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident . It said The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. Maria remains in a critical but stable condition. John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke s Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. Maria s care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them. De Villota sustained her injuries after her car suddenly accelerated into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. She didn t move for about 15 minutes. He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.
Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don t know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. It s terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain s first F1 drivers. She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1. So this is a very sad situation. Thankfully, she is not in a life threatening situation so we have to look at the positive side. We will see Maria again. Lewis Hamilton tweeted Just heard about Maria s terrible accident at Duxford. I hope she pulls through. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time. The McLaren driver said later I don t understand how it happened or how it was able to happen.

A stunning start saw tries from Peceli Yato and David Strettle help Clermont into an early 15 0 lead. Four penalties from Johnny Sexton then cut the gap to three but a Morgan Parra penalty and Camille Lopez drop goal seemed to have won it. Garry Ringrose s score cut the gap to two but Lopez s boot saw Clermont home. Clermont two time finalists but yet to win the tournament will meet Saracens in Edinburgh on Saturday, 13 May. Clermont are the nearly men of French rugby, having lost to Toulon in Europe s top club tournament in the 2013 and 2015 finals, and won only one of their 12 French finals and that at the 11th attempt. But they started as a side used to the biggest stages, and their early pressure brought them deserved tries from the impressive Fiji flanker Yato and livewire former England winger Strettle. Both sides are attack minded but Leinster were struggling to get hold of the ball and it was not until the end of the half they finally enjoyed some pressure of their own. Ireland fly half Sexton got them on the board with the last kick of a half in which they had been totally outplayed. Leinster needed to start the second half the better and duly attacked from deep on their first possession. They proceeded to come at Clermont from every angle, with three quick penalties enabling Sexton to cut the gap to only three points. Then came the decisive moment of the game. The supporting Dan Leavy thought he had scored for Leinster, but the television match official had noticed an infringement back at the start of the move. His eagle eyes spotted that flanker Leavy himself had held on to Aurelien Rougerie at a ruck to open the gap Leinster had first streamed through 60 metres back upfield.
Not only did Leinster have the try struck off but they also conceded a penalty, which Parra stroked over to put Clermont further ahead. Lopez banged over a drop goal from distance to put Clermont more than seven points clear, only for Ireland centre Ringrose to score a fine converted try and cut the gap to two points. But the outstanding Fritz Lee won the latest in a series penalties at a ruck to halt a Leinster attack and Lopez s accurate boot did the rest to send Clermont into the final. Leinster fly half Johnny Sexton I felt that we could still win it at half time. We should have made them work harder for their scores they got a 15 point head start. We were beaten by an impressive side, who have been impressive all year. We have to take our hats off and say they were better than us. Clermont s ex England Saracens wing David Strettle We always knew they would have a purple patch. We had to start well, hold on when they got on top after half time and then finish strongly. I think Saracens have got better since I left, but I can see in the two years that I have been here how important this tournament is to the club.

Washington CNN Russia appointed actor Steven Seagal as a special representative on US Russian humanitarian ties, the country s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in statement on its official Facebook page Saturday. According to the statement , the action star s role will be to promote US Russia relations in the humanitarian sphere, adding that the role will include collaboration in the sphere of culture, public and youth exchanges. The foreign ministry said the unpaid role will be similar to the United Nations goodwill ambassador positions. Seagal, who became a Russian citizen in 2016, is a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He attended Putin s recent swearing in ceremony in May. Seagal has been an ardent supporter of Putin, going so far as to defend his government against allegations of election meddling in the United States. He told Piers Morgan on the British ITV network s Good Morning Britain last year, For anyone to think that Vladimir Putin had anything to do with fixing the elections, or even that the Russians have that kind of technology, is stupid. And this kind of propaganda is really a diversion ... so that the people in the United States of America won t really see what s happening, he added. In the interview, Seagal also praised Putin as a great world leader and a brilliant tactician. In 2013, BuzzFeed reported that Putin suggested to President Barack Obama that Seagal serve as an honorary envoy of Russia to help improve relations between the two countries. Also that year, California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher credited Seagal with facilitating meetings for a congressional delegation that visited Russia in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings to investigate the suspects backgrounds and discuss intelligence sharing issues. CNN has reached out Seagal s spokesperson for comment.
This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ... me Minister Youssef Chahed Только что состоялась ещё одна встреча в рамках нашего визита в Тунис с Премьер министром этой страны Ю.Шахедом, которая была посвящена планам наращивания нашего торгово экономического и инвестиционного сотрудничества.
Мы выразили удовлетворение темпами роста товарооборота, договорились работать над тем, чтобы его структура становилась более сбалансированной. Этим вопросам будет посвящено заседание Межправительственной комиссии по торгово экономическому и научно техническому сотрудничеству, которое планируется в первой половине этого года здесь, в Тунисе.
Мы также напомнили нашим тунисским коллегам о том, что в прошлом году Российская Федерация предложила подписать программу торгово экономического и научно технического сотрудничества между нашими странами на 2019 2021 годы.
Мы попросили, и Премьер Министр Туниса Ю.Шахед обещал это сделать, ускорить согласование этой программы, чтобы она могла быть одобрена на предстоящем заседании Межправительственной комиссии.
Также договорились ускорить ратификацию подписанного ранее межправительственного соглашения о сотрудничестве в сфере мирного использования ядерной энергии и подписание целого ряда других проектов и документов, которые касаются облегчения визового режима, автомобильного транспорта и сотрудничества в сфере охраны окружающей среды.
Тунисские коллеги также проинформировали нас о планах развития инфраструктуры своей страны. Они заинтересованы в том, чтобы российские компании, прежде всего занимающиеся строительством автомобильных и железных дорог, участвовали в соответствующих тендерах. Будем поощрять наших экономических операторов откликаться на такие предложения.
С удовлетворением отметили развитие сотрудничества между Тунисом и российскими регионами, в частности между Тунисом и Татарстаном. Президент Татарстана Р.Н.Минниханов посетил эту страну в октябре прошлого года. Состоялся бизнес форум с участием бизнесменов Туниса и Татарстана. Такие контакты мы также будем всячески поощрять.
В целом беседа была конкретной, предметной и помогла лучше понять, как нам двигаться по пути дальнейшего развития нашего сотрудничества во всех областях.
The falls came after the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers suggested that the Cyprus model, which involves a tax on bank deposits, could form a template in any future bailout. On Monday morning, hopes the deal would solve the crisis lifted shares. By 15 30 GMT, all major European markets had fallen into negative territory, joined by US stocks. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, later addressed his country in a television broadcast. The deal was painful but the best that could have been struck under the circumstances, he said. He said that controls limiting restricting the movement of capital would be temporary and he promised to protect the weak, saying that welfare payments would be met. Earlier, markets in Europe and the US moved downwards when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch Finance Minister who as head of the Eurogroup played a key role in the Cyprus negotiations, said the deal represented a new template for resolving future eurozone banking problems. If there is a risk in a bank our first question should be OK, what are you in the the bank going to do about that , he told Reuters and the Financial Times. He later added a clarification saying that Cyprus was a specific case with exceptional challenges . The Cyprus deal puts the burden for dealing with problem banks on their shareholders and creditors in this particular case, customers with large bank balances rather than the government and taxpayers and bondholders, who lend through financial markets. Our World Economics Editor, Andrew Walker, pointed out the more usual approach to failing banks in the current crisis has been for the state to inject new capital. He says that Cyprus s banks are unusual in that they have relatively low amounts of financial market investors which could be tapped. In the past, nations such as Ireland have pumped billions of taxpayers money into propping up their banks, rather than risk upsetting large investors and spooking the financial system.
Mr Dijsselbloem said the pattern for bank rescues should see shareholders take the first hit, then bond holders, who lend money through financial markets, and only then should depositors with large bank balances be tapped. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor But Mr Dijsselbloem s remarks raised fears that other European countries with struggling banks may face the same solution as Cyprus, which agreed to force those with cash on deposit above 100,000 euros Â 85,000 , many of whom are Russian, to pay a substantial tax. Cyprus will receive 10bn euros 13bn Â 8.5bn in bailout funds, but has agreed to a major restructuring of its banks. Small savers will be protected but Cyprus s second largest bank Laiki Bank will be wound up and split into good and bad banks, with its good assets eventually merged into the Bank of Cyprus, the country s biggest bank. The two banks will remain closed until Thursday, while all others will reopen on Tuesday after being closed for more than a week, Cyprus s central bank says. By Robert PestonBusiness editor The Cypriot government suggested that account holders with deposits of more than 100,000 euros should expect to lose about 30 of their balances. The UK s FTSE 100 index ended the day down 0.2 , while Germany s Dax gave up 0.5 , and France s Cac lost 1.1 . In New York, the Dow Jones was 0.5 lower. In Madrid, the market slipped 2.5 while the Milan index was down 2.27 . The euro was also driven lower, falling to a six week low against the pound. The euro was down 0.6 to 84.74 pence. Jeroen Dijsselbloem The new deal for Cyprus, unlike previous agreements, does not require the approval of the Cypriot parliament.
The uncertainty over the future of Cyprus in the eurozone was sparked a week ago when its parliament rejected an earlier bailout deal, which also included a controversial bank levy. Despite the Cypriot economy s relatively small size, many analysts had been concerned that the crisis would spread to the wider eurozone, had Cyprus been forced to give up the single currency. There were fears that the country s possible exit from the euro would trigger a loss of confidence across the single currency bloc, and prompt investors to withdraw from other troubled economies, such as Greece. However, while Cyprus is now likely to remain in the eurozone, the country still faces significant obstacles as it attempts to recover from the crisis. The EU IMF deal involves a massive restructuring of the Cypriot banking system, as well as austerity measures and tax increases. There has also been significant public anger in Cyprus at the intervention of European authorities, and the credibility of the Cypriot government has been questioned. We see a risk that Cyprus sovereign debt burden post bailout might not be sustainable, as the country is likely to enter a deep recession caused by the shrinkage of the banking sector and severe deleveraging, warned Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS.
Two shots were fired at the man, who was on a bicycle outside St Edmund s RC Primary School and Nursery in Springhill, Birmingham. The man later fled and the school was locked to maintain the safety of everyone , said police. A staff member s car was damaged but no one was hurt. Police said the shooting appeared to be targeted. More updates on this story Officers were at the school on Thursday to reassure people. It is not believed that the school or any of the children or staff were the target of the attack. We are still searching for the victim, who is also thought not to have been injured, and the offender who made off in the vehicle, said West Midlands Police. Det Insp Richard Marsh said a number of people were outside the school at the time and he urged them to contact the force. We are still trying to identify the vehicle and the public could have crucial information to assist our enquiries, he said. We appreciate this will have caused some shock in the community, but we believe this was a targeted incident unconnected to the school. We are still trying the establish the full circumstances behind what happened and we need the victim to come forward, along with the help of witnesses in the area at the time.
Elisabetta . and Francesca Grillo lived a life of luxury that can be seen portrayed . in glossy magazines using Charles Saatchui s credit cards, the jury . was told during the trial. The . Italian sisters lavished thousands of pounds of the millionaire s money a shop til you drop New York . trip, a stay in the Ritz Hotel in Paris and dozens of items of designer . clothing. When asked about where they got their expensive clothes, the sisters would say they had bought bargains online. Scroll down for video . Cleared Sisters Elisabetta left and Francesca Grillo who were today cleared of carrying out a 685,000 credit card fraud . But really the pair had secretly embarked on a four year greedy and fraudulent free for all using Charles Saatchi s credit cards, Isleworth Crown Court was told. Mr . Saatchi and Miss Lawson who has her own . fortune of 20million were so awash with cash it was only a chance . occurrence that uncovered the Grillo sisters lavish spending. Cookery Miss Lawson is pictured in her 2006 TV show Nigella s Christmas Kitchen . It . happened when the sisters ordered a taxi with a firm kept on account by . Mr Saatchi s art company Conarco, and left it waiting for an age . outside the family home. Irritated . by its beeping, 70 year old Mr Saatchi made enquiries. He was shocked . to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants . to a polo match in Berkshire. Mr . Saatchi s finance director at Conarco, Rahul Gajjar, told the court . that although he had noted Francesca Grillo s credit card spending . creeping up with her monthly limit leaping from 25,000 to 100,000 . he had not yet thought to raise the matter.

Metzer told the court that the Italian sisters worked long hours for . modest salaries 25,000 for Lisa and 28,000 for her sister and . suggested it was common practice for assistants to be allowed to spend . on themselves. They would also be able to live rent free at a flat owned by Miss Lawson in Battersea, central London, the court heard. The . jury was told Francesca s average monthly spend was 48,000 while . Elisabetta s was 28,000 compared with the other personal assistants . who racked up bills of 8,000. Mr Saatchi s finance director Mr Gajjar confronted the sisters about their spending in the kitchen of the Saatchi family home in west London on July 3 last year. The pair admitted lavishing money on themselves but initially offered to make amends and pay it back before the police were called in.
Police called to Bramble Road in Witham, Essex, on Friday found a man had been burned on the face and hands. A spokesman said they could not say which of two suspected attackers was in custody for investigative reasons . Last week police said they wanted to question two men about the attack and on Sunday released an e fit. Police said the 56 year old victim had gone down to collect his post from the communal entrance to the block of flats when he encountered two men banging on the door. A spokeswoman said it was now thought he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was not the intended target of this attack . The victim is receiving treatment at the specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening. The two suspects are described as a white man and a black man and if anyone saw them either in the area prior to this attack or afterwards we would urgently like to speak to them, a spokeswoman said.
FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has announced that he is to stand for the presidency of the world governing body. Prince Ali, who is also a member of the FIFA Executive Committee and the head of the Jordan Football Association, will stand against incumbent Sepp Blatter and Frenchman Jerome Champagne for the top job in May this year. I am seeking the presidency of FIFA because I believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport, he said in a statement on www.jfa.com. FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan will run for football s top job . This was not an easy decision. It came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected FIFA colleagues over the last few months. The message I heard, over and over, was that it is time for a change. The world s game deserves a world class governing body an International Federation that is a service organisation and a model of ethics, transparency and good governance. Blatter has held his position as FIFA president since 1998 and will be running for a fifth term at the 65th FIFA congress in Zurich on May 29. The governing body has been engulfed by controversy in recent months over the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Prince Ali will challenge Sepp Blatter right , who is running for a fifth term as FIFA president . American lawyer Michael Garcia produced a 430 page report into the bidding for the tournaments but quit as FIFA s ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. The Executive Committee agreed unanimously in December that an appropriate form of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published.
Officials at a meeting in Morocco agreed to the proposal without a vote being taken but nothing will be published until the Ethics Committee charges against three FIFA ExCo members Angel Villar Llona of Spain, Belgium s Michel D Hooghe and Thailand s Worawi Makudi have been dealt with. The headlines should be about football, not about FIFA, Prince Ali added. FIFA exists to serve a sport which unites billions of people from all over the world, people of differing and divergent political, religious and social affiliations, who come together in their enjoyment of the world s game . Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said Personally I welcome Prince Ali s decision to stand for the FIFA presidency. It is very important that there is a credible candidate standing against Mr Blatter and Prince Ali is certainly that. FA chairman Greg Dyke, pictured in July, has welcomed Prince Ali s decision to stand against Sepp Blatter . Prince Ali has served as president of the Jordan Football Association since 1999 and a year later founded the West Asian Football Federation which consists of 13 different nations. The 39 year old was educated in the US at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, where he impressed as a wrestler, before moving to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK. He s served as a pathfinder in the Jordanian Special Forces and graduated from Princeton University in 1999. Ali is married to Algerian born Rym Brahimi, now Princess Rym, who previously worked as a journalist for CNN and is the daughter of UN diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi. They have two children. Frenchman Jerome Champagne will also challenge to end Blatter s reign, which began in 1998 . Among his achievements in football is his championing of the lifting of FIFA s ban on the hijab in the women s game. Ali was among those FIFA officials who have called for the publishing of the Garcia report. Champagne is a former FIFA deputy secretary general. Nominations have to be made before January 31.
An oil tycoon has been ordered to pay nearly 1 billion in a divorce settlement to his wife, making it one of the biggest payouts in history. Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to 1 billion to his ex wife Sue Ann Hamm, according to a court filing made public on Monday. Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of 995.5 million, with about a third of the funds, or 322.7 million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed. Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to 1 billion to his ex wife Sue Ann Hamm pictured , according to court filings released on Monday . Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at 14billion today . Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some 650 million, in installments worth at least 7 million per month. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around 25 million since the case was filed in 2012. To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock. The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten week divorce trial which ended last month. Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm s shares are in his name. His stake was worth more than 18 billion when the trial started in August. It s worth around 14 billion today. Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small time driller worth less than 50 million into a 20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma s largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him.
But under Oklahoma law, their active appreciation since 1988 is subject to equitable distribution with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than 17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold s stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple s shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Harold Hamm s leadership at Continental is central to the case. The Hamms own four houses together including this vast property in an exclusive enclave of Nichols Hills, Oklahoma . High life Sue Ann Hamm and the couple s daughter Jane are pictured at a lunch for the Wall Street Journal Innovator of Year award . In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental s success not to Hamm s business savvy but to factors beyond his control that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental s growth. The trial ended on October 9. This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together. In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of 3million. Video Source YouTube . Harold Hamm pictured with Mitt Romney during his run for the White House. The oil tycoon donated close to 1million to the Republican candidate s campaign .
Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down to earth and drives his own truck. His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new US oil prospect since the Sixties. Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney s presidential bid in 2012. Hamm leaves after he made a quick visit to the humble home right where he d lived in as a boy in Lexington, Oklahoma .
MIAMI, Florida CNN Florida Law enforcement officials said Monday they had launched an investigation into a tragic boating accident near St. Augustine, Florida, that took the lives of five people and seriously injured seven others. CNN affiliate WJXT shows the scene of the deadly boating accident near Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken over as the lead agency involved in the investigation. The incident took place on Sunday around 7 15 p.m., in the intracoastal waterway in St. Johns County, Florida, about 20 miles north of St. Augustine. According to FWC investigators, a 22 foot boat with 12 people on board rammed into the rear and right side of a 25 foot tugboat. We are still investigating and haven t come to any conclusions yet, said Carol Pratt, spokeswoman for FWC. She said they still do not know who was driving the boat. They also are waiting for victims next of kin to be notified before releasing any of their names and ages. The tugboat was at a dock and boat launch under construction on the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Valley, said Jeremy Robshaw, a spokesman for St. Johns County Fire and Rescue. Robshaw said rescuers couldn t initially reach the end of the unfinished dock, but laid plywood sheets on the structure to get to crash victims. No one was onboard the tugboat, which is registered to F A Enterprises in St. Augustine. The seven injured were taken to Shands Jacksonville Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Two patients remain in critical condition, one is considered serious and three are in fair condition. A hospital spokesman did not have information on the seventh victim. FWC told CNN that they hope to release more information on the incident and on their investigation. As in any accident, toxicology studies will be done on the driver of the boat, to determine whether he or she was impaired, spokesman Carol Pratt told CNN.
By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED . 05 08 EST, 26 September 2013 . . UPDATED . 05 13 EST, 26 September 2013 . Men may believe that whizzing around in an expensive set of wheels is the way to a woman s heart, but they couldn t be more wrong. The stereotype that women are turned on by flashy cars is in tatters as new research has shown that, while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex, women actually labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant, self centred and dangerous. New research aimed to establish whether the type of car you drive actually does influence perceptions and the results could make you think twice before buying your next car. Sorry, Lewis Hamilton Women label drivers of sports cars as arrogant, self centred and dangerous While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits. Meanwhile, men tended to most associate negative personality traits with drivers of 4x4s, viewing owners of these vehicles as arrogant, rude, and self centred. By comparison, women felt that saloon drivers like Ford Mondeo, Renault Megane, VW Passsat were likely to be hard working and safe drivers, while hatchback drivers were seen as being modest. Both sexes attributed the most positive personality types with eco car drivers such as Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius , naming them as the most likely to be conscientious, intelligent and also the safest drivers on the road. Despite being one of the most difficult colours to keep clean, the research found that black is the car colour that is most likely to turn someone s head. Not so fast While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits and prefer those who drive eco friendly cars .
The research suggests that the perfect car for a man looking to attract a partner would be a black eco car, such as a Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf. Phill Jones, a spokesman for Motors.co.uk, who carried out the research, said Our survey provided an interesting snapshot into how people perceive car drivers, with the bad boy sports car stereotype still holding true. The disparity between men and women suggests that the yummy mummy Chelsea tractor stereotype might be having a similar effect on men as sports cars appear to be having on women. While there is no doubt that owning the Batmobile or a Back to the Future Delorean would be a conversation starter if you re looking to meet new people, in reality the car we buy is likely to make us feel more confident rather than make other people find us more attractive. Opposite effect While 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex, women labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant, self centred and dangerous .
The basic reason is that his Catholic flock in Africa has increased faster there than in any other part of the world during the past 50 years. The Pope has just been forced to set up a new programme of evangelisation in Europe, where Catholics have been leaving the church in ever greater numbers. In Europe there is a serious problem of renewing an ageing priesthood. In West Africa his flock is flourishing, despite antagonism and even violence between Christians and Muslims in several countries. New vocations are booming. The Ouidah Catholic seminary is the burgeoning training ground for new African priests who 150 years after the first Catholic missionaries from Switzerland established themselves there are prepared to reverse the missionary direction and carry out pastoral work among Europeans in Europe. But Ouidah is also a centre for traditional African religions. It is the heartland of Voodoo, whose rituals and beliefs travelled to the Caribbean and to South America, particularly Brazil, during the centuries when slavery depopulated West Africa. By Virgile AhissouBBC Afrique, Cotonou Voodoo is completely normal in Benin. People across West Africa, especially Togo, Ghana and Nigeria hold similar beliefs but in Benin it is recognised as an official religion, followed by some 40 of the population. It has none of the negative connotations it has in the West and many of those who are officially Christian or Muslim also incorporate some Voodoo elements into their beliefs, especially in times of crisis. But Voodoo is more than a belief system, it is a complete way of life, including culture, philosophy, language, art, dance, music and medicine. Voodoo priests ask the gods to intervene on behalf of ordinary people but local adherents stress that they have nothing to do with sorcery or black magic. People here do not stick needles into dolls to cause misfortune to their enemies, as you see in some Western films.
What is Voodoo In pictures Voodoo priestess There is still a Voodoo temple filled with sacred pythons in Ouidah, not far from the huge Catholic seminary. Voodoo is a belief system with a culture which includes art, dance, music, rituals, medicine, and is expressed in several languages. Nearly half the population of Benin still follow traditional African animist religions such as Voodoo. Many who have converted to Catholicism still refuse to abandon their former beliefs entirely. The Catholic Church however has a problem with this. It is called syncretism, which means treating all religions on the same footing. Right wing Catholic traditionalists denounced the late Pope John Paul II for allegedly consorting with Satan when he invited an African animist to take part in his groundbreaking interfaith prayer for world peace in the Italian city of Assisi, the shrine of Saint Francis, back in 1986. Pope John Paul s successor, Benedict, invited another African traditional religious leader to celebrate with him the 25th anniversary of that meeting only last month. But this time there were no public prayers together, only private meditation. The Catholic Church, which cannot tolerate the idea of Protestants and Catholics sharing the same communion table, has even greater difficulty in reconciling the worship of Jesus Christ side by side with African animists offering libations to spirits of the forest. The Pope travelled to Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, with a larger retinue of advisers than usual on his travels. All the senior Vatican Cardinals who work in the Roman Curia were invited by the pope to join him for the six hour flight. They included Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson from Ghana, the head of the Vatican s Council for Justice and Peace, the body which monitors human rights records not only in African countries but around the world. Cardinal Turkson is the first Ghanaian to be appointed to the highest rank of prelates in the Catholic Church.
He is even considered to be a possible candidate to succeed Benedict XVI, when the 84 year old pontiff dies. Another member of the Pope s retinue is Bishop Barthelemy Adoukonou, a former student of the Pope at the University of Regensburg in Germany, where he taught theology. Monsignor Adoukonou, promoted to the rank of Bishop as recently as last month, is rapidly gaining influence as an adviser in the highest ranks of the Roman Curia. One of Pope Benedict s restricted number of engagements in Benin but one to which he to which he attaches great importance is a meeting with 200 sick and disabled children, who are looked after by Catholic missionaries. He will address all the suffering children of Africa in a speech he plans to make where they live. Another high point of Pope Benedict s visit to Benin will be a meeting with the head of state, members of the government and members of the diplomatic corps in the presidential palace. About 3,000 people are expected to attend and Pope Benedict plans another keynote speech, in which he will refer to the many human rights abuses in Africa. He will refer also to the role of the Church during the democratisation of the country, following Marxist rule after its independence. Here, he also plans to greet some local leaders of traditional African religions who have been invited for the occasion. Vatican Radio has produced its first music CD on the occasion of the Pope s African visit. Five thousand copies will be distributed to representatives of local churches. It is called Afrika Tenda Amani and has been recorded by two popular West African musicians Papa Wemba and Bonga.
Media playback is not supported on this device The left back, 27, said in the Sun on Thursday that he felt he and his team mates are underpaid and that Spurs need to sign well known players and not ones you had to Google . Rose has now said the timing and manner of his comments was ill judged . I forgive him and now we move on, said Pochettino. Of course he has a future at Tottenham . Nothing has changed in my vision or perception here. Tottenham, who finished second behind Chelsea in the Premier League last season, have not signed any players so far this summer and sold right back Kyle Walker to Manchester City in July for 45m. Rose said in his newspaper interview that Tottenham needed to sign two or three players . My words were were not meant to offend, added Rose on Friday in a statement released through his management company. For that I would like to apologise to the chairman, manager, my team mates and the fans. Rose, who signed a new five year contract last year, joined Tottenham from Leeds United in July 2007. He has made 144 appearances for the club after becoming a first team regular in 2013. Rose will miss the game against Newcastle with a knee problem but Spurs have been boosted by the news that Kieran Trippier s ankle injury is not as bad as first feared. The right back limped off in Saturday s 2 0 friendly win over Juventus at Wembley. However, on Friday, Tottenham said Trippier has minor ligament damage, adding that a short recovery time is expected .
The FSB intelligence agency said two attempted incursions had taken place over the weekend and a Russian soldier and an FSB employee had been killed. President Vladimir Putin vowed further security measures in response to Ukraine s stupid and criminal acts. Ukraine s president described the accusations as preposterous . Russian accusations against Ukraine of terrorism in occupied Crimea sound as preposterous and cynical as the statements of the Russian leadership about the absence of Russian troops in the Donbass region of rebel held eastern Ukraine , Petro Poroshenko said. These fantasies are only a pretext for making more military threats against Ukraine, he added. Russian intelligence also said it had smashed a Ukraine military intelligence network in Crimea and detained a number of people. They included a Ukrainian national named as Yevhen Panov, who is described by Russian sources as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer. Russian state TV has been running pictures from the FSB, showing rucksacks packed with explosives. Ukrainian saboteurs , sent by the defence ministry, were supposedly intending to use them in Crimea. The claims of Ukrainian terrorism on the peninsula have sparked concern here that Moscow could respond with some kind of military action. The possibility has been discussed actively on social media, especially after President Putin s comment that he will not just pass over the death of two Russians. Others suggest that the incident will be used or was engineered, depending on your viewpoint to scupper the complex peace process in Ukraine. Straightaway, Mr Putin said more internationally backed talks, due in the next few weeks, had been proved pointless . So Russia has a reason to stall again on the Minsk peace process, maintain the unstable status quo in Ukraine and to blame Kiev for all of it. Russia says one of those detained is Yevhen Panov. Initial reports suggest he was a former military volunteer fighting for Ukraine in the east of the country. However he has apparently more recently been associated with a charitable organisation.
Ukraine has managed to contain the Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and, in purely military terms, it is hard to see what Ukraine has to gain by provoking its larger, much more powerful neighbour. For all the talk about rapprochements and peace in eastern Ukraine, there has been very little concrete progress. Fighting between Russian backed separatists and the Ukrainians goes on every day. Just two weeks before Ukraine celebrates 25 years of independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations between Moscow and Kiev have taken another turn for the worse. Kiev is preparing to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ukrainian independence on 24 August, and officials have suggested Moscow may try to disrupt the celebrations. Russia is preparing for a parliamentary election on 18 September. The FSB said Ukrainian forces had intended to sabotage key infrastructure in Crimea. The aim of this subversive activity and terrorist acts was to destabilise the socio political situation in the region ahead of preparations and the holding of elections, the spy agency said. It said the attempted incursions had been accompanied by heavy fire from Ukrainian territory, resulting in the death of the Russian soldier. The FSB employee died while trying to detain infiltrators, it said. Bombs, ammunition and mines had been found in the area where terrorist attacks had been foiled, it said. Mr Putin said there was no point in further negotiations with Ukraine and called on the US and European countries to put pressure on Kiev to change its behaviour. About 9,000 people are reported to have been killed in the conflict in eastern Ukraine that followed the Russian annexation of Crimea. The annexation, which was itself largely bloodless, followed a vote to secede at a referendum on self determination on 16 March 2014 a ballot which was not recognised internationally. The US and European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its seizure of the territory.

More than 20 years after a New Mexico woman garnered headlines after she sued McDonald s over a scalding cup of coffee, a 5 year old girl has won a six figure settlement in Buffalo federal court for a similar incident at a Thruway rest stop. The family of the young girl sued the owners of a Denny s restaurant in Angola in 2012, took the case to trial and recently agreed to a court approved settlement of at least 500,000. The girl, who was only 14 months old at the time, suffered first and second degree burns over her neck, chest and abdomen. Her parents, Jose Adames and Sally Irizarry of Puerto Rico, sued the restaurant s owners after their daughter grabbed a hot cup of coffee and spilled it on herself in 2010. They claim the waitress was negligent in placing the coffee within the infant s reach. Sometime after the family is seated, a cup of coffee is placed on the table, which the infant was able to grab and dump on herself, the family said in court papers. The case went to trial last month, but midway through, an insurance carrier for G.B. Restaurants, the company that owned the now closed Denny s along the Thruway, offered to pay 500,000 to the family. The final settlement, approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott, remains confidential but it is believed to be near the 500,000 previously disclosed in court papers. Lawsuits over hot cups of coffee became fodder for the ongoing national debate over personal injury lawsuits when 79 year old Stella Liebeck successfully sued McDonald s in 1992. Liebeck s Styrofoam cup of coffee spilled on her lap outside one of the chain s restaurants in New Mexico, causing third degree burns. When she filed suit against the chain, she became a lightning rod of sorts. But her lawyers will tell you that, in the end, the facts proved McDonald s was negligent.
They said the chain had a policy of serving its coffee at 180 degrees, a temperature hot enough to cause serious burns. They also say the company received more than 700 complaints from customers in what amounted to a clear red flag. In some ways, the Buffalo case mirrored the suit in New Mexico. There were claims about the coffee being kept at overly hot temperatures, and there was testimony during the trial from medical personnel who worked on the infant. The family also provided evidence that their daughter will require lifetime medical care at a cost of more than 340,000. They continue to worry about her health and welfare now and into the future, the family s lawyer said of the girl s parents. John W. McCandless, the Erie, Pa., lawyer who represented the infant s family, and Robert W. Gallagher, who represented the restaurant owners, said they could not comment because of the confidential nature of the settlement. email pfairbanks buffnews.com BUFFALO, N.Y. WIVB The family of a 5 year old girl from Puerto Rico has reached a 500,000 settlement in Buffalo Federal Court after the girl suffered severe burns at a Denny s restaurant in Angola. Tatyana Adames was 14 months old when she and her parents stopped at the restaurant along the thruway for breakfast in June, 2010. According to court documents, Tatyana was seared by scalding hot coffee that an inattentive Denny s waitress had placed within her reach. She suffered first and second degree burns to her neck, chest, and abdomen. The family filed suit against the owners of the Denny s in 2012, and the case recently went to trial. Then, Farmer s Insurance, which covers the now closed restaurant s owners, offered to pay 500,000 to settle the suit. Court papers show the family accepted the offer, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott approved the final settlement.
Although that final settlement is sealed, it is believed to be for the previously disclosed amount of 500,000. This case comes more than 20 years after a woman in New Mexico won her lawsuit against McDonalds after she spilled hot coffee on herself. In that instance, the 79 year old woman suffered third degree burns from spilling her coffee on her lap. Her lawyers successfully claimed the chain was negligent in keeping its coffee at an excessive 180 degrees. In the case of Tatyana Adames, there were also claims that the coffee was kept at an overly hot temperature. Because of her injuries, patches of skin came off when Tatyana s clothing was first removed after the spill. Her medical providers had to remove the rest of the dead skin while Tatyana was under conscious sedation . She was in the hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania for several weeks, far away from her home in Puerto Rico. She also now suffers from an inflammatory reaction when exposed to the heat of Puerto Rico, which makes her skin break out in red, painful, itchy rashes. A Denny s handbook providing instructions for employees states that waitresses should Never set hot items directly in front of a child . Medical advocates estimate the lifetime cost of care for Tatyana s injuries will exceed 340,000.
Scott Ashton, 44, died in hospital last Wednesday following an incident in the city s Shiprow on 18 May. Frances Thomson, 24, made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Mr Thomson is expected to appear in court again next week.

The award winning reports were Aleppo Airstrikes, Aleppo Old City Fight, and Afghan Women Self Immolation. In its submission to the Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, CNN highlighted Paton Walsh s poetic writing, saying it contrasted with the sobering environments from which his stories are usually drawn. His reports punch through the daily accounts of wounded and dead, and give us a fresh way to see the grinding pitilessness of war, and its quirky inconsistencies, the broadcaster said. Aleppo Airstrikes is the account of indiscriminate shelling in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Walsh s piece to camera sees him crouching as a government bomber jet flies above. It s that sound that terrifies ordinary residents of Aleppo daily, he says. Of the lone infant who survives the strike, Paton Walsh observes A year old, he was born into Syria s bloody revolution, and may yet survive it still. In Aleppo Old City Fight, Paton Walsh goes right inside the fight for the historic old city. His report focuses on the improvised nature of the battle, with pot shots at nothing in particular and what it could mean for the wider conflict. CNN said Paton Walsh s war reporting was complemented by his sensitive stories about the plight of women in the developing world. In Afghan Women Self Immolation, the correspondent reports on an epidemic of self immolation among young married women in Herat. The women take the drastic measure as a form of protest against the abuse they suffer at the hands of their husbands or in laws. CNN said Paton Walsh s delicate writing has a reverential tone, bestowing upon these sad burn victims in Herat the respect they seek. Beirut based Paton Walsh has worked for CNN since 2011, focusing on the Middle East, Afghanistan and surrounding region.
He topped five other contenders to take home the award for outstanding writing at the awards ceremony, which was held in New York, Tuesday. More recently, Paton Walsh has reported from scenes of conflict in Egypt and Turkey and from Dagestan, where he secured an interview with the parents of the alleged Boston bombers. CNN s Anderson Cooper 360 also won an Emmy, for Outstanding News Discussion and Analysis for Kids On Race The Hidden Picture, while CNN s 2012 U.S. election night coverage saw it honored with an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story Long Form. Paton Walsh s previous awards include the British Press Awards Young Journalist of the Year in 2000 and Amnesty International s Gaby Rado Award 2006 for a reporter at the start of their career for his work in the former Soviet Union. He also won Amnesty s television award for his work in Sri Lanka in 2010, while he was working for British broadcaster Channel 4 News. Read more from Nick Paton Walsh .

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was the catalyst for a peace process in the restive Indonesian province of Aceh. Could Nepal s disaster also bring historic change What s been agreed Monday s 16 point agreement divides Nepal into eight federal states, the boundaries of which will be decided by a federal commission. The names of the states will be decided by a two thirds majority vote in assemblies to be set up in each state. Nepal will have a parliamentary form of government with two houses. The lower house will have 275 members, 60 of whom will be directly elected, while 40 will be elected through proportional representation. The upper house will have 45 seats. The prime minister will have executive powers and be chosen from the biggest party or coalition in parliament. The country will also have a ceremonial president elected by parliament and provincial assemblies. A constitutional court will be set up for 10 years to resolve disputes. Did the earthquake focus minds It s been nearly 10 years since Maoist rebels laid down their arms and joined Nepal s political process. Politicians agreed to write a new constitution by 2010, but have failed to come to an agreement. When the earthquake hit on 25 April, Nepal s prime minister, Sushil Koirala, was out of the country. It was several days before he and other politicians took a visible lead in directing rescue and relief efforts. There was a sense among Nepal s population that the political deadlock had affected the politicians ability to respond to the crisis. They were under pressure to show they could deliver. However some believe the stronger parties took advantage of this to push through a deal which did not reflect the wishes of Nepal s smaller parties. What s the timetable It s expected a draft constitution will be ready by July. It will then need to be approved by a two thirds majority in parliament the four parties who signed this deal have the numbers to do this.
They are the Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoists and one of the parties representing the Madhesi ethnic group from the south. A federal commission will then have six months to draw up the borders of the eight provinces and submit a proposal for approval in parliament, though there are fears this process could drag on for years. What are the stumbling blocks The deal has been criticised as incomplete as it has yet to decide on the boundaries or names of the new provinces. The stumbling block is that the question of federalism, which has been at the heart of Nepali s political discourse for over five years now, has not been resolved, says Prashant Jha, author of Battles of the New Republic A Contemporary History of Nepal. There are fears that the commission to decide the boundaries could be politically influenced. Many small political parties which represent ethnic groups and people from the southern plains, the Terai, have already voiced their opposition. It s unclear whether their demands for better representation will be met. Will it really happen After years of deadlock over the new constitution this is a significant breakthrough which sees the end of the division between Nepal s Maoists, who have been campaigning for federalism, and the country s established political elite who have been reluctanct to cede power from Kathmandu. But the deal could fall through because it does not resolve the differences between the country s main parties and its marginalised social and ethnic groups who feel excluded from this deal. Until the big parties reach out to these forces, we cannot call this a social contract which has the buy in of Nepal s diverse groups, says Prashant Jha.
ISIS is using British female extremists to incite other UK women to carry out terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools. Experts at King s College London say they have identified a group of around 30 British women in northern Syria, who are encouraging others to launch terrorist attacks in the UK. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation ICSR has studied the social media accounts of female jihadis, and has found that instead of supporting their male counterparts, many are actively helping to recruit female would be extremists, often encouraging them to carry out atrocities in the UK. ISIS is using British female extremists to incite UK terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools, and authorities continue to hunt Hayat Boumeddiene left , the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly right Details of the study comes as Britain and the rest of Europe remain on high alert following the shootings in Paris earlier this month. Authorities are still hunting Hayat Boumeddiene, the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join up with Islamic State fighters. She is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, but had left France before the Kouachi brothers Cherif, 32, and Said, 34, opened fire on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, arriving in Istanbul on January 2. Boumeddienee, who is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, is pictured right at passport control following her arrival in Istanbul on January 2 . Around 50 British women and girls are thought to have joined ISIS, with the majority based in the jihadist s stronghold Raqqa and aged between 16 and 24.
Among them are 16 year old twins Salma and Zahra Halane who fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria where it is believed they have married IS fighters. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols . It has previously been thought that women have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS ranks as wives, but ICSR s findings suggest they are playing a more active role. ICSR research fellow Melanie Smith, who heads the first known database of female foreign fighters, told The Observer British women tend to incite attacks , they say to people that can t move to the Islamic State Why not carry out something at home That s a common message if you can t leave your family behind or afford to move to Syria then carry out something. Ms Smith added that women have often been recruited in the past to carry out suicide attacks. School inspectors are also expected to warn that children are still at risk from Islamic extremism, despite a crack down in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal. Four separate investigations were conducted last year into allegations in Birmingham, which were originally sparked by the Trojan Horse letter now widely believed to be a hoax that referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city. In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham s schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures. These schools were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy all run by the Park View Educational Trust PVET as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School.
In an update published in September, Ofsted said that these schools had not improved, with chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw saying that very little action had been taken to address the serious concerns raised about each school s performance, amid slow progress in appointing new governors and senior leaders. Sir Michael is expected to warn a meeting of the education select committee later this month that he is still very concerned about a continued risk of extremism in schools, Whitehall sources told The Sunday Times. Twins Salma left and Zahra Halane right , both 16, fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria where it is believed they have married IS fighters . Nearly half of the 4,000 referrals to the Government s Channel programme, which aims to target children and adults who are vulnerable to radicalisation before they become terrorists, have reportedly been under 18. Some have these have been as a result of teachers cracking down on pupils feared to be at risk of fleeing the UK to fight in Syria. One headteacher said four children at her north London school had been reported to the Prevent programme, of which Channel is a part, including a 16 year old girl who wanted to fundraise for ISIS, and a 15 year old boy who had made a throwaway comment about fighting in Syria.

A glitch on the United Airlines website saw travellers offered return, first class flights from London to Newark for just 74 49 . The round trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site. By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back 5,618 3,690 and 6,778 4,452 . For a brief period of time on February 11, round trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just 49 . It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United has since made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets. One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark. She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu, for example March 19 to March 25. Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as Denmark when filling out her postal address. The unbelievable fare totalled 491 Danish krone, which comes to 49 or approximately US 74 . Despite the low costs, two customers reported miscellaneous charges when they came to play, adding up to 326 214 to the price of the ticket. It is not known what these costs represent, but both customers said they were happy to pay as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket. MailOnline Travel attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16 20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option. A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK around 206 or 135 . The country option was then turned back to United Kingdom.
It is as yet unclear how many people snapped up the flights during the time of the glitch and whether the airline will honour the bookings. According to a statement provided to MailOnline Travel United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline s properly filed fares. This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United s Denmark site.

Lord Feldman, the man allegedly behind calling Tory grassroots supporters swivel eyed loons, has been a loyal presence at David Cameron s side for thirty years. Yet he never gives interviews, has never stood for elected office, and is virtually unknown outside Westminster. But now, it is the sheer strength and longevity of Cameron s friendship with Lord Feldman which makes the furore so damaging for the Tory leader because it is widely assumed their views are shared.

It was at Brasenose College, Oxford, that he met Cameron. They organised a college May ball together and discovered they had a mutual love of racquet sports another similarity shared between tennis playing Tony Blair and Lord Levy .

Like Cameron, Lord Feldman got a First in his final exams then he took a job with management consultants Bain Co. before, in 1991, being called to the Bar and practising as a commercial barrister at one of the country s top chambers. His family owns Jayroma, a multinational textile company making ladies clothes, and in 1995, aged 29, he joined the firm, drawing a salary of 900,000 in one year alone. It meant he was able to buy the 3million house in Holland Park, West London, where he lives with his wife Gaby and their three children round the corner from David Cameron s house in Notting Hill. Tory figures describe Lord Feldman as likeable, friendly, extremely bright and unassuming.
He skis regularly, enjoys yoga, and owns another house in Andalusia, southern Spain. It was Lord Feldman who not only urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 after the party s third successive general election defeat, but also masterminded his campaign. Encouragement Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 . Lord Feldman helped run Mr Cameron s bid with ruthless efficiency, calling in favours from his network of contacts in the business world and raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process. Through his family clothing firm, Lord Feldman himself donated 10,000 to the successful cause. He was appointed deputy treasurer of the party in 2005, and ironically given the circumstances today immediately let it be known that he wanted to end the dependency on major donors. He s not comfortable with individuals giving large amounts. He wants a wider base of people giving smaller amounts, said a party official at the time. But even before the Conservatives got into power, Lord Feldman made the wrong call. In 2007, he was chairman of the Leaders Club, a dining group for Tory donors who each gave a minimum 50,000 to party funds each year. They would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron s office in the Commons and meet senior Tory politicians. But this arrangement was in breach of Parliament s rules, which do not allow party political fundraising in the House of Westminster, and Mr Cameron was forced to unreservedly apologise after he was rebuked by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer. In 2008, Lord Feldman was appointed chief executive of the Tory Party and was given specific responsibility for attracting party donors.

Lord Feldman, one of the Prime Minister s closest friends and political allies, was accused of making the swivel eyed loons remark to journalists at a London hotel.

The MPs just have to do it because the Tory associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel eyed loons. But yesterday afternoon, after crisis talks with Mr Cameron, and amid growing claims on Twitter that the unnamed person was Lord Feldman, the peer issued a statement, saying the allegations against him were completely untrue and he was considering legal action. I did not, nor have ever, described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists, he said. On the contrary, I have found them to be hard working, committed and reasonable people, the backbone of the party. Mr Cameron fully backed Lord Feldman. A No 10 spokesman said The Prime Minister supports Lord Feldman s position. It is categorically untrue that anyone in Downing Street made the comments reported in The Times and the Telegraph. Both The Times and The Daily Telegraph stood by their reports. A source at News International, which owns The Times, said There is no doubt Feldman used the words loons and swivel eyed. A titanic trial of strength between No 10 and the two newspapers now seems inevitable. Defeat for Feldman would force him to resign and could inflict potentially catastrophic damage to Mr Cameron.
The Frisky It seems that all anyone is talking about lately is the economy, so why is money still such a tough topic to discuss with your nearest and dearest They say married couples fight over money more than anything else, but what about when you just started dating That s possibly even more awkward. Columnist says no woman should leave her house on first date without enough money to pay for her meal. The first date . Though Dr. Phil feels otherwise, my take on this has always been he or she who asks, pays. The bloviating shrink says men should always be the ones to pony up. And if you don t pay for the whole thing, you should at least offer to split the tab. Incredibly to me , most women I spoke to thought I was an idiot and firmly believed the dude should always pay on a first date though for some this was a recent change of heart. Kate, a 33 year old writer told me, I tend to try to pay for myself, but as I get older and more comfortable with my awesomeness, I kind of wish and hope that the other person will be a little more old fashioned about it. Good point. If someone s eating opposite Amazing Me, shouldn t she or he pay for the privilege After all, I m entertaining and cute and if you let me order dessert there may be some smooching in your future. Regardless of your feelings on the matter, whatever you do, don t leave the house without enough money to pay for at least your share. It s a first date so while he may seem great and generous on paper, you never really know what you re getting into until he s sitting across from you. Sure, he might be staring adoringly deep into your eyes, but then again, his pants might be held up with duct tape.
Do you really want to count on that dude to know the meaning of gratuity What to say That s so generous of you can I at least leave the tip What not to say This princess doesn t pay for food Dates two thru six . Jennifer Kelton, CEO and founder of BadOnlineDates.com, has built a business on bad dating behavior. She explains her thoughts on the money issue While it s not expected, Let s face it we are hardwired to want the man to bring back dinner to the cave. Up until my current relationship, I ve almost always been in the driver s seat finance wise and believe me, that s a pretty meager seat so I ve always furnished my own cave. I ask her if it s okay to date a guy just for a free ride or free grub Kelton says no. Being cheap is never attractive and I would say that after more than four dates the woman should pay the tip. Whoa Just the tip Apparently the women who called me a moron were onto something However, if you re going to keep riding the free food express, the least you can do is surreptitiously feel out his money situation if he s hurting, suggest cheaper restaurants or maybe cook for the guy. What to say That s so generous of you can I at least leave the tip What not to say Let s have the 2000 Perrier Jouet, since this one s on you Dates six thru infinity . Up until the two of you really get to know each other, there s probably not going to be any urgent need to discuss finances in depth, but he can t keep buying you steak and foie gras dinners if he s on a cheeseburger and fries budget. For all you know, you re out earning him or he s supporting 12 Guatemalan orphans and is stretched to the breaking point. Then again, maybe he s a gazillionaire.
At about date six possibly sooner if they re really eventful dates , you should be getting to know a lot about every part of him including his wallet. There s no right or wrong way to approach this discussion, but just remember, financial compatibility is almost as important as sexual chemistry, though rarely as much fun. TM 2009 TMV, Inc.

An attack by snipers on a Silicon Valley power substation last year is prompting the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to launch a crusade to better secure and defend the nation s electrical grid. The former chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, now a San Francisco energy law attorney, called the little publicized April 2013 attack on the substation a very well planned, coordinated and executed attack on a major piece of our electric grid infrastructure. While Wellinghoff has expressed concern that the attack may have been a test run for a bigger strike possibly terrorism the FBI has declared the incident wasn t an act of terror and is still investigating the case, with no arrests made. The FBI considers the incident vandalism, said spokesman Peter Lee in San Francisco. There is no nexus to terrorism at this time, Lee said. Nonetheless, Wellinghoff is urging Congress to fill a void in federal law that he says doesn t empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations, which he describes as barely protected with a chain link fence and cameras. Even those cameras don t capture details outside the fence, because they are more focused inside it, he added. Last year s sabotage was carried out by at least one sniper at a good distance from the fence, outside the camera s focus, Wellinghoff said. We need to have a national coordinated plan, and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge, Wellinghoff said. So far, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D California, has joined the call for improved security. The matter was addressed at a December hearing of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Waxman is the ranking member. Just this April, there was an actual attack on our electricity infrastructure, Waxman said, referring to the Silicon Valley shooting. This was an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military style weapons. Communications were disrupted. The attack inflicted substantial damage.
It took weeks to replace the damaged parts. The nation s critical infrastructure and defense installations simply cannot function without electricity. Yet it is clear that the electric grid is not adequately protected from physical or cyberattacks, Waxman said in a statement. In all, 150 rounds from an assault rifle were fired over almost 20 minutes at a Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation south of San Jose, California, knocking out 17 transformers in the post midnight darkness of April 16, according to PG E, Wellinghoff and CNN affiliate KTVU. To prevent a blackout to Silicon Valley, workers re routed power, but it took almost a month to make repairs, the affiliate reported. Authorities also found an AT T fiber optic cable was cut in an underground vault, causing a phone blackout, Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup with the Santa Clara County Sheriff s Office told KTVU. By the time police arrived, the shooters, also suspected of damaging the phone line, were gone. At the time, the incident wasn t publicized, but since he stepped down as FERC chairman in November, Wellinghoff is raising public attention to the California sniper s attack to demonstrate the vulnerability of the nation s electricity system. Waxman is apparently endorsing Wellinghoff s initiative. Waxman is urging Congress to pass legislation that would fix this gap in regulatory authority and empower FERC to directly address threats to the nation s power grid. In 2010, the U.S. House passed such a measure, called the GRID Act, but the Senate didn t act on the proposal, Waxman said. The federal government relies on an energy industry organization to develop reliability standards for the electric grid through a protracted, consensus based process, Waxman said. After the California vandalism, Arkansas also saw last year multiple attacks on power lines and grid infrastructure that led to millions of dollars in damage and brief power outages, Waxman said.
PG E officials said they have redundancies built into their electric grid that enable us to reroute power around damaged equipment and help keep the lights on for our customers, said spokesman Brian Swanson. Since the incident occurred, PG E has worked aggressively with federal and local agencies to improve substation security throughout our system, Swanson said. The utility industry and stakeholders like the Edison Electric Institute are meeting with policy makers, government officials and law enforcement at all levels to engage in constructive dialogue and share information on how we can work together to protect the grid across the country. The institute, an association of shareholder owned electric companies, says security and protection are top priorities. Electric companies are partnering closely with each other and with senior officials from all relevant federal and law enforcement agencies to protect the grid s most critical assets, said Scott Aaronson, the institute s senior director of national security policy. But he noted that publicizing clearly sensitive information about critical infrastructure protection endangers the safety of the American people and the integrity of the grid. In the meantime, Wellinghoff is urging utilities to enact low cost improvements such as replacing chain link fencing with an opaque barrier that would block a sniper s vision of the substation. Wellinghoff is also recommending movable concrete Jersey barriers as a perimeter around the substations to stop any sniper bullets. He s also recommending utilities extend lighting beyond the fence yard, with more sophisticated cameras, so video can capture saboteurs outside the fence. The California sniper or snipers were 40 to 60 yards outside the substation fence, he said. This isn t about this substation or this organized attack, Wellinghoff said of the California incident. This is more about the larger issue of physical security of these high voltage substations nationwide and the need to ensure that some defensive measures start to be put in place.
The Read On. Get On. report said children who fell behind could feel the impact for the rest of their lives. It said they were less likely to gain good qualifications and go on to further education. The coalition behind the report aims to have all 11 year olds reading well within a generation. Organisations such as Save the Children and the Scottish Book Trust are part of the coalition. They want to see parents reading to young children for 10 minutes a day. Their report said that 40 of families in the lowest income bracket had fewer than 10 children s books at home and fathers from these households were half as likely to read with their children at age two as fathers in the highest income households. It said that this impacted on children later in life as those who were read to often as toddlers were more likely to become keen readers themselves. The Read on coalition said there were 220,000 children living in poverty in Scotland and they expected this number to rise. Neil Mathers, head of Scotland at Save the Children, said As a country we cannot continue with a situation where one in five poor children are not reading well at the end of primary school. It is unfair. We know that getting every child reading well at 11 cannot happen overnight but it is possible within a generation if we work together. Read On. Get On. is a mission to galvanise the nation so that parents, grandparents and volunteers play their part in teaching children to read. We want every child to be given a fair and equal chance to learn to read well, regardless of their background. While children are still reading books, the report found that the most commonly read material by children is now text messages, with websites and e books growing in popularity.

The TV hosts were first spotted having dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance and they had been on a few dates. The New York Post reported that Ms Cho and her ex husband were embroiled in a nasty legal battle over renovation work done to their 2.2 million, nine bedroom, four bathroom Westchester mansion. Ms Cho split from her husband Evan Gottlieb, pictured, over the summer and moved out of their Yonker s mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment . Cathal Maguire, a Yonkers contractor, claimed that Ms Cho and Mr Gottlieb racked up a 430,875 bill for upgrades made to their home and then stiffed him for 100,875 of the work. Ms Cho and her spouse filed a counterclaim in state Supreme Court in White Plains alleging Maguire inflated prices, charged for work never done and did a shoddy job. The case is ongoing. Meanwhile, It was also claimed that Josh has repeatedly clashed with co host Lara Spencer . over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair s off air relationship is anything but amicable. The only woman he is said to have any time for is primary anchor Robin Roberts. The only female Josh hasn t fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar. He does have a daughter from his former marriage to Priya Narang Elliot, and that relationship ended in divorce. He is high maintenance, and if viewers could see what he was like off the air, people would be truly shocked.
A Good Morning America spokesperson . described the allegations about Elliott as absolutely false , adding . they do not comment on the private lives of their anchors. Elliot . was given up for adoption at birth. Then at 12 his adopted parents . divorced and his father, who had told the family he was gay, died.

Trust issues with females Josh Elliott has clashed with co star Lara Spencer, right, but has a better relationship with Robin Roberts, left . Good Morning America is the most popular morning show in the country, but Lara Spencer, left, has reportedly clashed with her male co hosts . The . upbeat vibe and jovial mood of ABC s Good Morning America is one of the . key reasons it has toppled rival NBC show Today in the morning ratings . battle this year.

A demonstration was held at the weekend by animal rights campaigners in Derby over the planned facility near Foston. Midlands Pig Producers MPP said allegations its pigs would be kept in cramped conditions were untrue. The farm would hold 2,500 sows and 20,000 piglets and use biogas from the slurry to produce electricity. MPP has finished giving extra information to Derbyshire County Council as part of the planning process. It said it had addressed concerns about animal welfare and emissions. A company spokesman said We are astonished at some of the highly misleading claims and accusations. Claims that pigs will be crammed into narrow crates are simply not true. Our acclaimed 360 Farrowers were named because the sow can turn around 360 degrees at will. We urge people to either contact us, or refer to the planning application so that they may ascertain the facts of the matter for themselves. About 100 animal rights protesters marched through Derby on Saturday claiming the large scale development would be cruel to pigs. Critics said that the only time the pigs would see the outside world would be on their way to slaughter. It has also been claimed the site could put small scale farmers in the area out of business. MPP said the farm would observe the highest welfare standards and pointed out there was already a unit in the UK containing 3,500 sows. South Derbyshire District Council handed over duties for dealing with the application to the county council because of its waste implications. If planning permission is given, construction on the farm will take about a year.
A combination of hard work, raw talent and destiny took an impoverished Elvis Presley from a two bedroom Tupelo, Mississippi, home, transformed him into a international icon and left his legacy at Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee. Graceland is the second most visited home in the United States after the White House. But Presley, who never forgot his humble beginnings, is also celebrated in Tupelo, where the Elvis Presley Birthplace Museum opened in 1992. The museum draws from 75,000 to 80,000 people each year to its exhibits, the house where Elvis was born and the church where he first sang gospel music. Tupelo will kick off this year s Elvis Week with Fan Appreciation Day on August 10, and Ben Portsmouth, last year s Elvis Ultimate Tribute Artist winner, will perform during the evening. Elvis week continues at Graceland from August 11 to 17, with daily events including a Memphis music tour, Elvis movie screenings, memorial services and concerts.
Ted Hughes The Unauthorised Life, one of six titles up for the 2015 Samuel Johnson Prize, is accused of containing significant errors by Hughes estate. Publisher HarperCollins said Jonathan Bate regret ted any minor errors but said it stood by his masterly tome. A spokesperson for the Samuel Johnson Prize declined to comment on the row. Bate, a professor of English Literature at Oxford, initially began work on his 672 page book with the qualified assent of the Ted Hughes estate and Hughes widow, Carol. Last year, though, the estate informed the author it was withdrawing its co operation because it feared he was straying from an agreement not to write a standard biography. In a statement issued by the estate s solicitor, Bate s book serialised in the Times newspapers ahead of its publication on 1 October is accused of containing glaring factual inaccuracy and tasteless speculation . It draws particular attention to a claim made by Bate that Hughes widow and son stopped off for a good lunch while accompanying his coffin from London to Devon in the hours after his death in October 1998. The idea that Nicholas and I would be enjoying a good lunch while Ted lay dead in the hearse outside is a slur suggesting utter disrespect, said Carol Hughes. The estate s solicitor, Damon Parker, said Carol Hughes had not read Bate s book but had been led to believe that the portrait presented of her late husband was something of a caricature . He called on HarperCollins to apologise for the alleged errors, issue a retraction, and agree to make corrections to the biography s future and e book editions. The publisher responded by saying Bate had made every effort to corroborate all facts used in the book, which was made more difficult by the withdrawal of support for the project by the Ted Hughes Estate . It said the book had been written in good faith and verified by multiple sources , adding that any errors found would of course be corrected in the next printing .
This did not satisfy the estate, which told the BBC on Thursday it was patently incorrect for HarperCollins to say the academic had made every effort to corroborate facts. There was nothing to prevent the author seeking confirmation from the poet s widow... of the points which he has got wrong in his book, said Parker. He also said that Carol Hughes had contacted the author privately this summer with an offer to check for... factual errors , an offer that was not taken up . The winner of the Â 20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize for non fiction writing will be announced on 2 November. The recipient of last year s award, Helen Macdonald s H is for Hawk, went on to become a number one bestseller.
Alexander Worth was killed in the crash on an access road between Newlyns and Lodge Farms at North Warnborough.

CNN A Kentucky census worker who was found dead in September committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide, authorities said Tuesday. The body of William E. Sparkman Jr., 51, was found September 12 near a cemetery in southeastern Kentucky s Clay County. He was wearing only socks. A thorough examination of evidence from the scene, to include DNA testing, as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence, resulted in the determination that Mr. Sparkman, alone, handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved, Kentucky State Police said. Sparkman s wrists were bound with duct tape, and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree, but his body was touching the ground, authorities said. He had Fed written on his chest in black ink. However, Sparkman s wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart, allowing for considerable mobility, said Kentucky State Police Capt. Lisa Rudzinski. He was also in contact with the ground, almost on his knees, she said. To survive, all Mr. Sparkman had to do was stand up. Lividity on the body marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body showed that Sparkman died in the same position, Rudzinski said. His glasses were taped to his head, and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth, she said. Mr. Sparkman had extremely poor eyesight and so would have needed his glasses secured, Rudzinski said. But the most compelling evidence came from the fact that Sparkman had obtained 600,000 in accidental death insurance, which would not have paid in the event of a suicide, as late as May, she said. In addition, he told a credible witness of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government. The details were consistent with how Sparkman died and was found, Rudzinski said.
The witness did not take action after Sparkman shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through, authorities said. It was learned that Mr. Sparkman had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of Clay County, Kentucky state police said in a statement. Police believe that Sparkman s primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid, Rudzinski said. His motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known, she said, as Sparkman left no note. We don t know what Mr. Sparkman was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act, she said. Autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness, officials said, although it was reported that Sparkman had previously had lymphoma. Police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was. Forensic analysis of the writing on Sparkman s chest showed that he had written it himself, Rudzinski said. Analysts found ink dots, made by writers on completing a letter, at the top of the letters, rather than at the bottom as would be expected if someone had made the writing on Sparkman. Despite a search by authorities, the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found. Police do not believe that anyone assisted Sparkman, she said. Sparkman had told the witness, whom police declined to name, that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects, including his laptop computer and other items. Police have not found those items, Rudzinski said. Toxicology tests showed that Sparkman was not drugged or under the influence of any substance, she said. The red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene.
DNA testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on Sparkman s neck, as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body, found only Sparkman s DNA, she said. The police investigation is still open, and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks, authorities said. Authorities met with Sparkman s son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them. Our hearts go out to him, Rudzinski said. He still lost his father at the end of the day. She would not say whether his son accepted the findings, saying she did not want to speak for the family.
New DNA technology could help reveal the killer in an unsolved murder of a mother and her three year old daughter. The technique, known as Snapshot, can generate a digital mugshot of the suspect by using samples such as blood and strands of hair left at the scene. Investigators in South Carolina have used the analysis, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, in a bid to get a breakthrough in the slaying of Candra Alston, 25, and her toddler Malaysia Boykin four years ago. Their bodies were found in the busy Brook Pines Apartments in Columbia on January 9, 2011. Unsolved Investigators in South Carolina are hoping the DNA technique called Snapshot, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, leads to a breakthrough in the slaying of Malaysia Boykin, three, and Candra Alston four years ago. There were no witnesses to their deaths in January 2011 . Leads There were no signs of forced entry at their home and police believe the toddler and her mother may have known the killer. More than 200 people have been interviewed in connection to their deaths . Police have never revealed how they died and would only confirm it was by different means. There were no signs of forced entry leading detectives to believe they knew the killer or killers. The only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified DNA sample that has, until now, been untraceable. As there were no witnesses, authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the suspect was dark skinned with brown hair and brown eyes. However the computer generated image does not have an estimated height or age traits which the company claim are very complex . Speaking to Fox News, Parabon s director of bioinformatics, Ellen McRae Greytak, said This is particularly useful when there are no witnesses, no hits in the DNA database and nothing to go on.
Prediction Using the phenotyping technique, investigators have been able to determine that the suspect is dark skinned with brown eyes and brown hair . Traditional forensic analysis treats DNA as a fingerprint, whereas Snapshot treats it as a blueprint a genetic description of a person from which physical appearance can be inferred. Traits are generally predicted with more than 80 percent confidence, and importantly, Snapshot also reports which phenotypes can be excluded with more than 95 per cent confidence. Mark Vinson, a cold case investigator with the Columbia police department, said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the mother and daughter s death. Around 150 of them submitted their DNA but none matched the sample left at the scene.
Mariner Street car park, near the train station, will be cleared and replaced with a 725 bedroom student block, complete with nightclub, gym, office space, bars, restaurants and shops. The 22 storey tower would be the second tallest building in Swansea, next to Meridian Quay. Construction is expected to start later this year and finish by summer 2018. A report before Swansea council s planning committee on Tuesday said the tower will be a bold addition to the city skyline . The report added there is a growing need for student accommodation in Swansea, with both Swansea University and Trinity Saint David universities expanding in the city. Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said the project will be a major step forward for High Street s regeneration, and will build on the great work that s already been done.
Like a wounded animal lashing out in fury, ISIS is betraying hints of desperation in its latest video, which purportedly shows the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. hostage Peter Kassig, analysts said Sunday. And if there s news worse than the apparent brutal death of Kassig, it s that we should expect even more vicious videos to come from the group, also known by the acronym ISIL, said Haras Rafiq of the Quiliam Foundation, an anti extremist think tank. As we see the U.S. and the coalition making gains against ISIL, we will find that they try and show that they are still strong, try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been, and unfortunately one of the things we ll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric, he said. I think it s a sign of desperation, he said. I think it s a sign that they know and feel they are under attack, they re under siege and they re struggling. The video, released online Sunday, shows the aftermath of a beheading, in which the victim is not clearly recognizable. The White House confirmed that the video showed Kassig. Kassig, 26, who converted to Islam in captivity, also went by the name Abdul Rahman Kassig. He went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. The video does show in gruesome detail the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the Syrian government, which is also battling ISIS forces. It can t be said enough, said CNN s Nic Robertson. This is the most barbaric they ve done so far. The carefully produced video is clearly a prize piece of propaganda for them, Robertson says. It also differs from others produced by ISIS. It doesn t feature a Western hostage dressed in orange speaking to the camera before his death. Nor does it name the group s next victim.
It is likely in part meant to scare Syrians and Iraqis into obeying ISIS orders when it comes calling, said Rafiq and retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Joe Ruffini, a counterterrorism expert. What ISIS is telling them is, When we come in and tell you to do what we tell you, you know what the consequences are if you say no, Ruffini said. But it also comes at a time when the United States and its anti ISIS allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James Spider Marks. Has ISIS peaked Terror group suffers setbacks in Iraq . It also comes during a visit to Iraq by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey. Clearly there are no coincidences, Marks told CNN on Sunday. This is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and, I would say, the results of those activities. Since beginning airstrikes in August, U.S. officials have touted successes in disrupting ISIS communications and logistics, slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations. Last week, President Barack Obama said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on Iraqi ground troops and other local fighters. More recently, U.S. officials have suggested more openness to a role for U.S. ground forces in the fight. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Dempsey said commanders are certainly considering the prospect that U.S. forces might be needed to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, currently held by ISIS. In Sunday s video, the narrator taunted Obama to do just that. Hostages tortured before beheadings .

He is among several lawmakers to express frustration after three Republican senators opposed a bill to scale back parts of the US health law. The so called skinny repeal is the Senate s third failed attempt to roll back Obamacare. It is considered a blow to Republicans who vowed for years to repeal the law. The legislation fell apart during the early hours on Friday, when Arizona Senator John McCain cast the decisive vote to reject the bill by 51 to 49 in the Republican dominated Senate. He joined Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in opposing the plan. An estimate from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office CBO found the skinny repeal would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026, with insurance premiums increasing by 20 . Mr Ryan said Republicans should not give up on the plan, but added that he would now turn his attention to overhauling the tax code. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, described the result as a disappointing moment . He continued It s time to move on. Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks blamed Mr McConnell for the failure, telling CNN the leadership at the top is responsible. The buck stops there . If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done on this, how is he going to get the job done on the rest of President Trump s agenda over the next three and a half years he asked. Mr Brooks added that Mr McConnell should pressure the Senate to pass a new version of former President Barack Obama s signature law the Affordable Care act or step down. Iowa Congressman singled out Mrs Murkowski and Mr McCain for the loss. He said Mrs Murkowski was initially appointed to her position by her father and that her write in campaign in 2010 was essentially a revolt against Republican primary voters. Mrs Murkowski was elected to her fourth term last year. Congressman Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, was among several lawmakers to share his disappointment on Twitter. Texas Senator John Cornyn tweeted it was up to Democrats now to protect Americans from a market collapse.
Iowa Senator Joni Ernst tweeted she was disappointed the Senate could not repeal the flawed law while Georgia Senator David Perdue blamed an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self interests ahead of national interest . The American people should be outraged and should demand real change now, he said in a statement. It is extremely important that we get this fixed. But Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich applauded Mr McCain, Mrs Murkowski and Mrs Collins in a tweet on Friday, saying Courage is contagious . President Trump lamented the failed vote during a speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York on Friday afternoon, but added you can t have everything . He told the crowd he said from the beginning to let Obamacare implode first and then repeal it. I turned out to be right, he added. A spokesman for Mr Obama weighed in on the debate on Friday, praising those who mobilised, organised and made their voices heard . President Obama still believes that it is possible for Congress to demonstrate the necessary bipartisanship and political courage to keep delivering on the promise of quality, affordable health insurance for Americans, Kevin Lewis said in a statement. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer lauded the three senators who voted against the bill. I have not seen a senator who speaks truth to power as strongly as well as frequently as John McCain, he said at a news conference on Friday. He also called Mrs Collins and Mrs Murkowksi tough women and said he spoke to Speaker Ryan on Friday about working on bipartisan legislation. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Instead of beating the drum for healthcare reform, the administration has been all over the map. A hastily announced ban on transgender individuals in the armed forces, issued by presidential tweet. A press conference to herald efforts to combat gang violence. A campaign style rally in Ohio with a focus on the threats of illegal immigration. A speech to a Boy Scouts gathering that was heavy on media bashing.
In case that wasn t enough, over the past week the administration has been beset by internecine warfare. Mr Trump publicly questioned the effectiveness of his former campaign confidant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, subjecting him to an increasingly angry barrage of tweets. Read Anthony in full The bill officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act would have eliminated parts of Obamacare, including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more. It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women s group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations. But the pared down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals. A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place. The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it. Mr McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans. There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress. However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year. Following the vote, President Trump tweeted As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Mr Trump s position on healthcare reform has varied he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself. In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of collapse , with healthcare premiums skyrocketing and providers fleeing the marketplace .
He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama era majority and called for senators to return to the correct way of legislating with input from both parties. We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve, he said. But Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted the fight was not over. Mark my words, this journey is not yet done, he said.

By . James Chapman and Jason Groves . Last updated at 11 32 PM on 9th December 2011 . Nick Clegg is facing a mutiny from his own party after supporting David Cameron s decision to wield the veto. The Deputy Prime Minister backed the Prime Minister s negotiating position after being telephoned by him in the early hours of yesterday to discuss the unfolding events. But Mr Clegg apparently believed the veto would not be necessary, as France and Germany would roll over and make concessions to Britain to maintain treaty change at the level of all 27 EU countries. Showing the strain Nick Clegg right has come under fire from his own party after backing David Cameron s decision to veto the eurozone rescue package file picture In Europe s periphery Mr Cameron looks anxiously at German Chancellor Angela Merkel at yesterday s eurozone summit in Brussels after wielding the veto . The failure of the deal and use of the veto has left the overwhelmingly pro EU Lib Dems close to a state of crisis with senior ministers said to be deeply concerned . They fear the Coalition will be put under unprecedented strain and sources warned that any Tory moves to loosen ties with the EU further would lead to open revolt among the Lib Dem membership. Former party leader Lord Ashdown said There will be a huge price to pay and, as a consequence, the foreign policy priorities of this country for the past 40 years has gone down the plughole in a single night. That foreign policy has now been hijacked by the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party aided by a Prime Minister who was not prepared to stand up for the national interest. Damning criticism Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott left said it was a black day for Britain and Europe , while former party leader Lord Ashdown right said there will be a huge price to pay further down the line . He told the Guardian As a consequence . we have lost control of the European agenda and the Prime Minister has . lost control of the demands for a referendum. This has been Gallic .
payback time for the way in which Cameron went around Europe lecturing . Sarkozy on what to do. Prominent Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close political ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, described the summit outcome as a black day for Britain and Europe . He said We are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken. With the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff, we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the City of London above our vital national interest of working closely together with Germany and France to keep our economy and jobs all over Britain safe. Lorely Burt, chairman of the Lib Dem parliamentary party, said it was unclear why Mr Clegg had agreed to the decision. She said I gather Cameron phoned our illustrious leader before he decided to do this. There must have been reasons. I don t see them at the moment. Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said the UK . was facing a worst case scenario of isolation in Europe. Mr Horwood . said the result was not the ideal outcome from a Lib Dem point of . view . Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of leaving Britain on the sidelines of Europe Furious Mr Miliband, a staunch pro European, said Mr Cameron caved into the demands of Tory Eurosceptics . But he blamed Tory Eurosceptics for pushing the Prime Minister into a corner. He added It will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the European single market and the future of the European economy. Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies accused the Government of adopting a xenophobic approach to Europe. Far from keeping Britain strong, Cameron has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table, he said. By seeking to protect bankers from regulation, he has betrayed Britain s real interests and done nothing in practice to help the City of London.
The fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us. Fellow MEP Sharon Bowles warned the UK face revenge attacks from the rest of Europe. She said There is already mood music within the parliament that if the UK wants it some people will take a great deal of satisfaction in making sure we don t have it. By contrast, Mr Cameron s position in his own party has been greatly strengthened though he will now face renewed demands for a referendum as the other members of the EU forge a fiscal union. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was tempting to say well done to Mr Cameron, but insisted he had gained nothing London Mayor Boris Johnson who piled . pressure on Mr Cameron in the run up to the summit, and has been . increasingly touted as a leadership rival said David Cameron has . played a blinder and he has done the only thing that was really open to . him to do. Eurosceptic MPs cheered the result but made it clear that they would step up the pressure on Mr Cameron at Westminster to go further in distancing Britain from the heart of the new European project. Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who quit the Government over Europe in October, hailed Mr Cameron s stance as a paradigm shift in our relationship with the EU , which made a referendum more likely. Temporary truce Boris Johnson, increasingly touted as a leadership rival, said Mr Cameron had played a blinder He added There is going to be inevitable pressure for further repatriation of substantial powers, and people may well be asked before the end of this parliament for their view on an in or out referendum. The leading Eurosceptic Bill Cash said the decision to wield the veto was a historic moment for Europe. He added We are now embarked on a very serious, responsible path towards renegotiating the whole of our treaty relationship.
WASHINGTON CNN Hundreds of thousands of visitors to the National Mall crowded Metro stations around Washington on Tuesday, slowing movement to a crawl after the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. A security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama s inauguration. All of our stations are overcrowded, said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. It s taking hours for people to get back into the stations. Police were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said. But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience. As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go. Throughout the weekend, we ve effectively dealt with record breaking crowds, said Metro General Manager John Catoe. By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday s ridership record with nine more hours of service to go. Monday s 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record. The Metro numbers were just one record setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone. Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office. A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane s, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security. Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be.
The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far. FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people, but none was anything serious. About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first aid needs. Some security screening lines ran slowly, officials said, but there had not been any major systemic problems. Earlier in the day, federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The FBI was investigating two streams of intelligence suggesting that Somalia based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event, the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN. Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level, an administration official said. The ceremony went off without incident. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, a Foreign Terrorist Organization in February. The State Department calls it a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda. Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Also Tuesday, a false alarm prompted police to temporarily close a 25 mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said. Investigators had received a tip that a man headed to Washington was threatening the inaugural, but they eventually determined there is no danger to the public, FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. Two law enforcement sources said the man s mother phoned in a tip to authorities saying her son was traveling in a vehicle containing a bomb. New Jersey State Police stopped a man in a vehicle on the highway Tuesday afternoon, questioned him and searched his vehicle, several law enforcement sources said. Officials said he never posed a threat.
It s unclear what, if any, action might be taken against the mother. Tuesday in Washington, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen were deployed on land, water and in the air in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration was secure. The security effort involved Secret Service agents 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions 10,000 National Guardsmen about 1,000 FBI personnel and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard were ready to respond if there was an emergency, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Security planners drew up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage, he said. Watch the anti sniper detail prepare . Federal officials acknowledged that the inauguration of the first African American president could make an attractive target. Since Obama s election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacist groups. They have ramped up their anti Obama comments, officials said, but it appears to be more talk than action. Because inaugural events are spread over four days, security is especially challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. CNN s Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson, Kevin Bohn, Carol Cratty and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.
Lib Dem Baroness Hamwee had asked if the 1 pay rate for people who have committed no crime was something that as a society we can be proud of . Baroness Williams of Trafford told the Lords the work by inmates was voluntary and was a way to relieve boredom . She said it helped meet recreational and intellectual needs and was not a scheme designed to save money. Baroness Williams, who faced jeers as she answered questions in the House of Lords, argued that any rights detainees had to work were curtailed, so their pay rights were not the same as people who are not subject to immigration detention . Labour frontbencher Lord Rosser argued that a Freedom of Information request in May 2014 suggested that hundreds of detainees had been paid 45,438 for 44,832 hours work. The saving of using detainees for 1 an hour, compared to paying employed staff on minimum wage, would be in the region of 300,000 a month. Who gets the benefit of this apparently considerable saving each month by using detainees at immigration centres on just 1 an hour to do necessary work, as opposed to using employed staff on the minimum wage Is it the government or is the firm running the centre who reap treat financial benefit Baroness Williams insisted the work at immigration removal centres was not about supplementing contractors, who she said were obliged to provide a minimum number of opportunities for detainees to participate voluntarily in paid activities. But after Lib Dem Lord Paddick received a similar reply, former Commons Speaker Lady Boothroyd pressed the minister The question that s being asked is who benefits That was the original question and that s the question we re all waiting to hear the answer. Lady Williams replied Who benefits is the detainee. She said that this money is not wages as the ordinary working population would see it , adding that the rate is being reviewed and a report is expected at the end of the year.
The Grade I listed buildings at Cannington Court have been restored over the past three years. Staff will use the base to develop skills in smart metering, new nuclear projects, finance and human resources. Chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz, said We are committed to developing the new skills and ideas to build a low carbon society. Cannington Court is owned by Bridgwater College and has been leased to EDF Energy. When it is not used by EDF staff, the college will make use of the facilities for its students. EDF has used sustainable energy sources, such as ground source heat pumps and solar panels, to provide 50 of the building s power. At the scene, BBC business correspondent, Dave Harvey On the face of it, a new training centre for a multi national company is not big news. For the staff and the managers, it was certainly a big day in Cannington, as the French chief exec drove into Somerset with a government minister to do the honours. But for the rest of us Well the opening of EDF s new national training centre is significant, for two reasons. One, it underlines the company s commitment to Somerset. As Vincent de Rivaz told me, they want to bring staff from Scotland, Suffolk and the South East to learn nuclear technology in Cannington. It matters also because it demonstrates how confident EDF was that Hinkley C would be approved. Vincent de Rivaz approved the multimillion pound hub four years ago, before Hinkley C even had planning permission. He knew there were hurdles, but he never doubted it would go ahead. We are now told Hinkley C s final investment decision, the absolutely last green light, will come before Christmas. Mr de Rivaz is clearly losing no sleep over that decision. Cannington Court was also previously a Catholic industrial school for boys and an agricultural college.
Last month, EDF Energy confirmed it had reached an agreement with Chinese state run energy firm China General Nuclear Power Corporation CGN on their level of investment for a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. Although CGN has confirmed it will pay Â 6bn towards the cost, EDF has not yet announced its final investment decision. Once this is confirmed the nuclear build will go ahead but, due to the long delays in the project, the plant will not be generating power in 2023 as initially planned. Anti nuclear campaigners say the nuclear build deal is over priced and will result in higher electricity bills for consumers. They also say nuclear power is unsafe and unsustainable.
The arch at Wembley was illuminated in the colours of France s flag and the whole stadium sang French national anthem La Marseillaise before England s friendly with France on Tuesday. Wenger attended the game at Wembley, having been in Paris on Friday when 129 people were killed there. The football world has a big union and togetherness, said the Frenchman. You always think after this kind of event do you continue to play or do you stop your life The Stade de France, which was hosting France s friendly against Germany, was targeted as part of Friday s attacks Belgium s friendly with Spain on Tuesday and Germany s match against Netherlands were subsequently called off. Wenger said the decision to play Tuesday s game at Wembley was right and thanked the English community for their show of solidarity. He said It was fantastic for France and it showed the class of England to see the arch of Wembley in French colours. Now we must get on with life and respond to the situation in a positive way. You can t stop everything. You have to focus on something else. Arsenal visit West Brom on Saturday 15 00 GMT , and Wenger said he will check that France international Laurent Koscielny is in the right frame of mind to play. You could see he was not himself on Tuesday, said Wenger. It has affected him deeply. He wasn t the same player. I will talk with him to see if he is completely recovered and focused. It is a big game for us. If he is not completely committed or feels ready I will not play him. Newspaper reports on Thursday suggested Arsenal were set to offer forward Alexis Sanchez, 26, and record signing Mesut Ozil, 27, new contracts. Sanchez and Ozil are both under contract until 2018, and Wenger believes the club are in no rush to tie them down for longer. We have some time. We are not in a hurry, he said. We want them to stay.
CNN Some people like Christmas. Some people love Christmas. And some people are so overcome by their love for the holiday season they decorate homes, gardens, even their vehicles in decorations so spectacular you have to worry about their energy bills. CNN asked people across the world to send in the most stunning and outrageous Christmas displays they had seen. We received submissions from the Dominican Republic to Russia, all of which displayed the inventiveness of people during the holiday season. The U.S., of course, is where outrageous Christmas displays have been elevated to an art form. Robert Ondrovic s image of his neighbor Kevin Lynch s house in Queens, New York, shows a house so festooned with lights and decorations it s hard to make out the front door. Lynch, a retired firefighter, reportedly used more than 300,000 lights and 350 figurines. I was amazed at the display, including the total amount of lights and figurines, Ondrovic said. Plus, Kevin plays Christmas music outdoors. Read more 9 sparkling North American Christmas markets . But the U.S. now faces stiff international competition. In the Philippines, where Christmas celebrations are taken so seriously they begin in September, the light displays are so bright they seem like they could be visible from space. iReporter Marlo Cueto took some stunning images of families enjoying a beautiful light show in Pasay City. I think the show s significance is to make people feel the excitement and happiness of Christmas in the middle of a busy district, he said. It brings people together, friends and families. Meanwhile in the Caribbean, Misael Rincon sent in a series of colorful, Day Glo shots of Christmas decorations in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. But while the decorations are playful, the sentiment behind them rings true for Misael. Christmas is a moment to share with family, the arrival of loved ones who are living outside the country, he said.
It s about love, faith and hope for the coming of God in a humble manger. Of course it s not just homes, stores and public spaces that benefit from a sprinkling of tinsel and fairy lights many like to deck out their vehicles as well.

GOP Health Plan Would Leave 23 Million More Uninsured, Budget Office Says Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla Getty Images Chip Somodevilla Getty Images The revised Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will leave 23 million more people uninsured in 2026 than if that act, also known as Obamacare, were to remain in place. The GOP bill would also reduce the deficit by 119 billion over 10 years. That s what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday in its latest score of the American Health Care Act. The CBO s assessment shows that the deficit would fall and premiums would fall for some Americans, but the report also raises potential concerns about the bill. The agency reports that the bill could destabilize individual insurance markets in some states, leaving unhealthy Americans unable to buy insurance. The bill will now move on to the Senate, and should it pass that chamber, it will not look like this current AHCA version. As NPR s Susan Davis reported Wednesday, the Senate is likely to write its own version of the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also told Reuters he doesn t know what that path to passing the bill will look like. I don t know how we get to 50 votes at the moment. But that s the goal, he said. A smaller deficit, but a far higher uninsured rate The 119 billion deficit reduction represents a decline from previous versions. When the CBO first scored the AHCA, it said the plan would save 337 billion over 10 years. Later revisions reduced those savings to 150 billion. By far the biggest savings would come from Medicaid, which serves low income Americans. That program would face 834 billion in cuts. Cutbacks in subsidies for individual health insurance would likewise help cut 276 billion. But those are offset in large part by bigger costs, including the repeal of many of Obamacare s taxes. Those tax cuts would overwhelmingly benefit the highest income Americans, the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, reported on Wednesday.
The increase in the number of uninsured is also slightly lower than in the CBO s initial estimate. That report estimated that 24 million fewer would be insured in 2026 if this bill were to become law, putting the uninsured rate at around 18.6 percent. This revised bill would reduce that by around 1 million a difference of less than half a percentage point. In contrast, the uninsured rate in 2026 would be around 10 percent under Obamacare, the CBO reports. More than half of that increase in the uninsured 14 million would come from reduced Medicaid enrollment. The CBO also notes that the AHCA could mean some Americans would buy policies that don t cover major medical risks. Because of those policies skimpy coverage, the CBO doesn t count those people as insured in this report. The Trump administration responded by saying it believes the CBO s numbers are unreliable. History has proven the CBO to be totally incapable of accurately predicting how healthcare legislation will impact health insurance coverage, the White House said in a statement. The CBO did indeed far overestimate the number of people who would sign up for the Obamacare exchanges, as FactCheck.org s Brooks Jackson wrote in March. Likewise, it undershot on the number of Medicaid enrollees. That said, Jackson added, the CBO predicted the uninsured rate relatively closely. Difficulties for some addicted, pregnant or sick Americans The act could make obtaining health care coverage prohibitively expensive for some sicker Americans, the CBO found. That s because under the AHCA, states could get waivers exempting them from some Obamacare provisions, including what are called essential health benefits a list of basics like mental health and prescription drugs that the Affordable Care Act required plans to cover. States could also get waivers that allow insurers to charge more for people with pre existing conditions. One challenge the CBO faced in creating these estimates was figuring out how many states would get those waivers, and the report acknowledges that this creates some uncertainty in the estimates.
In the end, it estimated that around one sixth of the population lives in states that would seek both of those waivers. Around half of Americans live in states that would seek no waivers, meanwhile, and the remainder live in states that would make moderate changes. In states that obtained both of those waivers, it would mean lower premiums for people buying individual insurance. But less healthy Americans in those states could face extremely high premiums, the report said. Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people including people with preexisting medical conditions in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly, the CBO wrote. Waiving essential health benefits could also make medical care much more expensive for people who are pregnant, addicted or have other mental health issues and who live in those states that waive those benefits. In particular, out of pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services, the report says of people living in those states. Under current law, the CBO wrote, the markets will be stable in most areas because lower income Americans buying individual insurance will be shielded from rising Obamacare premiums, thanks to subsidies. However, the report acknowledges that insurers have reduced their participation in the exchanges, leaving some Americans with no options for buying insurance. The Affordable Care Act doesn t have a back up plan for this situation, as Vox s Sarah Kliff and Sarah Frostenson reported Wednesday, so it s not clear how this could play out. Cuts to Medicaid Medicaid accounts for by far the biggest spending reductions under the American Health Care Act. The bill would roll back the Medicaid expansion instituted under the Affordable Care Act, which extended the program to cover some Americans with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty line. That expansion increased enrollment by 10 million, as NPR s Alison Kodjak previously reported. Rolling back that expansion would limit future enrollments.
The AHCA would also give states a choice Receive Medicaid funding via either a block grant or a per capita amount per enrollee. Together, these changes would create major cuts in enrollment for the program 14 million fewer people by 2026, and 834 billion in spending cuts over a decade. Older, lower income Americans get higher premiums Average premiums would be lower in 2026 than they would be under Obamacare, both in states that do and that don t seek waivers. But it s impossible to make a meaningful blanket statement about how premiums would change under this bill, as those changes differ vastly for different groups of people. For example, older Americans who make little money and buy individual insurance would see their premiums climb far beyond what they would be under Obamacare. A 64 year old making 26,500 would pay 1,700 in premiums annually under Obamacare. In a state making those moderate changes to its market, that 64 year old would pay 13,600, and in a state with no waivers, the cost would be 16,100. That s more than nine times that person s premium under the Affordable Care Act. However, younger Americans would see little change in their premiums, or even declines. Likewise, some people with higher incomes could see substantially lower premiums under this bill. For example, a 40 year old paying 6,500 a year under current law could pay an estimated 2,100 in a state with moderate changes to its market. The bill moves on to the Senate The CBO s newly estimated deficit savings mean the bill can safely move on to the Senate. The future of the bill hinged upon this report, as House Republicans passed their most recent version of the bill without waiting for the CBO to report its estimated price tag. Three weeks after passing the bill, however, they have not sent the bill on to the Senate yet, because they were waiting on this score.
Budget rules dictate that if the bill s deficit savings had not reached 2 billion and that 2 billion had to come from particular spending categories , the bill would be dead upon arrival. Republicans American Health Care Act would be devastating to older Americans who rely on the individual insurance market, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO found that the revised Republican bill does bring down overall premiums in the individual market by anywhere from 4 to 20 percent by 2026 compared with what they would be under current law. The variation depends on whether a state accepts waivers under the American Health Care Act, which would allow insurers to offer much skimpier health plans at lower premiums. States that take up such waivers would see lower premiums, although the health plans would provide fewer benefits. States that don t adopt such waivers would have higher premiums, but their health plans would offer more benefits a trade off. But the CBO s analysis includes a big caveat Premiums would differ greatly based on age and income. In general, the older and poorer you are, the higher your premiums would be under the American Health Care Act compared with current law. The CBO offers an example of a single individual with an annual income of 26,500. If that person is 21 years old, he could benefit from the Republican health care bill. Under the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare , he would on average pay 1,700 in premiums for insurance. Under the Republican plan, he would pay 1,250 if he s in a state that accepts regulatory waivers and makes moderate changes to market rules although, again, this also means his health plan would likely be skimpier. If his state doesn t take up a waiver, his premium would actually increase by 50 to 1,750. But if that person is 64 years old, he would be hurt by the Republican bill. Under Obamacare, he would also pay 1,700 in premiums for insurance.
But under the Republican bill, he would pay 16,100 about 60 percent of his annual income if he lives in a state that doesn t accept regulatory waivers, and 13,600 still more than half his annual income if he lives in a state that does adopt waivers to make moderate rule changes. That amounts to as much as an 850 percent increase in premiums from Obamacare to the Republican bill. A 64 year old who s making 68,200 a year could fare a bit better. Under Obamacare, he s expected to pay 15,300 in premiums for insurance, because his income would be too high to receive the law s tax credits. Under the Republican bill, the tax credit, which is now based on age instead of income, begins phasing out at 75,000. So his premium would drop to 13,600 a bit below Obamacare levels in a state that gets a regulatory waiver but would actually increase to 16,100 in a state that doesn t get a waiver. Here s how all of that looks in chart form Older people with an annual income of 75,000 or more would get fewer to no subsidies under the Republican bill. So they would likely face higher premiums than they did under Obamacare, much like the lower income consumer. The Republican bill accomplishes all of this in two ways. First, it abandons Obamacare s income based tax credits which give more money to people with lower incomes to instead give anyone with an annual salary below 75,000 a tax credit based on age, with older people getting more money and a phaseout for higher incomes. But it also peels back an Obamacare rule that protects older people from higher premiums. Under Obamacare, insurers are generally only allowed to charge an older person about three times what they would charge a younger person under the theory that older people are often sicker and therefore need to use more insurance.
But under the Republican bill, the limit of three times would go up to five times, effectively letting insurers charge older people 66 percent more than they would under Obamacare. Republicans argue this is necessary because it would also let insurers charge younger people less, which would encourage younger and generally healthier people to come into the insurance pool and therefore bring down the overall cost of health care by making it so more younger, healthier people are effectively subsidizing everyone s care. The CBO found that s broadly true It would bring insurance premiums down in general, and it would cost at least some young people less to get signed up for a health plan. But it would do all of that at a very high cost to older, particularly poorer Americans. Daron Taylor The Washington Post Health care legislation adopted by House Republicans earlier this month would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 than under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday only a million fewer than the estimate for the House s previous bill. The nonpartisan agency s finding, which drew immediate fire from Democrats, patient advocates, health industry officials and some business groups, is likely to complicate Republicans push to pass a companion bill in the Senate. The new score, which reflects last minute revisions that Republicans made to win over several conservative lawmakers and a handful of moderates, calculates that the American Health Care Act would reduce the federal deficit by 119 billion between 2017 and 2026. That represents a smaller reduction than the 150 billion CBO estimated in late March, largely because House leaders provided more money in their final bill to offset costs for consumers with expensive medical conditions and included language that could translate to greater federal spending on health insurance subsidies. What is in the Republican health care bill Questions and answers on preexisting conditions, Medicaid and more. As GOP senators quickly distanced themselves from the updated numbers, what became apparent is the difficult balancing act congressional leaders face as they seek to rewrite large portions of the Affordable Care Act.
Some senators are eager to soften portions of the House bill, including cuts to entitlement programs and provisions that would allow insurers in individual states to offer fewer benefits in their health plans or to charge consumers with costly medical conditions higher premiums. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky. , who did not issue a statement in response to the new budget score, suggested in an interview with Reuters that he still harbored doubts over whether his party could muster enough votes to pass any kind of health care bill this year. I don t know how we get to 50 votes at the moment, he said, referring to a situation in which Vice President Pence would cast the deciding vote. But that s the goal. To avoid a filibuster by Democrats, Senate Republicans plan to take the bill up under budget reconciliation rules which only require a majority vote but mean the legislation cannot increase the federal deficit within a 10 year window. The Republicans have been working for weeks on their own health care bill and emphasize that they do not intend to simply follow the House s lead. Exactly what the composition of our legislation is, I m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose, McConnell told Reuters. Some, like Sen. David Perdue R Ga. , said the CBO score would have no impact on his chamber s efforts to write its own bill. The three numbers you need to understand the CBO report on Republicans health care bill Regardless of any CBO score, it s no secret Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, Perdue said in a statement. Doing nothing is not an option. Instead of addressing the future number of uninsured Americans under the Republican plan projected to immediately jump in 2018 by 14 million House Speaker Paul D. Ryan R Wis. on Wednesday chose to focus on the CBO s estimate that premiums overall would fall under the AHCA. This CBO report again confirms that the American Health Care Act achieves our mission lowering premiums and lowering the deficit, Ryan said in a statement.
It is another positive step toward keeping our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Congressional analysts concluded that one change to the House bill aimed at lowering premiums, by allowing states to opt out of some current insurance requirements, would encourage some employers to maintain coverage for their workers and get younger, healthier people to buy plans on their own. But those gains would be largely offset by consumers with preexisting conditions, who would face higher premiums than they do now. Their premiums would continue to increase rapidly, the report found. The CBO estimated that states seeking waivers to strip the ACA s essential health benefits would affect roughly one sixth of the population and that obtaining maternity coverage outside a basic plan, for example, could be more than 1,000 per month. But Rep. John Faso R N.Y. , who supported the House bill, called the CBO s assumption that waivers would affect that many Americans grossly wrong. Frankly I doubt any state would try to take advantage of that provision, he said. I think that is completely out of the ballpark. Asked why the House included the provision if no state would seek such waivers, he replied, I m sure it will be stripped out in the Senate. The administration s reaction came from Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who questioned the congressional analysts latest numbers while noting that many Americans on the individual insurance market are paying more than double the premiums they were before the ACA was passed in 2010. The CBO was wrong when they analyzed Obamacare s effect on cost and coverage, and they are wrong again, Price said. Trump, House GOP ask appeals court to again delay decision on health care law provision Joseph Antos, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who specializes in health care policy, said the new estimate is the same signal repeated, conveying that the changes congressional Republicans envision would cut the price of premiums and trim the deficit while leaving more Americans without insurance.
The AHCA s proposal to cut spending on Medicaid a federal program that covers roughly 69 million Americans by 834 billion over the next decade is the thorniest political issue facing the Senate, Antos said. They re going to have to do something on Medicaid, and that something is a real question, he said. Rep. Mark Meadows R N.C. , chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he was confident the Senate would be able to craft a bill that could pass muster in the House even in light of the CBO s analysis. He said that he expected senators to address the situation of the roughly 10 million Americans who now enjoy Medicaid coverage under the ACA in a less conservative way than the House and that the measure would still have conservative support in the House when it came back. Senate Democrats seized on the new budget estimate, arguing that their GOP counterparts would be foolhardy to press ahead along the same lines as the House s final legislation. The bill was passed May 4 with no support from Democrats. These were cosmetic changes. They thought they could put lipstick on a pig, said Sen. Ron Wyden D Ore. , adding that it s now obvious we re going to have well over 20 million people uninsured. Several key outside groups, including those representing physicians, hospitals and patients, said in statements that the updated projections underscored the need for the Senate to shift course. The president of the American Medical Association urged the Senate to take a different approach. The CBO estimates show that last minute changes to the AHCA made by the House offered no real improvements, Andrew Gurman said. And Rick Pollack, president and chief executive of the American Hospital Association, said the new numbers only reinforce our deep concerns about the importance of maintaining coverage for those vulnerable patients who need it.

By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12 30 PM on 29th November 2011 . Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK but a quarter of them are unaware that they have the disease, according to the Health Protection Agency. The latest figures show the number of sufferers has risen from 86,500 to 91,500 between 2009 and 2010. Of the 6,660 people newly diagnosed with . HIV in 2010, half came forward for testing after a time when treatment . should ideally have started. Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK. This electron micrograph shows how HIV orange invades healthy immune system cells . Early treatment boosts chances of living longer with the precursor to Aids. Of the 680 people with HIV who died in 2010, two thirds had been diagnosed late. Heterosexual men were the most likely to be diagnosed late, at 63 per cent compared with 39 per cent of gay men and 58 per cent of heterosexual women. The human immunodeficiency virus HIV attacks the body s immune system, which we need to fight disease and infection. The virus specifically attacks CD4 cells. Although the body will try to produce replacements, the number will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working. Once the person acquires a life threatening condition, such as pneumonia, they are said to have the last stage of HIV Acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS . HIV is spread through bodily fluids most commonly during unprotected sex. There is no cure but since the 1990s treatments have been developed to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows people to live with the disease for a very long time. In 2009, the World Health Organisation estimated there were 33.4m people across the globe living with HIV AIDS. In 2010, more than 3,000 gay men were diagnosed with HIV the highest ever annual figure. One in 20 gay men are now infected with HIV nationally, rising to one in 11 in London.
Today s data also suggests that a stigma is still attached to the condition, revealing that one in five people visiting a sexually transmitted infection STI clinic in 2010 did not accept an HIV test. The HPA is recommending that, in areas where prevalence of HIV is high, testing should be offered in places where it is not currently the norm. Testing should be offered to all people signing up with a GP and those admitted to hospital, but only with the patient s permission. Dr Valerie Delpech, consultant epidemiologist and head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said HIV is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection. However, we are very concerned that a large number of people in the UK are unaware of their HIV status and are diagnosed late. We want to see increased access to HIV testing routinely offered in clinical settings such as new registrants at GPs and hospital general admissions, in areas of the country where rates of HIV infection are high. The cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is estimated to be around 18,000 per year when they are not showing any symptoms. This is based on the price of care as well as triple drug antiretroviral therapy. However, it costs 21,500 to treat patients who are showing symptoms and 41,000 for those with full blown AIDS. Patients who have four drugs cost the NHS between 22,775 and 48,000 per year. The annual cost of providing HIV treatment and care in the UK could be as high as 758m by 2013, according to a study in PLoS One. We are also urging sexual health . clinics to ensure that HIV testing is offered as part of a universal . sexual health screen at every new attendance. Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said The number of people who don t know they have HIV and are diagnosed late is a serious issue.
Not only does it have a severe impact on health and reduce life expectancy, this largely accounts for the onward transmission of HIV as people aren t taking the necessary steps to avoid passing it on. She added People shouldn t be scared of HIV testing, but they should be scared of undiagnosed HIV. The advances in HIV treatment have been one of the biggest success stories in the 30 years since the virus first emerged, but too many people test too late and so fail to benefit from these drugs. Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said HIV rates in the UK remain dangerously high and to bring them down we all have to take responsibility for our sexual health. We can t just rely on partners, or chance, to keep sex safe. The HPA has previously predicted that by 2012 there will be 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK. The study comes just ahead of World Aids Day on December 1.

By . Jonathan O Callaghan . Spinning wind turbines might soon be confined to the recycling bin. That s because German company Festo have revealed their innovative design for a new wind turbine that can operate even in low wing conditions. Known as the DualWingGenerator, it uses . two pairs of wings to generate power even when the wind speed drops to . nine miles 14 km per hour. Scroll down to watch video . The product is part of Festo s Bionic Learning Network and mimics the natural beating of a bird s wings. As one wing rises the other drops so that they help each other move even when the wind speed is low. The shape of the wings means they generate lift when wind passes over them. The motion of the wings is turned into electricity by an integrated circuit motor. As one wing rises the other falls, so it can operate even in conditions when wind speed is low . But it s the effectiveness of the turbine to operate at low wind speeds that really makes it impressive. It s possible that it could one day be used as an alternative to modern wind turbines. Festo s DualWingGenerator is the first flapping turbine of its kind . The DualWingGenerator is an evolution of Festo s SmartBird. The SmartBird s revolutionary design allows it to start, fly and land autonomously. Its wings not only beat up and . down, they also twist at specific angles, providing the ultra light . model with excellent aerodynamic qualities and extreme agility . Controlled by a radio handset, it can also simply glide through the skies if left to its own devices. Steering is achieved when the SmartBird, which weighs just 450 grams, moves its tail and turns its head from side to side. Inspired . by the herring seagull, scientists at technology firm Festo control the . up down flapping motion of the wings by spinning two wheels inside the . robot s torso.
The former England paceman has been suffering from a lower back issue , but is expected to feature in the five match ODI series beginning next week. Ireland play the Afghans in three T20s in India, staring on Wednesday. We re happy with the progress Boyd is making and feel confident that he will still make an impact on this tour, said Irish head coach John Bracewell. We are lucky that we have cover at present. Bracewell added that bowler Tim Murtagh would be available for the ODI series following the birth of his second child. The matches in Greater Noida conclude with an Intercontinental Cup encounter on 28 31 March.
CNN As recently as 2011, Hillary Clinton was seen by many as a respected but polarizing figure Smart and accomplished, sure, but controlled and somewhat humorless. In the infamous faint praise of her rival turned boss Barack Obama, she was likable enough. Three years later, she seems somehow hipper, looser and more ... human. As we inch toward the 2016 election, she s presented a new online persona. While Clinton has embraced social media, it hasn t always loved her back, as seen most recently on her current book tour. The Internet has used every opportunity to turn her words and actions into memes, not all of them flattering. So what happened How did Hillary Clinton suddenly go viral You can trace the change back to October 18, 2011, when then Secretary of State Clinton was traveling with her staff on a C 17 military plane from Malta to Tripoli, Libya. Nobody knew its importance at the time, but that s the day Reuters Kevin Lamarque and TIME s Diana Walker snapped a handful of photos that would soon become iconic Clinton, in oversize black shades and a no nonsense expression, checking her BlackBerry at a makeshift desk as staffers mingled behind her. Okay, nice image I thought, but we were about to land in Tripoli which was certain to yield the images that the world would really want to see, Lamarque wrote in a blog post months later. Photographers, you never really know when your pictures will resurface and what use they will be to someone out there. 5 things to watch in Hillary Clinton town hall . Texts From Hillary . You know the rest. Six months later, the photos were all over the Internet, thanks to two journalists with an idea that started as a joke at a bar. In April 2012, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith launched a blog, Texts From Hillary, that showed fictional text message exchanges between Clinton, from her seat on the plane, and a range of celebrities.
There she was rejecting a Mark Zuckerberg friend request, telling a flirty Ryan Gosling to call her Madame Secretary, blowing off Jon Stewart by saying she s already booked on Colbert and responding to Obama s Hey Hil, whatchu doing with Running the world. As the perfect vessels for deadpan mockery in the social media age, the posts and related Twitter feed soon were everywhere. Within days, Clinton invited Lambe and Smith to her office at the State Department, where she initiated a group photo of the trio texting on their phones. Although its makers shuttered the blog only a week later Once you meet the subject of your meme ... it s very hard to top that, Smith told CNN Clinton s image was altered almost overnight. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Barack Obama had a lock on young people, technology chic and the press. Hillary was regarded by kids as the lady who d been around a long time, wearing headbands and pantsuits, Maureen Dowd wrote that week in The New York Times. Now she s quick to laugh at herself and take advantage of the positive buzz, Dowd continued. Building a brand on Twitter . A few months after Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013, she joined Twitter. Her first tweet thanked Lambe and Smith for the inspiration and then said, I ll take it from here ... tweetsfromhillary. It was retweeted more than 10,000 times. And her Twitter bio became an instant classic of the form. It reads Wife, mom, lawyer, women kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD... Soon Clinton was posting childhood photos of husband Bill on his birthday, tributes to the late Nelson Mandela, a portrait of her with members of Russian band Pussy Riot and pleas for such pet causes as elephant poaching and empowering women in the developing world.
She has really embraced the platform in the right way. She has humanized herself and her brand, said Shama Hyder, CEO of the Marketing Zen Group. Today, participating in digital media isn t a choice, Hyder added. Your digital footprint is created regardless of your participation, and any smart politician knows that it is best to help curate that image vs. leaving others to define it for you. Clinton also has shown flashes of self mocking humor, as when she tweeted a joke during the Super Bowl in February about how she enjoyed watching someone else being blitzed and sacked on Fox for a change. Today, Clinton, 66, has 1.5 million Twitter followers, many who may not even remember her eight years in the White House. At least for now, she seems more comfortable in her skin witness the photos of her wearing thick glasses and almost no makeup although that may change if she runs for president again. The Internet isn t always nice . But getting the attention of the Internet is not always a good thing. Anything Clinton says has the potential to go viral, for worse as well as better. In January 2013, Clinton was fighting back criticism before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing about the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans, she said. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they d go kill some Americans What difference, at this point, does it make It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. The Twitter sphere quickly seized on the outburst, and within hours, WhatDifferenceDoesItMake was trending.
Not only did the hashtag spread, but so did a graphic of Clinton s 2008 campaign sign juxtaposed with the phrase What difference does it make Earlier this month, as she promoted her new book, Hard Choices, Clinton was trending again . In an interview with ABC s Diane Sawyer, Clinton said she and former President Bill Clinton were dead broke and struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages in pricey Washington and the New York suburbs along with their daughter Chelsea s tuition at Stanford University. Clinton sought to clarify her comment, saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled to pay off debt, but the damage was done. Her Twitter critics turned HillaryIsSoPoor into a mocking hashtag. Once and future candidate Criticism aside, should Clinton run for president in the 2016 election, digital branding experts believe the reborn, tech savvy Clinton will resonate better with voters, especially young ones. Marketing guru Marian Salzman believes the old Clinton hid her personality behind the security wall of public service. The new Clinton is undergoing a swift digital makeover, said Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America. How can she modernize, and fast Get online and exude an ageless hipster style that takes away the pain of the proximity between her age and the age of Ronald Reagan 69 when he took office, Salzman told CNN. The sudden burst of intellectual energy, even in 140 characters, reinforces she is of these times and living the now. Salzman believes Clinton must be her authentic self on social media to appear more relatable to voters. She needs humor and self awareness we don t want Mrs. Thatcher, she said, referring to the sometimes imperious former British prime minister. She needs to be of the people, and with them. It can t hurt to keep posting more personal messages such as her My most exciting title yet Grandmother To Be tweet congratulating Chelsea and husband Marc Mezvinsky on expecting their first child.
Hyder, of the Marketing Zen Group, believes Clinton still wants to be president and has realized she can no longer sit on the sidelines when it comes to digital media. I believe it has helped her garner many new fans and will continue to play a huge role in building her brand, Hyder told CNN. The last time Ms. Clinton had presidential aspirations, there wasn t a strong sense of her as a person. The public had a very one dimensional image. Using digital media in this way allows her to present a fuller ... more human picture. If she does decide to run, it could be a decisive factor. CNN s Dan Merica contributed to this report.
An Australian government agency has labelled the Sydney siege a terrorist attack. In positive news for businesses affected by the December attack on the Lindt chocolate cafe, Treasurer Joe Hockey today labelled the siege a terrorist incident for insurance purposes.

CNN Germany captain Michael Ballack enjoyed a dream return to the Bundesliga as his Bayer Leverkusen side claimed an impressive 2 0 victory at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Ballack, who rejoined first club Leverkusen during the summer after four years at Chelsea, played his part in a superb team performance as Leverkusen showed they will be one of the teams to watch this season. Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th minute and Brazilian Renato Augusto added a second goal just three minutes later to ensure the three points. In Sunday s other match, Mainz secured a surprise 2 0 home defeat over Stuttgart thanks to goals from debutant strikers Sami Allagui and Morten Rasmussen. Tunisian Allagui opened the scoring in the 26th minute and Danish international Rasmussen who joined on loan from Celtic this week added the second two minutes after the interval. With the first round of matches now complete, Hoffenheim lead the table courtesy of Saturday s stunning 4 1 win over Werder Bremen. Three goals in a bizarre six minute spell in the first half proved the difference between the sides after Torsten Frings had put Werder ahead from the penalty spot. Meanwhile, defending champions Bayern Munich got their season off to a perfect start on Friday as Bastian Schweinsteiger s last gasp goal gave them a 2 1 victory over Wolfsburg.

A two year old boy playing with his toy wheelbarrow was bowled over by a kangaroo which then pinned him down and tried to claw him to death. The screaming child s terrified parents ran at the animal and managed to chase it away but not before it left Zakkiah Galea with severe wounds to his face and body. His mother Nicole Galea last night told how the aggressive kangaroo left her in fear that her son had received fatal injuries in the attack on the family s ten acre property at Port Macquarie, in northern New South Wales. In hospital Two year old Zakkiah Galea was playing in his garden in New South Wales when he was attacked by a kangaroo which tried to claw him to death . Mrs Galea, who is eight months . pregnant, said The kangaroo was on top of him. He was pinned to the . ground while it clawed at his forearms. I screamed at the kangaroo to get off him but it wouldn t it just kept on attacking. It . was only when Zakkiah s father, Andrew Galea, rushed to help his wife . fight off the kangaroo that the animal finally ran off into nearby . bushland. It turned on Andrew first before hopping away, Mrs Galea told Sydney s Daily Telegraph. It was just awful to see Zakkiah. He had a bloody face and blood had soaked through his shirt. There was a deep puncture in his chest and a gash on the top of his leg. He had two large gouges from his mouth to his ear. Zakkiah s mother Nicole Galea said the aggressive kangaroo left her fearing that he had received fatal injuries during the attack on the family s ten acre property at Port Macquarie .
Native species The kangaroo only hopped away when it was scared off by the boy s father file picture Last night, Zakkiah was recovering at home from his wounds that required 13 stitches. His mother said He scared. He says he doesn t want to be attacked by the tiger kangaroo again. Other people in the remote neighbourhood have been attacked by kangaroos, said Mrs Galea, and she suspected urban development was to blame new houses forcing the animals into human environment. Peter Clark, of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, said people should be aware that kangaroos are wild animals of substantial size and power and might react instinctively and attack if they are startled. He suggested that people living close to kangaroos should fence off their properties and remove food, shelter and water opportunities. He also suggesting turning on water sprinklers to discourage the animals from gathering.
It was the day before Everton s return to Europe and Phil Jagielka was holding court in the media auditorium at Finch Farm. A naturally bubbly character, Jagielka was in high spirits as he focused on the imminent clash with Wolfsburg but it was only a matter of time before he knew the topic of conversation would change. He would have to confront a difficult summer and testing start to the new campaign. A little bit sticky, was how he chose to describe the last four months. It was, perhaps, an understatement. Having been in the firing line for England s World Cup demise and scrutinised for the poor goals Everton had been conceding, lesser souls might have found it all too much. Phil Jagielka is not one to shy away from pressure, and has faced a difficult period admirably . Everton captain Jagielka was impressive against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday . Jagielka scored a stunning goal from 25 yards to rescue a late point for his Everton side . Jagielka, though, is not someone who will ever hide. He is a character who will face up to issue and however hard he found the questions, he answered them impressively. He fights and doesn t give in. That is why, in the 91st minute of the 223rd Merseyside derby, he was scuffling around the edge of Liverpool s penalty area, trying to find a way of helping his team salvage something from a game that was slipping away. How Everton s captain delivered. Latching on to a headed clearance from Dejan Lovren, Jagielka crashed volley from 25 yards into the top corner of The Kop net, to leave Anfield bar one delirious Blue corner in stunned silence. It was, undoubtedly, the most spectacular goal scored by an Everton player behind enemy lines since Graeme Sharp s howitzer in 1984.
Simon Mignolet left is powerless to stop Jagielka s howitzer at Anfield on Saturday lunchtime . Everton players celebrate Jagielka s equalising goal, which rescued a point for the Toffees late on . Seasons, both individually and collectively, can be transformed in such dramatic moments and so high was the quality of the goal, Roberto Martinez labelled it the best he had seen at a live game. We pushed up a little bit and there was an opportunity about five minutes before when I elected to pass and I thought if one comes across again I ll swing one at it and thankfully the swinging worked, Jagielka said modestly. It s been a frustrating season so far and to go one nil down and to keep knocking at the door the way we did shows tremendous character. A point is decent, we d have loved three. But we ve got to make sure we keep the character strong because right now we re not picking up the right results. Jagielka s performance, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, may go some way to restoring his international place . Jagielka right admits he is no longer a starter in the England team, but his performance yesterday will have impressed Hodgson, sat observing in the Director s Box . Everton did not play well yesterday but, at the back, the combination of Jagielka and John Stones was solid and their respective performances would have been noted by England head coach Roy Hodgson, who was sat observing in the Directors Box. Jagielka accepts he is no longer a first choice for England, given he was dropped for the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, but if he keeps playing in this manner, both club and country will feel the benefit. This has to be a catalyst for revival. We ve performed ok but the results haven t shown it, said Jagielka.
So it s about the lads to come out and keep playing the way we are and keep having the courage to do the right things and hopefully they ll turn around. He is proof of that. Jagielka centre heads for the degout as he celebrates with team mates at Anfield .
By . Damien Gayle . Tragic Kamaljit Sidhu leapt from a motorway bridge after her former partner put her through an ordeal of stalking and harassment, a court heard . The mother of a woman who leapt from a motorway bridge has condemned her daughter s stalking ex lover for putting her through hell . Ryan Dey, 23, refused to accept that Kamaljit Sidhu wanted to end their 18 month relationship and made threats towards her and her friends. He was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29 year old. Passing sentence, a judge told how Dey had threatened to tell Miss Sidhu s family she had an abortion and that he had once beaten her up. Miss Sidhu s grieving mother Sarbjit Sidhu said evil Dey put her daughter through an ordeal of control and abuse in the weeks before she fell to her death. Does Ryan Dey really realise the damage he has inflicted on my beloved Kam, me and my family she asked in a statement released after the hearing today. We will never forget our baby Kam, I was unable to see her for the last time when she was put to rest and that has been difficult to deal with. Ryan Dey is evil, he is a bully and a coward and had put my daughter through hell with his control and abuse and will never be forgiven for what he has caused. As a mother and a family we want the world to know this can never be allowed to happen again, I do not want anyone else to go through what we have. Our lives have stopped and we can t breathe. She added The police asked is there anything we can do, Mrs Sidhu, and my only answer to them was can you please give me my daughter back, we really miss her, her death has left a big hole in our lives.
Miss Sidhu, who was known to loved ones as Kammi, leapt to her death last October from a bridge over the M6 near to Great Barr in the West Midlands, where she lived with her family. In the weeks leading up to her death, Birmingham Crown Court heard, she had been hounded by Dey, a lorry driver from Oldbury, who had refused to accept that she had put an end to their relationship. He made threats towards her, contacted her friends and had searched various locations in Birmingham, where she worked, trying to find her. She went on to make comments on social media telling friends that she was afraid of Dey in the lead up to her death. He put my daughter through hell Ryan Dey, left, was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu, right, jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29 year old . Judge Michael Chambers said You had been in a relationship with Kam for the previous 18 months notwithstanding the other relationship you were in. You did not like her seeing or socialising with anybody else. You did not even like it when she was seeing friends in her own home. She sought to end the relationship but instead of accepting it you started persistently harassing her. It led her to becoming very frightened. You even hacked into her Facebook system and sent messages to her friends pretending to be her. She was living at home with her parents and you called their land line at all times of night and day. You repeatedly went to the address and waited outside. The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu s death, she had been out at a bar with friends following a job interview in Birmingham. But her demeanour changed dramatically when she spotted Dey in the same bar with two men, leading her to drop down on all fours and hide from him.
She continued the evening with her friends and she ended up on motorway bridge having been drinking, the judge said. A message was written by her on a moisturiser bottle and said I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry. Afraid The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu s death, she had been out with friends in Birmingham. When Dey arrived at the bar with two men she dropped down on all fours to hide from him . Miss Sidhu jumped to her death at 4.30am on October 25, hours after the incident in the bar. I m satisfied that you did or said something to her that made her very frightened, said Judge Chambers. Coupled with the background plus whatever had caused her to be so frightened of her significant factor which caused her to fall off that bridge. I m satisfied she did take her life and you were a factor in that. What you did or communicate will never be known but from police interviews we know you threatened you would disclose to her family she had had an abortion and at least on one occasion you had beaten her up. She was a much loved and liked young woman with her life before her. Those close to her should understand any sentence does not reflect or measure the loss of a loved one. Dey was arrested a month after Miss Sidhu s death and charged with harrassment and stalking. Prosecutor Peter Grieves Smith told the court that on the night she spotted him while out drinking in Birmingham she had already told her parents that he had been in touch with her and that if he called the house not to tell him where she was. Dey began calling the Sidhus repeatedly, leading them to disconnect their phone. They did not wish to speak to him, the prosecutor said. But the effects of that meant when the victim tried to call her parents later that night she couldn t get through.
Much loved and liked The court heard that Dey repeatedly hacked into Miss Sidhu s Facebook account, sending abusive messages to her friends . Friends who were out with Miss Sidhu that evening got the impression that she was on edge, said Mr Grieves Smith. The effect of what he did by coming to the bar that night was that she was terrified. The victim continued to hide and eventually she returned looking distressed, he said. That night she left the bar after she was satisfied he was gone and she was given a lift by a friend. It was not long after she was dropped off she fell from the motorway bridge. Something had occurred to make her manifestly scared. We might never know what that was. The court heard Dey sent a string of threatening messages to Miss Sidhu on Facebook just hours before she died. Mr Grieves Smith added It was clear that one of the Facebook entries from the defendant at 1.30am that night said I m going to f you up . He repeatedly hacked into her Facebook account and could see who she was communicating with and what she was doing. A Facebook message on October 23 at 6.21am from the victim s account to a friend asked What do you think about orgies and threesomes . The message had been sent from the defendant who had hacked into the account. The victim s friend told police the defendant had said You stupid bitch I will tell your family all of the f ed up shit you have done. He also took her mobile phone and the purpose of doing so was control. Bit by bit it as time proceeded it got worse and had led to the moment of the early hours of October 25 when she died. Dey was sentenced to two years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after avoiding a trial by admitting stalking and causing serious alarm or distress at a hearing last month.
Following the sentencing today, detective chief inspector Kim Madill, from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said This has been a difficult, challenging and deeply upsetting case to investigate for all concerned. The investigation team has worked tirelessly to try and find some justice for Kamaljit and her family, following her tragic and untimely death. One can only imagine the fear and torment that Dey must have put her through to take such a course of action. Even though this conviction cannot bring Kamaljit back, hopefully the fact that Dey has admitted his crimes and is now facing a spell in prison will come as some comfort to her grieving family.
Younes Tsouli, 31, was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb making instructions and has used Human Rights Act to appeal against deportation . A jailed terrorist who wrote a letter from a British prison proclaiming jihadis as heroes is trying to avoid deportation from the UK on human rights grounds. Internet jihadi Younes Tsouli, 31 who was once described as Al Qaeda s most influential cyber terrorist was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb making instructions as well as beheading videos on the internet. Tsouli, who called himself Terrorist007 , was posting the material for Al Qaeda in Iraq. His prison term came to an end last November, but he was re arrested and detained ahead of his release as prison officials found a copy of an Al Qaeda magazine in his cell. A hearing at the Old Bailey last week cleared Tsouli of unlawfully possessing the material, and he was due to be deported immediately back to his native Morocco. But he has appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds, applying for asylum to the UK under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which states no one should be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . It is believed that Tsouli had been active in the global cyber jihadi scene since he moved to the UK to study IT at a London college in 2001. The cyber terrorist used to hack into respectable websites and use them as hosts for videos including the beheading of British hostage Ken Bigley and Americans Daniel Pearl and Nick Berg. Tsouli set up a website called YouBombIt which he described as a platform just like YouTube to post videos of bombings of Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has set up another called DeadZionists, and was in the process of setting up a third called Islamic Terrorism, when police raided his basement flat in Shepherd s Bush in 2005. His websites and forums were being used by jihadis across the world to communicate.
In July last year, the prison authorities intercepted a letter Tsouli had written to his father in Arabic, where he urged his family to join the jihad in Syria. In it he wrote This is a letter of advice to those members of my family who will learn their lesson and I hope that they are among those whom Allah has opened their hearts to what is good. Uncovered Prison officials at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire found the magazine inside Tsouli s cell . He quoted a saying of the Prophet Mohammed, which said Allah gives rewards to those who go out for jihad out of conviction and belief in Allah and his prophets. To those Allah will grant either victory or paradise. He also mentioned a recent religious ruling which was a call to arms in Syria, adding Prepare for the war since its flames are rising. The letter was read out during last week s hearing, where Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Inspire in his cell in September last year, two months after the letter was intercepted. The court heard the forensic tests done on the magazine had revealed that it passed around the prison, as fingerprints belonging to a number of terrorist inmates including Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the leader of the gang that tried to blow up airliners over the Atlantic were found on it. However, Tsouli was cleared as he argued the magazine formed part of legal material. He is being kept in detention while the Home Office fights his bid to stay. Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire in his cell in September last year . Jihadi John killed four US and UK hostages on camera under ISIS regime . A British jihadi who once hacked into the personal details of Tony Blair has tried to sell the identity of Jihadi John to The Mail on Sunday for 3,000. Junaid Hussain, 20, was jailed for six months in 2012 after publishing the former Prime Minister s address and National Insurance number on the internet.
In a series of online conversations, he told the MoS he would give us Jihadi John s name and old Twitter details, with which we would be able to uncover his identity. Hussain, from Birmingham, said he needed the money to buy a car to move his family around IS stronghold Raqqa in Syria. He also claimed Jihadi John, pictured, who killed four US and UK hostages on camera, was of Arab origin, was born a Muslim and has been in Syria for ages . The Mail on Sunday refused to pay the money, and Scotland Yard has been informed.

Carnes, Mississippi CNN The deaths of two Mississippi teens are about to put a national focus on a little recognized problem. Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi. Local teenagers said the site is a popular hangout because it s quiet and secluded. But the dead teens parents say the explosion could have been prevented if some warning signs had been posted something simple as fences, gates and signs, probably very inexpensive, and certainly a lot less expensive that what a child s life is worth, said White s father, Phillip. Police say they don t know exactly what ignited flammable vapors inside the tank. When it exploded, the teenagers were killed instantly. Their bodies were found about 40 yards from the tank s base the tank landed another 20 yards from them. Investigators say they found a lighter, but don t know whether it was involved. I couldn t believe that my child was gone, White s mother, Wanda, told CNN. The White and Byrd families have an ally in their camp. The Chemical Safety Board, created by Congress, investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years. Most of them involved young people. The CSB says it found a patchwork of laws nationwide that don t uniformly address security around oil and gas wells. It s asking the industry to police itself by voluntarily installing fences and warning signs. If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen, CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN. Delphi Oil, the company that owns the tank that blew up, told CNN it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families. A spokesman called the boys deaths tragic, but the company says it is complying with all rules.
However, authorities tell CNN there are no state regulations requiring locked gates or no smoking signs. He may be in compliance, Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee told CNN. But there s nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with. Carnes is about 40 miles north of the Gulf Coast. In nearby Laurel, city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs, according to Emergency Management District Executive Director Terry Steed. The CSB asked family and friends of Byrd and White to help them make an educational video about the dangers of oil and gas production sites. It s called No Place to Hang Out, and it s part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks. But it also urges the industry to improve itself. There s nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, said White s girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16. But if it can save someone else s life, I d like to see it happen. Like McDonalds, added another friend, Shawn Ashlee Davis. They have to put Caution. This coffee s hot on their cups . I really think they need signs warning This is a dangerous place. Mississippi state Sen. Billy Hudson told CNN he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed wire topped fences, locked gates and Danger Keep Out signs. There s no guarantees, Hudson said. You could cut the fence with a bolt cutter, or you can shoot off a lock. But it ll be a deterrent, and it s a step in the right direction. White s father says his son would be proud that friends and family are speaking out He d be proud that we re trying to do something to keep other kids and other families from going through what we re going through.
A survey into the proposals for Union Terrace Gardens UTG was launched two weeks ago. LDA Design said the aim including new access from surrounding streets was to make UTG a lively cultural hub . Aberdeen City Council said the survey showed 94 of people thought facilities would improve. It drew more than 1,400 responses, New access would be from Union Street and Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument. The central lawn space would be retained, and there would be a new café pavilion opposite His Majesty s Theatre HMT . Four years ago, councillors rejected plans for a 140m transformation of the gardens. Businessman Sir Ian Wood had offered 50m towards the cost.
Luis Suarez was also on target to take the combined tally for him, Messi and Neymar to 100 goals this season in all competitions. Messi scored his 20th and 21st league goals of the season as Barcelona took their unbeaten run to 36 games. Munir El Haddadi had opened the scoring early and Suarez got on the scoresheet in the closing stages. Barcelona took just eight minutes to take the lead as Messi s fine, aerial pass freed Suarez and his cross was tapped home by El Haddadi, who was deputising for the suspended Neymar. Eibar missed the chance to equalise when an unmarked Gonzalo Escalante volleyed wide from six yards out. The hosts were punished three minutes before half time when Messi produced an excellent, low finish to double Barcelona s lead. They were awarded a penalty 15 minutes from full time when Ivan Ramis was penalised for handling a Messi cross, and the Argentine sent the spot kick down the middle to make it 3 0. Suarez added the fourth when he beat defender Ander Capa and scored with a low shot with six minutes to play. Barcelona also managed their first clean sheet since early February as they closed out victory comfortably. Second placed Atletico Madrid are eight points back after beating Valencia 3 1 in the evening game.
Relying on historical records and accounts from old timers, AL.com may have located the long lost wreck of the Clotilda, the last slave ship to bring human cargo to the United States. What s left of the ship lies partially buried in mud alongside an island in the lower Mobile Tensaw Delta, a few miles north of the city of Mobile. The hull is tipped to the port side, which appears almost completely buried in mud. The entire length of the starboard side, however, is almost fully exposed. The wreck, which is normally underwater, was exposed during extreme low tides brought on by the same weather system that brought the Bomb Cyclone to the Eastern Seaboard. Low tide around Mobile was about two and a half feet below normal thanks to north winds that blew for days. I m quaking with excitement. This would be a story of world historical significance, if this is the Clotilda, said John Sledge, a senior historian with Mobile Historical Commission, and author of The Mobile River, an exhaustive history of the river. It s certainly in the right vicinity... We always knew it should be right around there. This reporter, Ben Raines, used the abnormally low tides to search for the ship after researching possible locations. The remote spot where the ship was found, deep in the swampy Mobile Tensaw Delta, is accessible only by boat. During my first trips after discovering the wreck, I documented it with photographs and aerials shot with a drone. Over the next week, I ferried a shipwright expert in the construction techniques used on old wooden vessels and a team of archaeologists from the University of West Florida to the site. All concluded that the wreck dated to the mid 1800s the Clotilda was built in 1855 , and featured construction techniques typical of Gulf Coast schooners used to haul lumber and other heavy cargo, as the Clotilda was designed to do.
The vessel also bore telltale signs of being burned, as the Clotilda reportedly was. In later years, the slavers bragged of burning the ship at the conclusion of their voyage in July of 1860 in an effort to hide proof of their human trafficking. Evidence of a fire on the wreck included a distinctive patina on wrought iron chain plates used to hold the masts and bowsprit in place, and charred beams and timbers in the ship s interior. These ships were the 18 wheelers of their day. They were designed to haul a huge amount of cargo in relatively shallow water, said Winthrop Turner, a shipwright specializing in wooden vessels. That s why you see the exceptional number of big iron drifts used to hold the planking together. That s also why the sides of the ship are so stout. They are almost two feet thick. The construction techniques here, no threaded bolts, iron drifts, butt jointed planking, these all confirm a ship built between 1850 and 1880. The team of University of West Florida archaeologists, led by Greg Cook and John Bratten, agreed. The men have made a career of exploring shipwrecks, including Spanish galleons sunk in Pensacola Bay in 1559 and slave ships sunk off the coast of Africa. They were contacted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration several years ago about searching for the Clotilda, but nothing ever came of the plan. After examining the aerials, images and historical documents I had assembled, the archaeologists visited the wreck on a chilly morning, temperatures just above freezing. Finding the Clotilda 44 Gallery Finding the Clotilda You can definitely say maybe, and maybe even a little bit stronger, because the location is right, the construction seems to be right, from the proper time period, it appears to be burnt. So I d say very compelling, for sure, said Cook.
There is nothing here to say this isn t the Clotilda, and several things that say it might be, Bratten concurred, adding that several bits of evidence assembled by AL.com make a strong case for further exploration. So far, the investigation is only visual, with no attempts made to dig up the hull or remove artifacts. Alabama laws governing ship wrecks carry stiff penalties, including the confiscation of boats and other equipment, for disturbing shipwrecks or military battlefields without permits. One of the key elements that suggests this may be the Clotilda comes from the location where it was found. The ship lies essentially where its captain, William Foster, said he burned and sank it in 1860. Even so, the archaeologists stressed, a conclusive determination can only be made by documenting any artifacts that remain in the hold, if such a determination can even be made. So far, the scientists have only examined the parts of the ship that can be seen above the mud that encases most of the hull. Turner, the shipwright, estimated that the bottom of the ship may be as deep as ten feet down in the mud, based on certain parts of the ship that are visible above the mud. Digging into the past will require both federal and state permits, and a lot of money. A crime and a mystery The Clotilda is the last ship known to have brought slaves into the country. The hunt for the ship has inspired numerous searchers over the years, but the Clotilda has long escaped discovery, until perhaps now. A small clarification for those familiar with the tale, the ship s name is the Clotilda, not the Clotilde. Newspaper accounts beginning in 1860 misspelled the name, and over the years it stuck. But the ship s license and the captain s journal make clear that Clotilda is correct.
A couple of details in the historical record may have helped keep the ship hidden for so long, mainly by sending would be explorers looking in the wrong place, or leading them to disregard this wreck as a possible candidate. Those items will be discussed in greater detail below. From the start, the fate of the Clotilda was designed to remain a mystery, with the slavers attempting to destroy the ship after delivering 110 captives from the Kingdom of Dahomey, which is modern day Benin, Africa, in 1860. Though slavery was still legal in the U.S. at the time, it had been illegal to import slaves into the country for 52 years, since Thomas Jefferson signed an 1808 law forbidding the practice. With the nation edging closer to civil war over the slavery issue, Alabama steamboat captain and plantation owner Timothy Meaher made an infamous bet that he could sneak slaves into the country, right under the noses of federal troops at the twin forts that guarded the mouth of Mobile Bay. Historian Sylvianne Diouf traced the evolution of the wicked scheme and the resulting journey in her excellent book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama, published in 2007. Attempts to contact Diouf were unsuccessful. The book primarily focuses on the story of the captives, who were freed just five years after they were enslaved, thanks to the end of the Civil War. The group, 110 strong, originally asked their captor, Meaher, to pay for passage back to Africa. After he refused, they appealed to the U.S. government, again to no avail. Ultimately, some members of the group bought a small piece of land north of Mobile from Meaher and created a community called Africatown, where some of the descendants of the original slaves still live. They spoke their native tongue, farmed using traditional African methods, and ran their own school.
Descendants of those brought to this country aboard the Clotilda are believed to be the only group of slave descendants who know precisely where their ancestors came from, when they arrived, and what vessel brought them here. Africatown was added to the national historic register in 2012. The last of those brought from Africa, Cudjo Lewis, died in 1935, but not before experiencing a small bit of celebrity. Diouf s book relies in part on interviews with Cudjo made before his death. Several but not all of the clues needed to find the ship were in the book. In the end, this ship was found where the Clotilda s captain, William Foster, stated that he set it on fire in his journal. Neither Foster or Meaher were ever convicted of the crime of slaving, though Meaher was arrested at one point for his role, and Foster was forced to pay a 1,000 fine for failing to register in port after an international trip. The disruption of the Civil War meant that the case against the men was abandoned. The Journey Thirty years later, Meaher was quoted extensively in a newspaper article in 1890 bragging about how they had smuggled their captives into the country. A state park on the edge of the Mobile Tensaw Delta, about eight miles from where the ship was found, is named for Meaher s family, which donated the land and remains prominent in Mobile. In fact, I left from a boat ramp in Meaher State Park on my trips to find and explore the wreck of the ship the park s namesake may have sent to win his wretched bet. Meaher, the mastermind behind the scheme, was already a rich man, with a plantation and a steamboat that he captained up and down the Alabama River. He set out to bring slaves in for no reason other than to prove that he could do it.
He purchased the Clotilda, a two masted schooner, for 35,000 and hired Captain William Foster to sail to Africa, purchase 100 slaves with about 9,000 in gold, and bring them back to Alabama. The ship s true mission was disguised by stops in Caribbean ports. The supplies needed to feed the captives on the return journey were carefully hidden beneath piles of lumber, to avoid discovery should the Clotilda be boarded by British, Dutch, or Portugese military vessels during the crossing. That lumber would later be used to build pens to house the captives. Foster s journal and insurance documents from the 1800s, maintained in the Mobile Public Library, provide a detailed account of the voyage beginning with a list of how many casks of rice, rum, molasses, beef, water, and other supplies were laid on to feed 110 captives on a return voyage. Written in the flowery language of the Victorian era, Foster s account has him sallying forth to meet with African slave traders. During the four month journey, the Clotilda survived a collision with a Portuguese Man O War ship that had given chase, mutiny by the crew, and a storm that ripped a mast from the ship. The tale ends with the arrival back in Alabama waters, the tricks used to smuggle the prisoners past port officials in Mobile, and finally the burning of the ship after the captives were hidden in a swamp. Even as the men plotted the sinister voyage, they understood that the chances of discovery were high, and the price of being caught violating the federal slaving law could be death. They arranged to bring the ship to shore far from Mobile, at Point Aux Pins, a desolate stretch of shoreline along the Mississippi Sound. Upon successful completion of the voyage, Foster was to send word to Meaher, who would dispatch a steam tug from Mobile to tow the large sailing ship upriver to offload the slaves at Meaher s plantation.
But by the time the ship returned to Alabama, Meaher knew the scheme had been found out and worried federal officials might be lying in wait. The original plan had been for Foster to unload the slaves and then sail to Mexico, where the ship would be cleaned, and then disguised with new rigging, license papers and a new name. Instead, with the crew threatening another mutiny, Foster and Meaher agreed to burn the ship. It was, they decided, the only way to hide the telltale signs of human trafficking visible in the hold. Diouf, relying on historical accounts, imagines the scene this way, He knew and Meaher did too that they might have been spotted, so they had decided to destroy the evidence, the telling signs of a slaving voyage the partitions, the platforms, the empty casks of food and water, the big pots, the tubs, the blood, the vomit, the spit, the mucus, the urine, and the feces that soiled the planks, the awful smell that always floated around slave ships. Location, Location, Location One of the most definitive pieces of evidence that this wreck might be the Clotilda is its location, adjacent to the island where the captives were reportedly transferred to another boat. The details I used to pinpoint the wreck come from three men their lives separated by more than 100 years one of whom I interviewed. Russell Ladd has been travelling the Delta rivers since he was a boy. His family is one of Mobile s oldest, specializing in insurance for shippers. A large stadium in Mobile is named after Ladd s ancestors. Ladd still maintains the family s remote camp on Chuckfee Bay, accessible only by boat. His grandfather, born in 1881, bought the land. The camp is located in the interior of the Delta, less than a mile from where the ship was found.
I called Ladd in October to tell him I was hunting for the Clotilda and asked if he might have an idea where the wreck might be. I think I do, Ladd said, before describing a fairly precise location to me. He described a spot I ve been by many times, in an area where I often fish but have never noticed a wreck. When I asked why he thought it was there, he said, Well, when I was a boy, we used to go up the Mobile River to fish various places. On low tide, we d see this burned out ship and my father and his friends would say, There s the Clotilda. Ladd said the boat house where the family s boat was kept was on Bayou Sara, which flows into the Mobile River alongside 12 Mile Island, so we traversed 12 Mile Island quite a bit. The whole delta was full of old gravel barges, wooden barges, that were in various states of deterioration. They used to just abandon those everywhere. But those were rectangular. I don t know of any other ships like this one, where it comes to a point. I always questioned Daddy about it. Ladd s father, born in 1907, and his grandfather, born in 1881, both fished and duck hunted in the Delta. While Ladd offered the location where the ship was found in our initial interview, he later said he was never sure if his father really knew or was just telling an inquisitive kid what he wanted to hear. At the dawn of the 20th century, the location of the wreck appeared to be an open secret locally, although records I ve reviewed from others who hunted the ship reveal there were more than a half dozen wrecks people insisted were the Clotilda. Photos of some of those wrecks from the early 1900s make clear they could not be the Clotilda for various reasons.
And none of the wrecks in those records were located where this ship was found. Similarly, none of the other wrecks are located where the captain said he burned the ship, as this wreck is. In her book, Diouf writes A man was posted near the burning vessel to make sure pieces of the wreckage did not float down the river, a definite sign that something shady had been going on. But it was a futile exercise because her hull remained visible at low tide for three quarters of a century. The survival of a significant portion of the hull is not unusual, as ships will only burn down to the waterline. Over time, the portion of the ship that had been visible on a normal low tide, particularly the ribs, surely rotted away, due to exposure to the elements. However, sections that remain continually underwater, or better still, buried beneath a layer of mud, could be expected to survive centuries, especially with the old growth longleaf pine used to construct the Clotilda and other ships built in Mobile in the 1800s. Ladd said it had been many years since he had been able to see the wreck. But Diouf s 75 year span where the burned husk was regularly visible dovetails nicely with Ladd s recollection of seeing the ship when he was a boy. The second part of the location evidence comes from the accounts of Capt. Foster and Timothy Meaher. In his journal, hand written in a tight and slanted cursive, Foster describes towing the Clotilda into the Delta under cover of night by way of the Spanish River, so as to avoid detection in the port of Mobile. The Delta is a vast wetland, about 13 miles wide, and divided by dozens of rivers, creeks, bayous and islands.
Using Spanish River meant the Clotilda traveled up the east side of two islands, Pinto and Blakeley, and allowed Foster to bypass the downtown waterfront, which was already heavily populated in the 1850s. I towed the Clotilda into Mobile Bay and up to 12 Mile Island and transferred the captives to a river steamboat the Czar and then I burned her and sunk her in 20 feet of water, reads Foster s testimony, suggesting he burned the ship next to 12 Mile Island, which is precisely where I found it. For his part, Meaher, in a newspaper interview 30 years later, added the detail that the ship was towed into Bayou Connor and burned. For several reasons, I don t think this was true, though I think Meaher might have believed it was. It s also possible this was another effort by Meaher to hide the location of the ship. The reference confused me at first because I didn t recognize the bayou s name. I earn part of my living as a nature guide, taking sightseers and fishermen into the Mobile Tensaw Delta aboard my boat. I know the rivers and bayous well, but had never encountered a Bayou Connor. It was only when I began searching through old maps that it made sense. There, on a map made in 1889, is Bayou Connor, branching off from Bayou Canot, just across from the tip of 12 Mile Island. Today, the whole area is known as Bayou Canot. The confluence of Bayou Canot and the Mobile River occurs directly above the northern tip of 12 Mile Island. The geography of the rivers coming together makes a big X on the map, with the apparent continuation of Bayou Canot wrapping around the east side of 12 Mile Island while the main channel of the Mobile River wraps around the west side.
It is possible that Meaher meant this lower section around 12 Mile Island, though technically, both sides of 12 Mile Island are considered to be the Mobile River, and Bayou Canot then called Bayou Connor meets its end at the confluence with the river just above the island, all things a steamboat captain such as Meaher would have known. I think a more likely scenario is that Meaher told Foster to move the ship off the main river into Bayou Canot and burn it, but then left aboard his brother s steamboat with all of the Clotilda s crew before the fire was lit. I suspect Foster, left behind with all the evidence of their crime, might have decided to burn the ship right then and there, in what was already a pretty secluded spot, rather than spend another hour taking the ship deeper into the swamp. The three primary documents for investigating this affair are Foster s 13 page description of the entire journey, the newspaper article about Meaher written 30 years later, and a handwritten document that may be the reporter s notes for the Meaher article. Those sources differ on the critical detail of where the ship was burned, though they agree that it was Foster who did the burning. We also know Meaher most likely wasn t around when the ship was burned thanks to his braggadocio in the 1890 newspaper article. There, he spins the story of how he crafted an alibi for his whereabouts during the days long affair of retrieving the Clotilda and transferring the slaves to his brother s steamboat. The breathless newspaper article begins by crediting Meaher s desperate but successful undertaking with creating the only full blood African colony in America, referring to Africatown, which had been established decades prior. The tale comes from the venerable captain, from whose lips was learned the story of the importation of the last cargo of slaves in the South.
It describes Meaher s alibi plot this way His brother, the late Capt. Burns Meaher, who at that time commanded the steamboat the Czar, was instructed to fire up and proceed to the mouth of the Spanish River, which debouches into Mobile Bay about four or five miles east of this city, and there await the Clotilda s arrival. Capt. Meaher also issued orders that supper must not be served on the packet Roger B. Taney on her trip to Montgomery the following Tuesday night, until he boarded the boat at some point up the Alabama River. Meaher was the captain of the Roger B. Taney. He ordered the ship to leave Mobile without him for its weekly run upriver, planning to sneak aboard after the slave transfer had taken place, which he did. Getting back to the Taney quickly was key to making his alibi work. The newspaper article continues Under cover of night, Capt. Meaher and the Clotilda s crew were transferred to the Taney. The crew of the slaver were stowed away in an upper portion of the boat, locked in, and supplied with cards and whisky. It was 9 30 before supper was announced on the Taney that night, and when the captain took his seat at the head of the table his face wore a most nonchalant appearance, and gave forth not the slightest intimation that he had been engaged in other than the legitimate performance of his duties. Based apparently on the newspaper article and the handwritten notes mentioned above, a Mobile area man named Jack Friend spent thousands of dollars searching for the Clotilda in Bayou Canot in the late 1990s. Though Friend is now dead, I spent a day reviewing his extensive collection of papers related to the Clotilda and other shipwrecks in the History Museum of Mobile with historian John Sledge.
Employing a salvage company, side scan sonar, magnetometers, and divers, the team searched the length of Bayou Canot and came up empty. They did not, however, search the area where I found this wreck, though it was just a mile downstream from the area they did search. This same area was left off of an extensive study of Mobile Bay ship wrecks conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1983. That study included the lower Delta, but stopped about four miles south of the area where the wreck I found lies. Combining it all together, we have Ladd s reminiscence, which led me to the wreck of a large burned ship from the mid 1800s. That wreck, in turn, is located next to the island where Foster recounts unloading the slaves and scuttling the ship, and across the river from the bayou where Meaher says the ship was torched. Even if the ship was actually burned in Bayou Canot, it wouldn t surprise me that her rope had parted during the fire and she drifted out into the main channel and washed up where you found it, said Sledge, the Mobile historian. It is not very far, and it is downstream. Ship length While there are no pictures of the Clotilda, we do have measurements for its length and width. The ship was listed as 86 feet long, with a beam or width of 23 feet. With the keel line visible in the mud around the wreck, we were able to get a good measurement of the beam of the ship. It fit perfectly, at 23 feet and identical to the beam of the Clotilda. But the length was dramatically different. In fact, in my initial visit, I measured the wreck at 124 feet, including a section of the stern visible in the water.
I suspect this measurement may have encouraged other people hunting for the Clotilda to disregard this wreck as a possible suspect if they encountered it. Initially, it dissuaded me, as it appeared far too long to be the Clotilda. But as I sat on the bow of the ship staring toward the stern, I couldn t imagine how a vessel any smaller could have carried 110 captives and a crew of 14, plus supplies, on a four month journey across the Atlantic Ocean. A schooner style vessel that was 40 feet shorter than the wreck I was looking at simply would have been too small. So, I began researching how ships were measured in the 1800s. As it turns out, there were three critical measurements for sailing ships. There is the overall length, which is the first thing most people think of today when talking about the size of a boat. But the overall length is actually irrelevant when calculating how much cargo a given ship could hold, as only the portion of the ship sitting in the water supports the weight of the cargo. For old sailing ships, there were often two other measurements given The length along the waterline, and something called the Length Between Perpendiculars. These latter two measurements are designed to account for the fact that old sailing ships often had raked bows and sterns, meaning the ends of the vessel were slanted, with a portion of the front and back of the ship hanging over the water. These numbers were the most important to shippers in the 1800s, not the overall length. The Length Between Perpendiculars, was a measurement from the front edge of the rudder forward to the base of the ship s stem in the bow. This measurement, as opposed to the overall length, gave people in the shipping industry a good estimate of how much cargo a given vessel could carry.
Armed with that knowledge, I began looking up the Length Between Perpendiculars for various two masted schooners from the mid 1800s. I found numerous examples of vessels with a Length Between Perpendiculars or sometimes a waterline measurement of 80 to 90 feet, and an overall length of 120 to 140 feet. Perhaps the most famous example would be the reconstruction of the slave ship Amistad, subject of a movie about slaves taking over a ship starring Morgan Freeman. The Amistad was 23 feet wide, exactly the beam of the Clotilda. The Amistad s overall length was 129 feet, while it s waterline measurement was 78 feet. These numbers match quite closely with the Clotilda, if we assume the 86 foot length was actually a waterline or Length Between Perpendiculars measurement. I found records for about a dozen schooners with measurements closely matching the Amistad and the Clotilda. Next steps With the evidence in the stem, we can get an idea of preservation. With those chain plates, we can get some indication of mast placement. It appears to be a schooner, said Cook, the archaeologist. If it turns out to be the last slaver, it is going to be a very powerful site for many reasons. The structure of the vessel itself is not as important as its history, and the impact it is going to have on many, many people. Cook said the first step is to gather input from the Alabama Historical Commission, state officials, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Then, he said, preliminary excavations and other tests by archaeological teams would be appropriate. Ultimately, the goal would be to identify the wreck, and then perhaps put the contents on display. My friend, outdoors writer Jeff Dute, first suggested we look for the ship, knowing many others had tried. He visited the wreck with me the day Turner, the shipwright, explored it.
Dute said that once he had seen the ship, his overall feeling was a profound sadness. Just imagine what this trip meant for those people. Ripped from their homes, their country, then months in the hold of this ship, right here, Dute said. That last voyage of the Clotilda is a horrible thing to contemplate. I just keep imagining, crossing the ocean, then getting dumped out here in this swamp while the ship that brought you here went up in a giant conflagration. How terrified they must have been. For my part, I think finding the Clotilda would be a fitting capstone for both Mobile s slaving history and the war that finally ended the practice. Mobile was a big port, even in the 1800s, with a big slave trade. A historical marker on a downtown street marks the site of the old slave market. And just a few miles away, on the east side of the Mobile Tensaw Delta, lies the site of the Battle of Blakeley, the last battle of the Civil War, fought five years after the Clotilda was burned. It is easy, standing in the wintertime gloom of these Alabama swamps, to imagine that old ghosts haunt these bayous. Maybe this could help put some of them to rest. I can t help but think this would be a stunning find. Mauvila and the Clotilda are the crown jewels of Alabama archaeology. In maritime history, this is major. This is an internationally significant discovery, if it is the Clotilda, said Sledge, the Mobile historian. My main concerns are protecting the wreck from people picking over it. The fact that it is already exposed like that clearly shows it is getting a lot of wear and tear. And, of course, proving that it is actually the right ship. If it is, it will be a beautiful thing to behold. This whole thing is pretty, pretty amazing.

Washington CNN The Supreme Court offered its tentative endorsement of so called organizing agreements between unions and for profit companies, with some justices saying on Wednesday the longstanding practice can encourage good labor relations. At issue is whether the particulars of such an agreement between Unite Here Local 355 and the Mardi Gras casino in Florida violates a federal law that prohibits companies from giving labor unions seeking to represent workers anything of value. Worker rights experts and business groups have called this one of the most significant labor relations cases in decades, and a high court ruling could have major implications for the future of the union movement in the United States. The gaming union entered into a neutrality agreement with the company, agreeing to work together to pass a ballot initiative legalizing slot machines in Dade and Broward Counties, a deal that ostensibly would benefit both sides. Unite Here independently spent more than 100,000 in an ad campaign supporting the measure. It also agreed not to strike or boycott. The casino in return allowed union members onto the premises, gave them employee contact information, and agreed to remain neutral in the organizing campaign. The high court debated in oral arguments whether this particular agreement violated the letter and spirit of the broader law, designed to prevent bribery, corruption and extortion in negotiations and organizing. A lower federal appeals court said if the 100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that s corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Tell me how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the 100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the employer. But Justice Elena Kagan said, I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer employee agreements, she said. The idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them, regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that.
The lawsuit was brought by Martin Mulhall, an employee of Hollywood Greyhound Track Inc., who opposed the union s efforts to get him to join. Backed by the National Right to Work Foundation, his lawyers said backroom deals between company and union management undercut his right of association and free choice. Section 302 of the Taft Hartley Act of 1947 makes it a crime for an employer to pay, lend or deliver ... any money or other thing of value to a union that wants to represent its workforce. That s the danger that 302 exists to take care of, not that it s necessarily wrongful per se for a union to have lists of employee information or the use of property, but what will it do in return attorney William Messenger told the high court in an intense hour of oral augments. And unions have compromised employee interests in exchange for this type of assistance. They certainly have extorted employers. Several justices suggested the casino and the union were engaged in a quid pro quo, but were not sure that amounted to an exchange of something of value. I mean, the union wouldn t promise that for nothing, said Justice Antonin Scalia. It would get something in exchange such as, in this case, the right to go on the employer s property to recruit union members or some other thing of value from the employer, right But Richard McCracken, Unite Here s lawyer, said this neutrality agreement and the 1000,000 ad campaign were like so many others, including the pending deal to build a massive oil pipeline through the middle section of the United States. The union, like so many construction unions that we know, is advocating in Congress for the passage of laws like the Keystone Pipeline Law. Why did they do that They do it because they want the jobs, he said. That is a combination of interests funneled through the First Amendment s protection for mutual effort.
Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree, telling Messenger that his client s views run contrary to years of settled practices and understandings. Unite Here represents about 265,000 active members in the United States and Canada, mainly in the hospitality, food service and manufacturing industries. The case is Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall 12 99 . A ruling is expected by the spring.

By . Harriet Arkell . Passport American born Randall Cole, 44, says he had to answer clearly homophobic questions when he attended a routine interview to get a British passport . A passport official has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation after a gay man complained he was interrogated about his personal life in front of his four year old son during a routine passport interview. Randall Cole, 44, says he was grilled for half an hour by a Home Office employee in Chelmsford, Essex, about whether he had ever had sex with a woman, why his son s biological mother had given him up, and what passers by thought when they walked past him and his husband with their two adopted sons. The American born charity worker, who is married to a Brit and became a British citizen in May, said that when he objected to her questioning in front of his small child, the woman said We can ask anything we want . Mr Cole has filed a formal complaint to the Home Office, and the employee is currently suspended while an investigation is held into the matter. He said he was shaking after the interview, which was conducted in the middle of an open plan office and left him feeling violated. The father of two adopted sons said that the atmosphere in the clearly homophobic interview changed when he explained that he had two adopted children with his husband, Stuart Wales, 42, and the passport official realised he was gay. Despite him being accompanied by his son Samuel, four, Mr Cole said he was asked whether the children were biologically theirs, what Samuel and his brother Benjamin, eight, thought of their birth mother, and whether they were confused by their family set up. Mr Cole said that he explained that even if the boys birth mother were there too, if one of them fell over, he would run to him rather than her, but says the Home Office employee merely sighed and shook her head.
He told the Guardian Then she said What do you think people make of you when they see you walking down the street with your kids And he said she went on to quiz him about whether the boys called their biological mother Mum , forcing him to explain to his small boy about him coming out of his mother s tummy but him and his husband being their parents. Mr Cole said the line of questioning in front of his son left him upset that he had failed to keep him safe . He said that when he said he worked part time, the woman dismissed him as playing the housewife role in the couple, and then her questioning became even more personal. She said You must have had relationships with women in the past, though He said at this point he objected, but she was having none of it. She became indignant and said We can ask anything we want, regardless of whether or not it makes you feel uncomfortable, he said. Chelmsford Mr Cole has submitted a written complaint to the Home Office after his interview in the Essex town . Mr Cole, who married human resources manager Mr Wales in California but moved to Britain because of its reputation for tolerance, said the woman was clearly trying to humiliate him and put him in his place. He said she told him that he could refuse to answer questions but that his refusal would be noted in his application, and that she continued to press for answers on the point of whether he or his husband had ever been sexually active with women. The Home Office website says that during the interview for a first British adult passport You ll be asked to confirm facts about yourself that someone trying to steal your identity may not know . Passport interviews are routinely recorded. This morning a Home Office spokesman said People applying for their first British passport are required to attend an interview designed to detect and deter those trying to obtain passports fraudulently.
Passport Office The female employee has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation file image Intrusive questions about someone s sexuality as part of an interview would be inappropriate and is not a reflection of our policy. HM Passport Office expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from our staff and takes allegations of misconduct extremely seriously. The member of staff in question has been suspended and a disciplinary investigation is now underway. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told MailOnline It s truly shocking in this day and age that a Home Office official can behave in this intrusive and bigoted way. I m delighted that the official has been suspended. No one applying for a passport should be subjected to such humiliation for any reason. It shows that the Home Office needs to do more to train its staff to be sensitive and non homophobic.
CNN The government shutdown is in its second week, and the public debate in the United States is centered around how the crisis will be resolved and who is to blame. What do the polls say What are the implications for the Republican Party, for House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama Not many are talking about the international implications. But they could be significant. Many in the international community have argued the U.S. government is dysfunctional or even broken. Friends are questioning whether America can be relied on or whether partisan politics will prevent it from acting when called upon. And with this comes some fear. America s adversaries may come to believe that they can act without consequence that America will, in the end, trip over itself. These perceptions are extremely dangerous, both for the United States and the rest of the world. They will limit American deterrence and weaken America s partnerships as friends and allies start to wonder whether the United States has their back. America has long been critiqued internationally both for doing too much and too little. In a study Chatham House is conducting on elite perceptions of the United States, many in Europe cast aspersions on the United States for its actions in Iraq and Afghanistan wars into which the U.S. pulled others or its use of drones. They also condemn America s perceived lack of leadership in Syria. They want Washington to act but cannot agree how. It is a no win situation for America. One thing they are clear on Europeans and others, particularly in Asia want a strong United States. One that provides moral leadership and enforces global norms. One that can be called upon to act, particularly in tough situations. Instead, events in recent weeks have only reinforced the international perception that America is in decline. The declinist debate has been raging for years, driven in large part by America s diminishing percentage of global gross domestic product as against China s rise in particular .
However, with the recent economic recovery, such views were wavering, and the strength of U.S. innovation, entrepreneurship and technology, coming on top of the energy revolution, were persuading some that the United States was once again on the rise. In recent weeks however, these arguments have been overcome by the pictures of gridlock and weakness in Washington. First it was the story that Obama was saved by Russian President Vladimir Putin from an embarrassing loss in a congressional vote to attack Syria over its suspected use of chemical weapons. Then came the shutdown. And, for those in the private sector in particular, a developing fear that, come October 17, when the United States needs to raise its debt ceiling, it will instead drive itself and the world s economy off a cliff. The idea of America as a secure, stable, predictable state, where investment cannot fail to be reimbursed, would suffer a significant blow. Holders of Treasury bonds would no longer be assured of their returns. Chinese efforts to weaken the position of the dollar as the only reserve currency would get a boost. Investors would no longer have the gold standard U.S. guarantee. But while perceptions are extremely important, they are not reality. As Sunday s anti terrorist operations in Somalia and Libya show, America will act when it wants to. While the U.S. Treasury bond may seem less secure, it is still far stronger and better guaranteed than that of any other large economy. A nation moves when its interests, capabilities and will are engaged. America s interests have not changed. Its capabilities are still vastly superior to those of most other nations. The only question is America s will. Many internationally will continue to question U.S. power and influence. Its adversaries will surely continue to test these. America s allies and friends will be made nervous over its perceived decline.
But while the Washington gridlock and partisan politics make action tougher and more costly make it harder for America to rally friends and share burdens, and to deter and dissuade opponents it would nevertheless be dangerous to underestimate the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Xenia Dormandy.
This past week in Johannesburg there was a funeral I wished I had been able to attend. Ahmed Kathrada, well known African National Congress ANC activist and South African statesman, was laid to rest. The well deserved tributes to the man, affectionately known as Kathy, who died at the age of 87 have been delivered. It was not the politics surrounding the funeral, with President Jacob Zuma being asked to stay away, that was the main attraction for me, even though I must confess I would not have minded being there to hear some of the speeches. I would simply have liked to be there to be part of an event that would mark the closure for a journey that started for me on 15 October 1989 in the Soweto township. I was on my first reporting trip to South Africa for the BBC and, after having been denied a visa for more than two years, I was finally granted one after the intervention of the redoubtable anti apartheid activist Helen Suzman. As things turned out, it was the perfect time to have arrived in the country. Elizabeth Ohene I remember Ahmed Kathrada telling me he was trying to get used to being seen as an old man when throughout his political activist days and in prison, he was always the young man . A week after I got there, it happened. The long expected opening of the prisons to let out the leaders of the liberation movements started without any warning. That was the day, no, the night that Ahmed Kathrada and some of his colleagues were released from jail after 26 years. I was in Walter Sisulu s home in Soweto when he was brought home in the middle of the night.
Andrew Mlangeni, Elias Motsoaledi and Raymond Mhlaba jailed after the infamous Rivonia trials were also released along with Wilton Mkwayi, one of the leaders of the ANC s armed wing, Oscar Mpetha, the veteran ANC and South African Communist Party leader in the Cape, and Japhta Masemola, a Pan Africanist Congress leader. Their release was greeted with scenes of wild celebration around the country. Over the next fortnight, I met and interviewed almost all of them in their homes and thus started my intense relationship with South African politics. I had no choice, of course, but to follow the journeys of those men from then on. I remember I had this eerie feeling that they, having survived so many years of prison under difficult conditions, might not last very long in the outside world in South Africa. In my interview with Raymond Mhlaba, he talked about the difficulties of adjusting to the changed country he and his fellow inmates had been released into. He made a joke about how ironic it would be if he should survive Robben Island all those years only to be killed trying to cross the road in Port Elizabeth. Twenty six years earlier, at the time he went into jail, there were very few cars on the roads he told me. Jafta Masemola was the first to die in a traffic accident a few months after gaining his freedom. I watched the funeral of Walter Sisulu on television from Accra and I was relieved he had survived to a grand old age. I remember Ahmed Kathrada telling me he was trying to get used to being seen as an old man when throughout his political activist days and in prison, he was always the young man . When the news of his death was announced last week, I had a fleeting idea of going to his funeral but then as he was a Muslim, it was not likely I could make it to South Africa before he would be buried.
Then I thought to myself that even as a Muslim, if he were a Ghanaian, we would have found a way to keep his body in the morgue for a few days at least before burial. That would have provided the opportunity for old quarrels to be settled and fresh ones to erupt. There would have been time for some people to go to court to insist that President Zuma be allowed to attend the funeral. We would have had time to order a special cloth for the funeral and some enterprising folks would have ordered special t shirts from China. But before I could get my head around the possibility that this one of the last of those men who were released on 15 October 1989, the funeral was over. I wonder if South Africa today was the one we all dreamed of in those heady days when the impossible happened and Ahmed Kathrada and his friends came home. I feel privileged to have been part of it.

Prisoners are smoking e cigarettes as part of a move which could lead to a ban on smoking in jails. E cigarettes are now being sold in three prisons across the UK as part of a pilot to test whether the alternative could be used instead of cigarettes, BBC news reported. Last year, the prison service said it was committed to banning cigarettes across jails in England and Wales. Prisoners are smoking e cigarettes as part of a move which could lead to a ban on smoking in jails . An e cigarette brand is available in shops in women s prison Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire, as well as men s prisons Preston Prison in Lancashire and Stocken in Rutland. It was reported that 50 were sold across both male prisons in one week. The move comes after a Guernsey prison banned tobacco last year. The anti cigarette policy was introduced at Les Nicolles prison following success on the Isle of Man. At Les Nicolles, prisoners now use e cigarettes instead of traditional tobacco products. Guernsey Prison governor Dave Matthews said last year that the smoking ban at the jail had gone very well . He said We have removed tobacco but also provided prisoners with some assistance to try and give up their nicotine habit through the form of patches and the use of Quitline. Prisons across Britain currently allow inmates to smoke in their cells but not in communal parts of the jail or in exercise yards file photo Prisons across Britain currently allow inmates to smoke in their cells but not in communal parts of the jail or in exercise yards. Of the total prison population, a staggering 80 per cent of inmates smoke. The Prison Officers Association has been campaigning for a ban on smoking in all UK prisons since 2007. The POA said they were concerned that staff would be forced to suffer the harmful effects of second hand smoke . E cigarettes have soared in popularity in the UK but any long term impact on health remains unknown.
Critics of the devices fear using them in public could re normalise smoking. An independent review recently found that almost one in 10 smokers had been able to quit thanks to cigarette replacements. A Prison Service spokesman told the BBC We are looking into whether disposable e cigarettes are suitable for use in prisons and are currently conducting a trial in three prisons. A spokesman for the Prison Governors Association said anything that could protect not only staff but other prisoners and visitors from second hand smoke inhalation is obviously welcomed. We will be watching this trial with interest to see just how successful it is.
A schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his extreme haircut grows out, which could take months. Liam Pegg, 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his mowhawk style did not fit with uniform policies despite having the cut for a year. The Year 8 pupil now has to stay in isolation and will not be allowed to go out and socialise with other students, even at break times, until his hair grows out which could be months. But Liam s father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception. Liam Pegg pictured 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his mowhawk style did not fit with uniform policies . Tim, a 30 year old carpenter, said His haircut is a mix of a mullet and a mohawk. He spikes up the top, but leaves the back flat for school. He has had this haircut for well over a year and no one has had a problem with it before, so I don t understand why it has been raised as an issue now. It s hardly an extreme hairstyle. I would understand if he had dyed it bright pink and had it spiked up all over the place, but it isn t. Liam arrived at Nailsea School, in North Somerset, on Monday to be told he was no longer allowed to attend lessons with his friends and must report to isolation. Staff at Nailsea School pictured ruled he would have to stay in isolation until it grows back which could take months . The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before . The punishment involves students being taught in a room on their own, where they are set work and supervised by a member of staff. They are not allowed to go out and socialise with other students even at break time.
The case is similar to that of Anthony Mousiou who was told he must study in isolation by Samuel Ryder Academy after his short back and sides was just 4.5 millimetres too short and breached their uniform policy. Liam s parents, Tim and Claire, were informed their son had been placed in the special measure indefinitely when he arrived home from school. They say Liam has had the same hairstyle since he started at the school in September 2013. Mr Pegg added We only found out that he had been placed in isolation when Liam came home and told us. We had no contact from the school. Liam s father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception . He has been in isolation all day, every day, since Monday. He is not in the classes he should be, socialising with other students nor taking any exercise. Surely this is against his human rights. When we went up to the school to discuss it we were told he would have to stay in isolation until his hair grows back. The headteacher said that in his opinion Liam s hair cut was inappropriate and extreme. There is no legislation relating to pupils uniform or appearance, which is left up to school s governing bodies to decide. But schools often impose bans on extreme haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy. The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don t comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school s published behaviour policy. A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion.
If he has to wait until his hair grows back, he could be in isolation for months. This is outrageous and is effecting his education. The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before. A number of years ago it hit the headlines after it banned female students from wearing skirts after problems with ones that were too short. Head teacher Chris Wade said The governors and staff at Nailsea School are united in setting high standards as we firmly believe our role is not just to enable students to pass exams, but to prepare them for life as an adult in their future work. It is also important to instill in students an awareness of rules so that they can be functioning members of society. I do not apologise for having these high expectations and for reserving the right to take action when our standards are not met. On this occasion it appears the parents disagree with the school about what is seen as acceptable but I remain open to discussing this in person with them. Ultimately if parents are not convinced that the rules we adhere to are of benefit to them or their children they may choose to attend another school. When students join Nailsea School, parents sign a home school agreement in which they promise to ensure the children follow the rules. The school s uniform policy says If students arrive inappropriately dressed for school, they will in the first instance, be spoken to by their teachers and, if necessary, by their head of house. We reserve the right to send home any student whose clothing, hairstyle or personal appearance is inappropriate for school.
When the Nugents realized their home was contaminated, they said they filed an insurance claim with Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance. Their claim was denied, they said, because of an exclusion for environmental pollution. The company declined to comment on the Nugents policy or claim, citing client privacy. The Nugents have now filed suit against Joshua Argue, his ex wife Jelisa Argue, his real estate agent Lori Argue, who is also his mother, and her company, Carpenter Realtors. The Nugents are claiming breach of contract and fraud. On the sellers disclosure statement, the no box is checked next to the question Have there been or are there any hazardous conditions on the property They knew that at the time we were bringing in an 8 month old and two little girls, and sat there and just lied, Chris Nugent said. America Tonight was unable to reach any of the Argues, but Carpenter Realtors President David Caveness gave this statement The agent was aware her son had a substance abuse problem. Our agent has assured us she had absolutely no prior knowledge of her son s alleged manufacture of meth within the subject property. As she has stated to us, if she had known meth was being manufactured in the property, she would never have allowed her grandchildren to live in that home. State Police arrested Joshua Argue in February for an alleged role in a stolen car parts ring. Held of Crisis Cleaning and Crawford of the Indiana State Police both recommend testing for meth before buying a home. Held said once the decontamination is complete at the Nugents house and the walls primed with a special sealer and painted, the family will have nothing to worry about. The Nugents say they re not sure if they ll ever have peace of mind in the home. Most of all, the Nugents say they re hoping to avoid bankruptcy so they can put the ordeal behind them. I want my life back, Jenny Nugent said.
I want my kids life back. Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. When Chris and Jenny Nugent bought their dream home in Indiana, they made sure to get the house inspected for mold and damaged pipes. But they never imagined they would also need to have the house tested for meth contamination. The Nugents said they used their life savings to take out a mortgage on the 144,000 cheery looking home nestled on an acre of land in the quiet suburbs, enough room for them, their two young daughters and infant son. But after they moved in, they said everyone in the house started feeling ill. They were sick every week, Jenny Nugent said. They would wake up. Throw up. Have digestive issues and then by noon, 1 o clock start to feel better. ABC News The Nugents said their daughters were missing school, the baby wasn t sleeping through the night, and even the family dog became ill and had to be put down. Jenny Nugent also said she noticed strange metallic smells around the house, especially in the kitchen. It smelled like a handful of change, she said. Jenny Nugent said a neighbor finally cracked the mystery, telling her she suspected the previous owner had cooked meth in the house. Nugent immediately got her home tested a simple procedure that costs 50. I am so grateful that we were fortunate enough to have really good neighbors, she said. If it were not for them, we may have not known until one of our kids ended up in the hospital. After two tests, the results were horrifying. The Nugents said the downstairs floor had methamphetamine levels nearly 18 times higher than what s considered legally safe, including the room where baby Mason had been sleeping for 10 months.
The family immediately moved out and eventually ending up in an apartment, but they said they felt forced to throw away most of their belongings for fear of contamination. Those test results came back, I remember that night we just pulled up in the driveway and were like, we re never going back in there other than to get our clothes, and we haven t, Chris Nugent said. For Jenny, returning to the house is painful. She says she feels like she can t even go inside without wearing protective gear. It feels like a death happened, to be honest, she said. That s how it feels to my husband and I. When methamphetamine is smoked or cooked inside a home, invisible molecules of the drug sink into the carpet, walls and everywhere else, experts said. The meth residue is then inhaled or ingested, even absorbed through the skin. Exposure can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute of Health. To be able to re sell the house and recoup their savings, the Nugents had to hire a professional cleaning team, Crisis Cleaning, who handle meth decontamination, something most home insurance doesn t cover. That s something that s happening even more than what I ve ever seen before since I started doing this the last five years, said Crisis Cleaning s Donetta Held. To decontaminate the Nugents house, the Crisis Cleaners cut out all the carpets, gave the house a professional vacuuming and then gassed it with a mix of potent chemicals that the cleaners say neutralize the meth particles. One pass through is often not enough, sometimes they must de contaminate a room several times. All in, the cost to clean the Nugents home is expected to be about 10,000. Crisis Cleaning says they offered to clean the Nugents home pro bono. While this is a frightening scenario, the Nugents are not alone.
Indiana was ranked number one in the nation in meth lab seizures last year, beating out Tennessee and Missouri, according to statistics that the Missouri State Highway Patrol complied from the U.S. Department of Justice s National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure Report. Indiana State Police s Meth Suppression Section said they conduct as many as four meth busts a day across the state. It s an ongoing battle, said Trooper Nate Raney. Everything that we do is to try to stay one step ahead of them. To combat the meth house problem, the Indiana state police created an online registry that lists thousands of homes where meth or meth labs have been found, although they estimate that for every meth house they locate, two more are undiscovered. We really don t know how many meth labs are out there, said Meth Suppression Section Commander Niki Crawford. The problem is, when you find one that s been thrown in a ditch somewhere, that meth lab was somewhere. Was it in a car Was it in a hotel room Was it in an apartment Was it in a house We don t know. The best way to prevent a nightmare like the Nugent family s is to have a simple home meth test done on the house before you sign. Just do the meth test, Jenny Nugent said. It s 50. It will give you peace of mind. ... That s the best recommendation I could make to anybody. The Nugents are now suing the real estate agent, the real estate company, Carpenter Realtors, and the former owners of the house for breach of contract, claiming the agent who sold them the house, Lori Argue, knew meth was being used on the premises because the former owner is her son, Joshua Argue.
When contacted by ABC News, the attorney for Lori Argue and her company said, There is simply no evidence that Lori Argue or any representative of Carpenter had any knowledge of methamphetamine use or contamination on the real estate, adding that the buyers had an independent home inspection prior to purchasing the home. Read the full statement from Lori Argue s attorney HERE Joshua Argue declined ABC News request for comment, but his ex wife Jelisa Argue told ABC News in a statement, There was no meth being used or cooked in the house when I lived there I ve never used meth and I would never put my son or anyone else in that environment. She added that after she and her son moved out, her ex husband remained in the house for almost two years. Read her full statement HERE. It causes a lot of anger. There are some days that are harder than others, Jenny Nugent said. I think what helps us get through a lot of the anger is the fact that we ve had a lot of support from our friends and family.
By . Simon Tomlinson . An Iranian actress has infuriated ultra conservatives in her home country after kissing the president of the Cannes film festival s on the cheek. Leila Hatami s peck has been seen by fanatics as an affront to the chastity of the Islamic republic s women. A photograph carried by Iranian media shows Hatami pecking 83 year old Gilles Jacob at the opening of this year s festival. Now Hizbullah Students, a group of university students with links to Iran s Revolutionary Guard have filed a complaint with Iran s judiciary for Hatami s prosecution. Scroll down for video . Iranian actress Leila Hatami pecks Gilles Jacob, the president of the Cannes Film festival, on the cheek in a move that has sparked outrage among ultra conservatives in her home country . We, the undersigned, who are a group of student Muslim brothers and sisters, ask the cultural and media branch of the judiciary to prosecute Leyla Hatami for her sinful act of kissing a strange man in public, which according to article 638 of Islamic Criminal Justice carries a prison sentence, the petition read. Furthermore, the action of this film star has hurt the religious sentiments of the proud and martyrs breeding nation of Iran and as such we also demand the punishment of flogging for her as stipulated in the law. Held in high regard Hatami second left is on the jury at this year s Cannes festival in southern France, along with l r Carole Bouquet, Jeon Do yeon, Cannes Film festival general delegate Thierry Fremaux, Jury President Jane Campion and jury member director Sofia Coppola . Deputy Culture Minister Hossein Noushabadi weighed in, quoted by the website of state broadcaster IRIB, he said Those . who attend intentional events should take heed of the credibility and . chastity of Iranians, so that a bad image of Iranian women will not be .
demonstrated to the world, . Iranian woman is the symbol of chastity and innocence, he said. He said Hatami s inappropriate presence at the festival was not in line with our religious beliefs . Born into a family with a background in cinema, Hatami gained worldwide fame for her role in Asghar Farhadi s A Separation, which won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. She is on the jury this year at the annual Cannes festival in southern France but lives in Iran. Hatami is one of five women members on the Palme d Or prize jury, which includes actress Carole Bouquet and directors Sofia Coppola and jury president Jane Campion. According to Iran s interpretation of Islamic sharia law, in place since the 1979 revolution, a woman is not allowed to have physical contact with a man outside her family.
Dafniya, Libya CNN Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi shelled each other for hours on Saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of Dafniya, an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of Misrata. At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week, according to a CNN team. Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO s bombing campaign. As soon as Gadhafi s speech ended, they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself, and it continues on the front this morning, said CNN s Ben Wedeman, who was in Misrata Saturday. Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya. He said the Libyan military could be like locusts, like bees in Europe, potentially targeting homes and offices. You are mistaken, you are involved in a battle that you don t know what you are going to face, so withdraw and run away, Gadhafi told a pro government gathering in Tripoli. Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean, and able to move the battle to Europe. Gadhafi referred to NATO, which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary with the exception of a ground invasion to protect civilians. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi s call for vengeance. NATO s aggression is killing our children and Europe will have to face the consequences, he said.
You will have people attacking Europe, joining terrorist organizations against Europe, and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe. Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters have no popular support. The rebels have no future, he added. They know it and they are terrified. On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track, with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger. We need to see this through, and we are in complete agreement that we will, she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader s remarks. Certainly this is an individual who s obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats, he told reporters. It s what makes him so dangerous. But he s also someone who s given to overblown rhetoric. He said the United States would continue to support NATO s mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside. The events came one day after the African Union s special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis. The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process, but stops short of saying he should step down. It is envisaged to convene, soon, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals, the group said in a statement. Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere.

NEW YORK CNN While President Obama takes plenty of heat over his plans to overhaul domestic policies, critics have also taken aim at his foreign policy approach, particularly as it relates to human rights around the globe. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski says Obama should have met with the Dalai Lama. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski said Wednesday that while the administration appeared to have gotten the balance right on Myanmar, the military junta ruled Asian nation formerly known as Burma, by starting a dialogue while maintaining sanctions, China is a different matter. And that s where we ve seen the tension play out in the most acute way, with several signals that have been sent suggesting that the administration is putting human rights issues to one side, Malinowski said on CNN s Amanpour. And most recently, the, I think, symbolic mistake of the president declining to meet the Dalai Lama before his own visit to China later next month. Watch the discussion . The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled to India in 1959 and established a government in exile there, visited the United States earlier this month. China considers Tibet a renegade province and accuses the Dalai Lama of inciting violence. The timing of a presidential meeting with the Dalai Lama is considered largely symbolic, and Malinowski said the president s delay sent a message to the Chinese government that perhaps this isn t as high a priority for the United States as it has been in the past. Malinowski also criticized the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force Maj. J. Scott Gration, who had suggested wooing the Sudanese government with cookies and gold stars, smiley faces, handshakes, agreements, talk, engagement to change its attitude about Darfur, where genocide and famine have killed hundreds of thousands of people. It s a really dumb thing to say, said Malinowski, who previously served in the administration of President Clinton.
Governments like this, they are not children, and they do not react to cookies and gold stars, he said. They act on their interests, and historically, as you know from Bosnia, to all the places where we have successfully defeated this kind of violence, governments respond to pressure. Sudanese President Omar al Bashir, a candidate for re election next year, has been indicted on war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. Despite Gration s comments, the Obama administration has not yet articulated a Sudan policy. But Louise Arbour, president of the International Crisis Group and a former U.N. human rights commissioner, told Amanpour that talking rather than pressuring governments over human rights can be beneficial. If you have a policy of engagement, which I think very much is the one put forward by the Obama administration, you may give an impression that you re softening, said Arbour, who is also a former war crimes prosecutor. It s very easy to look tough, right You don t talk to anybody, you repudiate everything, you slam all the doors and you accomplish nothing, or very little. And we have a lot of precedence for that. When you have a policy of reinforcing diplomatic initiatives, engagement, it may look soft, because you have to put on the table a multiplicity of issues, not just a single one. But on balance, I think there s more chance on some of these ... all important initiatives than just by looking tough and achieving nothing. Arbour added, however, that the engagement approach to human rights abuses will not create fast change from the abusive regimes. Noting the glacial pace of transformation in Myanmar, where democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been held under house arrest for nearly two decades, Arbour said it s going to be very slow.
You can t have 20 years of extremely adversarial, confrontational posturing, and then say, well, we re ready to talk and be friendly, and assume that the other side s going to roll over, she said. It s just not going to work that way. There have to be very slow processes, but I think Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been encouraging more engagement. She wants to have contact with the junta and with foreigners, and it s happening. These are small steps. They re certainly in the right direction.
You don t get invited out on a US nuclear aircraft carrier all that often, and after writing this I might not get invited back for a while. On the flight deck of the USS George Washington the noise is like nothing I ve ever experienced. A few feet from where I am standing, 11 F A 18 Super Hornets are lining up to be launched. The first one is hooked on to the catapult there is a massive crescendo as its engines roar to full re heat. Then, in a cloud of white steam, the 15 tonne jet is thrown down the deck and off the end of the ship like a toy. Seconds later, the deck crew in their multi coloured smocks are calmly lining up the next one. Watching the US Navy close up like this, it is hard not to be slightly awed. No other navy in the world has quite the same toys, or shows them off with the same easy charm. But as I stand on the deck filming my report on how the US is practising for war with China , I can see my host from the Navy public affairs office wincing. You get used to hearing the PR rhetoric the US Navy is not practising for war with any specific country . But the US Navy has not assembled two whole carrier battle groups and 200 aircraft off the coast of Guam for a jolly, either. This is about practising what the Pentagon now calls Air Sea Battle . It is a concept first put forward in 2009, and it is specifically designed to counter the rising threat from China. A few minutes later I am standing on the bridge of the George Washington with Rear Adm Mark Montgomery, the commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. The forces under his command are practising for what he calls an anti access, area denial scenario. When we talk about our capabilities, he says, we are talking about our capabilities to operate in unrestricted way in the waters of our choice .
As some countries have been developing increasingly complex anti access weapons, we have to develop our tactics, techniques and procedures to continue to operate in an unfettered manner. Rear Adm Montgomery won t discuss the specifics of the exercise. But his ships and aircraft face an increasingly complex web of threats, from beneath the water, from air, land, from cyberspace and from space. It s generally understood that some countries have the ability to remove satellites or to limit satellite communications, he says, so we have to practise working in a communications denied environment. China s People s Liberation Army Navy is still no match for the US Navy, and won t be for a very long time. Instead, China has been developing other weapons designed to keep America s precious carriers far away from China s shores. These include new quieter submarines, long range hypersonic anti ship missiles and, perhaps most worrying, very accurate medium range ballistic missiles that have been dubbed carrier killers . As if on cue, an alarm bell starts ringing. A voice comes on the public address system This is a drill, this is a drill Black smoke, black smoke The George Washington is under simulated attack. Part of the ship is reported to be on fire. Teams rush to contain the damage. For the last 10 years, China s most important, and oft repeated, political slogan has been peaceful rise . It is designed to reassure Beijing s neighbours its growing military might is no threat. But since President Xi Jinping came to power last year, there has been a distinct change. China is now asserting claims well beyond its own coastline. Its ships are aggressively patrolling the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, long controlled by Japan. It is spending billions building new islands in the South China Sea.
Spratly Paracel islands A flashpoint with global consequences Senkaku Diaoyu islands How uninhabited islands soured China Japan ties In August a Chinese fighter jet confronted a US surveillance plane in international airspace over the South China Sea, repeatedly buzzing it and, according to the US Navy, closing to within 20ft 6m . According to Rear Adm Montgomery, all this makes the US Navy s role in the region even more vital. The US Navy is one of the single greatest contributors to the security and stability of the Asia Pacific region, he says. We have been for nearly 70 years . I think the US Navy plays a good role whether it is in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Philippine Sea, stabilising things, assuring partners and dissuading adversaries from taking actions that are non transparent or illegal. China s leaders would no doubt disagree. Beijing s long term aim is to dominate the waters close to its shores. If the US Navy tries to stop it, might that not make conflict more likely But from Tokyo to Taipei, Manila to Hanoi, there are governments that are very happy to see America s great carrier battle groups sailing these waters.
CNN A three goal blitz in nine minutes sent Arsenal second in the English Premier League as they finally ended their hoodoo against champions Chelsea by winning 3 1 at Emirates Stadium on Monday night. Goals from Alex Song, Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott put Arsene Wenger s side two points behind leaders Manchester United, and ended a run of five successive defeats to Chelsea. Branislav Ivanovic pulled a goal back for the visitors, but it wasn t enough to end their miserable run of form as they continue to search for their first win since early November. The Gunners were handed a boost before kickoff as Spain midfielder Fabregas was restored to the starting lineup, as well as Dutch striker Robin Van Persie, but Chelsea s French forward Nicolas Anelka was absent with a knee injury. Football s heroes and villains of 2010 . The first half was a scrappy affair as Chelsea sat back and invited their opponents to attack them, with neither side creating much in the way of goalscoring opportunities. But that all changed five minutes before the break as Samir Nasri forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into a fine save with an effort that was curling towards the top corner. And just four minutes later Arsenal were ahead. Song exchanged passes with Wilshere, before picking up a loose ball in the area and driving it into the corner of the net. The home side came roaring out of the traps in the second half, as Walcott latched onto a loose pass from Michael Essien and drew Cech before squaring to Fabregas, who stroked the ball into an empty net on 51 minutes. Little more than a minute later the roles were reversed as Fabregas clipped a ball through to Walcott, who fired low past Cech from the edge of the area.
Chelsea gave themselves a glimmer of hope on 57 minutes as Ivanovic glanced Didier Drogba s curling freekick into the net, but despite committing plenty of men forward the champions couldn t fashion a way back into the match. Nasri and Abou Diaby had chances to compound Chelsea s misery, but both squandered late opportunities. Chelsea s defeat is bound to heap more pressure on their Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has presided over a wretched run of just one win in eight games. We have to wake up because we are asleep, he told Sky Sports after the game. We did not play well but Arsenal did and they deserved to win. We must stay focused and continue to work hard. Arsenal boss Wenger said We were disciplined, played for each other and were less nervous and perhaps less adventurous at some stages. Let s hope the game has strengthened our belief and that we can challenge for the championship.
London CNN Britain s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have revealed further details about their wedding including how the bride s parents will be involved, the timing of their honeymoon and how they plan to remember Harry s mother, Princess Diana. Meghan s mother and father, Doria Ragland and Thomas Markle, who split up when she was young, will both attend. In the days before the wedding, they will fly into the UK to spend time with the British royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, according to Jason Knauf, communications secretary to Prince Harry. Meghan will spend her last night as a single woman at a hotel in an undisclosed location. Then, on the morning of Saturday, May 19, a car will take Meghan and her mother to Windsor Castle before her father walks her down the aisle of St. George s Chapel at 12.00 p.m. 7.00 a.m. ET . Knauf said Meghan is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion. Read More LONDON Meghan Markle s divorced parents will meet with Queen Elizabeth II and other royals before her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry and will have special roles in their daughter s wedding, a palace spokesman said Friday. At the wedding, the royal couple also plan to honor the memory of the late Princess Diana, Harry s mother, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. Officials didn t predict the weather springtime in England can be glorious or horrid, sometimes on the same day but they outlined plans for a celebration designed to spread from the privileged environs of Windsor Castle throughout Britain and the world, via television and the internet.
Here are some of the plans disclosed by Harry s press secretary, Jason Knauf, during a briefing at Buckingham Palace Meghan s Parents To Take Part In Wedding Markle s parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, will arrive during the week before the May 19 wedding so they have time to meet Harry s family. Knauf says they will visit with the queen, her husband Prince Philip, Harry s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, and with Harry s brother Prince William and his sister in law Kate. Ragland will travel with her daughter by car to Windsor Castle on May 19 and Thomas Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St. George s Chapel for the ceremony. Knauf says Markle is delighted that her parents will be by her side. He did not say whether Markle s half brother and half sister will attend the wedding. ___ Princess Diana s Family Will Have A Role The press secretary says Harry is keen to involve his mother s family in the wedding and that all three of Diana s siblings will be present. One of Diana s two older sisters, Jane Fellowes, will give a reading during the ceremony to represent Diana s family. ___ No Maid Of Honor Markle, an American actress who came to prominence in the TV series Suits, will not have a maid of honor during the ceremony. Harry has chosen William as his best man. ___ Young Bidesmaids And Page Boys Knauf says all the bridesmaids and page boys will be children. That may mean a role for Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 3, the children of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. But don t bother looking for Prince Louis born in late April as the youngest prince will not attend the wedding.
___ Don t Ask About The Dress Palace officials are determined that the style and designer of Markle s wedding gown will be kept secret until the moment she gets out of the car to walk into the chapel. They say this tradition is very important but that won t keep speculators from trying to guess who has received the most important dressmaking assignment of the year. ___ Separated The Night Before The press secretary says Harry and Markle will spend the night before the wedding apart. They have been living together in recent months since announcing their engagement. They will spend their first night as a married couple in Windsor Castle. ___ Good Wishes For Prince Philip s Health Palace officials say they re hopeful that 96 year old Prince Philip, Harry s grandfather, will be well enough to attend the wedding festivities . The queen s husband has been recovering from hip replacement surgery and has not participated in any public events since being discharged from the hospital in mid April. ___ Follow The Wedding At Home The palace plans to publish the Order of Service on its website the morning of the wedding so people watching it on television will be better able to follow what s taking place inside the church. ___ Delayed Honeymoon Knauf would not reveal where the newest royal couple will spend their honeymoon, but he said they won t be leaving right after the wedding. Instead they plan to make their first public appearance as a married couple during the week following the ceremony. In the past, they have traveled in Africa together. Royal Photographer Alexi Lubomirski, the photographer who snapped Harry and Meghan s engagement photos, will be back behind the lens for the wedding. A mutual friend suggested Harry and Meghan check out Lubomirski s Instagram where the fashion photographer posts his work with some of world s most famous faces including Julia Roberts, Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie.
The tell all autobiography of Little House On The Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder has emerged as a surprise publishing hit, with readers rushing to snap up the gritty account of pioneer life. First published in November by the tiny South Dakota Historical Society Press, Pioneer Girl The Annotated Autobiography, offers an unvarnished view of life in the Midwest in the 19th century, a marked departure from the bucolic imagery of the beloved Little House series. The not safe for children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey. Scroll down for video . Runaway hit Readers have been rushing to snap up copies of Laura Ingalls Wilder s no holds barred autobiography Pioneer Girl, which hit the shelves in November . Real pioneer girl A handout photograph shows Little House On The Praire author Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose autobiography depicts an unvarnished view of the 19th century Midwest . Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder . Lane, herself a well known author, tried and failed to get an edited . version of the autobiography published throughout the early 1930s. The . original rough draft has been preserved at the Laura Ingalls Wilder . Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, for decades but hadn t . been published. The children s series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 never presented an entirely romanticized version of life on the prairie in Little House In The Big Woods, Laura and her sister Mary gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard. But the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that Wilder deemed unsuitable for kids, including much of the time the family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, and Walnut Grove, Minnesota, according to Pamela Smith Hill, a Wilder biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography.
So you can read Pioneer Girl as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical Ingalls family really lived, what their relationships were and how they experienced the American West, she said. TV hit Wilder s series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 were adapted for TV in the 1970s. The show ran for nine seasons . Wilder details a scene from her childhood in Burr Oak, in which a neighbor of the Ingalls pours kerosene throughout his bedroom, sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before Wilder s father Pa in the children s books intervenes. Scenes like that make Wilder s memoir sound like it s filled with scandal and mature themes, which isn t exactly true either, according to Amy Lauters, an associate professor of mass media at Minnesota State University Mankato. It s just that that first version was blunt, it was honest. It was full of the everyday sorts of things that we don t care to think about when we think about history, Lauters said last August. And it s certainly not the fantasized version we saw on Little House on the Prairie the television show. The autobiography preserves Wilder s original rough draft misspellings, idiosyncrasies and all but adds extensive annotations. Little House lovers can learn about the three girls that Wilder combined to create the Nellie Olson character, or how extensive the damage was in Minnesota during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s, which forced Pa in On The Banks Of Plum Creek to set out in search of work. In some ways, I came to think of the annotations in Pioneer Girl as almost an encyclopedia about Laura Ingalls Wilder s life and work, Hill said. Hard knock life Caroline and Charles Ingalls, known as Ma and Pa in the series, had financial problems and bounced from one apartment to the next .
Speaking to AFP this week, Nancy Tystad Koupal, the director of the publishing house, said they decided to release Wilder s first draft because it painted an honest picture of American pioneers hardscrabble life, warts and all. In the TV show, the character of Laura Ingalls Wilder was played by Melissa Gilbert . At the time, life was hard. Violence was typical. It was part of the pioneers life, Koupal said. The author s large family struggled financially and could not afford to buy a house of their own, forcing them to bounce from one apartment to the next. They had to flee in the middle of the night to avoid paying rent, Koupal said. In another episode from her adventures in the Midwest, Wilder tells about a sick woman whose drunk husband tried to rape her. The author only escaped by fighting back. Wilder s books were adapted for TV in 1974 by Michael Landon who also starred on the show. It ran for nine seasons, comprising more than 200 episodes. The Little House books and TV show were enjoyed by several generations of Americans readers and viewers, which could explain the unexpected success of the new memoir. With sales being bolstered by news stories and radio segments about the new book, it has climbed up the Amazon bestseller list, and even briefly overtook Chris Kyle s American Sniper for the top spot last week. As of Wednesday afternoon, Wilder s memoir remained at the top of the US History books list and in fifth spot on the overall list of best sellers. Since its publication two months ago, orders for the autobiography have exploded. Manuscript The original manuscript of Pioneer Girl was written on tablet paper with lead pencil . An initial print run of 15,000 was sold out within a few weeks. The historical society then placed orders for another 15,000 followed by another 45,000 books.
The editor of the book, Pamela Smith Hill, took it upon herself research the events and dates mentioned in Wilder s original manuscript to make sure all of the information was accurate. We had to check if her memory was correct, Koupal said. It is her autobiography, but she wrote it when she was 60, and sometimes, memory fails.
Former world No 1 Tiger Woods will drop outside the top 100 in the rankings on Monday for the first time in more than 18 years. The 39 year old American is down at No 96 and a world ranking official revealed that he is likely to slip to No 102 when the list is adjusted after this weekend s tournaments. Woods posted an 82 at the Phoenix Open in January, his worst round as a professional, as he slumped outside the leading 50 in the rankings for the first time in more than three years.

By . Mark Nicol . PUBLISHED . 17 05 EST, 23 November 2013 . . UPDATED . 17 58 EST, 23 November 2013 . The Royal Household last night defended hiring out the ballroom at Buckingham Palace to investment bank JP Morgan for a lavish dinner hosted by the Duke of York. The bank paid an undisclosed fee to hire the ballroom and made donations to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Ballet, which provided entertainment. Among the 100 guests were banking executives, Tony Blair, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is at the centre of a new Palace for hire row . A Palace spokeswoman said the event was part of Prince Andrew s ongoing work to support British prosperity . But Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said I understand the Palace needs to cut costs and raise money, but dining there should be a privilege rather than being open to the highest bidder. The security implications are also an issue. The Household s relationship with senior corporate figures was previously questioned after St James s Palace was rented out, apparently at a cost of 30,000 a day, during the London Olympics. Buckingham Palace said that the State Apartments were occasionally used by outside organisations to generate income to pay for the upkeep of its properties a recommendation made in a recent parliamentary report. The Royal Ballet performed at the Buckingham Pallace event . The event in the ballroom on October 30 was reportedly arranged by a personal friend of Prince Andrew called David Mayhew, who is one of JP Morgan s most senior staff. JP Morgan declined to comment last night but a Palace spokesman said Events at Buckingham Palace, of which there have been around 200 in the past year, are hosted by members of the Royal Family in conjunction with a variety of organisations. Re charging the costs of the event where appropriate is standard practice.
CNN At one of Nevada s infamous legal brothels, a 20 year old woman recently signed up for work but not to have sex. Instead, Katherine Stone, who dreams of one day becoming a lawyer, planned to sell something other women working at the bordello couldn t offer Her virginity. Like the brothels themselves, Stone s choice has been controversial, particularly for those who believe a woman s virginity should only be shared for love. But in Stone s eyes, that s exactly what she s doing. I love my family In 2014, Stone s family home in Seattle, Washington, was destroyed by a fire. Without insurance, Stone and her family found themselves forced to remain in the scorched property. Then came the day when she noticed an ad on Facebook, and I found out all about the brothels and the money, Stone says. It made me think, Wow, it s a chance at fixing all that I need to fix.

Any Nevada county with a population below 700,000 can host a brothel and, as of 2015, there were 19 brothels operating in the state. Brothel tycoon Dennis Hof owns seven of Nevada s legal bordellos, and that s who Stone turned to last year for help. Hof who says he receives two to three similar requests a week agreed to sell Stone s one time service with the understanding that he ll take a 50 cut from the profits of the final bid. In an effort to salvage her family s damaged home, Stone packed her bags and left home for the first time to live at one of Hof s brothels. People say you are suppose to do it for love, Stone says of the cultural ideals around losing one s virginity.
But if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family. I obviously value myself Like the brothels themselves, Stone s decision has been controversial. I read an article about myself online that made me cry, Stone recalls. It was a Christian lady she said I had no self respect, which I disagree with completely. I mean, I obviously value myself. At the moment, Stone says, her virginity bid is a little over 400,000 and she s still waiting to accept an offer. I m waiting for a man who I feel a connection with so that the experience can be special for both of us, she says. It s really not just about the money. While she waits, Stone is still contracted by Dennis Hof to legally provide services to gentlemen who are seeking experiences other than intercourse, she says. I have done small simple parties.

I have the right to choose Hof himself has been heavily criticized, with some lambasting him for exploiting women in need. The businessman and reality TV personality employs over 500 women at his ranches in Nevada, with roughly 30 working every weeknight at the famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch. As for Stone s contract, it s controversial there is not any question about that, Hof says. But, he continues, It is her choice. I don t think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house ...
If she wants to sell it, I think that s great. If that sounds like something a pimp would say, Hof wouldn t disagree. In the strictest sense, I am a pimp, he says. I am a guy that brings customers to a girl. The difference is I have a license to do this. Stone would argue she has the same. I have the right to choose what I do with my body, she says. And in this troubling economy, do you blame me After a devastating fire claimed her home, a young Washington woman has made an important decision many have viewed as extremely controversial. 20 year old Katherine Stone has decided to auction off her virginity for the sake of her family. Stone s family home in Seattle was destroyed in a fire in 2014. They had no insurance so due to financial complications, they were forced to stay on the burned out property. Later, Stone came across a Facebook ad for a legal brothel in Nevada. Prostitution is legal in some counties in the state. Stone turned to Dennis Hof, who owns at least seven brothels in Nevada, each one of them legal. I talked to my people and I talked to her and she convinced me that this is something she wanted to do, Hof told InsideEdition.com. With support from her mother, Stone said goodbye to her old home and made her way to one of Hof s brothels, where she now lives. I was definitely scared throughout the whole thing, Stone told InsideEdition.com. I was intimidated because I was brand new to the sex industry. Despite her fears, she said all of the ladies who work at Hof s brothel are supportive. It s just a good environment we have fun here, she said. The current bid for Stone s virginity has reached 400,000, but no offers have been accepted just yet. According to Hof, she is looking for Mr. Right. She hasn t found the right situation, said Hof.
She s had guys that she s liked that didn t have enough money and she s had guys that had enough but she didn t like them. Hof said due to Stone s situation, he won t accept any of the profits. Stone said she s waiting for someone to make her feel comfortable with what she s doing and, while there have been negative criticisms online, Stone won t let it affect her. The whole time I ve been here, I ve come to terms with what I m doing, she said. I m definitely ready. Copyright c 2016 CBS Studios Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The mother of two was then also involved as a father of three was stabbed 14 times. Matthew Howard, 27, thought he was going to die after being attacked by Margaret and her daughter Isabel, 18. He was dragged out into the alleyway and abandoned. He suffered a collapsed lung, nerve damage and was left disabled. While he was in hospital he missed the birth of his youngest child three days later when he was in hospital. Both attacks were meted out for pleasure by the teenage children at separate rowdy parties.

Her daughter Isabel was jailed for six years while her son Joseph was given eight years. Sarah Booth, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court that as Mr Daley, 18, tried to leave the party in August 2010, at the grim family home but Gilheaney and his friends followed him outside and attacked him. The victim was repeatedly hit and kicked while he lay on the ground screaming for help. Miss Booth said He believed he was knocked unconscious and a witness described everyone piling on top of the victim and the defendant.
Another onlooker told how Mr Daley ended up with a hole in his lip, his nose split in half and with deep cuts all over his face and body.

The company exported 279,000 packets to the country in 2013 up from 46,000 in the previous year. The Canadian market now makes up about 40 of Mackie s export sales turnover. The figures were announced as Commonwealth Games Secretary Shona Robison visited a store in Toronto which stocks the Perthshire firm s products. Ms Robison has been in the country as the Queen s Baton Relay continues its journey through Canada. Ms Robison said This is another terrific example of a Scottish firm making a big impact on the international stage, and it s great to see Scottish brands on supermarket shelves abroad. Mackie s have been working extremely hard to gain a foothold in Canada and this has resulted in tremendous sales figures a six fold increase in one year is remarkable. Ronnie Wilson, commercial director for Mackie s Crisps, said The response to our crisps in Canada has been tremendous, and our Scottish provenance has proven to be a key selling point in this market. Following the introduction of our dedicated Canadian packaging at the beginning of this year, which is bilingual and features a prominent saltire flag, we now have scope to broaden our distribution into mass grocery channels. Furthermore, we are about to launch 13 new lines into the Canadian market in addition to the nine lines we already supply there. Mackie s Crisps was founded in 2009 as a joint venture between Aberdeenshire based Mackie s of Scotland and Perthshire potato company Taypack.
CNN Africa is poor, corrupt and rural. Right Think again. A team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of Africa as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent. When filmmaker Nosarieme Garrick hit the streets of New York to ask passersby What do you know about Africa the overwhelming response was not a lot. It s very big, very hot. Most of Africa s impoverished. I m pretty ignorant to Africa, admitted one man. I know about some human rights violations, some wars and genocides, was the bleak answer from another woman. It was a dismal reflection of many Western stereotypes surrounding Africa one that Nosarieme is determined to change. Watch Fighting Hollywood stereotypes . My Africa is hopeful . The 27 year old hopes to launch an eight part documentary series My Africa Is showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders. The four things that come to mind when people think of Africa are population, problems, poverty, and promise unfulfilled headline media reports on the continent. But that s not the whole story, Nosarieme, originally from Nigeria and now living in Washington, said. The ambitious project would cover 13 cities across sub Saharan Africa. Organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the Kickstarter website and hope to start filming in October if they reach their target. Between the 1980s and now the image of famine and wars has been ingrained in people s minds. That s a narrative that s going to be hard to shift, Nosarieme said. That s not to discount the fact that this stuff does happen. But what I wasn t seeing was the solutions. See also South African ballet dancer confounds stereotypes . Nigeria the troubled oil giant . First up in the documentary series is Abuja in Nigeria a country that until the election of President Goodluck Jonathan last year had largely lurched from one military coup to the next.
This is Africa s most populous country and its leading oil producer. Yet few in the country have benefited from the oil boom with more than half the population still living in poverty. See also Congo s designer dandies . The President was recently forced to sack bosses from state owned oil company NNPC amid corruption allegations . Then there s the ongoing violence between Muslim and Christian groups in the north, with even Pope Benedict XVI weighing in to call for an end to the brutality. Put simply, when it comes to Nigeria, the headlines aren t great. Getting on the Photowagon . But according to Nosereime, that s only half the story. Nigeria is going through a turbulent time, she admitted. But there s a rising youth who are trying to educate each other. Indeed the trailer for the first My Africa Is show, the focus is on Photowagon a Nigerian photography collective on a mission to show the giant of Africa through the lens. Launched in 2009, their powerful images paint a very different image of Africa. It s a well rounded collection that captures the frivolity of everyday life, such as market scenes and football matches. But doesn t shy away from some of the more familiar and gruesome notions of Nigeria such as terrorist attacks and military clampdowns. The other Nigeria . Photowagon co founder Aisha Augie Kuta says her mission is to conquer sports photography as a northern Nigerian female a bold statement for a very conservative country. But the gung ho 33 year old appears undeterred as she takes My Africa Is to a Nigeria vs Argentina football match in the capital Abuja. Traditional dancers and hip hop singers entertain the crowds during half time, while ecstatic fans hug each other with each goal. It s an image of Nigeria that couldn t be further from the grim headlines. Aisha admitted that if you believed the Western media, you wouldn t step foot inside Africa. They see us as a continent without hope, the mother of three said.
For Africans, we see hope on the street everyday. But on the news you don t see that. It s always about the negative stuff. Instead, what we see is a lot of poor children dying from malaria or polio. If you listened to the news everyday you d have no hope from the bombings or corruption. Don t get me wrong, it is happening. But it s not a constant. It s not the Nigeria we in Lagos or Abuja are living in. See also South Africa s underground youth culture . The 33 year old said the country had come a long way since she was growing up under a military regime in the northern state of Kebbi. Aisha remained optimistic about democratic change in the west African country, particularly for women, but was also realistic about its pace. There s a lot of opportunity and hope as to where we can be, she said. But at the same time there s a lot of uncertainty about how much change the government can bring in.
Liverpool are heading for Miami to do battle with arch rivals Manchester United on Monday after a comfortable 2 0 win over a dismal AC Milan side in Charlotte. Goals from Joe Allen and Suso made it three wins out of three for Brendan Rodgers men in the International Champions Cup.

Referee David Gantar . However, they made no mistake in front of a 70,000 strong crowd at the Bank of America Stadium as they easily dealt with the challenge of Milan, who had already been heavily beaten by Olympiacos and Man City. Rodgers used no fewer than 21 players to ensure his squad is ready for the first showdown with United since Louis van Gaal s appointment as David Moyes successor.
With Daniel Sturridge ruled out with a minor knock sustained in training and 20million new boy Lazar Markovic sidelined by a tendon problem, Liverpool made five changes following the win over Manchester City in New York. Brad Jones, Jose Enrique, Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho and Sturridge were replaced by Simon Mignolet, Jack Robinson, Lucas Leiva, Jordon Ibe and Raheem Sterling. Lightning quick teenage wingers Ibe and Sterling lit up the opening 45 minutes as their pace tormented Milan s overworked backline. Liverpool were in control from the start and took the lead in the 17th minute. Big crowd Kolo Toure lead the team out in Charlotte on Saturday . Relaxed Already in the final, Brendan Rodgers was able to give Steven Gerrard a rest . Allen s work rate created the chance as he dispossessed former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and burst clear. The Wales international fired against the woodwork and Sterling s effort from the follow up was blocked by Christian Abbiati. The ball fell back into the path of Allen, who volleyed home in style. Sterling was then denied by Abbiati before Kolo Toure made a crucial tackle to thwart Giampaolo Saponara at the other end. Ibe, who enjoyed a beneficial loan spell at Birmingham City last season, showcased his exciting potential. The youngster was on the receiving end of some rough treatment from former Portsmouth man Sulley Muntari but he picked himself up and battled on. Keeping tabs The Liverpool manager and his backroom staff observe the game . Ibe began the attack which should have yielded a second goal in the 27th minute. He raced 50 yards before linking up with Lambert and Sterling, who was pulled to the ground by Adil Rami. Lambert, who never missed in his 34 penalties for Southampton, took responsibility but his spot kick was kept out by Abbiati.
Milan did threaten just before the break but Mignolet grabbed Mbaya Niang s strike at the second attempt and Allen dealt with the danger after Stephan El Shaarawy raced into the penalty area. Suso and Conor Coady came on for Henderson and Sterling as Rodgers began to rest players with one eye on Monday s final in Miami. There were eight more changes on the hour mark with the introduction of Steven Gerrard receiving a rapturous ovation from the 70,000 strong crowd. The raft of subs dented the flow of the game and chances were at a premium. Making an impression Jordan Ibe left battles with Mattia De Sciglio for possession . Ibe continued to shine with another classy burst down the left as he got the better of Rami but Milan survived. Gerrard sparked panic with a through ball to Suso which triggered a thundering collision between Gabriel and Mattia De Sciglio. The Liverpool skipper went close from long range before Milan threatened to restore parity. Mbaye Niang went clean through but Mignolet raced out and made a brave sprawling save. Muntari s strike was then deflected wide before Liverpool killed off the Italians in the 89th minute. Coutinho raced into space down the left and teed up Suso, who swept a low left footer into the far corner. Mignolet s stunning finger tip save denied Bryan Cristante deep into stoppage time as Liverpool march on to Miami on a high.
By . Glen Owen . PUBLISHED . 17 39 EST, 18 January 2014 . . UPDATED . 18 47 EST, 18 January 2014 . Unite s Len McCluskey attended a meeting where NHS leverage campaign was allegedly proposed . Doctors have reacted with anger after leaked documents revealed plans by union militants to intimidate GPs over health reforms. Unite s leverage team the dirty tricks unit which bullied managers and their families during last year s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Scotland intends to deploy the same tactics against doctors involved in privatising the NHS. At a recent Unite executive meeting attended by controversial general secretary red Len McCluskey, there was a proposal that the next comprehensive leverage campaign will be focused on the defence of the National Health Service . According to leaked minutes, the leverage team suggested taking action at a local level by using direct intervention to... target private health care companies and commissioning bodies . Under the Government s health reforms, the bodies, partly staffed by GPs, are responsible for putting local medical contracts out to tender and are therefore seen by Left wing opponents as being in the vanguard of privatisation. During the Grangemouth dispute last autumn, the sinister leverage unit staffed by campaigners who describe themselves as industrial terrorists personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes. One director embroiled in the row over pay and conditions said he had feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite activists descended on his drive during the school holidays and told his neighbours that he was evil .

Last night, Tory Health Minister Dan Poulter condemned Unite s plan, saying We take threats to doctors and nurses very seriously.
Unite may have walked all over Ed Miliband and taken over the Labour Party, but we will not let them do that to our NHS. Leading GP Michael Dixon, the president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said This plan is deeply worrying. It will be the patients who suffer from attempts to intimidate hard working doctors. Nobody deserves to be threatened just for trying to improve patient care. Last night, a Unite spokeswoman said that while the executive had discussed the plan, it was just a proposal. She added that defending the NHS from the savagery of the Government was one of the most serious issues facing the country .
CNN King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has left a New York hospital to recuperate at his home in the city, the official Saudi Press Agency said Wednesday. The king left the New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center Tuesday night, the news agency said citing the Royal Court. The statement did not say how long Abdullah will remain in New York. Abdullah first underwent successful surgery on November 24. He had a successful follow up back surgery on December 3 to stabilize several vertebrae in his spine, the agency said earlier. The king traveled to the United States for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, Saudi state media reported. Abdullah, 86, had named Crown Prince Sultan to administer the state s affairs in the monarch s absence, the state run Saudi Press Agency reported at the time. The top three figures in the kingdom Abdullah, Sultan and Prince Nayef, the country s interior minister and second deputy prime minister are all sons of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1932. Abdullah has ruled the oil rich kingdom since the August 2005 death of his half brother, King Fahd. But Abdullah ran most of the kingdom s affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half brother. Since coming to power, he has sought to establish rules and procedures for many Saudi institutions, giving him a reputation as a reformer in the highly conservative nation.
CNN The Achilles heel of America s policy against terrorism is its failure to counter the narratives that inspire individuals to become extremists and terrorists. That s why despite the skill and numerous successes of our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies the type of tragic events seen most recently with the stabbings of soldiers in London and outside Paris, and the April bombing of the Boston Marathon, will continue to occur. We re failing to use a key weapon that needs to be used. There s no question that the United States has been extremely effective tactically against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups since 9 11. Our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have done what they were charged with doing, from routing them in Afghanistan to hunting down Osama bin Laden to thwarting plots against New York. But this isn t enough. For as long as extremists are able to attract new recruits, they ll keep producing replacements for those killed or apprehended and the battle will never end. This is why the strategic tool known as countering violent extremism, or CVE, has to be used alongside special operations, drones and other weapons. As an FBI Special Agent, I interrogated dozens of senior terrorists. It quickly became clear that part of al Qaeda s effectiveness in gaining recruits was in their tailoring their rhetoric and their messenger to the personality, location and likely local grievances of their target. Extremists won t use a Yemeni railing about U.S. crimes in Iraq to try to appeal to American Somali youths in Minnesota. They ll find someone with as close a background as possible, and who understands grievances that resonate, such as foreign powers intervening in Somalia s affairs. Once a person is recruited they are indoctrinated with the group s counterculture. Asymmetrical groups like al Qaeda often develop their own countercultures, with certain religious texts, events and a consciousness that allows them to in many ways create their own religion within Islam. It isn t an ideology. That s factually inaccurate and gives it undeserved credit.
It s a false narrative. As I travel around the world today, I ve seen how that counterculture, once centered in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has worryingly spread to places like Nigeria and Southeast Asia. Its spread is helped by today s new technological tools Recruitment is not just happening in training camps and in secret meeting rooms, but in Internet chat rooms and through social media. That has been a major factor in the increase in homegrown terrorism in the West, seen horrifically on May 22 on the streets of London and April 15 at the Boston Marathon. In his recent speech on terrorism, President Obama told the nation that the values the United States holds will ultimately defeat the terrorists. This will be the case as long as we take the steps to effectively deploy our message. We need to counter extremists in the same manner that they recruit Targeting extremists with the ideal medium, messenger and message. A mistake the United States has been making to date is in repeatedly making broad gestures toward the Muslim world and the U.S. Muslim community, making the argument that the United States is a friend. These broad messages don t have an impact on those who need to be targeted. The United States is working on developing a CVE program, but it has mistakenly spread the domestic portfolio across a range of agencies, from the Department of Education to the FBI. This makes it difficult to have a clear and effective strategy, and also hampers efforts Charging law enforcement with both collecting intelligence on suspected extremists as well as handling community engagement programs creates natural conflicts and means that neither job can be done effectively. The ideal situation is one in which the federal government provides support to local efforts to deal with local extremists and recruitment factors, not by imposing a strategy dictated from Washington.
This requires local communities whether in New York or in Sana a, Yemen to step up and take the lead in increasing the resiliency of their communities against these groups by identifying what the extremist narratives are and where they re spreading and then by countering them. When people are being recruited because of alleged local or tribal grievances, it is community leaders who are the best messengers to counter that narrative. When it s a distortion of Islam, it s the duty of religious leaders to take the lead. Sometimes it s former extremists, who have taken the same path and have credibility, who can be the most effective messengers. The best CVE programs, such as Singapore s, do this. They have a focused aim of reducing the pool of potential recruits and the appeal of violence, and they target accordingly. When done correctly, CVE should not be an excuse for broad social work or for anthropological studies it s a focused counterterrorism weapon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Soufan.
CNN I was living in Syria when the statues of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq came toppling down. Saddam, who had arrogantly had his name inscribed on bricks at the ancient city of Babylon, did not expect his rule to end so abruptly, so humiliatingly. And at the University of Damascus, students told me that they expected Syrian President Bashar al Assad to fall soon, too. They were not alone. With 250,000 U.S. troops amassed in Iraq in 2003, George W. Bush s White House had contemplated rolling American tanks into the Syrian capital. The Middle East was to be reshaped in the image of American democracy. But events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Korea distracted the Pentagon, and the democratic domino theory did not come to pass. Ten years after Iraq, did the war give birth to the Arab Spring Yes, the Iraq War had indirect connections to the Arab uprisings that swept the Middle East and northern Africa in 2011. For one, the fall of Saddam must have psychologically empowered Arab opposition activists who saw that a Ba thist dictator and his sons could be removed from power. FULL COVERAGE The Iraq War, 10 years on . But it is a mistake to suggest that Arabs across the region were directly inspired by the fall of Saddam if that were true, they would have risen a decade ago. Why wait until 2011 The answer is that other, more direct developments led to the ongoing Arab revolutions. First, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 atrocities, Arab governments used the ensuing war on terror to quell domestic dissent. When opposition Islamist parties questioned the legitimacy of Arab dictators, they were portrayed as al Qaeda sympathizers to the West, and their imprisonment in Cairo or Riyadh or Tripoli didn t raise international eyebrows. The violence of radical Islamists failed to topple strongmen in Egypt and Syria in the 1960s and 1980s.
And once again, from 2001 to 2011, government repression of less radical, nonviolent Islamists signalled to a younger generation of Arabs that Islamism could not overthrow autocratic regimes. WATCH NOW Iraq s phantom WMD . Second, as the war on terror unfolded, Islamists continued to fail in their decades long pursuit to gain political office, and the widespread corruption and nepotism of regimes in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt sunk deeper, US support for Arab dictatorships also came into question. Then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice put it best in June 2005 For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither. These were not just empty words. The U.S. government identified civil society organizations and financially supported NGOs through the democracy promotion agenda. During the Bush administration, annual funding for these programs exceeded the total amount spent on such programs in the entire decade to 2001, according to the 2009 budget report from the Project on Middle East Democracy. Funding for the mostly secular democracy activists was bolstered by the training provided for them in use of social media in mobilizing people. The invention and popularity of Facebook and Twitter helped young Arabs bypass communications controlled by their dictators. Even if this U.S. funded training in creating political parties, electioneering, communication and media training only reached a small portion of the population, is it any wonder that English speaking, elite, urban Arabs took to Facebook and Twitter to help overthrow dictators Yes, there were local grievances and the uprisings were homegrown. The Arab uprisings belong to the Arab youth. But they were also responding by using modern technology to amplify the mood music of Western belief that Arabs too could create free societies. They were not an exception. WATCH Lingering effects of war on Iraqis .
Why else were Arab protesters attention focused on the Obama White House as they demanded the president call on Mubarak to depart As Turkey pressured the White House to oppose Mubarak, Saudi Arabia pressured Obama to support Mubarak and in that way the uprisings revolved to some degree around the messages sent from the U.S. government. The Arab Spring was going to happen with or without Saddam Hussein, but it would not have happened had it not been for the attacks of September 11. In fact, in many ways the Iraq War has prevented more from being done to aid the uprisings, hindering global resolve in attending to the killing fields of the full blown civil war in Syria. OPINION Media s failure on Iraq still stings . It is the ghost of Iraq that prevents the U.S. from leading attempts to topple the brutal Assad regime in Damascus. Regime change has consequences, as we learned in Iraq. There will be no new commitments to nation build again, or re train police and security forces in a far off Arab land. The sectarianism, tribalism, Jihadism, border skirmishes and threat of chemical weapons use in Syria reminds U.S. policymakers of the American and Arab blood and treasure sacrificed in Iraq. And to what avail The ongoing loss of life in Syria is a direct result of U.S. foreign policy blunders in Iraq. Syrians are the victims of America s Iraq adventure. So as we ponder the last decade and current Arab uprisings, let us not gloat about the success of Iraq. Iraq is not a success. It is now an ally of Iran, home to a prime minister who persecutes his own political opposition, and unashamedly supports the Assad regime in Syria. Egyptians, Yemenis, Libyans, and Tunisians were not inspired by America in Iraq. The opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of Ed Husain.
CNN As a drone with a sensitive camera scans an expanding search area for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, investigators are widening their scope to include other missing persons and murder cases. A suspect in custody has been connected to previous sexual assault allegations, and DNA evidence has linked him to the disappearance and death of another young woman in the same area where Graham vanished. At least four women have gone missing there since 2009. Graham, 18, was last seen in Charlottesville s Downtown Mall area on September 13. Investigators believe suspect Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person with her. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile. There have been no signs of Graham since. As the search for her and the investigation of Matthew continue, this is what we ve learned so far . Who is Hannah Graham She s a native of Northern Virginia and tall 5 feet, 11 inches with a slender build. Graham has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was wearing a crop top when she was last seen. She s a second year University of Virginia student making straight A s, her parents say. And she is a member of the ski team. She had been co captain of her high school softball team. She was extremely smart, very witty, very athletic she was musically inclined, her former coach Craig Maniglia said. She was studying pre med, he said. There are also photos from a recent trip to France and comments from friends in French on what appears to be her Facebook page. Where was she the night she vanished On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. About 12 45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three quarters of a mile from the apartment complex.
Other surveillance cameras captured her, as she ran past a gas station, walked past an Italian cafe and then by a jewelry store. At 1 20 a.m., she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1 30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, making her less able to defend herself. What is being done to find her This is the first time in the state s history that an aerial drone has been used in a missing person search. Authorities are also offering a 100,000 reward for information leading her safe return. More than 3,000 tips to Graham s possible whereabouts have poured in. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. More than 1,200 volunteers have searched around Charlottesville for clues leading to Graham. And the search area has expanded to include U.S. Route 29, outside of Charlottesville, where other women reportedly disappeared. Where is Hannah Graham What other cases have come up in the investigation DNA evidence has linked suspect Matthew to the death of a second woman, Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared in 2009, authorities said. She was 20 at the time. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Investigators are also checking other unsolved homicide and missing person cases for possible connections Those of Cassandra Morton, whose body was found in a wooded area near Lynchburg in November 2009 Samantha Ann Clarke, who was last seen on September 13, 2010 and Virginia Tech students Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were shot to death in 2009. Route 29 seems to be a ghoulish common denominator. Harrington and Clarke disappeared along the corridor, where Graham also may have vanished. Alexis Murphy of Lovingston, Virginia, also vanished there.
All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, CNN affiliate WVIR has reported. Another man, Randy Taylor, was convicted in Murphy s case in August 2013. He maintains he is innocent. And this week, his lawyer, Michael J Hallahan II, asked that evidence in the case be re examined. This is not a fishing expedition, but rather this request is based upon evidence presented at Randy Taylor s trial and based upon these new developments relating to Matthew in the news, Hallahan said. Maybe it s him Matthew , maybe it s not. It doesn t hurt to check. In addition, in 2010, Harrington s case was connected to the 2005 kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax, Virginia. That woman survived her ordeal and provided police a description to make a sketch. Whether the drawing of an African American male resembles Matthew would have to be left up to interpretation. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Graham disappearance . Has Jesse Matthew been in trouble before Matthew has been accused of sexual assault twice before, when he was in college over a decade ago. A woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University in Lynchburg on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student at the evangelical Christian college for three years and played on the football team. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn t want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn t enough evidence to arrest Matthew. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented. There were no witnesses. This week, a criminal incident information report was released by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, pointing to a sexual assault allegedly involving Matthew on September 7, 2003. Matthew quit the school s football team after the allegations and later left the school. When Virginia police first looked for Matthew for questioning in the Graham case, he went to a police station, and there he asked for legal representation.
Days later, after police obtained an arrest warrant, Matthew was found more than 1,000 miles away on a Texas beach. He did not fight extradition in a Texas court and was taken back to Virginia. CNN s Eliott C. McLaughlin, Mike Ahlers and Ed Payne contributed to this report.
Wolves Kurt Gidley, 34, became the first rugby league player to wear a camera during Thursday s 22 8 defeat. Television viewers were told at half time that the device had been removed because of technical issues . I don t know if it had any effect on what he did, but the camera went at half time, said Wire coach Tony Smith. Kurt wanted to get on with playing footy. I don t think things were going great for Kurt at that stage. He needed to get it off and just get on with playing. The camera, which was mounted on a vest behind a hole in Gidley s shirt, was worn to try to give viewers a unique perspective of the contact sport. Gidley had said before kick off that the experimental idea painted a target on him. Wolves are bottom of Super League and without a win after five successive defeats, but Smith said the technology could not be used as an excuse. I hope they got some good footage from it, he added. I think it was done for all the right reasons to try and give people a perspective of rugby league from a different angle. Sky Sports, who broadcast live Super League, have said they will continue with the experiment. We had a few technical issues with the camera which could not be resolved in the half time break, a spokesperson said. Kurt was happy to continue wearing it and it was a decision made by our production team and Warrington, not his, to take it off. After we have reviewed the game and the camera we will certainly look to give it another go.

It may be banned for ordinary people in Iran, but Facebook has at least one member in the country. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appears to have become one of the website s newest members. Despite banning it due to its use by activists to rally government opponents in 2009, a page purporting to be for Khamenei himself launched a few days ago with the name Khamenei.ir. Ayatollah Khamenei has joined Facebook despite banning the rest of Iran from the site due to government opposition in 2009 . The 73 year old s page displays pictures of him alongside speeches and pronouncements he has made. While there are several other Facebook pages already devoted to Khamenei, the new one whose number of likes was today close to 10,000 appeared to be officially authorised, rather than merely the work of admirers. The page has been publicised by a Twitter account of the same name that Iran experts believe is run by Khamenei s office. Both U.S based social media sites are blocked in Iran by a wide reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of Iranians who use special software to get around the ban. In 2009, social media were a vital tool for those Iranians who believed the re election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged. Facebook was used to help organise street protests of a scale not seen since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The protests which the government said were fuelled by Iran s foreign enemies were eventually stamped out by the security forces and their political figureheads remain under house arrest. The cover photo for the supreme leader shows Khamenei being driven through the streets with hundreds of supporters surrounding his vehicle . Another picture shows Khamenei alongside Imam Kohmeini in the first days of Iran s Islamic Revolution movement . Khamenei s Facebook page has so far shared a picture of a young Khamenei alongside the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the early 1960s.
It shares a similar tone, style and content with accounts devoted to disseminating Khamenei s message on Twitter and Instagram and to the website www.khamenei.ir, a sophisticated official website published in 13 languages. Experts said the social media accounts showed that Iran, despite restricting access to such sites inside the country, was keen to use them to spread its world view to a global audience. Social media gives the regime leadership another medium of communication, one that can share their message with a younger and far more international demographic, said Afshon Ostovar, a Middle East analyst at CNA, a U.S. based research organisation. Iran has yet to comment on whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has joined Facebook or not . Iran is locked in a decade long dispute with the West over its nuclear programme, which the U.S. and its allies suspect is aimed at developing a bomb, something Iran has repeatedly denied. Iran, the West and regional states are also often opposed on issues such as the violence raging in Syria and the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Iranian authorities have said they are trying to build a national intranet, something sceptics say is a way to further control Iranians access to the global web. Tehran tried to block Google Inc. s email service this year but soon reopened access. Iranian authorities had no immediate comment on the site, which apparently went online last week but only recently gained prominence among social media watchers. Despite the possibility that it is a hoax, the page has generated at least 170 comments laudatory and derogatory, and nearly all in Farsi that highlight the deep political divisions in Iran and possibly opposition fervor from expatriate Iranians. One post compared Khamenei to a celebrated ruler of ancient Persia, Cyrus the Great, who significantly expanded the Persian empire 2,500 years ago.
Another wrote Mr. Khamenei, how are you visiting this page With proxy It was a reference to Iran s blocking of Facebook and many other Western social media sites, and the efforts to bypass the restrictions using proxy server links from outside Iran. The U.S. State Department said Monday it will keep tabs on the page, but had no comment on whether it was genuine or not. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland joked that Washington is curious how many likes the Khamenei page receives. But much about the page including an informal photo of Khamenei riding in a car suggested it was not sanctioned by Iran s top leader. It is also highly unlikely that Khamenei would endorse a banned outlet such as Facebook. The Net is not unknown territory for Iranian leaders, however. Khamenei, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others have official websites. Also, some senior Iranian clerics issue religious opinions by email.
Members were balloted over job security at the university s medical school. UCU Scotland said three quarters of those who took part in a ballot voted for strike action. A petition will also be handed in on Tuesday. The university expressed disappointment at the announcement. UCU Scotland said all four members of staff now at the centre of the dispute were of Asian ethnic origin, which the union said raised the question of whether the process had been discriminatory. A University of Aberdeen spokesman said We are disappointed that the UCU has decided to take strike action, and that they have chosen a date for the strikes which occurs during the student exam period. We will not allow our students exams to be disrupted and have made arrangements to make sure this does not occur. Of the staff that were placed at risk of redundancy as a result of restructuring in the School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, the remaining four have been offered alternative employment on their current salary and grade. As a result, we no longer believe there will be a need for any compulsory redundancies. Regarding the concerns of UCU over the process that was followed, it is important to point out that the University of Aberdeen is an equal opportunities employer and takes this responsibility very seriously.
By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED . 04 58 EST, 19 September 2013 . . UPDATED . 05 33 EST, 19 September 2013 . With 12,000 cash in his backpack, an early morning motorbike ride to the jewellers and a big smile on his face, Matthew Camp was off to buy his girlfriend a special engagement ring. But that dream was shattered because unbeknown to him a faulty zip on his bag meant that for miles, his hard earned cash was streaming out behind him. And for fisherman Matthew Camp, the cash truly was the result of hard work, sweat and sacrifices. Good intentions Matthew Camp planned to buy his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn an engagement ring with his recent paycheck from a good season as a scallop fisherman . After days and even weeks away at sea, aboard the scallop boat the FV Nancy Elizabeth, at last the boat had had a big haul. It was a welcome relief in a job which at times brings in nothing at all. When the ship docked on Sept. 9 in Cape May County, New Jersey, Mr Camp, 32, immediately cashed his check, stuffed the bills into his backpack and headed south on the Garden State Parkway at 8am. According to Philly.com, it wasn t until he reached Lund s Fisheries, close to his home in Lower Township, that the horror of what had happened hit him. Every hard earned dollar was gone. His plans were ruined he called his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn. He was sick to his stomach Miss Bohn told Philly.com. This season had been good, finally. Last season had been bad and we were at our wits end. Sometimes he can go out for a month and not even make a paycheck, she told the news service. Mr Camp only realised all his hard earned cash was gone after travelling south on his motorbike along the Garden State Parkway to Lund Fisheries .
Mr Camp turned his motorbike around and retraced his tracks searching desperately for his money. Some luck, fortunately, was on his side, as a team of highway workers on a roadside project had scooped up 4,000 and handed it in to police. But the rest was gone, presumed taken by opportunist motorists. Mr . Camp, a father of four, had received a phone call from a person . claiming to a driver in a silver Dodge pickup, and claiming they had the . cash, Miss Bohn told Philly.com. But the couple weren t sure if it was a cruel prank. No money was handed in to the police. It can t possibly feel good to spend someone else s hard earned money, she said. His dream was shattered when the 12,000 cash for his scallops, which he stuffed into his backpack, fluttered away in the wind because of a faulty bag zip . As Mr Camp prepared to set off on another long fishing trip, his sister Michelle Godin spoke to the news service, and told them he was angry and embarrassed at what had happened. She stressed he was a hard working, honest, family man who has to leave his loved ones for days on end for a dangerous job to make ends meet.

London CNN An advertisement for Marc Jacobs perfume featuring teenage actor Dakota Fanning has been banned in Britain because it sexualized children. The ad, for Marc Jacobs Oh, Lola fragrance, featured Fanning, the child star of War of the Worlds and I am Sam wearing a short dress and holding an oversized bottle of the scent in her lap. Four readers complained that the photograph which appeared in two British magazines in August was offensive and irresponsible, for showing Fanning, 17, in a sexualized manner. Britain s advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Agency ASA agreed with the complaints, and has banned the picture from use in the UK. Coty UK, the perfume s manufacturer insisted that the ad did not show any private parts or sexual activity and said it was provoking, but not indecent. But the ASA ruled that Fanning was holding up the perfume bottle... in her lap between her legs and we considered that its position was sexually provocative. In a statement, it said that while it accepted that Fanning was 17, we considered she looked under the age of 16, and that her outfit and pose drew attention to her sexuality. Because of that... we considered the ad could be seen to sexualize a child. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offense. It is not the first time the ASA has banned advertisements featuring Hollywood stars in July, the watchdog ruled against a make up ad starring Julia Roberts, on the grounds it had been airbrushed too heavily.
BEIJING Ten people were arrested in suspicion of killing and dismembering a wild panda and selling its meat, according to Chinese state television. Police found the panda s skin, bones and 22 pounds of meat in a raid on a house in Yanjin, Yunnan province, in December, CCTV reported. Two of the suspects are brothers who told police they were hunting for an animal that killed their goat. On finding the creature in a tree, they shot at it and found the falling animal to be a giant panda. When the injured panda climbed another tree, they shot at it again, causing its death. The account was confirmed to another Chinese journalist by the Yunnan Forestry Bureau. DNA tests revealed the panda was an adult female, CCTV said. A piece of a wild giant panda fur is measured after 10 suspects involved in killing the panda were detained by police in Yanjin county, Zhaotong city, southwest China s Yunnan province on May 13. Yang linhua Imaginechina via AP The grisly case provoked strong reactions on social media. How can people be so heartless towards such adorable animals asked Sina Weibo user, Jiwuge. However, Netease user Xiazi said Without the existence of buyers there would not be this killing. There are only about 1,800 wild pandas left in China, CCTV said. Julia Zhou and Alastair Jamieson contributed to this report.

Police in southwestern China arrested 10 people for killing... Associated Press Five panda cubs eat special milk porridge served in separate bowls during feeding time at the Chengdu Panda Breeding Research Center in Chengdu in southwestern China s Sichuan province Wednesday, May... Associated Press The giant panda is an endangered species that tops China s list of protected animals. Poaching them is rare, but panda parts are believed to fetch high prices on the black market because of their rarity. China Central Television said forest police in Yunnan province recovered panda skin, meat, bones and an internal organ from the poachers and vendors. If convicted, the suspects could be jailed for years. Authorities told the official Xinhua News Agency that one suspect, identified by his family name of Wang, set up a trap after he found his sheep had been killed by wild animals in December. After he found the trap was broken and his brother spotted footprints of a wild animal, the two men tracked down the panda and killed it, according to the media report. The men sold 35 kilograms of giant panda meat and its four paws for 4,800 yuan 800 to one buyer, and that the parts were sold again to others, Xinhua said. A recent census shows the wild panda population grew by 268 to a total of 1,864 in China since the last survey ending in 2003. The World Wide Fund for Nature has said poaching, a traditional threat to wild pandas in China, has declined but economic development has become a major threat. Hydropower plants, roads, and mining projects disrupt the animal s natural habitat. Still, Chinese officials say poaching rare animals and smuggling their parts remain a problem and that authorities are stepping up efforts to crack down on acts endangering rare animals.
By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED . 09 51 EST, 25 July 2013 . . UPDATED . 09 11 EST, 8 August 2013 . The research shows that poor quality or inadequate sleep can effect many different aspects of skin cells . It is well known that sleep is essential for health, with lack of shuteye associated with everything from weight gain to cancer. But now research has proven the long suspected link between insufficient sleep and accelerated signs of ageing. The study, conducted by University Hospital Case Medical Centre in Ohio investigated the impact of chronic lack of sleep has on skin function and appearance. They found that poor quality sleepers lost 30 per cent more water 72 hours after a skin barrier disruption, such as exposure to UV light than those who regularly have good quality sleep. Crucially for women concerned with the signs of ageing poor sleepers had twice the amount of intrinsic signs of ageing such as fine lines, reduced elasticity and uneven pigmentation, as well as recovering slower from sunburn. They also reported less satisfaction with their skin s appearance and had a dulled skin sensory response. Further breakthroughs for the importance of night time repair of skin comes from cutting edge research from scientists on the process of Catabolysis. Dr Nadine Pernodet, Executive Director of Skin Biology Research at Estee Lauder explains Catabolysis is a natural purification process that helps skin cells eliminate internal debris that can cause cellular damage. It is getting older coupled with environmental stressors that generate this internal debris within cells, which can cause cellular damage and prevent cells from functioning effectively. Sleep is essential to skin repair which keeps it looking youthful and even . Skin cells, like the entire human body, have a natural 24 hour rhythm, repairing themselves at night and protecting themselves in the day.
The research, commissioned by skincare brand Estée Lauder, is the first to show that Catabolysis is at its peak at night in line with the circadian rhythm of our bodies and that as you age, the process becomes less efficient and desynchronised with the night. Healthy skin cells maximise natural repair at night and thus suffering from chronic lack of sleep will negatively effect your skin. Sleep expert Dr Guy Meadows from www.thesleepschool.org debunks some myths ... How much sleep do you actually need need The average amount of sleep people need to wake up feeling refreshed and to cope during the day is 7 8 hours. Genetic variation means that their are long and short sleepers and so sleep needs can range from 4 to 10 hours. Genetics also determine the time that you sleep such as whether you are an owl or a lark. Women are three times more likely to suffer from poor sleep than men 75 to 25 per cent . Can you train yourself to have less sleep Contrary to what many people believe you cannot train yourself to need less sleep. People who believe they need more sleep than they actually do and spend to long in bed could be weakening their sleep quality. For these people, paradoxically decreasing the amount of hours spent in bed could help to improve depth and quality of sleep. What are long term effects of not enough sleep Research tells us that good sleep helps to protect your immune system and prevent you from getting coughs and colds. It helps you to eat healthily and lose weight by regulating the hormones that control appetite. It also regulates your daytime mood and so helps you to combat feelings of stress, anxiety and depression more effectively. Good quality sleep is also the answer to youthful looking skin by lessening the formation of wrinkles and preventing acne. In the long term, good quality sleep has been shown to limit your risk of conditions such as heart failure, Alzheimer s, diabetes and cancer.
The fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room . What are your top tips for the perfect sleep 1. Let go of the props sleep is a natural physiological process that can t be controlled and trying to do so by engaging in unnatural rituals or becoming reliant on props e.g. warm baths and milk etc can lead to further sleep anxiety. Follow a normal wind down of turning of the TV, getting ready for the next day, brushing your teeth, washing your face, reading in bed if you want to and then turning out the light. To achieve your best nights sleep you should limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime . 2. Be mindful Worrying about past poor quality sleep or imagining how bad things will be in the future if we don t sleep only helps to increase night time arousal levels. Mindfulness grounds us in the present moment by noticing things objectively and without judgment and as a result can promote sleepiness. Take a moment to notice the touch or your pillow on your face or the movement of your breath and if your mind wanders off, gently return it back to what you were observing in that moment. 3. Welcome thoughts and emotions fearful thoughts such as If I don t sleep, I wont be able to cope or strong sensations such as anxiety or a racing heart, are a common aspect of insomnia. However, it is often our unhelpful attempts to avoid them such as watching TV or drinking alcohol in the middle of the night that actually keep us awake and fuel them further. Learning to change your relationship with them by getting to know them and even welcoming them when they arrive, helps to reduce their power over you and lessen your struggle with sleep.4. Timing and drive when we can t sleep we try to catch up by going to bed earlier, lying in or napping for long periods during the day.
Whilst this may help you to cope in the short term, it often leads to a weaker sleep wake cycle. Start to go to bed and get up at roughly the same time most nights, as this will help to keep your body clock on time and promote the natural drive to sleep. If you fancy a nap, then limit it too less than 20 minutes.5. The Bedroom if you are awake at night choose to stay in bed and conserve your energy by lying still and being calm and relaxed. Be mindful and welcome your thoughts and emotions. The key is learning how to be in bed with all of your fears, rather than spending all night struggling with them or getting out of bed to avoid them.6. Live your life the fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room. Commit to making small actions everyday that take you closer to what is important to you in your life, whilst experiencing your insomnia. Doing so takes away the justification for struggling with sleep in the first place and paradoxically promotes sleep. 7. Lifestyle and environment Live a healthy lifestyle that promotes sleep. For example, drink a moderate amount of caffeine and stop by 2pm. Limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime. Exercise regularly during the day or early evening and for the reasons of enjoyment and health promotion, rather than to get you to sleep. Sleep in a cool, quiet and dark room. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II claims to clean out dirt or dead skin cells from deep in your skin while you sleep . Estée Lauder have used this research into the importance of sleep in skin cell repair to develop an industry first anti ageing product. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery . Complex II works to aid the process of Catabolysis at night, resulting in younger looking skin with long term use.
The patented Catabolysis Technology contains algae and yeast extract to support the skins purifying process and Chronolux Technology which helps support the natural synchronization of the skins nighttime renewal process. The serum is applied before bed and washed off in the morning. Estée Lauder s iconic original Advanced Night Repair has been one of the best selling anti ageing products for the past 25 years and one of the first products to harness the fact that the skin repairs itself at night. The Daily Mail s Beauty Editor Elsa McAlonan was one of the first industry experts to try the 48 serum ahead of it going on sale next week, she said The product is supposed to slow down the look of premature ageing, dramatically reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improve the appearance of radiance and evenness. In tests, 83 per cent of women felt their skin looked healthier, and found it gave them a fresher, more rested look. Don t expect to look ten years younger after one night, but you should see a difference after a week.
David Cameron has branded Islamic State terrorists who killed British aid worker Alan Henning brutal and repulsive as the Prime Minister led a wave of global revulsion over the murder. He vowed to hunt down and bring to justice the man who wielded the knife, who has become known as Jihadi John as Barack Obama, Nick Clegg and Muslim leaders all spoke of their disgust. Mr Henning, 47, a father of two, was filmed being murdered in a video posted on the internet three weeks after he was last paraded in front of a camera. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has branded the Islamic State brutal and repulsive tonight after British aid worker Alan Henning was filmed being beheaded by the terrorist dubbed Jihadi John . In a strongly worded statement, Mr Cameron said We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice. He added My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan s wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him. Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need. The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ISIL terrorists. David Cameron received a security briefing this morning before calling the slaying of Alan Henning completely unforgivable Aid worker Alan Henning, 44, a father of two, was kidnapped by Islamist rebels on Boxing Day last year . This morning, Downing Street revealed that Mr Cameron was meeting with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Later this morning, he called the slaying completely unforgivable adding that there was no level of depravity to which they will not sink . No appeals made any difference, Mr Cameron told Sky News. The murder of Alan Henning is absolutely abhorrent, it is senseless, it is completely unforgivable.
Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is, and barbaric it is, he said of IS. When asked whether he believed the extremists would kill more of their Western hostages, Cameron suggested the only way to stop them was through military action. The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did, shows what we are dealing with, he said. Nick Clegg took to Twitter to praise Mr Henning, saying he worked to selflessly help those in need This is going to be our struggle now. ... We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it. We must find those responsible. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg praised Mr Henning on Twitter, saying Sincere condolences to Alan Henning s family. Barbaric actions of ISIL are held in complete contempt. We are resolved to defeat this evil. Alan Henning was a man moved to selflessly help those most in need and we should remember that above all else at this difficult time. Labour leader Ed Miliband said The murder of Alan Henning by ISIL is appalling and barbaric. He was an aid worker, helping those in need. Those who killed him have revealed only their lack of humanity and brutality. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his wife Barbara, his children and all those who knew him. We will do everything we can to support the efforts of the Government to bring those guilty of this terrible act to justice. U.S. President Barack Obama said The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL. Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family, and for the people of the United Kingdom.
Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan s murder as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines to justice. Standing together with a broad coalition of allies and parteners, we will continue taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The American ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun said this morning Today, we stand with the UK in joint determination, resolve and commitment to achieve justice for Alan Henning. Imams had joined forces before Mr Henning s execution to appeal to the terrorists to release the former taxi driver from Salford, who left his job to travel to Syria to take help to victims of its civil war. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning a British hero. His barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world, Shafiq said. Dr Shuja Shafi, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said This reported murder is a despicable and offensive act, coming as it does on the eve of the Muslim festival of Eid Al Adha. It is quite clear that the murderers of Alan Henning have no regard for Islam, or for the Muslims around the world who pleaded for his life. Barack Obama condemned the killing, and reiterated his promise to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS . Alan was a friend of Muslims, and he will be mourned by Muslims. In this period of Hajj and this festival of Eid, Muslims remember the mercy of God and the emphasis God places on human life. Alan Henning s murderers have clearly gone against that spirit of Islam. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
Hanif Qadir, founder of Active Change Foundation the organisation behind the Notinmyname campaign said The fact that they have chosen to commit this barbaric act on the eve of the Eid al adha, a global expression of forgiveness and mercy among Muslims, only demonstrates the extent of the evil and barbaric nature of these criminals. They have not shown any ounce of mercy or compassion and are therefore totally against Islam and are hell bent on killing innocent individuals and must be stopped. As a British Muslim I urge every other Muslim in the UK to stand up and refute these terrorists and distance themselves from this brutality and false Islam. In footage released on social media, Mr Henning is shown being beheaded by Jihadi John, the Islamist fighter who was also behind the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines. Former Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman in the Cabinet, tweeted her condolences, saying the Mr Hennning was the true martyr. Liberal Democrat party president Tim Farron said Alan Henning should be remembered for what he was a kind hearted, selfless man who wanted to help others. My prayers are with his family. Inspire, an anti extremist campaign group of British Muslim women, described Mr Henning s death as an affront to all Muslims across the world . Co director Sara Khan expressed her heartfelt condolences to the family of the aid worker, who she described as an amazing man, a man of courage, a man of dignity, a man of integrity . She said The only thing that the killing of Alan has achieved is greater revulsion for ISIS and the fact that more people from across our world, within our communities, Muslims and non Muslims alike, are united in their stance against their barbarity and inhumanity. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Alan Henning pictured a British hero.
The murder of Alan Henning is a brutal and criminal act of terror that is an affront to all Muslims across the world. Former head of the Army, General The Lord Dannatt said the deaths of hostages were sadly part of the harsh price to be paid in confronting the abomination of IS. Our Government is now standing up to its responsibilities and part of the harsh price, while this takes time, is that sadly if they have hostages in their hands, these atrocious things seem to be happening and seem to be going to continue to happen, he told BBC Radio 4 s Today. He renewed his call for the UK to extend military operations to Syria, where the US and other allies are conducting air strikes, saying this country was practically not doing enough . Dealing with half a problem is not going to solve the problem, he said. If the Americans have found a way to be able to do this then actually we should be doing it. This morning, Mr Cameron met with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Afterwards, a Downing Street statement said the Prime Minister had raised a second video showing a British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message and that police were investigating urgently for possible terrorism offences relating to it. A second video, published by Islamic State last night, shows an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. The fighter is believed to be a former Morrisons security guard who flew to Syria . It comes after footage emerged last night of an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. In a rant directed at that despicable swine David Cameron , the unmasked jihadi said Send them all, send your reserves and your backup and we ll send them back one by one in coffins. It is understood the jihadist in the video is former supermarket security guard Omar Hussain.
The 27 year old from High Wycombe previously worked for Morrisons as a security guard. He lived with his mother and brothers before travelling to Syria in January 2014. The Downing Street statement said The PM was clear that we must keep doing all we can to ensure that these terrorists are found and brought to justice for their heinous crimes and we will keep working with our US partners and those in the region to do this. ISIL s brutality will not persuade us to change our approach. Indeed, the senseless murder of an innocent man only reinforces our resolve to defeat this terrorist organisation and to eradicate the threat they pose to Britons whether those in the region or here on the streets of the UK. At the meeting, the Prime Minister also raised a second video released last night which shows an apparent British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message. The police are urgently investigating the contents of the video, including possible terrorism offences relating to it.
CNN The age of the virtual assistant is here to stay with Microsoft adding the voice of Cortana to its Windows Phone 8.1. I m old enough to remember the days when certain computing tasks required a steep learning curve. Now it seems almost magical that I can tell my virtual assistant to remind me to take out the garbage when I get home or call my mom when I get busy. The best part is that when it speaks to me, it does so in a way that allows me to believe, for a brief moment, that I m interacting with another person. That s because these virtual assistants sound so human. For the creators of artificial intelligent systems, it s critical to build them so that they can facilitate emotional connection with users. When machine interactions with humans feel effortless, natural and real, that s the ultimate metric of success. We re just getting started. Today s artificial intelligence systems are just scratching the surface of what s possible for personal assistants, advisors and maybe, in some cases, true companions. Indeed, the machine human relationship in the movie Her may not seem so far fetched in the decades to come. Future virtual assistants will offer far more capabilities and can be personalized for each person. Why should we settle for the voice that companies choose for us We ve known for quite some time that typically female voices are preferred, based on their ability to be heard in a clear manner across a broad range of devices. Of course, female voices also tend to be trusted more than male voices. However, if there is one request heard over and over again, it s for more and varied choices in the persona of these virtual assistants, along with greater control over their spoken voice. Creating text to speech, or TTS, can be a difficult task. The more human the system needs to sound the more data needs to be collected. Often times this requires massive amounts of linguistic and acoustic information, based on recordings of real humans. Fortunately, the technology is rapidly evolving.
Future modeling techniques, where TTS voices are made from mathematical models of its human counterparts, will be lifelike enough to simulate human speech. They will also allow more rapid voice creation, allowing a previously unachievable level of personalization, where each person could even pick his or her unique voice for a virtual assistant. Modeling technology will also make possible the combination of different voice traits. For example, the deep qualities of a voice similar to James Earl Jones could be combined with the unorthodox speaking style of someone like Jack Nicholson. Microsoft took a page from the gaming world by basing Cortana on the character from the Halo video game series. Perhaps future voices in our devices will be as readily available to manipulate to create a cacophony of recognizable personal assistants from favorite film and TV actors, radio hosts, family members, comedians the sky would be the limit. Whether it s a character from our favorite game or movie, or a persona created by users themselves, we could allow our virtual assistants the freedom to keep us entertained as well as informed. While there is a fine line between personalization and novelty, I see us on a collision course for having more intelligent conversations with our digital assistants in the years ahead. The gadget oriented systems of today will continue to grow and adapt to our ever expanding needs, and the more they learn about us, the more they can assist us. When looking at the challenges facing humanity, whether it s eradicating disease, solving our planet s renewable energy needs, or even colonizing other worlds, it s worth pondering if it will be the humans or the intelligence systems that we create that will tackle these problems. And will we be listening if it s the virtual assistants that are doing the work
The International Ski Federation FIS imposed the punishment after ruling she helped to manipulate results to ensure her place at the Sochi Olympics. Mae, who represented Thailand, and five officials were punished after an investigation into four Slovenian races which took place before the January qualification deadline for the Games. The Court of Arbitration for Sport will now consider the appeal. The Singapore born British violinist competed for her father s nation at the Sochi Winter Olympics and under his surname Vanakorn . She finished 67th and last in the Giant Slalom more than 50 seconds slower than Slovenian race winner Tina Maze and 11 seconds behind the 66th competitor. A CAS statement said The Court of Arbitration for Sport has received two appeals from Ms Vanessa Vanakorn, filed against the decisions taken by the Hearing Panel of the International Ski, in relation to her qualification for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games. Last month Mae told BBC Sport that her ban was nonsensical .
The blast targeted a vehicle carrying members of the Central Reserve Police Force in the Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh state, reports said. Officials say the death toll is likely to increase. The Maoists say they are fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor. Their insurgency began in the eastern state of West Bengal in the late 1960s, spreading to more than one third of India s 600 plus administrative districts. Chhattisgarh is often hit by Maoist violence. Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh described India s Maoist insurgency as its greatest internal security challenge . Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen. But hit and run attacks are still common, killing hundreds of people every year.
BAGHDAD, Iraq CNN Thousands of people marched in central Baghdad on Saturday to protest a proposed U.S. Iraqi security agreement that would extend the presence of U.S. troops in the country after the end of the year. Thousands staged a mass march through Baghdad, Iraq, on Saturday to protest a planned U.S. Iraq security deal. The political party of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al Sadr called for the rally. At one point, several speakers at a podium addressed the mass of people, urging the Iraqi government to reject the proposal. End the U.S. occupation of Iraq one speaker shouted in English. Hazem al Araji, a senior al Sadr aide, told protesters their voices would be heard in America. Thanks to you, to these voices and the millions of voices, George Bush will hear these millions of calls in his Black House in which you shouted out, No, no, America he said. Watch protesters wave flags, swarm street . This talk and these words are that of the leader, Muqtada al Sadr Baghdad is free, free America, get out. This voice does not reach the Green Zone. We want to hear everyone who is occupied in that area saying Baghdad is free, free, America get out al Araji exclaimed. Protesters clogged several streets in the capital, waving Iraqi flags and kicking up dust. The demonstration, the largest in Baghdad in several months, was largely peaceful. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in Washington on Thursday a draft status of forces agreement authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had been agreed upon by U.S. and Iraqi negotiators and was being reviewed by the two governments.
A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31, and U.S. officials are examining contingencies in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status of forces deal to the country s various factions, a senior Bush administration official said this week. The same official said negotiations on the pact had finished and the text was final. The official said the final draft calls for U.S. troops to be out of Iraqi cities by June 2009 and out of Iraq by the end of 2011 unless the Iraqis ask the United States to stay. The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said negotiators had also reached a compromise on the issue of U.S. troops remaining immune from Iraqi law an issue that was a major hurdle in the talks. Baghdad has sought the power to arrest and try Americans accused of crimes not related to official military operations, plus jurisdiction over troops and contractors who commit grave mistakes in the course of their duties. The United States has insisted its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law. CNN State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.
China s stated budget for this year was 120bn Â 70bn , but the US report said the actual figure was closer to 145bn. The US called on China to be more open about its plans, amid high tension with other regional powers over disputed islands in the South China Sea. China often accused the US of hypocrisy as their budget dwarfs Beijing s. The American military budget was about 600bn in 2013. The annual US report on China s defences usually gives a rough estimate of spending, with last year s quoting a figure of between 135bn and 215bn. But officials say this year they have a much better understanding of the way China operates. The Pentagon said Beijing was spending money on upgrading its arsenal of drones, warships, jets, missiles and cyber weapons. Beijing s main focus, it said, was still on a potential confrontation in the Taiwan Strait. But it was also increasingly focusing on the territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. China claims islands and rocky outcrops throughout the seas that are also claimed by countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan. The US said China s lack of openness caused serious concern for other nations in the region. Absent greater transparency from China and a change in its behaviour, these concerns will likely intensify as Chinese military modernisation programme progresses, the report said. Beijing has not so far responded to the criticism.
By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED . 12 09 EST, 4 December 2013 . . UPDATED . 18 28 EST, 4 December 2013 . A paranoid schizophrenic who killed his flatmate and cut off his head was today jailed for life. Karl Addo, who was suffering from delusions of persecution, will serve at least six and half years for killing Sergio Marquez but may never be released from Broadmoor Hospital because he is so ill. The 30 year old killer had suffered years of mental illness which led to the extreme complex that he was being assaulted by gangs with special powers and been injected with drugs. Jailed Karl Addo left , who was suffering from delusions of persecution, will serve at least six and half years for killing Sergio Marquez right but may never be released from Broadmoor Hospital because he is so ill . Addo who is now being held at the high security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, West Berkshire believed Spanish waiter Mr Marquez was part of a gang and that he wanted to kill and torture him. Fearing for his life, Addo snapped on the day he had been told to leave the flat in Bournemouth, Dorset, and brutally killed 23 year old Mr Marquez. He hit him with a cleaver and stabbed him in what was a prolonged horrific and very violent attack and his body was terribly mutilated, Nigel Pascoe QC, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court. Several doctors assessed Addo as being profoundly mentally ill and borderline insane. He mutilated the body of Mr Marquez to stop him recovering from his injuries, the court heard. Sentencing Addo, a judge told him it was common ground he was dangerous. He said Addo would serve the minimum term but also imposed an indefinite restriction under the Mental Health Act. The result of the sentence I have imposed is that the public now has the double protection provided by the Mental Health Act and the involvement of the parole board, Mr Justice Burnett said.
Family Sergio Marquez with his mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres, who said her son was a kind, good hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him You will be detained for at least six and half years but will not be released unless the relevant authorities conclude that is it safe to do so. Praise Sergio Marquez was a bright 23 year old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth Given all that I have heard, you must recognise that there is a real possibility that such a conclusion will never be reached. Engineering graduate Addo, who was born in Britain but had also lived in the US, absconded from the Huntley Mental Health Centre in Central London where he was a voluntary patient the day before a mental health tribunal in October 2011 decided he should be sectioned. Addo then disappeared from mental health services before he moved to Bournemouth in May 2012. He killed Mr Marquez, a hotel waiter, on July 17 last year nine months later, the court previously heard. The headless body of Mr Marquez, which had also been eviscerated, was found by other flat mates who ran screaming from the flat. Police officers arrested Addo nearby covered in blood, the court was told. He had fled the flat when the others had returned. Flatmates told police that Addo had been acting strangely, that he used to steal food from them and had used book pages as toilet paper. He had not paid his rent and had been told to leave by the landlord, the court heard. Mr Marquez had sent a note about his anti social behaviour and Addo resented it, the court heard. The victim had tried to defend himself from the attack but was cornered in a room. A neighbour heard some of the attack and Mr Marquez saying please Karl, please Karl , furniture being dragged around and then Addo laugh, Mr Pascoe said.
Reaction Residents are talked to by police near the scene of Mr Marquez s death in Bournemouth in July 2012 . He was decapitated and disemboweled after he died, the court was told. Addo, of no fixed abode, pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday but guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility. The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family Mr Justice Burnett . The prosecution said the plea was acceptable because Addo had been severely mentally ill when he killed Mr Marquez, who lived in Coin near Malaga in Spain and had come to England to find work. The judge paid tribute to Mr Marquez. He was a bright 23 year old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth. In particular, he wished to improve his English and so his general prospects, not least because of the very difficult economic position in Spain in recent years. Emotional Maria Carmen Marquez Torres right poses with her partner Francisco Segado Ramos following the death of her son Mr Marquez left The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family. Speaking after the case, Mr Marquez s mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres said Sergio was a kind, good hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him. I have lost my son and the world has lost a wonderful man. I believe that I have received justice for me and for Sergio. No sentence would ever be sufficient and nothing will ever compensate me for the loss of my son, but I find comfort in the fact that Mr Addo will not have his freedom for a long time and inflict this pain on any other family.
The universe as we know it may not be the only one in existence. In fact, it could be one of a number of parallel universes making up a multiverse. In this scenario, there could be multiple versions of you in different universes ones doing exactly the same thing, and others where your twin has made completely different life choices. It may be stretching the imagination, but theory has gained traction following the major discovery of gravitational waves on Monday. Scroll down for video... The discovery of these gravitational waves could solidify the idea that our young universe went through inflation. That theory is linked to the idea that the universe is constantly giving birth to different, parallel universes . Earlier this week, astronomers detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything is when the universe expanded very rapidly a theory called cosmic inflation. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space time known as gravitational waves . Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang, although the results have been called into question . Enlarge . This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . Astronomers announced on Monday that they ripples in the fabric of space time that are echoes of the massive expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. Predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago, the discovery of the ripples, called gravitational waves, would be a crowning achievement the understanding of how the universe began and evolved.
The multiverse theory is based on the fact that these gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. In some regions of physical reality inflation, continues and in others it stops. In the regions where it has stopped someone looking back on this time would see a bang the birth of their universe. The multiverse theory is based on the fact that these primordial gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. In most models, if you have inflation, then you have a multiverse, said Stanford physicist Andrei Linde speaking at a conference on Monday. Theorists argue that every kind of universe is out there in the aftermath of the Big Bang, from our familiar universe to universes that have completely different physical properties. When it comes to inflation, universes beyond our own come wrapped up as part of the package what we see as our universe is what remained after inflation ceased in this part of reality, Colin Stuart, author of The Big Questions in Science , told MailOnline. What s just been found is a smoking . gun for inflation the most concrete evidence we have to date that it . actually happened. So the multiverse is looking more likely than ever. Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves . The term multiverse was invented in December 1960, by Andy Nimmo, then vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society. It is based on the theory of eternal inflation, which suggests that shortly after the Big Bang that formed the universe, space time expanded at different rates in different places. According to eternal inflation theory, this gave rise to bubble universes that may function with their own separate laws of physics. The idea of other universes out there may seem strange, but scientists say it can help solve some problems of fundamental physics.
For instance, the long standing mystery of why nature appears to be fine tuned for the emergence of life can be explained by the picture of a multiverse. Some scientists argue that intelligent observers exist only in those rare areas in which the conditions happen to be just right for life to evolve. The rest of the multiverse remains barren, but no one is there to notice it. Another multiverse theory suggests that if space time goes on forever, it must start repeating at some point, because there are a . finite number of ways particles can be arranged. The multiverse theory could explain a number of processes that have stumped cosmologists for years. For example, there is the 1998 discovery that galaxies in our universe seem to be spreading apart at an accelerating rate. This goes against the rule that mutual gravitational attraction should be slowing them down. If there were multiverses, our universe may happen to be one in which the dark energy is relatively weak. It could also resolve the dilemma in superstring theory. At its most basic level, describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy. The string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions. Such a multiverse might even explain the very reason we exist at all, said Mr Stuart. The natural forces at work in our universe, like gravity, for example, seem strangely fined tuned for life. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes . Tinker with the settings of nature even slightly and that creates a universe devoid of stars, planets and people. How come all the settings are perfectly suited for living things It seems an extremely unlikely coincidence. However, if there really are a multitude of other universes out there, each with their own settings, at least one of them will have the right settings for life. Our existence moves from being highly improbable to inevitable.
In fact, if the number of other universes is infinite, there are an infinite number of copies of Earth out there, with an infinite number of copies of you, reading an infinite number of identical versions of this article. Last year, scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old . Last year, scientists said that they had found the first hard evidence that other universes exist. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes. The map shows radiation from the Big Bang 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe known as cosmic microwave radiation. Scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed, but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a cold spot that cannot be explained by current understanding of physics. Laura Mersini Houghton, theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina, said These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang. A multiverse could resolve the dilemma in superstring theory. At its most basic level, the theory describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy. But string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four .
We re used to seeing professional athletes putting fitness gear through its paces in adverts, but now a sports brand has turned to every day runners in their latest campaign. Adidas has released a new video showing women running around London and the joy the sport brings them. While they may never be as fast as elite athletes like Paula Radcliffe, they can still strive to be the best they can be and discover the beauty of scenery around them on their run. One of the real runners featured in the film is Sophie Christabel, 25, from Bow. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Why I run Sophie says she loves the sport because it clears her mind . A lawyer by day, the running enthusiast writes a fitness blog BePrettyFit.com in her spare time, telling readers about her top running tips, products and challenges. I run to clear my mind it s a great time to be alone and think. I also run as I like using my body and testing it s potential, she said.. I got into running at university initially to lose weight, but discovered so many other benefits to it once I had started and haven t stopped since. She added I love running in London and seeing so many famous landmarks when you re running it s very inspiring. I like seeing the architecture change as you run through different areas you can always find somewhere new. It s such an honour to represent every day female runners and to be part of something that will hopefully inspire other women to run in London too. It s not all about Olympians The blogger is one of the real runners Adidas have featured in their new campaign . The film shows London runners as they weave their way through the capital, taking in the sunrise over London Bridge, the urban scene of Hackney Wick and the bustling markets of Elephant Castle, as the singer s voiceover says This is my way, my city, and I will always find a way through.
As part of the campaign, Adidas has been encouraging runners to tweet pictures of themselves wearing their Boost trainers and revealing where their run has taken them with the hashtag fromwhereirun . Adidas latest campaign uses real runners over elite sport stars . Women are running in more numbers than ever before and Adidas wanted to create something that speaks directly to them .

Cash Hyde Foundation Video Cash Michael Hyde 2008 2012 When Cashy was 20 months old Radiologist s at Community Medical Center in Missoula, MT. Discovered a 4.5 cm. Stage 4 Brain Tumor in Cashy. He was transported on Life Flight to Primary Children s Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT. Cashy was placed on the 2nd floor NTU intensive care unit. Cashy went into emergency open brain surgery the following day to try and remove the tumor. The surgeon s only removed 10 of the tumor for biopsy because it had grown around his optic nerves. After the surgery Cashy lost his eyesight from the pressure of the tumor on his optic nerves. Oncologist s diagnosed Cashy with a Malignant and Aggressive Cancer classified as a PNET Brain Tumor. PNET s are part of the Blue Cell Cancer group that our aggressive and have a high fatality rate.
The Oncologist recommended that Cashy receive 3cycles of Chemotherapy followed by 3 cycles of High Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue. This protocol is aggressive and will take 6 to 8 months to complete. We were told that we needed to do the treatment at Primary Children s Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT and that Cashy would have to stay in the hospital for weeks at a time. We returned home to Missoula for 6 days to pack are basic belongings and prepare ourselves for the Battle of a Lifetime There are no words to describe watching chemotherapy take effect on someone you love. Chemotherapy kills cancer cells very aggressively unfortunately it kills healthy cells the same. If cancer has ever touched your life or the life of someone you know, I don t have to tell you how devastating it is. From the day Cashy s tumor was discovered he has marveled the medical profession and defied odds countless times. Cashy is considered a Miracle to thousands of people around the world and many Doctors and Nurses. Along the way Cashy regained his vision, survived seizures, and many PICU emergencies. There were many ups and downs along the way but each day Cashy would fight with a smile earning him the title THE BOY OF STEEL. Unfortunately on October 12 2011 the Hyde s were told that Cashy s brain tumor was back and that he must begin Proton Beam Radiation at the Loma Linda University in California. With radiation treatment Cash has a 30 chance of 5 year survival and risk of Leukemia Cancer, Blindness and severe Brain damage. In June 2012, we drove from Missoula, MT to San Francisco, CA so Mike could speak at the High Time Cannabis Cup. We also had a booth for the foundation to spread Cashy s story and pediatric cancer awareness.
It was also Cashy s fourth birthday and we had a blast going to the beach, the science museum, we drove through the Redwood forest and rode the gondola up the mountain to see some really huge trees While we were in San Francisco, we teamed up with United Patients Group and they donated helped assemble and sticker 10 reggae runners to children s hospitals in the bay area. During our trip to San Francisco, Cashy had started throwing up and acting more tired than usual. He continued to complain about a pain in his lower abdomen, sometimes he would scream it would hurt him so bad. We had several tests done to rule out different things it could have been radiation enteritis, tumors in his abdomen, blockage or constipation. He had CT scans done with barium enema studies, he had ultrasounds, lab tests, and all the tests came back negative. After two more weeks and his condition only worsening, we did what we feared the most and ordered an early brain MRI even though he had been cancer free at the end of May. July 27th, 2012 Cashy s MRI revealed a 2.7cm brain tumor in the same location as the previous two tumors. We were devastated but we re hopeful that we would be able to save him with a natural treatment plan using cannabis oil, the Gerson Therapy and other immune boosting remedies. We had exhausted our options with chemotherapy and radiation as he had went through and received all the heavy hitter chemo drugs and the top notch radiation therapy offered. We made the decision that we wouldn t put him through any of that ever again. No more brain scans, no more IV s, no more Ports, no more Central Lines, Lab tests or hearing and kidney tests and most importantly No More Pokes, as Cashy had asked. We honored his request even though we knew what the outcome would likely be. Cashy Fought hard for five more months, he never received one more poke, like we had promised.
He never set foot in the hospital ever again. Cashy passed away November 14th, 2012 in the arms of his daddy while wearing a pair of his favorite monkey pajamas. He forever changed our family and many lives of others who have followed his amazing journey. Cashy s legacy will live on for years and years to come. He will never be forgotten. Fundraisers Donations This Battle would not have been possible without the financial support we received from the fundraisers donations that were put together by family, friends and strangers all across Montana, and other States thanks to Cashy s Facebook friends. We were able to leave work for 9 months and concentrate on helping Cashy fight Cancer as a Family. We were able to be at the hospital 24hrs a day and Cashy never had to be alone. We are very thankful for all that everyone has done. Camp Cashy Since Salt Lake City is 500 miles from our home in Missoula we brought down the family camp trailer and camped out at Primary Children s Hospital for 9 months. We were very fortunate to have it considering some families sleep on the floor and in the waiting rooms. It was nice to get out of the hospital and take a break. We called it Camp Cashy and it was our piece of Montana in Utah. Big Brother Colten Big Brother Colten is the Rock of our family and played a great role in this battle. Colten can make anyone smile and loves flirting with nurses, so I guess you could say he was in his element at Primary Children s. Kalli and I would switch each day and one of us would take Colten and go swimming or just hang out. Colten made us keep our spirits up and stay positive. Doctors said 2 year old Cash Hyde would likely die after they found a stage 4 brain tumor surrounding his optic nerve just a year ago this week. And he nearly did.
After being subjected to seven different chemotherapy drugs, the little boy from Missoula, Montana suffered septic shock, a stroke and pulmonary hemorrhaging. Cash was so sick he went 40 days without eating. His organs were threatening to shut down. His father, Mike Hyde, intervened, slipping cannabis oil into his son s feeding tube. In Montana, medical marijuana is legal. Hyde had used it himself to treat his attention deficit disorder. When Cash was diagnosed in May 2010, Mike got him a marijuana card and purchased the drug from his own supplier. Cash, now 3, made a miraculous recovery at Primary Children s Hospital in Salt Lake City, but his father s bold action taken behind doctors backs has raised serious questions about a parent s role in medical treatment. Hyde said he believes it was the marijuana oil that helped Cash eat again and that the drug illegal in most states, including Utah, can cure cancer. Not only was it helpful, Hyde, 27, told ABCNews.com. It was a godsend. Dr. Linda Granowetter, a professor of pediatrics at New York University and chief of the Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, told ABCNews.com that Hyde s intervention was fascinating but somewhat bothersome. Granowetter said she agrees that cannabis the chemical form, THC can be found in the prescription drug Marinol is effective in treating adult nausea that accompanies chemotherapy. But there have been no clinical trials in children. Its virtue is we know exactly what you are getting and how much, she said. I think that the fact that he didn t have the rapport and ability to be honest with the doctor is very troubling. Care is impeded when there is not complete trust. Hyde, who quit his job as a car salesman when Cash was diagnosed with cancer, said he was afraid Cash s doctor might take the marijuana away. When you are told your kid has cancer, whoa, said Hyde, 27.
Then they tell me they have to do aggressive chemo and he s probably not going to make it. It s a lot to take on. He had read claims by researchers online about cannabis s properties It s one of the best nausea and pain medications on the market, he said. Because there are no pediatric oncology facilities in rural Montana, where Cash s tumor was discovered in a CT scan at the local emergency room, he was rushed to Salt Lake City, the nearest treatment center. He was given the highest possible doses of chemotherapy for two months. He lost his appetite and threw up eight to 10 times a day. When he started the chemo, he was so sick, said Hyde. For the first six weeks, he was blind. But his tumor was shrinking It s the nastiest thing to see someone you love go through this. Doctors had inserted a gastric feeding tube to administer cancer fighting drugs and to help with his nutrition, but when August came the family experienced another medical rollercoaster ride, according to Hyde. The G tube burned out the inside of his stomach, said Hyde. He didn t even have the will to eat. By September, Cash had stopped eating for 40 days. He was suffering terribly, and the doctors said it was the best they could do for him, said Hyde, who asked doctors to stop the chemotherapy drugs. Instead, Hyde boiled up marijuana he had purchased in Montana with olive oil and measured 3 mm. doses that he poured into his son s G tube twice a day. Because it was illegal to use medical marijuana in Utah, Hyde never told his doctors. Cash Hyde Makes Miracle Recovery In two weeks he was weaned of all the nausea drugs, and he was eating again and sitting up in and laughing, according to Hyde, who said doctors called his son s recovery a miracle. NYU s Granowetter said cannabis certainly can increase appetite and improve mood...but the idea that it can cure cancer is ludicrous.
She said the drug is most effective in teens who have previously used marijuana. In young adults or children who have not had it before, it can make them paranoid. It s awfully hard to gauge if a child would have a bad reaction, according to Granowetter, who said she would welcome clinical trials on children. We know from research that 30 to 60 percent of parents with children are giving them alternative meds like vitamins, shark tooth and herbs from Chinatown, she said. That s why we spend a lot of time asking parents what else they are giving kids and trying to be non judgmental and work with them and guide them. She said most pediatric oncologists are open minded about alternative treatments. Mike Hyde said he did eventually tell the Utah doctors, who were surprised by how Cash bounced back with no permanent organ damage. They say the boy has a 50 to 80 percent chance that the cancer will come back, according to Hyde, who has since started a foundation to help children with cancer. We were told I was one of the best dads, said Hyde, who lived with his wife and their other 6 year old son in a camper in a parking lot for the nine months of treatment. Every encounter in Salt Lake City, we were positive and never quit fighting. I was told he was going to die, but I knew he hadn t stopped the fight.

The actor said he was thrilled to be asked to portray Tommy Butler in The Great Train Robbery A Copper s Tale. The drama will follow A Robber s Tale, which will view the heist from the perspective of its perpetrators. Luke Evans will star in that film as Bruce Reynolds, the raid s key planner. Broadbent said it would be great fun to play Butler, a fascinating copper of the old school , in the drama, to air later this year. I have such strong memories of the massive impact of the actual robbery and it is wonderful to find out from the script so much of the real story. Chris Chibnall, executive producer and writer of the Great Train Robbery dramas, said Broadbent was a dream piece of casting . The actor won an Oscar in 2001 for playing the husband of writer Iris Murdoch in Iris and a Bafta in 2007 for playing the campaigner Lord Longford. Butler, whose astuteness earned him the nickname Grey Fox , led the investigation into the Great Train Robbery which resulted in several of the robbers receiving lengthy sentences. He retired in 1969 and died the following year at the age of 57.
MOSCOW AP A Russian reconnaissance aircraft was brought down by a Syrian missile over the Mediterranean early Tuesday, killing all 15 people on board, the Russian defense ministry said. It blamed Israel for the crash, saying the plane was caught in the crossfire as four Israeli fighters attacked targets in northwestern Syria. The Russian military said the Il 20 reconnaissance aircraft was hit 35 kilometers 22 miles off the coast as it was returning to its home base nearby. The Israeli pilots were using the Russian aircraft as a shield and pushed it into the line of fire of the Syrian defense, Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. Russia said it would make an appropriate response to Israel. The military said Israel did not warn it of its operation over Latakia province until one minute before the strike, which did not give the Russian plane enough time to escape. A recovery operation in the Mediterranean Sea is underway, Konashenkov said. For several years, Israel and Russia have maintained a special hotline to prevent their air forces from clashing in the skies over Syria. Israeli military officials have previously praised its effectiveness. Russia has been a key backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad and it has two military bases in the country, including one close to the Mediterranean coast. The Israeli military said earlier on Tuesday that it had no reaction, saying it does not comment on foreign reports. Syrian air defenses inadvertently shot down a Russian surveillance plane over the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Moscow has said, blaming what it called reckless actions by Israel that led to the deaths of 15 Russian servicemen. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on September 18 that Israeli pilots conducting attacks on targets in Syria used the Russian plane as a cover, exposing it to fire from Syrian air defenses. The blame for the downed Russian plane and the death of the crew lies fully with the Israeli side, Shoigu told his Israeli counterpart, Avigdor Lieberman, in a phone call, the ministry said in a statement.
The Russian Defense Ministry, through various channels of coordination, has repeatedly called on the Israeli side to refrain from strikes on Syrian territory that create a threat to the safety of Russian servicemen, Shoigu added, according to the statement. The Israeli military rejected the accusation, saying Syrian President Bashar al Assad s forces were to blame. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, refrained from directly accusing Israel of responsibility for the incident while speaking alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban following their talks in Moscow. He said the plane was downed following a chain of tragic accidental circumstances. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said earlier in the day that Moscow could take commensurate measures in response to the irresponsible actions of the Israeli military. Putin said Russia s response would be focused on the security of Russian personnel in Syria. These will be steps that everyone notices, he said, calling the deaths of the servicemen a tragedy for everyone, for the country, for the loved ones of our fallen comrades. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow for the death of the Russian soldiers, his office said in a statement on September 18. Netanyahu told Putin during a phone call that Syria bears responsibility for the downing of the jet. He also noted that Israel is determined to block Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria and transferring weapons to its proxy Hizballah militia for use against Israel, the statement said. State run Russian news agency RIA Novosti said that the Israeli ambassador to Moscow had been summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on September 18. The accusation against Israel came hours after the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Ilyushin Il 20 aircraft went off radar 35 kilometers from the Syrian coast at about 11 p.m. local time the previous day. The Ilyushin disappeared from radar at around the same time that Israeli F 16 fighters attacked Syrian facilities in Latakia Province, the ministry said.
It said the plane was returning to Hmeimim air base in the northwestern Syrian province of Latakia, where the bulk of Russia s armed forces in the country are stationed. Hmeimim is Russia s main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria. Fragments of the plane were found 27 kilometers west of the city of Banias, Russian authorities said, adding that some remains of the crew had been recovered as well. In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Russian warplane was likely shot down by the Syrian regime. It sounds to me and it seems to me based on a review of the facts that Syria shot down a Russian plane. And I understand about 14 people were killed and that s a very sad thing but that s what happens, Trump said at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was an unfortunate incident and a reminder that a political resolution to the conflict was needed. Yesterday s unfortunate incident reminds us of the need to find permanent, peaceful, and political resolutions to the many overlapping conflicts in the region and the danger of tragic miscalculation in Syria s crowded theater of operations, Pompeo said in a statement on September 18. Russia has given Syrian President Bashar al Assad crucial support throughout the Syrian conflict, which began with a government crackdown on protesters in March 2011. Several countries are conducting military operations in Syria, in some cases supporting opposite sides in the conflict. Communication lines have been set up between countries to mitigate the risk of unintended military confrontation in Syria. Russia and Israel have largely maintained friendly relations in recent years, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited Putin in Moscow several times to discuss the Syria conflict. Israel is not backing a specific side in the Syria conflict, though it has admitted to conducting air strikes in the country targeting Iran and its allies, including Hizballah.
These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it, it said. Before announcing its plane was shot down by Syrian forces, Russia had said rocket launches were detected from the French frigate Auvergne nearby around that time, though the French military denied any involvement. Israel claimed that its jets were already inside Israeli air space when Syrian forces launched the missiles that struck the Russian aircraft. Konashenkov said the plane was downed by Syria using an S 200 air defense system that Russia had provided. Earlier, the official Syrian news agency SANA reported that missiles were fired at several locations in Latakia Province late on September 17. State media said the explosions were suspected to have been caused by Israeli strikes. With reporting by Interfax, Reuters, AP, RIA Novosti, TASS, AFP, and the BBC
Could you give up the internet for Lent or even for good Following various reports about companies stealing information and complaints about oversharing on social media, a web hosting firm has created a nine step guide on how to disappear from the web completely. It includes deactivating accounts, removing links from search results and how to remove yourself from various lists and for people who d rather just stay hidden than disappear, the guide also gives tips on how to use the internet anonymously. The infographic, pictured, from London based WhoIsHostingThis, details the nine steps needed to remove yourself from the web. It includes deactivating accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google . 1. Close your Facebook, Twitter, Google and LinkedIn accounts. 2. Search for yourself online and close any accounts you d forgotten about. 3. Falsify information on accounts that can t be closed or deleted. 4. Unsubscribe from mailing lists. 5. Delete search engine results. 6. Contact websites directly and ask them to remove details about yourself. 7. Ask data clearing houses companies that collect and sell data to other firms to remove your records. 8. Ask to be unlisted in phone books and online directories. 9. Delete your email accounts. Social media has made everyone s life an open book one that s open a bit too far in some cases. For people concerned about their personal information potentially costing them jobs and relationships, the decision to pull the plug is an increasingly attractive one, said London based WhoIsHostingThis WIHT . While it might seem impossible to keep your private life private, the truth is you can disappear online with a little effort and dedication. There are a number of sites that can help users delete their information, such as DeleteMe and JustDelete.me. However, for people who want to do the job manually, WhoIsHostingThis infographic details the nine steps needed to disappear from online completely.
The first step involves deactivating primary accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and LinkedIn. WIHT s infographic gives step by step instructions for each account. In the second stage, WIHT recommends users search for themselves, pictured. This will reveal which sites a user has signed up for in the past, but no longer uses such as a MySpace. Search engines can help people track down their old web activity . The third step in WIHT s nine step plan involves uploading false information into the accounts that can t be deleted, including fake names and locations, pictured. This has the double benefit of removing traces of the user, but also letting the user continue to use the web under an alter ego . In the second stage, WIHT recommends users search for themselves online. This reveals which sites a user has signed up for in the past, but no longer uses, such as a MySpace. The third step in WIHT s nine step plan involves uploading false information into the accounts that can t be deleted, including fake names and locations. Step four involves unsubscribing from mailing lists using emails in an inbox and junk folder as a starting point. Step four involves unsubscribing from mailing lists that send emails to an inbox, or junk folder, pictured . The final two steps involve contacting phone companies and online directories, and asking to be made unlisted before deleting every email address, pictured . If, while searching from their name on Google, users find various links that include information about them, they can ask the search engine to remove them. Google has a URL removal tool, for example. However, Google is not obliged to remove links especially if the website is owned or hosted by another company. In this instance, WIHT recommends contacting the website directly and asking them to remove any references. There are also services, known as data clearing houses, that collect information from sites to sell to advertisers, for example.
WIHT admits this is one of the most difficult places to remove data from but suggests being persistent with phone calls and letters. The WIHT infographic also details tips on how to keep on top of online data, and how to browse anonymously using DuckDuckGo . The final two steps involve contacting phone companies and online directories, and asking to be made unlisted before deleting every email address. In order to maintain your new found anonymity, you must master reputation management, learn to use dummy accounts, and take advantage of anonymous searching on sites such as Duck Duck Go, explained WIHT. Disappearing from the internet isn t for everyone. But if you re serious about your privacy, your security, and your reputation, taking the time to make yourself invisible online is worth the time and trouble.
Couldn t stay away Michael Bloomberg will return to lead the company he founded in 1981 . Michael Bloomberg . will return as head of Bloomberg LP after the outgoing president became frustrated with the former mayor s increasing presence at the office, according to a report. Bloomberg will replace Daniel Doctoroff, the company said Wednesday, despite the widely held expectation that he intended to dedicate his life to philanthropy after leaving office just months ago. The life of leisure, it seems, is not for Bloomberg. The New York Times reports that Bloomberg has become an increasing presence at the office, leaving Doctoroff frustrated with how the leadership dynamic had shifted. The privately held company, in which Bloomberg is the . majority shareholder, said Doctoroff would step aside as . president and chief executive at year end. Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at more than 32 . billion, had expected to spend much of his time on philanthropic . efforts after leaving office in late 2013. Those efforts have . included fights for public health and gun control. This is a sad day for me and my company, Bloomberg said in . a statement. I really wanted Dan to stay and continue in his . leadership role. But I understand his decision. Bloomberg, who stepped down as New York mayor last December, . added he never intended to come back to Bloomberg LP after 12 . years as New York s mayor. However, the Times reports that the initial few hours a day he said he d spend at Bloomberg s Manhattan offices soon turned into six and seven hours everyday in which he d play an increasing role in decision making. Doctoroff told Bloomberg his intention to step down two weeks ago and refused his billionaire boss s invitation to stay. Still pals Though Bloomberg s right hand man Daniel Doctoroff is stepping down over frustrations with the power shift since the former mayor left office, the two remain friends. Here, they participate in the ice bucket challenge .
Moving on Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for anotheropportunity, but would focus more of his time on non profitactivities. He also accepted Bloomberg s invitation to join theboard of the Bloomberg Philanthropies . So why have I decided to leave now , Doctoroff said in thememo. Simply put, while Mike never intended to come back fulltime, after he left City Hall and started to get to know thecompany again, he rediscovered what an exciting and incredibleplace this is. So he naturally wanted to be more involved. Doctoroff became Bloomberg LP president in 2008 and CEO in . July 2011. During that period, the company s revenues increased . from 5.4 billion to more than 9 billion, he said in a memo to . the company s employees. Doctoroff, 56, a former New York deputy mayor, told the New . York Times that he informed Bloomberg two weeks ago that he . intended to resign. Bloomberg encouraged him to stay. This wasn t the plan, Bloomberg told the Times. It was . his idea. If it was up to me, he would have stayed. Bloomberg started the company in 1981, using a 10 million . severance package he received after he was laid off after . investment bank Salomon Brothers had been acquired. He had . headed equity trading at Salomon. During Doctoroff s tenure at the company, the numbers of . subscriptions for its terminals have grown from 273,000 to . 321,000, the company said in a statement. The company expanded . from providing financial information to markets for legal, . government and alternative energy information. Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for another . opportunity, but would focus more of his time on non profit . activities. He also accepted Bloomberg s invitation to join the . board of the Bloomberg Philanthropies, the former Mayor said in . the statement.

We need to get eight or nine guys who are consistently leaders, and we don t have that at the moment, Jones said. We need eight or nine to be a World Cup winning side, and that s what we are aiming to be. He added to BBC Radio 5 live I think it s a reality of the way society is every sport faces the same problems. Nowadays guys don t go to university, they don t go out and work, they are in more sheltered environments such as academies. And Jones says the England coaches are working to try to develop more figures who could potentially lead the side. We have a number of players now who have started individual leadership plans, Jones added. We will see those players develop over the next period of time. Having skippered England to an unbeaten year in 2016, hooker Dylan Hartley will again captain the side in the Six Nations fitness permitting with Jones highlighting playmaker Owen Farrell as a likely replacement should he be unavailable. Owen makes sure the standards are kept high, as does fly half George Ford, Jones said. Certainly if Dylan wasn t ready Owen could be a very strong candidate. Full Six Nations fixture list here
CNN The death of a 14 year old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in Venezuela and pockets of anti government protests erupt throughout the country. Kluibert Roa Nuñez, a high school student, was killed Tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of San Cristobal. A police officer fatally shot Kluibert, officials say. The government and the opposition alike have condemned the teen s killing, but Venezuela s recent history of violence and sharp political polarization hang over this shooting. Already protesters opposed to President Nicolas Maduro s government are pointing to the teen s death as a fresh rallying cry. And Maduro has blamed protesters for the violence that led to the shooting. A year ago, San Cristobal was the birthplace of anti government protests that spread nationwide. The standoffs between security forces and protesters lingered for weeks and became violent, with more than 40 deaths, according to the government. Three witnesses at Tuesday s protest said that Kluibert was not a protester and had inadvertently come across the confrontation after leaving school. Vivian Nuñez, the slain teen s mother, told CNN en Español her son was walking four blocks from his school when a riot broke out around him. The protesters mostly students from a nearby university were running from police at the moment that Kluibert walked into the area, according to the witnesses, who spoke with CNN en Español. The teen tried to protect himself by ducking under a car but suffered a direct shot from an officer s firearm, the witnesses said. CNN has not independently confirmed how the shooting unfolded. The governor of the state of Tachira, where San Cristobal is located, declined to comment on his government s version of events. The teen s death sparked several protests around the country Wednesday.
In Caracas, demonstrators outside the justice ministry held up notebooks smeared with red paint to symbolize the blood of the country s youth they say has been spilled. A bloody notebook. This is what we, the students, have ideas, protester Hilda Rubi said. We say to Mr. Nicolas Maduro, Are you afraid of the students These are our weapons a notebook, pens, thoughts and ideology. The Venezuelan government responded quickly to the killing, detaining and identifying the national police officer who shot the teen. The interior ministry named Javier Mora Ortiz, 23, as the shooter. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz announced Wednesday that Mora is formally charged with intentional homicide, and that nine protesters were also arrested in San Cristobal. Interior Minister Carmen Melendez, speaking on state television, vowed that the officer would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. She appealed for calm, asking students to remember the 43 deaths recorded in clashes last year. The police has been reformed since then, she said, calling the national police force a protector of human rights. This is an isolated incident that does not represent the behavior of the new, humanist police, Melendez said. To protesters, and to the family of the slain teen, these comments seem to be insincere, or outright lies. Erick Roa, the father of the slain teen, told CNN en Español s Fernando del Rincon that he wants the full weight of the law to be applied to the officer but is not comforted by the government s actions. The officer s quick confession might be part of a strategy to get a lenient sentence, Roa said. He is afraid the justice system will go easy on Mora because he is a police officer. This was a murder this was a homicide committed by this man, and he should pay with the full weight of the law, he said.
The father also questioned the government s claims of what kind of projectile killed his son. The interior minister said Mora shot Kluibert with a shotgun loaded with rubber pellets. Roa said that if the weapon was indeed a shotgun, it was loaded with lead pellets, not rubber. The coroner s report said that a firearm caused the fatal wound, without detailing whether it was rubber or lead pellets, the father said. The government also said that police provided first aid to the injured teen, something that witnesses deny. Roa pleaded for police to be guardians while on duty, saying he hopes another child won t become a victim. The fury over Tuesday s shooting echoes the arguments made by pro and anti government groups in the past. Maduro framed the boy s death around the actions of the protesters in San Cristobal. He described a group of hooded youths who were being violent, beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force. Critics of the government turned to one of their most powerful tools social media to accuse the security forces of abuses and to share photos they say back their allegations. Tweets were tagged with SOSVenezuela, PrayForVenezuela and MaduroAsesinoDeEstudiantes, literally accusing the President of killing students. Government supporters tweeted under the banner ApoyoRotundoAMaduro, or complete support for Maduro. All this turmoil comes during an economic crisis in oil rich Venezuela. Venezuelans have endured years of shortages of basic goods, products and services. Consumers have to stand in line for hours for staples such as milk, chicken and cornmeal.

By . Simon Jones . Sunderland have made further enquiries about Cardiff s Jordon Mutch and hope to agree terms with Fiorentina for Marcos Alonso despite interest from West Ham. Sunderland were reported to have agreed a 1.5million deal for the Bluebirds midfielder in June. The 22 year old was Cardiff s top goalscorer last season and was not keen to drop back down to the Championship. The club are looking to wrap up many deals early on, with Billy Jones and Jordi Gomez already signed. Top boyo Jordan Mutch was Cardiff s top scorer last season but wants to stay in the Premier League . The Black Cats had also mooted a swap deal for Alonso, who made 20 appearances at the Stadium of Light last season, with Modibo Diakite moving in the opposite direction. However, Fiorentina are more interested in a swap plus 2million cash after French defender Diakite spent part of the campaign on loan there. West Ham and Swansea have also shown interest in 23 year old defender Alonso, especially if the Hammers fail in their bid to land Nice left back Timothee Kolodziejczak. Staying on Marcos Alonso R made 20 appearances on loan with Sunderland last season .
A first ever success at the ABAX Stadium moved Uwe Rosler s men to within four points of second placed Bolton, who have a game in hand and face Oldham Athletic on Saturday. Fleetwood took command in a first half they dominated, former Peterborough man David Ball laying on a simple 24th minute opener for Bobby Grant before Ashley Eastham was left with a similarly easy finish three minutes from half time after fine work from George Glendon following a quickly taken corner. It took hosts Posh an hour to pose any sort of attacking threat on a day where their last mathematical hope of making the play offs disappeared. Craig Mackail Smith saw a penalty shout ignored after being clattered by Alex Cairns, but he fired past the Fleetwood keeper to halve his side s arrears in the 68th minute. Mackail Smith tapped home following a brilliant burst and low delivery from the left by Marcus Maddison. And the striker came closest to snatching a draw when heading a Michael Smith cross straight at Cairns with seven minutes to go. Match report supplied by the Press Association.

My time covering transport at BBC London has nearly mirrored his in office and so as he departs I thought it timely to put down some non definitive thoughts. Recently I asked Mr Johnson if he enjoyed dealing with the transport his answer was quick Of course, it s the best bit. But it has not been without its ups and downs and controversy. And while there have been flamboyant quotes remember the grit snow lasagne what has changed Over the last eight years, even his most fierce critics would acknowledge there has been huge investment in transport. Crossrail is due to open, the Tube upgrades have continued and the underground service seems better although overcrowding continues to be a problem. While the mayor seems reluctant to highlight Tube reliability as an achievement, according to Transport for London TfL figures, it has improved. There have been many bumps for example the Jubilee line upgrade which initially hit problems as the PPP contractor Tube Lines struggled, and weekend closures were extremely unpopular. The solution something else not mentioned very much was to kill off the PPP by buying the shares of Bechtel and Amey Ferrovial from Tube Lines for Â 310m. In effect it brought the upgrade back in house. There have also been run ins with the unions as huge changes were implemented on the Tube. Mr Johnson changed tack on ticket office closures which he initially opposed. He also tried to get through a Night Tube as yet there isn t an official start date. And he never sat down with the transport unions, preferring TfL bosses to do the talking. Elsewhere, the Overground has been a big success story as has the rise of contactless payments for example. Of course, TfL has only been able to do these projects as it based its business plan on increasing fares at inflation 1 . So this all came at a price for commuters, who were paying for future investment today with higher fares.
While sometimes you got the feeling some projects would probably have happened anyway the mayor s mission was selling the point that higher fares were needed for higher investment. Although towards the end of his eight years, it felt like fares were as high as they could go. And don t forget he relied on central government cash to increase them just in line with inflation. And there is the question if Mr Johnson was hard enough in driving through efficiencies at TfL. Could there have been more savings If there is a Boris Johnson legacy, then cycling infrastructure is probably it. Segregated cycle superhighways are now opening and there is political consensus to continue building them. The mayoral candidates do not want to be seen to be undoing the work done. In that sense, his legacy is as political as it is physical. But it was not a straight forward route. In the first term of Mr Johnson backed un segregated blue paint bike lanes which no one really liked. Cycle Superhighway 2 encouraged cyclists onto a dangerous junction at Bow roundabout. It encouraged cyclists but gave them no protection. The cycling lobby, The Times paper and many cycling bloggers demanded more. The turning point came in the mayoral election of 2012, when Mr Johnson changed his policy to segregated bike tracks and promised a cycling commissioner to drive them through. A horrendous number of deaths in 2013 also increased pressure on the mayor to act. He deployed traffic police onto the most dangerous junctions. Today, segregated bike tracks are opening. And the cycle hire scheme, which was meant to be at no cost to the taxpayer , will according to the London Assembly have cost Â 225m by 2016. And the construction of the cycle tracks have added to one of the big problems facing the next mayor congestion. Mr Johnson called it operation juddering climax . And there s no doubt congestion has got worse something the next mayor will need to tackle.
Again he switched policy from smoothing traffic flow of the first term and dismantling the Western Extension of the Congestion Charging Zone, to giving over road space to cyclists. Eventually that created a bikelash even though City Hall tried to point out congestion was being created by an increase in white vans, construction and the huge increase in private hire cars due to apps like Uber. While air quality has gone up the political agenda, it is still a huge problem with thousands of Londoners dying each year prematurely due to bad air. London experimented with dust suppressants and green walls but while City Hall says they are tackling pollution levels, they still breach EU limits. Clean air campaigners say that Boris Johnson has failed to get a grip on this problem and his plans for an ultra low emission zone are too far off. I have lost count of the number of outlandish ideas that have been mooted and then withered. Odd schemes like the tunnel under Hyde Park or a bike track on the side of rail tracks. Then you d hear an idea like a cable car over the Thames and they would actually deliver it. It is the most expensive urban cable car in the world and don t forget it s built with some regeneration money from the EU and TfL cash but at the moment it is essentially a tourist attraction. One day it might be a regeneration tool but the number of commuters using it is tiny. Could you lump in the New Routemasters in as an expensive vanity project Certainly the mayor s opponents never liked them and thought it would be better to buy hybrids off the shelf. Overseas sales never materialised and they have had all kinds of problems with hybrid engines and non opening windows. But when you speak to some Londoners there is a kind of begrudging affection for them and it was the use of the Routemaster as a political tool during the 2008 election that got Mr Johnson elected. And so they will always probably polarise opinion.
If there s one project that is the mayor s pet it is the Thames Estuary Airport. If there is such a thing as small talk with a mayor this is the area it will usually veer into. And it was his pet project from very early on in his first term. He took journalists out into the estuary to look at potential sites. He lobbied the Airports Commission, and then attacked it when it rejected his idea. It has been derided as a folly but it is probably the one transport project that is now wedded to his future career. This has been eight years of huge investment in London transport. I have lost count of the number of new infrastructure projects and tunnels I have seen funded in part through higher fares. There have been policy changes and switches in focus. And a mix of the pragmatic steady hand on the tiller and the more outlandish. But ultimately it will be commuters who ll judge Boris Johnson s eight years in charge of London s transport.

Tasered teen Bryce Masters isno longer in a medically induced coma and is speaking with family members . The Missouri police officer who used a stun gun on a 17 year old during a traffic stop says he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and saw him recording the incident on an iPhone. Bryce Masters has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at a hospital where he was taken Sunday after the Independence police officer used a Taser on him. A spokesman for Masters family says he went into cardiac arrest and was being treated for a lack of oxygen to his brain. According to a search warrant application, the officer smelled marijuana inside the car. Police said they later found drug paraphernalia. Police say Masters was pulled over because of a warrant attached to the license plate of the vehicle and was combative when ordered to get out. The Kansas City Star reports Masters began slowly recovering overnight Wednesday. Family attorney Daniel Haus characterized the recovery as a miracle. Masters family has said his heart stopped after he was shocked with the stun gun during a traffic stop on Sunday in Independence. Bryce suffered some memory loss and doctors do not yet know what the long term affects will be. Police say he was combative and wouldn t comply with the officer s demands. They say he was pulled over because of a warrant associated with the license plate on the car, which belonged to someone else. They are seeing some signals that their son may make a fairly remarkable recovery, basically coming back from the dead, Haus told the Kansas City Star. It looks like whatever the doctors did with this medically induced coma, this new procedure where they lower the body temperature, was exactly what he needed, Haus added. The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave.
An eyewitness filmed the incident on her cell phone. In the footage you can see the officer dragging the Bryce s body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen s back ringed Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun. Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own. The confrontation continued outside the car and both Bryce and Runnels fell to the ground. The teen then suffered a medical emergency and needed resuscitation, prompting a call for an ambulance, police said. But eyewitnesses gave a different account to Fox4KC. Michelle Baker filmed the incident on her mobile phone when she heard screams outside and says she saw the Runnels Taser the teen when he was inside his car. In a cell phone video taken by Baker you can see the officer dragging the teen s body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen s back. You could tell the kid was going into convulsions. He turned him over and his head was dangling like this and he had blood coming out, said Baker. Curtis Martes, 17, says the teen was coming over to play XBox with him. I hear him say from my porch he s like I can t roll down my window it s broke, said Martes. He was like what am I being arrested for The cop just grabbed him and said you re under arrest, said Martes. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. The footage, shot on Sunday, shows him walking up to the Bryce s body left and stepping over it right He is then pictured seen raising his foot as Master lies on the ground. He like threw him on the ground busted his face up.
He kept like nudging him with his foot, said Curtis Martes, 17, who watched the event unfold . He said the officer Tasered the teen then pulled him out of the car.

Several times, the cop put his foot on the kid like he was stepping on his neck, but it was on his back, said Robert Baker, who lives nearby told The Kansas City Star. I think the officer was wrong, because the kid tried to explain to him that his window won t roll down. The FBI s Kansas City office will investigate whether Runnels used excessive force, which falls under the bureau s civil rights program, the FBI said in a statement. Independence police pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Masters is the son of a Kansas City police officer. Bryce Masters with his mother. The family issued a statement Monday asking that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate the confrontation .

The family s attorney, Daniel J. Haus, said they would have no further comment until the federal investigation is complete.
But there are strict rules about their usage, which has led some to come up with innovative ways to fly such vehicles more safely. I m using a dog leash for a small dog, says roboticist Sergei Lupashin as he demonstrates a new kind of consumer friendly drone at the Ted Technology, Entertainment and Design conference in Vancouver. By tethering it, he hopes the Fotokite, as it is called, can avoid some of the issues faced by unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs , which are banned without a special licence because of safety and privacy concerns. It doesn t rely on GPS Global Positioning System , sophisticated machine vision, radio, it doesn t even use a compass. Most crashes today happen because of GPS, radio or piloting issues, says Dr Lupashin. Should something happen, the leash gives a robust fail safe the vehicle reduces thrust and it automatically comes back to the operator, he adds. The inspiration for the device came during street protests in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow, when he realised it could be an invaluable tool for reporting protests around the world. For journalists it is good to get that perspective, to show the scale of the event without adding to the tension, says Dr Lupashin. But he also sees potential for amateur and professional photographers, archaeologists, architects and even as a toy for children. His prototype device uses a shop bought quadrocopter with a basic action camera attached which, in turn, is connected to a standard dog lead. It can shoot both video and stills. Drones have long been associated with the military, but increasingly they are finding their way into civilian life, for a wide range of uses including delivering medicines in the developing world, for farming and as a low cost way of getting broadband to remote parts of the world something both Facebook and Google are actively pursuing. They are also useful tools for both professional and amateur photographers, providing the opportunity for a bird s eye view of people and places.
Aerial photography is a fascinating new application for small, unmanned vehicles but the remote controlled ones are very complex and can be difficult to use. They are also dangerous, says Dr Lupashin. The safety issue took centre stage last month when an Australian triathlete was injured by an aerial drone taking pictures of the race she was competing in. A drone on a lead is likely to be treated with far less suspicion, says Dr Lupashin. People treat you normally it is like a flying pet. It always has a physical connection to the operator, he says. The BBC, along with other news organisations, already uses drones for filming, but it is constantly looking to update its kit. Andy Armstrong, a consultant looking at emerging broadcast technologies, recently tested the Fotokite for the BBC. Its ease of use and portability makes it useful for journalists in the field, he says. Anyone who s walked a dog without losing it can operate Fotokite, he adds, although he notes that to get really stable shots you need almost completely still air . Its lack of anonymity could also be a problem though. There are certain scenarios where you wouldn t want to attract that much attention, he says. Jake Berger, a BBC programme manager, wanted a UAV that would be able to safely film aerial shots of the crowds at an open air theatre show. The fact that Fotokite was tethered flown on a retractable dog leash meant it was suitable, he says. Unfortunately, the British weather confounded us on the day of the performance it rained continuously for about six hours. This would have both blown the electronics on Fotokite and risked electrocution from lightning. Currently the use of commercial drones in the US is banned by the Federal Aviation Authority FAA . Anyone wishing to use one has to obtain a special licence. The question of whether a tethered drone would be exempt from this is unclear.
According to Ben Gielow, general counsel for the Association for Unmanned Vehicles Systems Internet, even a drone on a lead would be against the law. He says the FAA told one company that wanted to fly a tethered drone that until we have new regulations in place, the only path for you to fly your aircraft in the National Airspace System even tethered is to obtain the special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category . Others though, who are developing similar tethered drones, say they have been told by the FAA that such UAVs would be exempt from current guidelines. The reality is that, in the US at least, there are no clear rules yet about the use of UAVs, tethered or not. The FAA has been dragging its feet for four years and are now faced with an explosion of this technology. People can buy inexpensive, sophisticated systems off the internet and it doesn t have the resources to govern or control these unmanned aircraft, said Mr Gielow. There are guidelines governing the use of model aircraft in the US they must always be This led the FAA to ban Texas based search and rescue group EquuSearch from using a remote controlled plane to help search for missing people. In response the group has launched legal action challenging the validity of an FAA ban and similar cases are also going through the courts. Their frustration is that if they were using such an aircraft for fun it would be allowed but because they are using it for search and rescue it isn t, says Mr Gielow. The lack of clarity about the use of UAVs has led to anger among US manufacturers who fear being left behind by other countries, such as the UK, France and Israel, which have much clearer guidelines regarding drone use. The US Congress has given the FAA until 2015 to create such rules, and this month it opened its first test facility in North Dakota.
But, for the time being at least, it seems that much about the use of such unmanned flying vehicles remains up in the air.

He was attacked by Tareyton Williams as he stood on the platform at 110th Street and Broadway in the early hours of July 6, 2006. He has said he does not blame Williams for the attack. Instead, he holds Five Star Electric . Corp. responsible for failing to lock down the tools and for its staff . for not coming to help him during the bloody attack. Victim Michael Steinberg, pictured recovering in hospital after he was attacked by a saw wielding madman on a subway platform in 2006, has sobbed in court as the jury heard the details of the horror . I almost died, Steinberg told the New York Post outside the court. I don t want to live through this . again. It s just because they don t . want to reach a settlement of any kind. His lawyer, Ronald Landau, added There was nobody and nothing to prevent anybody crazy person, . sane person, thief, nonthief from walking over to those power tools . and just lifting them off. Landau added that Williams had been acting bizarrely before the attack, yelling and pacing. At court on Monday, the contractor s . attorney, Barbara Sheehan, said a worker was just two or three feet of . the tools, when Williams grabbed two saws and unleashed his attack. What we have is an unexpected, . unforeseeable action by somebody who did something that really none of .
us could really conceive of, Sheehan said. Locked up Tareyton Williams, pictured, apologized to Steinberg before he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The victim said he does not blame Williams rather the MTA contractor for leaving the tools unguarded . Weapon Police remove one of two sawzall saws from a garbage can after they were ditched Williams . Williams was sentenced to 18 years in . prison for the attack and, before he was locked up, he apologized to . his victim. Steinberg said he forgave him. Mr Steinberg said he must now take Valium pills before using the subway to calm him. On the night of the attack, Mr . Williams calmly walked towards the 4 foot 11 Mr Steinberg with the two . chainsaws and began cutting into his chest. The two power saws, called Sawzalls, sliced through his ribs and punctured his lung. The elderly New York native begged his attacker to stop carving, offering him cash and credit cards, but he ignored the pleas. Finally he stopped, said now I will take your credit cards and your money and walked calmly away. At the time, Mr Steinberg told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help. Scene The former postal worker was in the 110th and Broadway station on his way to work when he was attacked with the two saws, and he said contractors just stood back and failed to help him . I screamed for help. Please help Please help me The ... people construction workers heard me. They just looked. They never stopped to help me, and that disturbed me more than anything else. I begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me, he explained to the Post. Doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper, the postal worker would have been dead. Williams was arrested after punching a man walking his dog later that day and pleaded guilty to senseless assault.
Steinberg, who was forced to quit his job, said the Transit Authority or Five Star Electric Corp. have never apologized for allowing the near fatal attack to take place.
It may be a foregone conclusion in the minds of many that accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is guilty of murder. A horrific crime multiple killings, including that of a child, and more than 200 maimed or wounded. What may be less clear is Tsarnaev s role in the attack, and whether, if convicted, he will be sentenced to death. As both sides prepare for his November trial, court filings and arguments by prosecutors and the defense provide a glimpse into their opposing strategy for the penalty phase of the case. The government says it has video showing Tsarnaev placing a backpack near the finish line, then using his cell phone, moments before the first bomb went off. He walked away and the second bomb went off in front of the camera, officials say. There is also the note Tsarnaev scribbled on the boat he was hiding in, claiming the Boston Marathon victims were payback for U.S. wars in Muslim lands. Excerpts of the note open the grand jury indictment. I can t stand to see such evil go unpunished Tsarnaev wrote. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all Now I don t like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said unintelligible it is allowed and Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop. In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev s betrayal of the United States. They claim that after Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States, the defendant enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States by killing and maiming its people. Leading the defense team is Judy Clarke, a longtime public defender who has represented some of the nation s most notorious criminals, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who killed three Jared Loughner, who shot and killed six people and critically wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords and Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who drowned her two children.
Kaczynski and Loughner pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment. In the Smith case, Clarke argued that her client s abusive childhood and depression tormented her, causing her to snap. Although it convicted Smith of murdering her sons, the jury spared her life. She enjoys a wonderful reputation, she fights very hard for all her clients, said former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who prosecuted terrorism cases in New York s Southern District. She s the model for all defense lawyers. Humanizing Tsarnaev is a priority for his defense team, said David Hoose, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Kristen Gilbert, a former Veterans Administration nurse convicted of killing four patients. The jury in that case did not vote unanimously to impose the death sentence. Gilbert was thus sentenced to life in prison. There s always a story to be told, Hoose said. It s not a story that excuses or justifies what was done. but it explains and allows us to understand as human being to human being what led someone to the point in their life where they could undertake such an act that virtually everyone else finds incomprehensibly horrible. The defense has great leeway in presenting its case for the penalty phase. The Supreme Court has held that pretty much anything related to the defense background, or character, or to the circumstances surrounding the crime is admissible, Hoose said. Hoose said he believes Tsarnaev, who was 19 when the crime happened, has a good chance of avoiding the death penalty. This is a young kid, still impressionable, only a year and a half over the minimum that he would have to be even to be eligible for the death penalty, who is clearly under the influence of an older brother who has been radicalized and who has become extremely violent. What do you do as a younger sibling when that kind of thing is going on in your family In a recent court filing, the defense lawyers sought information prosecutors obtained from the federal government s surveillance of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
Any evidence tending to show that Tamerlan supplied the motivation, planning and ideology behind the Boston Marathon attack, and that his younger brother acted under his domination and control, is material, the defense argued. Tsarnaev s defense team declined to comment to CNN, but in a status hearing this week, they called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case. If the government indictment is true, this is about a family, defense attorney David Bruck said. The defense objects to having an FBI agent monitor conversations between Tsarnaev and his siblings during prison visits. Judge George O Toole has indicated he agrees with the defense, but deferred ruling to give prosecutors time to respond. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, three people have been executed Timothy McVeigh, for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people Juan Garza, for three murders connected to drug trafficking and Louis Jones, for the kidnapping and murder of a female soldier. According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project, juries have handed down 74 death sentence verdicts since the death penalty was reinstated. However, a judge has formally applied the sentence only 71 times. The disparity comes from defendants convictions that were overturned or death verdicts that were vacated before formal sentencing by the judge. The liberal leaning nature of Boston area juries also will bear watching in Tsarnaev s case. Massachusetts banned the death penalty in 1984. Hoose said in an area that is heavily Catholic, many are inclined to follow the lead of Pope Francis, who opposes capital punishment. In a Boston Globe poll taken in September, 57 of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev. Thirty three percent favored the death penalty. Lillian Campbell, whose granddaughter, Krystle Campbell, was killed in the marathon bombings, told CNN s Chris Cuomo, When they came out with this part about the death sentence ... I said, well, I don t really care what they do with them.
Because whatever they do, it s not going to bring her back, she said. I ll never forget her, ever, no matter how much they say. Or what they do with the guy who did it. So I wouldn t wish anyone dead. I wouldn t. Even after what he did asked Cuomo. Even after what he did, Campbell replied. Prosecutors in the case declined to speak with CNN. Former federal prosecutor Allison Burroughs said, given the nature of the crime, it s not surprising the government is seeking the death penalty. If not in this case, then when Burroughs said. However, she said winning a death penalty verdict in Massachusetts is so unlikely it may not be worth the time and resources involved. Others say the government made the right decision. The death penalty attaching to a case of terrorism where people are maimed and killed is certainly a reasonable option, said Gerry Leone, the former Middlesex County District Attorney who prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid in 2002. Reid pleaded guilty before going to trial. Although Leone said he thinks the defense has a chance of beating the death penalty, the prosecution strategy should be clear. The prosecution keeps harping on and keeps drilling home the facts. And the facts are horrible here. Two hundred sixty plus people who were hurt and maimed. Three people dead. A police officer in the aftermath of those actions executed, Leone said. The government will keep pounding home the facts in this case, which are just horrible from a human perspective. Richard Burr, who represented Timothy McVeigh, knows what it is like to lose a capital case. McVeigh was executed in 2001. In any case where there is huge public injury, there s pressure on political leaders to seek the death penalty. There may be pressure on jurors to return a death penalty, even against their better wisdom. The key, Burr said, is to present the jurors with a detailed narrative of the defendant s life that can evoke some mercy.
Clarke and her team are masters at getting at a defendant s life story, Burr said. Yet she is also attuned to the critical need for the capital defense team not to ignore the victims. The death penalty deprives people of their humanity, Burr added. We have to try to help remind everybody that we re all in this together.
By . Tracey Cox . It s National Orgasm Day, don t you know Well, if you didn t know one thing you will be sure of especially if you re female is that reaching that magical point during sex isn t always so easy. For many, there s no problem but for plenty of women there can be obstacles in the way of reaching climax. Fear not though because there are ways to make sure that love making isn t boring and offers as much fun for you as it does your partner. Here s Sexpert Tracey Cox s tips for helping yourself out in the bedroom. Don t be miserable in the bedroom Help yourself to orgasm by reading up on Tracey s top tips . Change your attitude . The most common obstacle to having an orgasm is your attitude to sex. If you ve been brought up to believe it s bad or dirty or even unladylike , you probably feel uncomfortable touching yourself or letting your partner touch you. The good girls don t inhibition factor is a big problem for some. Remember that sex and pleasure is normal and allow yourself to get carried away. Enjoy If you really can t, do think about booking a few sessions with a female sex therapist check out the Psychological Society Accept you have to learn how to orgasm . Female orgasms aren t automatic. You re . not going to accidentally have one while doing the ironing. It s also . extremely unlikely that you ll have your first orgasm with a partner. Practically all women have their first on their own. So if you re . waiting for some magical lover to transport you to heaven, stock up the . cupboards you re in for an awfully long wait. Instead, invest in a few . good sex books that focus specifically on the emotional barriers to . orgasm. Keep reading and researching until you feel good about sex, . confident that you understand how your body works and know the basic . techniques most women use to orgasm. Accept responsibility for your own pleasure .
Do you think it s his responsibility to give you an orgasm No one can give you an orgasm you have to take one yourself, by guiding and telling him how to do it. It s not like a five course meal where he slaves in the kitchen and you get to do nothing but lie about until you re ready to savour the results. Orgasms happen when both of you know what you want and how to get it. Teach yourself how to masturbate . You ll learn more about your body and its response system if you use your fingers but using a vibrator is also a good idea. Any good department store sells personal massagers, ostensibly designed to massage shoulders but more often bought to massage clitorises. The saleswoman won t know what you re buying it for. Remember though, you re not putting it inside but holding it against your sensitive parts. Also do teach yourself to climax using your hands. Unless you want to always use a vibrator with your partner, you need to know how to do it manually. Teach him how to do it . Once you ve masturbated yourself to orgasm, it s time to tell him how to do it otherwise how is he supposed to know what you like God sex is your own responsibility don t expect to be able to lie back and let your partner do all the work . Change how you see your own body . Many women don t orgasm because they think their partners can t possibly find them attractive and spend too much time thinking about that during sex, rather than focusing on what s going on. Let s get one thing straight right now an overwhelming majority of men are turned on by a naked woman s body, no matter what shape it s in. However, if you aren t happy with yours, do something about it. Join a gym, get a make over, eat healthily, then splash out on some new clothes.
But accept what nature has handed out ignore the faults, play up the good bits and learn to love every centimetre. Stop trying so hard . A watched pot never boils. Your mind should be focused on how pleasurable the sensations are, not on Please God, let me have one . The more you worry about it, the more your body will tense and make orgasm impossible. Try a bit of reverse psychology. When you masturbate or make love, tell yourself you re not allowed to have an orgasm, that this session is strictly for research purposes. You ll relax more and may well end up scoring a goal. Tracey Cox knows it all when it comes to sex . Rethink your relationship . You re fat , No wonder you can t have an orgasm, you re no good at anything , You re not a real woman , You re frigid if your partner says or insinuates negative things about you, your body or your inability to climax, getting rid of him is the simple solution to your problem.

ATLANTA, Georgia CNN The Bigfoot in the freezer is made of rubber, a Web posting asserted Tuesday. The frozen creature reputed to be Bigfoot turned out to be made of rubber, an enthusaist reports. The initial promoter of two hikers claim that they found the body of Bigfoot in Georgia said he has determined that the discovery was a hoax. The body turned out to be rubber, and the two men who claimed that they found it, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, have admitted that it was a costume, said a posting Tuesday on the Web sites of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and Squatchdetective. The posting purportedly was written by Steve Kulls, who maintains the Squatchdetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, where the find was announced weeks ago. In addition, Stanford University anthropologist Richard Klein said Monday that he was not aware he had been identified as participating in the project and would not be involved in any effort to examine the purported Bigfoot carcass. Whitton and Dyer announced last week that they had found the body of a 7 foot 7 inch, 500 pound half ape, half human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They said they put the carcass in a freezer and had spotted about three similar living creatures. We were not looking for Bigfoot, Whitton, a Clayton County, Georgia, police officer, said Friday during a news conference. We wouldn t know what we were doing if we did. He and Dyer insisted that scientific analysis would bear out their claim. The hoax was discovered after an expedited melting process, Kulls wrote. A break appeared up near the feet area ... as the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.
Kulls said he contacted Tom Biscardi, the self described Real Bigfoot Hunter who has been searching since 1971 for the creature of legend and appeared alongside Whitton and Dyer at the news conference. Later that day, Tom Biscardi informed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was a costume, the posting said. Whitton and Dyer reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and an admission of the hoax and meet with Biscardi at their hotel on Sunday. But when Biscardi went to the hotel, the two had left, Kulls wrote. At this time, action is being instigated against the perpetrators, the posting said, adding that the motives behind the claims were unknown. iReport.com Do you believe in Bigfoot The posting said Biscardi s organization, Searching for Bigfoot Inc., is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception. Kulls did not immediately return a call to the Squatchdetective contact number. A woman answering the phone at Searching for Bigfoot Inc. said Biscardi had been ill and said she was not sure when he would be returning calls. A number listed as belonging to Matthew Whitton was disconnected as of Tuesday. Efforts to locate a phone number for Dyer on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Dyer and Whitton failed to show up Monday for a scheduled appearance on CNN s American Morning. Kulls said that at the time he first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program, he suspected the duo s motive was financial. On August 12, he said, the two requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketing and promotion. Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the body something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice, Kulls wrote.
Dyer, he said, insisted on holding the news conference and told Biscardi he would not release the body unless the briefing was held Friday. On Sunday, the research team was able to extract some hair and burn it. The hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair, Kulls wrote. Biscardi then gave the group permission to expedite the melting process, and the rubber foot was discovered, Kulls wrote. Meanwhile, Klein, the Stanford professor, said Monday that he was sorry that my name and Stanford s name have been brought into this. Klein s name was mentioned Friday as one of four scientists, two of them Russian, who would analyze the corpse. Klein said he was unaware that Biscardi had identified him. He said he had been contacted by Biscardi in the past and responded to a request to examine bones that were identified as coming from a deer. He seems like a nice enough guy, Klein said, but I can t imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence of Bigfoot . Anything has a remote chance of being true, but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real. CNN s Peter Dykstra contributed to this report.
In Silicon Valley speak, on demand means requesting a service laundry, a ride, a massage right now. All you have to do is push that button. But of course you still have to wait for the ride to come no one has figured out yet how to make it materialize out of thin air. Now Uber wants to approximate that feeling by letting you schedule your ride ahead of time. When you need it, goes the idea, your ride just appears. Starting today, business travelers in Seattle will be able to schedule rides 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. It s the first step in what the company says will be a global rollout of the feature. Even though we re an on demand company, we totally get it, says Tom Fallows, Uber s director of global experiences. Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave. After tapping on UberX in the Uber app, users will see a new option to schedule a ride to within a 15 minute window. You ll set their pickup date, time, location, and destination, and you ll be able to edit details up to 30 minutes before the pickup time. You can also cancel anytime without a penalty so long as your ride isn t already on the way. Uber says it will send you reminders 24 hours ahead of your ride, and again 30 minutes before. Passengers will also get a notification after the ride is on the way that includes, among other information, whether or not surge pricing is in effect. Since surge pricing is a strictly real time computation, Fallows says, users see only the base fare when they initially order a scheduled ride. But if you re not willing to pay the surge pricing, you have a five minute window to cancel without a penalty after the driver is on the way. Wait longer than five minutes and the standard cancellation fee applies. The amount varies by city It s 5 in San Francisco and Seattle, for instance, and 5 euros in Paris.
What the Driver Sees Meanwhile, the process on the driver s end remains exactly the same. The most efficient way to do this by far is for us to send your ride request to the nearest driver at the right moment, Fallows says. So from their perspective, it s a normal ride. Uber does the technical heavy lifting to decide when to send the ride request out, says Fallows, which includes examining such signals as where all Uber drivers on the network are at that moment where those drivers are headed and likely to be in the next few minutes and how long it would take those drivers to arrive at your pickup location. Traffic is another factor, Fallows says, as is the likelihood of a driver accepting your request. Scheduled rides go live today in Seattle, with other top business travel cities following soon, according to Uber. At launch, the feature is available only to users who have a business profile set up on the service, and only on the UberX tier. The announcement comes shortly after Uber s archrival, Lyft, said it was testing a similar feature among its own employees in San Francisco. Lyft said it would like to offer scheduled rides to regular customers but has no definite plan for releasing the feature. Passengers will be able to schedule a ride up to 30 days in advance, a reversal of Uber s long held attitude that it is an on demand service. Mass shooting in Orlando Why Pulse is more than just a gay bar An Uber car in San Francisco in May 2015. Passengers will soon be able to pre schedule rides. Passport, check. Toothbrush, check. Scheduled Uber pickup, check. The ride hailing company announced that users on their way to the airport, or in need of any pre scheduled ride, will be able to reserve one up to 30 days in advance. The service started Thursday in Seattle, the home of Microsoft, and will expand to other top business travel cities, Uber wrote on its blog.
Uber is not the first ride hailing service to offer this feature. Lyft announced in May it has started to test a similar program in San Francisco, while Gett has offered scheduled ahead service for more than a year where it operates, USA Today reported. As these companies upend the taxi and limousine industries, Uber s announcement shows that it, Lyft, and Gett have found that they shouldn t discard too many taxi and limo features in the name of on demand. Even though we re an on demand company, we totally get it, Tom Fallows, Uber s director of global experiences, told Wired.com. Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave. Through Uber s new feature, a user will be able to schedule a ride 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. The feature will be offered to start just through Uber X, its less expensive, private vehicle option. A user can cancel any time before their ride is on its way, at no cost to them. Pre scheduling won t impact drivers, who will not be able to match with riders ahead of time, according to The Boston Globe. And users won t be able to avoid surge pricing, in which the cost of a ride climbs at peak hours, either. Schedule ahead service is a reversal of Uber s long held stance about how, and when, it serves its customers. Uber is an on demand service, it writes on its website, on a page titled Can I make a reservation Use the Uber app to request a trip when you re ready to ride. There s no need to make a reservation in advance. Travis Kalanick, Uber s chief executive, reaffirmed this mindset in September, when he spoke one on one with Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff at the cloud computing company s Dreamforce conference.
Do you schedule time with your shower said Mr. Kalanick, when asked by Mr. Benioff if Uber would introduce scheduled rides, reported Forbes. And yet, ever since it started six years ago, Uber said it has received requests from customers for pre scheduled rides so they can rest assured that an Uber will be available when they need it, even if it s for a 4 a.m. ride to the airport, wrote Uber in Thursday s blog post. Taxis and limos have long offered schedule ahead services. In fact, it s a foundation of the limousine industry. Gett, which operates in Europe, Russia, Israel, and New York City, recognized this when it launched the service more than a year ago. Lyft was next. It started to pilot service in San Francisco about two weeks ago, and plans to expand it to other cities sometime this summer, reported PC Magazine. Lyft, though, will allow users to reserve a ride up to 24 hours in advance, compared to up to 30 days through Uber. Uber introduced pre scheduling in part to keep up with its rivals. Yet it s also an indication that ride hailing companies are learning they can t do away with too much of the traditional model. If you want to really, truly upend the market, then you have to focus on perfecting the tools people use to create change, wrote Kevin Harrington, the inventor of the infomercial, in a Forbes article. In the end, companies don t upend markets customers do. Uber s working on making it easier for you to get a ride when you need it. Ride scheduling, unveiled June 9 on a trial basis in Seattle, is the latest feature to be added, according to the company s blog. Advertisement While the new feature allows riders to schedule a pickup request up to 30 days in advance, it doesn t allow riders to match with drivers ahead of time.
Since launching its ride sharing application six years ago, the company said on its blog that riders have wanted the ability to arrange a pickup in advance. The company said it did not have a specific date when Boston would receive the new feature, but other top business travel cities will soon be added. Uber is also limiting the new feature to users it identifies as business travelers. To use the function, users will have to select uberX in the app, followed by a Schedule a Ride option. After filling out the appropriate information, such as pickup date and time, confirmation will be sent to the user. The company says they ll send reminders 24 hours and then again at 30 minutes before the requested pickup time. Advertisement The driver s information will be shared once a match is made, like the app currently does with unscheduled rides, Uber said. The ability to schedule a ride is a complete turnaround for Uber. According to Forbes in 2015, Uber s Travis Kalanick told Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff that Uber had no plans to introduce a scheduling capability. Roughly two weeks ago, ride share rival Lyft also announced plans for testing ride scheduling capabilities. According to an announcement posted May 23 on its blog, Lyft users in San Francisco can schedule rides up to 24 hours in advance. Uder s scheduling proposal comes on the heels of another announcement guaranteed uberPOOL arrival time. In a June 7 blog post, the company stated that uberPOOL users will see an arrival time estimate as opposed to the current travel time estimate. If you miss your arrival time, Uber will give you 2 off your next uberPOOL ride. Currently, uberPOOL arrival time is only offered in Los Angeles, but the company hopes to expand it to other cities soon. Uber said it also does not have a specific date to roll out the new uberPOOL feature in Boston. Seattle will be the first city where Uber offers scheduled rides to app users with a business profile.
Uber will allow riders to schedule a ride as early as 30 days in advance. The new service will be first offered to business travelers in the Seattle area starting at 11 a.m. Thursday, though the company has promised quick expansion to other cities. Hoping to please meticulous planners with loaded calendars, Tom Fallows, Uber s director of global experiences, said the service is aimed at those who want an extra degree of assurance Uber will be there when they head out, such as travelers with early morning flights. They sleep better knowing their Uber ride is arranged, Fallows said. To schedule a trip, app users with a business profile choose a route and set a date and time. Scheduled rides are priced like a normal Uber ride and subject to surge pricing. If you re requesting the ride at 8 a.m. on a Monday morning and it s super high demand, surge may apply just like it normally would, Fallows said. We send riders a push notification on the way, notifying them if there s any surge. Passengers can modify their scheduled rides before the driver has been dispatched. Once the push notification is sent and the driver is en route, users will have 5 minutes to cancel without penalty, Fallows said. Initially, scheduled rides will be available only on UberX, but Fallows said the company plans to expand it to black cars and other Uber lines soon. Uber chose to launch in Seattle because developers here built the system and the city has a lot of business travelers, Fallows said. Although scheduling is a simple concept, Fallows said the architecture that runs the dispatching system requires complex algorithms that determine the right time to ask a driver to pick up a scheduled ride. The algorithm weighs proximity, traffic obstacles and the likelihood a driver will accept a scheduled ride, among other factors. The best driver for a given ride won t always be the one nearest to the person requesting it, Fallows said.
For example, We may know a driver who currently has a passenger in the car is headed to drop them off nearby your house or pickup location, Fallows said. The best driver to be offered your ride is not an available driver 10 blocks away, but is a driver who is currently occupied but will soon be free two blocks away. Fallows said Uber s engineers in Seattle will be watching how the new feature is used and eager for feedback from customers. There s nothing like having things happen in your own backyard to excite you about building and testing, he said.

My headline may be a bit misleading. Albert Einstein, the Nobel prize winning physicist who gave the world the theory of relativity, E mc2, and the law of the photoelectric effect, obviously had a special brain. So special that when he died in Princeton Hospital, on April 18, 1955, the pathologist on call, Thomas Harvey, stole it. Einstein didn t want his brain or body to be studied he didn t want to be worshipped. He had left behind specific instructions regarding his remains cremate them, and scatter the ashes secretly in order to discourage idolaters, writes Brian Burrell in his 2005 book, Postcards from the Brain Museum. But Harvey took the brain anyway, without permission from Einstein or his family. When the fact came to light a few days later, Harvey managed to solicit a reluctant and retroactive blessing from Einstein s son, Hans Albert, with the now familiar stipulation that any investigation would be conducted solely in the interest of science, Burrell writes. Harvey soon lost his job at the Princeton hospital and took the brain to Philadelphia, where it was carved into 240 pieces and preserved in celloidin, a hard and rubbery form of cellulose. He divvied up the pieces into two jars and stored them in his basement. Just when you think this story can t get any weirder, it does. As Burrell explains emphasis mine After Harvey s wife threatened to dispose of the brain, he returned to retrieve it and took it with him to the Midwest. For a time he worked as a medical supervisor in a biological testing lab in Wichita, Kansas, keeping the brain in a cider box stashed under a beer cooler.
He moved again, to Weston, Missouri, and practiced medicine while trying to study the brain in his spare time, only to lose his medical license in 1988 after failing a three day competency exam. He then relocated to Lawrence, Kansas, took an assembly line job in a plastic extrusion factory, moved into a second floor apartment next to a gas station, and befriended a neighbor, the beat poet William Burroughs. The two men routinely met for drinks on Burroughs s front porch. Harvey would tell stories about the brain, about cutting off chunks to send to researchers around the world. Burroughs, in turn, would boast to visitors that he could have a piece of Einstein any time he wanted. I know, right To fast forward a bit Come 1985, Harvey and collaborators in California published the first study of Einstein s brain, claiming that it had an abnormal proportion of two types of cells, neurons and glia. That study was followed by five others the most recent published just this month , reporting additional differences in individual cells or in particular structures in Einstein s brain. The researchers behind these studies say studying Einstein s brain could help uncover the neurological underpinnings of intelligence. But that premise is nonsense and the studies are bunk, at least according to Terence Hines, a professor of psychology at Pace University. A couple of weeks ago, Hines presented a poster at the Cognitive Neuroscience Society annual meeting outlining all of the ways in which each of the six studies is flawed. Some highlights In the original 1985 report, Harvey and his collaborators found that in Brodmann Area 39 a region where the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes meet Einstein s neuron to glia ratio was significantly smaller than it was in the same area in 11 control brains. But the control group was not all that well controlled the brains came from people age 47 to 80 years old, whereas Einstein died at age 76.
The controls brains were also fresh, whereas Einstein s had been languishing in basements and beer coolers for three decades. Perhaps most problematic, counting cells is a subjective business, and the researchers performing the cell counts were not blind to which tissue was Einstein s and which was not. In 1996, Harvey partnered with a scientist from Alabama and counted neurons in Einstein s Brodmann Area 9 part of the frontal cortex as well as those of five controls. There were no differences in the number of neurons or the size of neurons, the study found, but Einstein s tissue was thinner than controls. More densely packed neurons, the authors speculated, means that cell to cell messages travel shorter differences, which might mean faster processing speed overall. That s quite a stretch. As Hines calls out in his poster, the finding was based on just one square millimeter of Einstein s brain. What s more, the authors admit to not reporting any of the ways in which Einstein s brain was similar to controls. In 1999, Harvey and Canadian collaborators got Einstein s brain into one of the world s most prestigious medical journals, The Lancet. Based on old photographs that had been taken of Einstein s brain before it was cut up, the researchers claimed that Einstein had an abnormal folding pattern in part of his parietal lobe, a region that has been linked to mathematical ability. They also reported that his parietal lobes were 15 percent wider, and more symmetrical, than those of control brains. Once again, though, the researchers were not blinded to which photographs showed Einstein s brain. And though the authors were quick to make links between these supposed differences and Einstein s mathematical prowess, Hines points out that Einstein wasn t, in fact, a great mathematician. The underlying problem in all of the studies is that they set out to compare a category made up of one person, an N of 1, with a nebulous category of not this person and an N of more than 1.
With an N of 1, it s extremely difficult to calculate the statistical variance the likelihood that, for example, Einstein s low neuron to glia ratio is real and not just a fluke of that particular region and those particular methods. Even if the statistics were sound, you d still have the problem of attributing skills and behaviors to anatomy. There s no way to know if X thing in Einstein s brain made Einstein smart dyslexic good at math you name it, or was just an X thing in his brain. It makes me angry to think of all that was wasted in these investigations. There was the monetary cost of the studies money that could have been spent on work that was not doomed from the outset to fail. There was a personal cost, in that Einstein s family was essentially strong armed into agreeing to participate in research that Einstein explicitly did not want to participate in. And there was a public cost, too. In popular press accounts of these studies over the years, the public was misled about the findings and their supposed scientific value. I ve made this error, too, by the way. In 2012 I wrote an uncritical, cringe worthy report on preliminary data from a neuroscience conference comparing brain images of Temple Grandin, one of the most famous people with autism, with those of three controls. The researchers claimed to find several distinctive features in Grandin s brain that could explain her exceptional nonverbal intelligence and her way of thinking in pictures. Here s how smart Einstein was he understood all too well the public s obsession with him, our obsession with celebrity and special ness. He knew that if given the chance, scientists would pore over his brain s neurons and glia, sulci and gyri, and make grand pronouncements about what makes a genius. And he knew it would be bullshit.
As Einstein supposedly wrote, but probably didn t really write, on a blackboard in his Princeton office Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.
By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED . 06 29 EST, 21 February 2013 . . UPDATED . 06 37 EST, 21 February 2013 . New details Secret documents have revealed that Jimmy Savile gave money to children and claimed it back on BBC expenses . Jimmy Savile made several secret payments to children at the height of his offending and managed to claim the cash back from the BBC as expenses, it was revealed today. Confidential documents show the paedophile handed 10 to three youngsters in 1974 worth around 72 today after they had appeared on his Clunk Click TV show. Savile, who was being paid the huge sum of 2,350 for every show he presented, demanded the money back and the Corporation obliged and never asked why he paid the children. A letter, dated April 18 1974, shows the transactions and has today been released by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. We understand from London that during the above programme Clunk Click you dispersed 10 each to the following young people names blanked out , it says. We therefore enclose our cheque for 30 to reimburse you. The payments were during the peak period of his predatory attacks, between 1966 and 1976, when he was aged between 40 and 50. In 1974 alone there were 30 occasions where he allegedly sexually abused both children and adults. Since October there have been 450 complaints to police about him 214 have been recorded as crimes. His earliest offence was in Manchester in 1955, and the final reported allegation was in 2009 when he was aged 82. Some were allegedly attacked on BBC premises, including in his dressing room and the caravan he kept in the Television Centre car park in London. Concerns Savile paid the youngsters in 1974, during his most prolific period of abuse, when he allegedly attacked people at BBC Television Centre pictured But despite abusing all over Britain he was never brought to justice even though police had chances to prosecute him while the DJ was alive.
Yesterday it was revealed an officer from West Yorkshire Police is to be investigated after being accused of contacting Surrey Police on the DJ s behalf before they interviewed Savile over three alleged sex crimes in 2009. The reasons for these new secret payments to Clunk Click children are a mystery, but the BBC maintains there is no evidence that the youngsters were victims. A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline The document shows Savile was reimbursed the sum of 30 but there are no further details about this transaction which took place over 40 years ago . Show Sir Jimmy Savile is shown presenting his programme Clunk Click alongside guest Max Bowker. It is not known which children Savile paid nearly 40 years ago . But the solicitor representing victims said the cash could be something more worrying. The payments could be deeply sinister, or it could just be that Savile was tight, Alan Collins from the Pannone law firm told the Daily Express. We know he met kids in cafes and perhaps bought them drinks, but I can t think why he would want to reimburse himself. It is well known he was reportedly tight fisted, but given what we have learned over the past few months, one has got to keep an open mind about this. The FOI shows other expenses claims he made when he was at the Corporation. It appears he demanded a new suit for every show he presented and asked for, and was given, an 1,800 pay rise per show in 1990 to allow for inflation a huge sum at the time. He also asked for 200 travelling expenses for every programme because he lived in northern England, not London. A memo in 1989 said Perhaps predictably Jimmy has raised the question of expenses using the argument that although he maintains a flat in London, he is now principally resident in Leeds.
By . Damien Gayle . Arrested Fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar . Ablyazov, who was held in France after special forces backed by armoured vehicles . swooped on his rented home . French police special forces called in airpower and armoured vehicles for an operation to seize a wealthy fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted in three countries over a 5billion bank fraud. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police swooped on a rental home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south east France, said Solange Legras, chief prosecutor at an appeals court in Aix en Provence. The police used powerful means . including armoured vehicles and a plane because Ablyazov was known to . have a private militia at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. The 50 year old is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22 months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than 150million in British assets, including an 18million mansion in one of London s most exclusive streets. Ablyazov, who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of large scale fraud in an organised group , Ms Legras said by phone, shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition process. A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the energy rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly after setting up a pro reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of public office.
However, he was pardoned by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition. Kazakhstan s prosecutors have . described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent . on seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred. He is wanted . there on charges of siphoning off at least 5billion from BTA Bank, . which based in the central Asian country s business capital, Almaty. The . prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed . the government of Ablyazov s arrest, which was carried out at the . request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged . embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also . sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA . bank and a Russian company. Dissident A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country since before the Soviet collapse . There was no extradition request from the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal action taken by the now state owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering some of the allegedly embezzled funds. Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High Court, said Ablyazov was accused of fraud on an epic scale and had committed deliberate and substantial contempts by breaching an asset freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded. The conviction was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown rare cynicism and deviousness as he fought the claims against him and ordered him stripped of assets worth more than 150million.
Mr Ablyazov s property portfolio in Britain is alone worth more than 63million. His Bishops Avenue property Carlton House is worth 17million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires Row. The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts. He also has a 1m apartment in Albert Court, closet to Lord s cricket ground and Oaklands Park a 100 acre estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and helicopter pad. In a statement on his Facebook page, . Madiyar Ablyazov, the former banker s son, said he feared what would . happen if his father were deported to Kazakhstan. We . beg the French authorities not to grant Kazakhstan our father. He is a . man of honour, who has been fighting all his life, and sacrificed so . much, for freedom and democracy in Kazakhstan, the younger Ablyazov . wrote. We are afraid for his life. Taken Ablyazov s mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . Ablyazov s arrest came after the deportation of his wife and young daughter from Italy to Kazakhstan caused a political crisis in Rome last month. Because France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan, Ms Legras, the Aix en Provence prosecutor, said she is focusing on the extradition request from Ukraine for now. Under the extradition process, the requesting country has 40 days to send its legal dossier to French authorities. Once that is received, French prosecutors will have five days to present Ablyazov to investigating magistrates. In my opinion, this isn t going to happen before the autumn, she said.
The managing director of BTA Bank today told MailOnline the company welcomed Ablyazov s arrest. Pavel Prosyankin said This arrest is a result of the Bank s diligent efforts through the British justice system to recover the billions of dollars he stole while Chairman. We have sought his arrest to prevent him from further dissipating assets which the English High Court ordered to be put in receivership. He has flouted many court orders and fled the UK after we secured another High Court judgment sentencing him to prison in England. He is now in custody and we are optimistic that we will be better positioned to recover more of the assets which the court has authorised us to seize. Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says the allegations are politically motivated.
University of East Anglia researchers tested 594 bio science students in their first week of term at five universities. Almost all had a grade A , A or B in biology at A level. But on average they answered 60 of questions from their A level core syllabus incorrectly. The researchers blame an emphasis on teaching to the test. Researchers tested students at They were told about the test beforehand but were not given any details about its content or subject focus. The researchers said it was unlikely, therefore, that students would have revised for the test before taking it. They were given 50 minutes to answer 38 multiple choice questions on cells, genetics, biochemistry and physiology. Lead researcher for the study, Dr Harriet Jones, said This is the first research carried out in collaboration with an exam board to investigate how much information is lost between students sitting their A levels and arriving at university three months later. We found that students had forgotten around 60 of everything they learned for their A levels. Universities expect their students to arrive with a high level of knowledge. What our research shows is that students are arriving at university with fantastic A level grades, but having forgotten much of what they actually learned for their exams. Dr Jones said the trend to teach to the test, to ensure good results for schools reputations, was the problem. This is undoubtedly a problem caused by secondary schools gearing all of their teaching towards students doing well in exams, in order to achieve league table success, she said. But cramming facts for an exam doesn t give students a lasting knowledge of their subject. School and university have very different demands. In higher education, students cannot rely solely on memorising information, so it is important that students can adapt to a more in depth approach to learning. In response to concerns that A levels were not preparing students adequately for the rigours of degree level study, Education Secretary Michael Gove has announced changes to A level courses.
From September 2015, A level syllabuses in England will be linear, with all assessment at the end of two years of study, rather than the current modular style of study. Leading universities are also closely involved in developing the content of the new A levels, to ensure students are fully prepared for university study. The UEA report said If A levels are to be redesigned to enhance their impact for students entering higher education, then creating programmes which encourage retention of key concepts should be a key factor to consider. The report concludes Secondary education has become increasingly politicised, which involves greater emphasis on testing and results of tests, target setting and performance.
CNN This month, the world s political and business elite will converge on Europe s highest altitude town for the annual talk shop that is the World Economic Forum, held this year under the banner of resilient dynamism. The theme, the conference s organizers make clear, is prescriptive rather than descriptive a clarion call to the world s leaders, rather than an endorsement of their responses to date in addressing the problems afflicting the global economy. The ... new reality that we face is a prolonged global economic malaise, particularly in major economies experiencing economic austerity, Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the World Economic Forum WEF in 1971, said in a statement. Future growth in this new context requires dynamism bold vision and even bolder action. Either attribute resilience or dynamism alone is insufficient. While there has necessarily been plenty of resilience in evidence since the last time delegates gathered at the Swiss ski resort, their responses to major issues like the ongoing eurozone sovereign debt crises and the U.S. s fiscal cliff could hardly be termed dynamic. Those issues are likely to be foremost in the minds of those deemed important enough to be admitted entrance to the event, considered one of the world s most exclusive. Attendance to Davos is strictly by invitation only, with only 2,600 white badges of attendance issued to representatives from more than 100 countries. Adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend. While the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately 20,000. Per delegate costs can easily rise to double that once travel, accommodation and other expenses are factored in. Among the VVIPs on the guest list will be heads of state, royalty, the CEOs of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations. The delegates will have plenty to talk about.
The WEF s own Global Risks 2013 report compiled from an annual survey of more than 1,000 experts and industry leaders offers a pessimistic outlook, saying the global community s ability to address significant challenges, such as global warming, is undermined by the continuing economic weakness plaguing major economies. It identifies income inequality and unsustainable government debts as the two issues most likely to have an effect on the global community over the coming decade, and warns of a major systemic financial failure as the most devastating potential outcome. That weakness in key economic zones is proving stubbornly difficult to remedy. In November, figures were released showing the eurozone has entered a double dip recession, with the well documented woes of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. Austerity, the bitter medicine that it was hoped would be the cure to Europe s economic malaise, has not only proved hugely unpopular, prompting millions of Europeans to take to the streets in coordinated mass protests in November it is also, in the eyes of many economic experts, not working. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is among many leading figures who have called for a slowdown in the austerity measures, the impacts of which the organization s chief economist Olivier Blanchard has said were miscalculated. The only major respite for the eurozone has come courtesy of the Draghi effect. In September, European Central Bank ECB president, Mario Draghi, pledged to buy unlimited amounts of short term debt from struggling eurozone members, in an attempt to shore up the 17 nation currency bloc, provided they accept certain conditions. Nevertheless the pain remains severe in many parts of Europe, with Greece in particular enduring the agony of austerity and recession. Its economy is forecast to have contracted 6 in 2012. Meanwhile the prospect of a government bailout continues to hang over Spain, according to market watchers.
Compounding the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone s fourth largest economy is an upcoming referendum, to be held in 2014, on whether Catalonia the country s wealthiest and most industrialized region, containing 16 of the population and producing 19 of its wealth wants independence. Elsewhere in Europe, economists are predicting that Britain which is not a member of the eurozone will receive a downgrading of its AAA rating this year. That was the result for the United States, as it suffered the first ever downgrade of its AAA rating last year. Despite lawmakers eventually reaching a deal on the fiscal cliff, political divisions look set to remain an impediment to addressing ongoing financial issues, such as the debt ceiling. The U.S. s borrowing has hit its legal limit of 16.394 trillion, prompting the Treasury to resort to extraordinary measures to ensure that the government can pay its bills. If the ceiling is not raised soon, the U.S. faces the risk of defaulting on payments. But despite the painful, drawn out experience of the fiscal cliff negotiations, indications from political leaders suggest that political partisanship and brinkmanship over financial solutions are set to continue. And in the Arab world, the ramifications of a wave of upheaval that began two years ago is still playing out. Egypt the most populous Arab country, geopolitically significant for its relationship with Israel showed encouraging signs when it successfully held election for its first democratically elected leader. But President Mohamed Morsy s assumption of special powers a move described by critics as dictatorial to push through an Islamist framed constitution outraged secular and liberal groups, among others, triggering fresh waves of protest from Egyptians disenchanted with how the revolution had played out. The renewed unrest has scared investors, prompting a fresh round of selling of the Egyptian pound, which has hit a series of record lows. His constitution passed, Morsy now faces an economic battle to tackle his country s low foreign reserves, 12 unemployment and a large budget deficit, and revive this geopolitically significant North African economy.
The question here, as elsewhere, remains whether 2013 can truly represent a new dawn or whether delegates will return to their snowy enclave in Davos in 2014 to address the same set of intractable problems.
CNN Phylicia Rashad says she was misquoted. She says she wasn t being dismissive of the women who ve accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault when she came to the comedian s defense in an online interview. I am a woman. I would never do that, she said on ABC s World News Tonight With David Muir on Wednesday. Forget these women Rashad played Clair Huxtable, Bill Cosby s TV wife, on the groundbreaking NBC sitcom The Cosby Show. Cosby s now been accused of harassing, drugging and sexually assaulting multiple women. And in an interview with Showbiz 411, Rashad said she never saw any indication of the behavior that the women have attributed to Cosby. Forget these women, Rashad is quoted as telling the outlet. What you re seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it s orchestrated. I don t know why or who s doing it, but it s the legacy. And it s a legacy that is so important to the culture. Fast forward to Wednesday night. Rashad says the Showbiz 411 piece didn t accurately reflect what she said especially the forget these women part. That was a misquote. That is not what I said, Rashad said. What I said is, this is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy. In a Wednesday post, Roger Friedman, the columnist who wrote the Showbiz 411 article, denied that he misquoted Rashad, but wrote that he understands how her words were taken out of context. She didn t mean for it to be taken the way it was, and I should have punctuated. There was NEVER the meaning in Forget those women that she was saying to actually forget or dismiss then. He continued, She meant, those women aside as in, she s not talking about that, she s talking about Cosby s legacy being destroyed. It was conversational. Somehow this got twisted.
I am really sorry if the way I presented it made it seem like either one of us was forgetting anyone. Allred calls Rashad out . In coming to the defense of her TV husband, Rashad has now waded into a controversy that continues to dog Cosby. More than 20 women have come forward with claims, and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against Cosby. On Wednesday, attorney Gloria Allred brought out three more women Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal and a woman who chose to be identified only as Kacey who say they were sexually assaulted by the comedian after being drugged by him. While introducing the women, Allred addressed Rashad s statements to Showbiz 411. Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby s paid attack dogs who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can, Allred said. Cosby stays mum . And Cosby He s maintaining his silence as he s done while his reputation suffers. He was in Kitchener, Ontario, on Wednesday night for a standup appearance. A few dozen protestors rallied outside, but the show went on without a hitch. Larger protests are planned for Thursday night s shows. After his set, Cosby released a statement thanking attendees. I would like to personally thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring laughter back into your lives tonight, he said. Also, I would like to applaud all of you and give you a standing ovation for respecting yourselves, the theatre Centre In The Square and the event organizers that produced a spectacular show for the Kitchener Community. CNN s Eliott C. McLaughlin, Lisa Respers France and Todd Leopold contributed to this report from Atlanta, and Paula Newton from Ontario.

CNN Real Madrid returned to the top of the table in Spain after edging past Racing Santander 1 0 on Saturday, while previous leaders Barcelona could only draw 1 1 at Athletic Bilbao. Real, still missing the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and with veteran talisman Raul starting on the bench, dominated struggling Santander but had only a solitary first half strike from Gonzalo Higuain to show for it. The visitors should have snatched a point, but Sergio Canales saw his 77th minute effort wrongly ruled out for an offside by a teammate who was not in the line of play. Real, whose last home outing ended in an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey against lower league opposition, saw midfielder Xabi Alonso hit the post in the 13th minute and then defender Alvaro Arbeloa also hit the woodwork with a floated cross. Argentina forward Higuain, who started in place of Raul, kept up his good goalscoring form in the 22nd minute when he pounced from close range after Kaka s right wing cross was not cleared. Karim Benzema thought he had doubled the lead in the 55th minute, but the France forward s effort was correctly ruled out for a marginal offside before he made way for Raul. The result lifted some of the pressure piling up on Real coach Manuel Pellegrini, who has a big week ahead with Wednesday s Champions league clash against FC Zurich and then the El Clasico battle with Barcelona on Sunday. Real will go into that match at the Nou Camp with a one point lead over Barca, who were missing the swine flu stricken Rafael Marquez, Yaya Toure and Eric Abidal and the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the trip to Bilbao.
Lionel Messi inspired the Spanish and European champions best moments in the first half, with Thierry Henry left on the bench following his controversial handball incident in France s World Cup playoff win against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday. But it was the Basque side who should have taken the lead on the stroke of halftime when Javier Martinez headed a golden chance wide when it seemed easier to score. Barcelona took the lead in the 54th minute when Xavi threaded a superb pass to Dani Alves and the Brazilian fullback coolly slotted in the opening goal. However, that lead lasted only nine minutes as substitute Gaizka Toquero ghosted in behind Alves to collect his teammate s headed flick on and calmly sidefoot high into the net. Henry was finally brought on by coach Pep Guardiola in the 84th minute, but Barcelona could not penetrate the stubborn Bilbao defense, with the home side left in seventh place after a hard earned point. Barcelona next take on Italian champions Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday, needing a result to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages. Sevilla consolidated third place after holding on to win 2 1 at Tenerife. Diego Perotti put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute with a close range finish from a cross by new Spain cap Jesus Navas, who almost gave away a penalty three minutes into the second half when Marc Valiente went down. Sevilla immediately counter attacked and midfielder Renato crashed in a shot from the edge of the area after being set up by fellow Brazilian Luis Fabiano. Striker Nino gave Tenerife hope with a superb volley 15 minutes from the end, but Sevilla defended well to earn the three points. Atletico Madrid crashed to a third straight defeat under new coach Quique Sanchez Flores, losing 2 1 at Deportivo La Coruna after Andres Guardado s dramatic last minute penalty.
Argentina striker Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead after just three minutes, but Diego Colotto leveled the score on 20 and Guardado kept his cool at the death after Pablo brought down Alberto Lopo. Sanchez Flores raced onto the pitch as Atletico protested furiously, resulting in Cleber Santana being sent off.
Washington CNN President Barack Obama got a second term from voters and another chance with Chief Justice John Roberts. After flubbing the oath in 2009, Obama and the Supreme Court s top jurist performed the honor flawlessly at the White House on Sunday at the official swearing in for the Democrat s second term. They will do it again on Monday at the Capitol before a crowd of up to 800,000 people. The Constitution mandates that U.S. presidents be sworn in on January 20. Because that fell on a Sunday this year, the public ceremony was scheduled for Monday at noon. Inauguration 2013 A viewer s guide . The dual events this time were due to a confluence of law and pomp. That was not the case four years ago when Obama and Roberts also performed the honor twice. During that inaugural, Obama and Roberts fumbled the oath before 1.8 million people. It all started when Roberts recited a seven word phrase, but Obama broke in halfway through and repeated the first three words. That seemed to throw Roberts off, and he proceeded to mix up the order of the words in the next phrase. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin reported in his recent book, The Oath, that Roberts is known for his superb memory and had obsessively practiced reciting the words at home for weeks. Government sources told CNN and Toobin that Roberts and his staff also e mailed their own copy of the oath to inauguration organizers weeks earlier. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN s platforms and nowhere else . Slash marks were clearly indicated to illustrate how the phrases would be divided and where Roberts would pause, to ensure the president elect would be on the same page. No one is sure why it happened, but the oath card never reached anyone on Barack Obama s staff, Toobin wrote.
They were concerned enough about the small stumble in the sequencing of words on the inaugural platform that Obama and Roberts went through it again the next day in private in the White House Map Room just to make sure they were square with the Constitution. Back at the White House four years later, it all went off without a glitch just before noon on Sunday. With Roberts waiting in the Blue Room, Obama strode in before a small gathering. He placed his left hand on a Bible belonging to his wife s family and raised his right hand. Roberts had the card with him and the slash marks identifying where he would pause were clearly visible. It all took less than a minute to get through the 35 word oath. Obama hugged his wife and daughters, exclaiming I did it Complete coverage The 2013 Presidential Inauguration .
CNN The Zumba instructor in Maine who ran a prostitution ring out of her fitness studio Saturday was released from jail early for good behavior and participating in a work program, according to a York County Jail spokesman. Alexis Wright, 29, walked out of the Maine jail at 8 a.m. Saturday after serving nearly six months of a ten month term for a prostitution case that last year rocked the sleepy New England town of Kennebunk. Her client list, including accountants, lawyers and even a local TV personality, became the talk of the picturesque Maine town. The State Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the prostitution ring in 2011 after receiving a tip that there was more going on at the studio than a Latin dance fitness party. In February 2012, Wright s Zumba studio was raided. Court documents showed that Wright videotaped intimate encounters with some of her customers in three locations including her store front Zumba exercise studio and would send the footage to her business partner, Mark Strong.

More than 13,000 Skype video call snapshots were recovered from Strong s computer, according to the memo. Strong was found guilty of promotion of prostitution and conspiracy to promote prostitution in March. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail, court documents said. In addition to jail time, Wright was ordered to pay 57,000 in restitution and 1,000 in fines. Prosecutors dropped more than 80 other counts and reduced more serious tax related charges from felonies to misdemeanors, according to the sentencing documents.

CNN France will host golf s Ryder Cup for the first time in 2018, it was announced Tuesday. Le Golf National course, on the outskirts of the capital Paris, was chosen to stage the 42nd edition of the biannual competition between Europe and the United States ahead of Germany, Portugal, Netherlands and favorites Spain. There had been calls for the tournament to be given to Spain in memory of golfing great Seve Ballesteros, who died after a long battle with cancer earlier this month. The five time major winner was patron of the Madrid bid. But the European Tour resisted the emotional draw of the Spanish bid, much to the delight of the French delegation. Water hazard 500 million floating golf course planned for Maldives . They have promised to boost the sport at grass roots level by building 100 urban courses in the country and pledged to increase the number of registered players by 300,000 to 700,000 by 2022. Every registered golfer in France donated one euro 1.41 to the cause and now the country can expect the big financial bonus from business and tourism that comes with hosting the event. Richard Hills, Europe s Ryder Cup Director, told the European Tour s official web site We have one worthy gold medallist in France, who gave us the confidence to believe that they will stage a truly memorable Ryder Cup in seven years time. France, as the successful nation, will now be entering into a multi faceted relationship with Ryder Cup Europe, lasting a minimum of 12 years and benefiting many aspects of golf at all levels. All of us at Ryder Cup Europe look forward to working closely with the French Ryder Cup 2018 team in the coming years. The announcement was celebrated heartily by the French delegation, which included golfers Thomas Levet and Jean Van de Velde, who represented Europe in the 2004 and 1999 Ryder Cups respectively.
The last, thrilling, installment, in 2010, was won by Europe at Celtic Manor in Wales, when captain Colin Montgomerie led his team to victory by 14 1 2 points to 13 1 2. Pascal Grizot, chairman of the French Ryder Cup bid, said We ve always believed it could happen. My greatest satisfaction is to have brought everyone together to believe it too. French golf united and this did not go unnoticed by the European Tour. This huge victory is one for everyone connected to French golf. Regarding Ballesteros he added We all remember Severiano Ballesteros as an icon in our sport and someone who epitomized the spirit of the Ryder Cup. He is in our thoughts today. Georges Barbaret, President of the French Golf Federation, added I can t wait for 2018. We have always believed in the link between culture and sport which I m sure will make the Ryder Cup in France a unique event that will leave everlasting memories.
A team of diggers has started removing 2,500 tonnes of waste from a 40ft high rat infested rubbish pile which has blighted the lives of residents for the past three years. The towering mountain of putrid rubbish sits at the end of cul de sac near Orpington, Kent, and is laden with everything . imaginable from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges . to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles. The stinking mound which residents say smells like rotting corpses is also prone to catching fire, as hot spots smoulder deep inside the 60 ft wide pile of rubbish. Fire crews have now been called to 23 fires at the site one of which lasted ten days which has cost the taxpayer 650,000. Scroll down for video . This 40ft pile of stinking rubbish has blighted the lives of . residents living in a cul de sac near Orpington, Kent, since . 2011. Now, experts from the Environment Agency are starting to remove . some of the waste . The Environment Agency, which has been locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site, has called in experts to remove 2,500 tonnes of rubbish from the 20,000 tonne pile . The towering mountain, which sits at the end of cul de sac, is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles . Now the Environment Agency which is locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site has ordered experts to remove some of the mess so the pile is at a safe level and stops spontaneously catching fire. But fed up locals in Cornwall Drive, St Paul s Cray, say the action is not enough and have called for the entire 20,000 tonne mountain to be removed.
Jan Watkins, 60, a grandmother of two, said It is a plague. It is a living nightmare. It is really, really horrible. You can t open your doors or your windows. The smell that comes through is like rotting corpses. You can t go out, it is in your clothes, in your hair, because the smell gets in them. You can t use your garden. Many residents have sore throats and coughs. Anybody who has a breathing problem suffers greatly. Ms Watkins said residents had been campaigning to clear the site for three years and accused the EA of allowing the mound to spiral out of control by failing to take swift action. She said she feared the frequent fires . were belching toxic fumes which could be endangering the health of her . two young grandchildren, whom she looks after during the day. She said If the Environment Agency . had taken action when we wanted them to two and a half years ago it . would be half the size. We feel very, very let down. The mountain of garbage has been a problem for residents since rubbish disposal . company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011. Fire crews have been called to 23 fires at . the site, mostly during the hot summer weather, costing the taxpayer 650,000 and taking up 2,000 hours of firefighters time . But residents say efforts by the EA to remove some of the waste which includes rotting industrial waste, tyres, scrap metal and even excrement is too little too late. They are campaigning for the entire tip to be removed . According . to its website, the firm s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . and it specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that . can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity. It charges people to dump rubbish at the site during the day and the night, which it then sorts, treats and sends on for disposal elsewhere. But residents say this practice does not happen and instead, over the past couple of .
years, Waste4Fuel has simply taken the money and let it stack up into a . monstrous pile. Resident Denise Clark, 34, a mother of two, said The smell, especially when it s hot, is repugnant, disgusting. It makes you feel sick to the stomach. It s like living next to a sewage . works. We have a real rat . problem. The size of the rats are massive up to 2ft with their tails. I . have a three year old son and five year old daughter and it makes me . fear for their health. My son has eczema and it is not good for him. Diggers working on the site is the first sign of any tangible action . being taken to free the residents of the rat infested rubbish mound, which regularly catches fire . Waste4Fuel uses the site as a waste transfer site where it processes . general non hazardous waste . It is allowed a maximum of 5,500 tonnes on the site at . a time but has almost four times that amount . She said local schools do not allow children out in the playground at break when the rubbish pile is on fire because of health fears. She added that residents fear the pile will one day cause a fire that gets out of control and spreads. She said About 18 months ago there was a fire that lasted 10 days and that was pretty scary. If the wind was blowing the other way it could have taken the whole street out. Ms Clark also blamed the unsightly scourge for sending house prices in the street down, saying house prices had plummeted by 100,000. The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council. But . its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the . Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site as a waste . transfer station processing general non hazardous waste, from commercial .
operators with a maximum of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time. The pile is often seen emitting steam, as . rubbish smoulders deep inside the mound, pictured left. It is that which . has forced the EA to send in workers, pictured right, in a bid to take . the mound to a safe level . The height and width of the giant mound mean most residents can see the rubbish pile from their window. Resident Denise Clark, 34, said the smell is repugnant, disgusting and it is like living next to a sewage works The . Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm, claiming it has not been paying for . the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere. Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April. But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money by allowing more waste to be brought on site and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order. The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson. The charges were in relation to . Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire . breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site. Resident Jan Watkins, 60, said she cannot open her doors or windows because the smell comes through like rotting corpses . She said the smell even gets in her hair and on her clothes when she steps outside . Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents . But, in July this year, the High Court dismissed the case a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal.
Talking about the team of diggers, the EA said Environment Agency contractors have entered the Waste4Fuel site in Orpington in an operation to lower the illegal waste pile to a safe level. The Environment Agency s battle to ensure that the site operator and landowner clean up the site is continuing, but is taking this rare step to reduce the blight on the local community. Rob Wise, environment manager at the EA, said We understand the frustration of local residents and we will continue our fight against Waste4Fuel. It is not right that taxpayers should pick up the bill for this operation when it remains the responsibility of the site operator and landowners, but the priority is to make the site as safe as possible. We are committed to working with our partners, including the London Borough of Bromley, to find a long term solution.
Lord s centurion Jos Buttler was run out backing up at the non striker s end by bowler Sachithra Senanayake, but England s batting was disappointing. Alastair Cook was the only player from his side to make a half century as England were all out for 219. Sri Lanka won with 10 balls to spare thanks to Lahiru Thirimanne s 60. Sri Lanka have always been a fighting nation. Arjuna Ranatunga started it and the rest have followed. You can say they are a small nation, but they produce good cricketers. Although the controversy surrounding the dismissal of Buttler is likely to be the main talking point of this encounter, another lacklustre England batting performance will need to be addressed as Peter Moores second stint as head coach opened with a series defeat. The top order failed to get to grips with the pace of the pitch and did not put Sri Lanka s bowlers under any pressure as illustrated by the failure to score more than a solitary boundary during their early batting powerplay. Openers Cook and Ian Bell put on 76, but the latter s dolly of dollies to Ajantha Mendis was quickly followed by the cheap dismissals of youngsters Gary Ballance 10 and Joe Root 10 . Cook, who needed to play the steady foil for the big hitters, then gave away his wicket when he tried to paddle sweep man of the moment Senanayake, having scored 56 from 85 balls. Eoin Morgan 17 and Ravi Bopara 17 tried unsuccessfully to ignite the innings. Responsibility to set Sri Lanka a demanding total therefore fell to Buttler, whose incredible 121 from 74 balls at Lord s on Saturday had almost helped England seal the series. The 23 year old had made 21 from 24 balls when Senanayake intervened.
The wicketkeeper batsman had been twice warned by the bowler for straying out of his crease before a further transgression saw the bails removed, the spinner s appeal only upheld by umpire Michael Gough once he had consulted Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews. The enraged home support made their feelings clear inside a gloomy Edgbaston as they watched their team dismissed without completing the 50 overs. Sri Lanka raced to 51 in seven overs as they threatened to make short work of reaching the required 220. But the introduction of James Tredwell rocked the top order. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara fell to his spin, while Lancashire paceman Jimmy Anderson removed Kusal Perera to leave the tourists on 62 3. The innings was brought back under control by Jayawardene 53 , who shared a fourth wicket stand of 98 with Thirimanne 60 not out , before Mathews 40 not out saw them over the line with successive boundaries.

An Israeli government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment and a U.S. Embassy spokesman could not be reached. Iran leader Iran s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Both Israel and America think Iran s programme under the leadership of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is aimed at developing bombs, and not for peaceful purposes as Tehran claims. Iran has threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by 40 per cent of the world s oil tankers, in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country. But the U.S. has insisted that it will not allow Iran to choke off one of the world s busiest shipping routes and an American military official said that any disruption will not be tolerated. A Pentagon spokesman warned that Iran would destroy its own economic lifeline if it disrupted the international oil trade. Tensions rose after Iran s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the Gulf would be easier than drinking a glass of water. And they continued to escalate with Iran revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a U.S. aircraft carrier near an area where it was carrying out military maneuvers . If Iran were successfully to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically.
Following a mistaken report last year that the strait had already been closed, the oil price jumped by 2, to over 100 a barrel. A senior Saudi official has insisted in the past that Gulf nations would be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions, but this would be of little use if Iran succeeded in cutting off the strait.

By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . Up and coming trainer Hugo Palmer is considering an ambitious tilt at the Breeders Cup Juvenile Turf in California with Aktabantay. After the colt had scrambled home by a short head under jockey Ryan Moore to land Saturday s Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown, Newmarket based Palmer who is in his fourth season training revealed that taking the son of Oasis Dream to Santa Anita at the end of October is a serious option.

A hair loss medication reportedly tried by Wayne Rooney may cause prolonged and possibly irreversible impotence, scientists have claimed. The recent findings come after one patient bravely stepped forward to reveal the drug left him with no sex drive and even shrank his genitals. Kevin Malley, 30, was prescribed with the drug Propecia after he worried he could be losing his hair. He said he only planned to take the pill for a year. Concern Men worried about losing their hair may consider treatments such as Propecia. However in the UK the drug label warns about possible persistent sexual side effects . However, just five months after he started taking it in May 2011 he found he was completely impotent and his testes also became smaller. Worried, he consulted his doctor and was told the symptoms would disappear after he stopped taking the drug. But he says a year on and nothing has changed. It will come as no surprise to Dr Michael Irwig from the University of Washington. He recently published a study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, that found the ingredient finasteride, which is found in Propecia, can cause persistent sexual dysfunction, including low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms. The male pattern baldness drug is manufactured by Merck and was approved by the FDA in 1997. While labeling on the medication in the U.S. currently warns about possible reversible sexual side effects, there is no reference to the effects being persistent, Dr Irwig said. However, other countries including the UK and Sweden do require medical companies to include the persistent risk warning on the labeling. It was reported that Wayne Rooney started taking the medication in 2009 after he became sick of other footballer s jibes about his receding hairline. He has since had a hair transplant. Unfortunate side effects Wayne Rooney was reported to be taking Propecia in 2009. It has since been linked with impotence .
Dr Irwig first became aware of the problems caused by finasteride several years ago when he encountered several men who reported they had developed sexual dysfunction while taking the medication. It s been very frustrating for a lot of these men because they ve sought care from medical professionals who have looked at the literature and have not seen a risk of persistent sexual dysfunction, says Dr Irwig. So a lot of these patients have been told to see psychiatrists and psychologists and that it s all in their head. Dr Irwig then noticed that men had reported sexual dysfunction for months even after they stopped taking the medication. I came across a website called propeciahelp.com with more than 1,400 registered users many young healthy men who developed the same sexual side effects from finasteride and I discovered that nobody had published a series looking at these men who they are, how long the sexual side effects lasted, what types. Dr Irwig s study included results from interviews with 71 men aged 21 to 46 years old to assess how long they took finasteride, the type and duration of sexual side effects and their sexual frequency before and after the medication. Dr Irwig discovered that 94 per cent developed low libido, 92 per cent developed erectile dysfunction and decreased arousal, and 69 per cent developed problems with orgasm. On average, the men used finasteride for approximately 28 months but experienced persistent sexual side effects for an average of 40 months, from the time they ceased taking the medication to the time of the interview. Dr Irwig also found that the average number of sexual episodes per month dropped after finasteride use. It turns out that almost all the men had multiple sexual function problems, says Dr Irwig. Before finasteride use, the men experienced average sexual activity of approximately 26 episodes per month, but after use, it came down to approximately eight per month an almost two thirds reduction.
Twenty per cent of patients I interviewed experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years, which makes me wonder if their persistent sexual dysfunction is permanent, he adds. Controversial Merck says no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long lasting sexual dysfunction . This was certainly Mr Malley s experience. He told Good Morning America I kept expecting the side effects to go away, but they did not, they only got worse. Mr Malley said before he took the drug he was engaged and worked as a public health researcher at a university in Las Vegas. After he developed symptoms his fiancee broke off the engagement and he said he had to resign from his job because of cognitive problems. He said he is angry no one warned him the drug could have such lasting effects. Even if the side effects are rare, that doesn t mean that I should not . have been warned. I did have a life before this, he told Good Morning America. Dr Irwig said roughly 5 per cent of men who take medicine will experience sexual dysfunction, and of those it s hard to tell how many will experience persistent symptoms . We know that this is a potential problem, but we can t quantify what the exact risk is. I can t tell a man if he has a 1 in 100 chance, or a 1 in 1000 chance of developing persistent sexual dysfunction, but it s pretty clear there s a relationship here, he says. Topical Rogaine can be used as an alternative to Propecia applied directly on the skin, it does not get absorbed by body and thus does not cause sexual side effects but Dr. Irwig says Propecia is very effective in treating hair loss and thus is commonly prescribed. So Dr Irwig says it is crucial physicians treating male pattern hair loss discuss the possibility of persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride with their patients.
I think it s very important that doctors who are prescribing this medicine talk about potential risks, so men can make an informed decision, he said. In a statement, Merck said no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long lasting sexual dysfunction. A spokesman said Merck believes that PROPECIA finasteride has demonstrated safety and efficacy profiles and that the product labeling appropriately describes the benefits and risks of the drug to help inform prescribing. A causal relationship between the use of PROPECIA and continued sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment has not been established. We encourage patients to talk with their doctor if they have any questions or concerns about their health, or about PROPECIA.

Mr O Leary pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a genuine mistake such as forgetting to bring their boarding card also . The boss posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. He was using the stunt as part of a drive to improve the public image of the airline, which was recently voted worst of 100 biggest brands by Which readers.

By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2 19 AM on 5th September 2011 . Dominique Strauss Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair smile as they finally return home to France yesterday, despite warnings that the disgraced former IMF chief s problems are far from over. They arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris amid a storm of protest, led by the French First Lady.

Strauss Kahn s accuser, Guinean hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, will now pursue a civil case. The 62 year old also faces another investigation in France over attempted rape, based on accusations by novelist Tristane Banon. When they landed in France, a police escort was waiting to rush the couple through customs and into a waiting Peugot limousine. French . detectives also indicated that they also intended to speak to Mr . Strauss Kahn about sex related accusations being levelled at him in . Paris. The couple on Saturday night left their the 50,000 a month Manhattan town home Strauss Kahn had rented for his house arrest and boarded the flight at John F.Kennedy International airport.

Paris based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss Kahn s legal team had put pressure on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent. This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness. It would also allow Ms Diallo s legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution.

Adam Purinton, 51, fled the scene of the attack at a pub in Olathe and went to a restaurant where he confided in a staff member, police say. He was arraigned in court on Monday with first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder. The accused wore a safety smock to prevent him from harming himself. Police say he shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibholta at a pub on Wednesday evening. He allegedly fired on Mr Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani, two 32 year old Indian men who worked as engineers at GPS maker Garmin. Mr Kuchibhotla died and Mr Madasani survived. A third patron, 24 year old Ian Grillot, was wounded trying to intervene. The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime. After the attack at Austins Bar and Grill, the suspect, who is white, drove 70 miles 112km to an Applebee s in Clinton, Missouri, where he allegedly admitted what he had done to an employee. On Saturday at 11am, the doors of Austin Bar and Grill reopened, after a fatal shooting which has shaken people here in Olathe and beyond. We ve come back to show we won t let the attacker change our way of life, said one patron who d turned up. Austins is your regular local bar in a strip mall. It serves the usual diet of fried food and beers, with sport on big screens. But, Austins is now also the place which robbed one man of his life, and left two others injured. As Alok Madasani sat in pain in his living room, nursing an injury caused by the bullet which struck his thigh, he told me how he and Srinivas were so well known at the bar the staff knew how much ice they took in their drinks. Until that fateful night, he said he d never heard anyone use overtly racist language in Olathe.
And many other Indians I met at a vigil on Friday night echoed that sentiment. They said Olathe has always been a friendly and welcoming place. One man said he hoped this tragedy was a one off , and that the show of support here would help heal the many hearts, which have been broken. In a 911 call, a bartender, Sam Suida, told the police dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said he d done something really bad and that he was on the run. He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldn t tell me what he did, she says on a recording of the call. I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me. Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe. The shooting drew worldwide attention and has gripped the Indian American community. Hillary Clinton weighed in on the matter on Twitter on Monday, demanding President Donald Trump speak out against intolerance following the shooting. With threats hate crimes on rise, we shouldn t have to tell POTUS to do his part. He must step up speak out, the former Democratic presidential candidate tweeted. Mr Trump has yet to comment, but his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Monday that early reports on the Kansas shooting were disturbing . Witnesses said the suspect shouted get out of my country before shots rang out. Mr Madasani told the BBC the gunman had demanded to know if they were in the country legally. The suspect is being held in the Johnson County Jail on a bond of 2m Â 1.6m . His next court appearance is on 9 March.
West Point, New York CNN President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban s momentum and stabilize the country s government. There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum, Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. Al Qaeda has not re emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9 11, but they retain their safe havens along the border. And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable. Obama said he d begin sending the additional troops at the fastest pace possible starting in early 2010 with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011. The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces. Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013. Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan . It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives . Deny al Qaeda a safe haven . Reverse the Taliban s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan s government . Strengthen Afghanistan s security forces and government . The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country s border with Pakistan. We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan.
That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border, Obama said. The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation building without any deadlines. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests, Obama said. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan. Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action, Obama said. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan. We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens, Obama said. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troops will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron. Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team. He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future. As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service, he said.
The additional U.S. forces will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight, Obama said. And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans. Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan, he said. Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what s at stake is not simply a test of NATO s credibility what s at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world. The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. Obama, whom Republicans had accused of dithering over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said. The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama s slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn t be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly. A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is trying to do it faster than the 12 month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near term next 12 months while Afghan security capacity matures risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible. The Pentagon official said Obama s six month timeline for sending the new troops is very aggressive and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order.
Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner. Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement. The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months, the statement said. Share your views on Obama s Afghanistan decision . The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. His liberal base, which helped him win last year s presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan. In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra 30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation. U.S. led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network s September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan s border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda s top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.
Emergency services were called Mossvale Nursery, in Fullerton Street, Paisley, at about 01 55. About 25 firefighters were called in to tackle the blaze, with crews bringing it under control at about 04 30. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was contained to one half of the nursery. The cause of the fire is not known. A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said Our firefighters were faced with a challenging fire within the nursery and their priority was to save as much of the building as possible. Through the efforts of the firefighters, the fire was successfully contained to one half of the nursery. Firefighters using a thermal image camera were able to check the building for hidden fire travel and effectively extinguish hotspots. Renfrewshire Council said the nursery would be closed on Thursday but the adjoining St James Primary and Mossvale Primary would open as normal.
By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED . 17 28 EST, 12 July 2013 . . UPDATED . 17 38 EST, 12 July 2013 . High demand YSL Forever Light Creator has already been reserved by thousands of women . It goes on sale for the first time today, but it seems the latest face cream that promises miraculous results is already a sellout hit with women. Some 15,000 have downloaded vouchers online for a sample of the Forever Light Creator anti ageing cream, which claims to give you a flawless complexion by using the reflection of light. And more than 3,000 have reserved the product, made by Yves Saint Laurent. In fact, its makers claim, demand is so high that they have set up a helpline for those who discover their nearest pharmacy has run out. The product comes as a lotion or a serum and is said to even out the skin s complexion and remove dark spots and shadows. It apparently contains three types of sugars called glycans which reflect light and make the skin more radiant. Glycans occur naturally in our skin but gradually decline as we age, which is partly why our complexion becomes duller, less flexible and more uneven. The creams cost from 35 to 82, depending on the size of the bottle, and are aimed at women over 25. Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said the product was a world first which had taken three years to develop. Our research has shown that women are now more concerned about age spots and uneven skin tone than they are about wrinkles, she said. Forever Light Creator recreates truly luminous skin. It also significantly reduces the appearance of age spots, the tell tale areas of darker pigmentation which distinguish an older face from the smooth, uniform complexion of youth, and gives skin a flawless look.
The manufacturers claim that after one week of using the cream skin is noticeably improved, and after two months red and dark spots will lighten and the complexion will become more uniform . Face of youth Model Josephine Skriver advertises the product which is so popular that Yves Saint Laurent has set up a helpline for women whose local pharmacy runs out . But experts dismissed such promises and said it was usually impossible for any cream to banish all blemishes. Dr Ross Perry, a cosmetic surgeon for Cosmedics Skin Clinics, said Skin tone and pigmentation are so subjective. There is no miracle treatment. As soon as you go back into the sun or get a bit of a tan, all pigmentation will come back. You can reduce it but it can easily return. He added Even the medically based products that have been clinically proven have a limited efficacy for removing pigmentation. Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist based in Harley Street, said I don t know of any topical non prescription product that will make a major impact on red areas, which usually reflect the presence of dilated blood vessels in the skin as a consequence of either sun damage or rosacea.
A family outing turned into a major archaeological discovery by one New Mexico 10 year old who literally stumbled on a million year old fossil. Jude Sparks was hiking the rugged New Mexico desert some five miles east of Las Cruces by the majestic Organ Mountains in November with his parents Kyle and Michelle and brothers, Hunter,8 and Rhett, 5. Jude said he and his brothers were checking their hand held radios when he tripped on something. I tripped on the bottom of the tusk and fell flat on my face, Jude told Fox News. LOCH NESS MONSTER REDUX DINOSAUR LIKE CREATURE REPORTEDLY SPOTTED IN NORTH CAROLINA LAKE When he turned his head he was looking directly at part of what looked like a jaw bone. It looked like large chunks of bone. Dusting himself off Jude quickly called Hunter who was nearer to the parents to come over to check out what he found. The boys originally thought it looked like a large dark cow skull but when Kyle and Michelle arrived they knew it was something much more relevant than what is typically found in the desert. Kyle said when he returned home he called Peter Houde, professor of Biology at nearby New Mexico State University. ANCIENT LAND DWELLING CROCODILE HAD T. REX SIZED TEETH, STUDY SHOWS When Houde arrived at the site he was amazed at what young Jude tripped on. I think this is only the second full Stegomastodon skull found in the state of New Mexico, Houde said. There was another found at Elephant Butte State Park just north of Las Cruces about two years ago. That one lacks the jaw and it appears the ends of both tusks were broken off, Houde told Fox News. Ours includes the jaw but is missing one tusk so far we may find it yet.
DINO EXTINCTION ALLOWED FROGS TO CONQUER THE PLANET According to Houde, there are only three nearly full Cuvieronius skulls, all of which were found in Bolivia in the early 1900 s. He says this recent discovery is the most complete. Intact skulls of both of these are extremely rare and we ve had unprecedented luck in obtaining the two, Houde said of New Mexico s unearthed prehistoric past. He surmises the fossil Jude tripped over was unearthed by recent rains in the region but never the less, the irony of a youngster tripping over such a historic find while playing with his brothers is inescapable. Houde said these mammoth animals are a primitive group of proboscideans elephantoids from which modern elephants evolved. The recent discoveries are late comers that were not ancestral to anything. THE RISE OF THE DINOSAURS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY VOLCANOES, NEW STUDY FINDS Ours would look pretty much just like modern elephants if they were alive today although the Cuvieronius had spiral tusks, Houde said. Their legs might be a bit stubbier, but the main difference from elephants is in their molar teeth, reflecting a diet more based on browsing than that of modern elephants. Fossils of these animals exist especially in the southern United States, down through Central America, and in some cases into South America, but they are pretty universally represented by very scrappy bits of bone, teeth or tusks. They simply break into small bits as they weather out of the sediment before they are found. The preservation of ours is truly unusual, but a great deal of that may be due to the fact that we were able to locate them while they were still deep underground, Houde said. Houde said the fossil is in remarkably good shape.
The exposure through the dirt did a little damage to a tusk, but nothing that can t fix. The fact that the jaw and skull were found next to one another suggests that there could be, or could have been, other parts of the skeleton preserved not far away. THE SUN MAY HAVE HAD AN EVIL TWIN THAT WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS Part of the delay in releasing information on the find was obtaining permission from the landowner to excavate the site. Kyle said the university requested they did not release any information until all of the pieces were in place which wasn t until just recently. Kyle said there was quite a bit of logistical coordination involved. He said he and Houde decided to cover the specimen with dirt until approval could be obtained. We intend to look but we will not be allowed by the land owner to dig willy nilly without good geological information about where we will likely be successful, Houde said. I m waiting for our geologists to return from summer field schools to look into it. Houde said he isn t very optimistic, saying bones get scattered far and wide and even if they were only 5 10 feet apart that would entail a lot of earth moving given the topography of this location. FOLLOW FOX NEWS TECH ON FACEBOOK But for one little boy, he has a summer memory that will last a lifetime. It s amazing God chose us to find this, he said. Michelle said that the structure of Jude s homeschooling program is part of a co op that will allow him to share is exploits whit his peers who have already been calling wanting to know about the bone. Correction This story has been corrected to clarify that the fossil was not from a dinosaur. Triceratops Was Last Dinosaur Standing The 65 million year old find suggests a meteor may have wiped out the dinosaurs in a sudden catastrophic event.
NMSU experts dig up Las Cruces boy s million year old fossil find Date 07 18 2017 Writer Minerva Baumann, 575 646 7566, mbauma46 nmsu.edu Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google Pinterest A 10 year old boy s accidental discovery in the Las Cruces desert led a New Mexico State University professor to a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year old stegomastodon skull. I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk, said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents and testing walkie talkies with his brothers when he came face to face with the fossil. My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk. The Sparks family contacted NMSU biology professor Peter Houde in November after seeing him interviewed in a YouTube video about a similar fossil found several years ago in a Mesquite quarry about 10 miles south of campus. A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant, said Houde. For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. But they re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico. After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU. In May, the family joined a team of students and professors who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull. Houde explained it took some months to get permission to dig on the property from the landowner, who requested the site remain a secret. It also took time get the special chemicals needed to properly preserve the fossils. The College of Arts and Sciences provided funding for the process. Houde applauded the Sparks family s decision to do the right thing in contacting him about their find.
He encourages others who might come across fossils to reach out to an expert rather than try to dig it up on their own. As you can imagine, when people find out about these things, they might be tempted to go out there and see what they might find themselves and tear up the land or they might hurt themselves, Houde said. To be quite honest, all these fossils from this area are radioactive and especially for children, not something you would want in your home. Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a ton. And while the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate. The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin, Houde said. You can imagine an extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses. That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it. In fact when the sediments are removed from the sides of them, they start to fall apart immediately and literally fall into tiny, tiny bits. It has to be done carefully by somebody who knows how to go about doing it. It is a very deliberate process that takes a little bit of time. During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull. NMSU geology major Danielle Peltier assisted with painstaking process of gently brushing the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applying chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact. Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein.
As we were brushing away the fossil as soon as we removed the sediment we needed to put a type of hardener on there to preserve the structural integrity, otherwise it would just crumble after a few days being left in the sun, Peltier said. Peltier, who will graduate in May 2018, plans to enter a Ph.D. track program and pursue a career as a paleontologist and academic. I ve been fortunate to do field work in Las Cruces, at White Sands and in Kenya, Peltier said. It s amazing to be able to travel, meet remarkable people and realize that you re the first person to be looking at something that might be anywhere from 5,000 to 3 billion years old. After the skull was unearthed, the NMSU team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it. The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university. While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde says the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display. I have every hope and expectation that this specimen will ultimately end up on exhibit and this little boy will be able to show his friends and even his own children, look what I found right here in Las Cruces. They sent an email to a biology professor at nearby New Mexico State University, Peter Houde. He recognized the find almost immediately These were the remains of a long extinct Stegomastodon, and Jude had tripped over its fossilized tusk. Dr. Houde said he gets calls and emails about potential finds from time to time often, they amount to nothing much. But this time, it was different.
This is really very unusual to find, he said, explaining that prehistoric remains are so fragile that they typically disintegrate shortly after erosion exposes them to the elements. The Sparkses simply got lucky by visiting the site shortly after strong rains had exposed the fossil. When Dr. Houde and the Sparks family visited the remains one day after Jude s discovery, they made sure to bury them again. After months of arranging a team, getting money and securing a permit, the skull was finally excavated in May. The creature it belonged to lived at least 1.2 million years ago, Dr. Houde estimated. Some have described Jude s find as a dinosaur discovery, but it s not. The Stegomastodon was an elephantine creature not a mastodon, but similar in appearance whose existence was relatively recent. It walked the earth within the last few million years and may have even been hunted by humans.
Brazil legend Ronaldo believes it is merely a matter of time before Neymar is considered the world s best player. The 38 year old believes Neymar has given the Brazil team a much needed boost, and that the Barcelona star is catching up to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. It is very close. It s about time for Neymar to take his place as the best in the world, the former Real Madrid striker told Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. Brazil legend Ronaldo has insisted it is just a matter of time before Neymar pictured is the world s best player . Barcelona star Neymar has been called upon to lead Brazil to be a great national team once again . Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are the best right now, but Neymar has come a long way. The move to Europe has done him good. And Ronaldo feels Brazil are craving someone like Neymar following a rough spell. We do not have many great players, he admits. We are living with hope in Neymar, who is excellent, the country s best, but at other times we had many others who we could rely on to play for the Brazilian team. Ronaldo believes those such as Ronaldinho, Kaka and Robinho failed to lead the team to its full potential, and that Neymar has to pick up the pieces. Brazil appointed Dunga as manager following their disappointing World Cup on home soil and have won six consecutive matches since. So, was that a good appointment Hard to say. I m not there and I was not asked about the new management, adds Ronaldo. The trauma of 7 1 against Germany very much hurt Brazilians. We can see that this fresh start after six games is good, OK, but we are still being felt. We want to erase that memory. But I have a much better memory, which is 2002 against Germany itself in the World Cup final . I d rather stay with this memory.

CNN The search for an American whose wife says he was shot on a lake that straddles the U.S. Mexican border has been suspended, a Mexican official said Friday. David Hartley was reportedly shot to death September 30 by gunmen investigators believe are linked to a Mexican drug gang. At present, there are no Mexican agencies actively searching Falcon Lake for Hartley. But the mother of Tiffany Hartley the woman who says her husband was shot says she s hopeful that they ll restart on Monday, after meeting with Mexican officials on Friday. Cynthia Young, Tiffany s mother, said said that she, her daughter and Tiffany s dad met with Mexican and American officials for about 8 hours on Friday. Young would not specify which officials attended the meeting but said the family was told that the Mexican government was restrategizing how it is handling the search for Hartley s body. Young said that the day mostly entailed Tiffany refiling a witness statement with Mexican officials, recounting what happened on the day she said he was killed. Young said the meeting occurred in McAllen, Texas, where Tiffany and her husband had recently relocated. Earlier in the day, Tamaulipas state attorney general spokesman Ruben Dario Rios explained the decision to halt the search. Our investigators have taken a temporary recess so that we can better assess the strategies we are using to find the body. We are currently considering other approaches to our search, he said. The search was suspended on Thursday. Responding to local reports that it may have been threats of imminent gun battles by the Los Zetas cartel that led to Mexican officials to suspend the search, Dario Rios said, Negative. We have no official information of threats on our investigators. Tiffany s mother said that we re very disappointed in the development. The longer this goes the less chance there is of finding David, she said.
Tiffany Hartley told authorities the couple was on a sightseeing trip on Falcon Lake, a reservoir on the Rio Grande. She believes the attackers may still have her husband s body. Dario Rios said earlier Friday taht Tiffany Hartley has not responded to the attorney general s formal request for more information about the incident. We still have not spoken to her, he said. Young had said her daughter is willing to meet with Mexican authorities on her terms and on U.S. soil, not in Mexico. Tamaulipas state governor Eugenio Hernandez Flores, in Washington for annual meetings on Mexican U.S. partnerships, was scheduled to meet with FBI officials during his visit Friday to pledge cooperation as authorities look into the matter. He told CNN that Mexican police had deployed dozens of searchers but have found neither a body nor a jet ski. Tiffany said she met with the lead Mexican investigator in the death of her husband days before the police officer was killed and his severed head delivered to authorities in a suitcase. U.S. and Mexican authorities vowed the search for Hartley s husband would continue despite the investigator s slaying on Tuesday. I met him. He sat right next to me, Hartley said, referring to Mexican state official Rolando Armando Flores Villegas. Her remarks aired on CNN s American Morning Thursday. We talked through a translator and he just seemed like a really good guy who really wanted to just do good for you know, his country, Hartley said. Hartley said she wonders if the death of the lead Mexican investigator will hamper the search for her husband. It definitely makes me worried that nobody is going to want to take over, she said. On Thursday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is doing everything it can to find Hartley and told ABC s Good Morning America that she is sickened by the case. I hope that we can find him , said Clinton.
I mean, the beheaded body of the brave Mexican investigator that just showed up shows what we re dealing with. She said the United States is supporting local law enforcement, supporting the authorities on the border, doing everything that we know to do to try to assist in helping to find the body and helping to find the perpetrators. A report issued by a Texas based think tank suggested Thursday that Hartley s death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two Mexican drug cartels. The Stratfor report, which cites anonymous sources, noted that Hartley worked for an oil and gas company with operations in Reynosa, Mexico. The couple had lived there for two years and had only moved to McAllen within the past few months, the report said. The truck they drove to Falcon Lake on September 30 still had a license plate from Mexico s Tamaulipas state. The couple drove their personal watercraft to the Old Guerrero area of the lake, which the report said is a known battleground in the ongoing war in the Los Zetas and Gulf cartels. The sources told Stratfor both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft, so Zetas scouts identified them as possible Gulf spies, because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on Falcon Lake. They were then apparently confronted by Zetas enforcers, Stratfor said. The sources told Stratfor the attack was unauthorized by senior Los Zetas members and a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the Hartleys without proper authorization. Protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group, the report said. Sources said that once Hartley was identified as an American, his body was destroyed the same day as the incident to prevent a backlash from the U.S. government against the group, Stratfor said.
With the heavy diplomatic and public pressure on both U.S. and Mexican authorities to find David Hartley s remains in the investigation, the decapitation of Flores Villegas was a stern signal to both the United States and Mexico that no body will be produced and to leave the situation alone. Falcon Lake is about 70 miles west of the Hartleys home in McAllen. CNN s Ed Lavandera, Eric Fiegel and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.
Two brand new iPhones and the Apple Watch have finally been unveiled but Australian customers can expect to fork out 25 percent more than the US for one of the new handsets when they hit the market next week. The larger iPhone handsets, which were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning, will first hit the market on September 19 and you can pre order one from Friday. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from 869, compared with 649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from 999 in Australia and 749 abroad. The brand new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus range were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning by Apple chief executive Tim Cook . Apple will sell the iPhone 6 in gold, silver and grey and prices will start at 869 for the 16GB model and 999 for the 64GB. For the first time, Apple will sell a 128GB model for 1,129. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen and curved edges, with 38 percent more pixels on the screen than the iPhone 5s. But that s not the biggest model Apple is planning on selling in the new range. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5 inch screen and 185 percent more pixels than the 5S. Like the iPhone 6, the Plus model is also sold in gold, silver and grey but it s naturally more expensive. The iPhone 6 centre has a 4.7 inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus right has a 5.5 inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S left The larger and newer iPhone handsets will first hit the market on September 19 and Australian customers can pre order from this Friday . It will start from 999 for the 16GB model, 1,129 for the 64GB model and 1,249 for a 128GB handset. The latest iPhone, the 5s, currently retails for 749 for the 16GB model.
But the anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company s first foray into the world of wearable items, won t be around until early 2015. Apple fans Salvatore Gerace left and Christian ibrahim get in line early for the new iPhone 6 at the Apple Store in Sydney, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2014. While an Australian price for the watch hasn t yet been announced, it will retail in the US from 349. The watch, which received a standing ovation when it was unveiled, has a rectangular bezel, rectangular sapphire crystal screen, curved edges and is made of metal. It will come in three finishes Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18 karat gold. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from 869, compared with 649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from 999 in Australia and 749 abroad . Apple haven t specified what the battery life was like on the Apple Watch, but did say it would need to be charged each night. The watch works seamlessly with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device. Australian retailers are said to be gearing up to battle it out over the new iPhone range. Optus fired the first canon on Sunday when it revealed people who abandon their existing contracts with rival companies would be given credit to offset cancellation charges if they move to a 24 month Optus plan. The anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company s first foray into the world of wearable items, won t be around until early 2015 . While an Australian price for the watch hasn t yet been announced, it will retail in the US from 349 . The move is timed to take advantage of the pre Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the newly unveiled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi said Optus rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months. This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new Apple handset and some of the barriers come down for switching, Mr Fadaghi said. Prices for the iPhone 6 will start at 869 for the 16GB and 999 for the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model .
Healthy people given the serotonin enhancing antidepressant citalopram were willing to pay almost twice as much to prevent harm to themselves or others than those given placebo drugs Healthy people given the serotonin enhancing antidepressant citalopram were willing to pay almost twice as much to prevent harm to themselves or others than those given placebo drugs in a moral decision making experiment at UCL. In contrast, the dopamine boosting Parkinson s drug levodopa made healthy people more selfish, eliminating an altruistic tendency to prefer harming themselves over others. The study was a double blind randomised controlled trial and the results are published in Current Biology. The research provides insight into the neural basis of clinical disorders characterized by a lack of concern for others, such as psychopathy. Serotonin and dopamine levels have both been linked to aggressive and antisocial behavior, and this study helps explain why. Our findings have implications for potential lines of treatment for antisocial behavior, as they help us to understand how serotonin and dopamine affect people s willingness to harm others for personal gain, says lead author Dr Molly Crockett, who conducted the study at UCL and is now at Oxford University. We have shown that commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs influence moral decisions in healthy people, raising important ethical questions about the use of such drugs. It is important to stress, however, that these drugs may have different effects in psychiatric patients compared to healthy people. More research is needed to determine whether these drugs affect moral decisions in people who take them for medical reasons. The study, conducted by researchers from UCL and Oxford University and funded by the Wellcome Trust, compared how much pain people were willing to anonymously inflict on themselves or strangers in exchange for money. A total of 175 healthy adults took part, 89 randomised to receive citalopram or placebo and 86 randomised to receive levodopa or placebo.
Participants were randomly assigned to the roles of decider and receiver and anonymously paired up such that each decider did not know who the receiver was and vice versa. All participants were given mildly painful electric shocks matched to their pain threshold so that the intensity was not intolerable. Deciders were explicitly told that shocks to receivers would be at the receiver s own pain threshold. Deciders went into a room alone with a computer terminal, and each took part in 170 trials. For each trial, they had to choose between different amounts of money for different numbers of shocks, up to a maximum 20 shocks and 20 per trial. For example, they might be offered a choice of 7 shocks for 10 or 10 shocks for 15. Half of the decisions related to shocks for themselves and half to shocks for the receiver, but in all cases the deciders would get the money. At the end of the session, one of the chosen trial results would be implemented so that the decider or receiver received the shocks and the decider received the profits. As such, their decisions had real consequences. Deciders knew that their decisions would be kept secret so that fear of judgment or retaliation would not skew the results. A similar experiment conducted by the same team previously showed that people disliked harming others more than harming themselves, a behaviour known as hyper altruism . This behaviour was seen again in this study, with most people more willing to harm themselves than others for profit. On average, people given a placebo were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent harm to others. Those on citalopram were far more harm averse, willing to pay an average 60p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Over the course of the experiment, this meant that people on citalopram delivered an average 30 fewer shocks to themselves and 35 fewer shocks to others than those on placebo.
People given levodopa, however, were not willing to pay any more to prevent shocks to others than to prevent shocks to themselves. On average, they were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves or others. This meant that they delivered on average 10 more shocks to others during the experiment than the placebo group. They were also less hesitant to deliver shocks to others, making the decision faster than those on placebo. Trial showed healthy people given a Parkinson s drug became more selfish, while people given a serotonin boosting drug were more protective of others Common drugs for depression and Parkinson s can sway people s moral judgments about harming others, according to research that raises ethical questions about the use of the drugs. The study found that when healthy people were given a one off dose of a serotonin boosting drug widely used to treat depression they became more protective of others, paying almost twice as much to prevent them receiving an electric shock in a laboratory experiment. They also became more reluctant to expose themselves to pain. Serotonin map of brain could lead to better targeted antidepressants Read more The scientists also found that the dopamine enhancing Parkinson s drug, levodopa, made healthy people more selfish, wiping out the normal tendency to prefer to receive an electric shock themselves, while sparing those around them. Molly Crockett, a psychologist at the University of Oxford who led the work, said the finding that a single exposure to the drugs had such a noticeable impact on behaviour challenged the idea that we have stable moral values. Patients taking these drugs are tracked in terms of how their symptoms improve, but not necessarily in terms of how their behaviour changes, she said. In the treatment of Parkinson s, some patients go on to develop compulsive gambling and compulsive sexual behaviour. The drugs have consequences that reach out into the world beyond the patient. She added that it was unclear whether the effects seen in the study would be replicated in patients.
An alternative possibility is that the drugs could bring the behaviour of patients back to baseline by stabilising their psychological state. The central message is we need to have more research into how these drugs affect behaviour, both in healthy people and in people taking them for disorders, she said. In the study, published in the journal Current Biology, 175 participants took part, with 89 assigned to receive the anti depressant citalopram or a placebo and 86 given either levodopa or a placebo. The participants were also randomly designated as deciders or receivers and anonymously paired up. All participants were given mildly painful electric shocks matched to their pain threshold so that the intensity was not intolerable. Deciders were told that shocks to receivers would be at the receiver s own pain threshold. Urgent call for new drugs to treat causes of Parkinson s Read more Deciders went into a room alone with a computer terminal, and each took part in around 170 trials. For each trial, they had to choose between different amounts of money for different numbers of shocks, up to a maximum of 20 shocks and 20 per trial. For example, they might be offered a choice of 7 shocks for 10 or 10 shocks for 15. Half of the decisions made in the trials related to shocks for themselves and half to shocks for the receiver, but regardless of who received the shocks, the deciders would get the money. On average, people given a placebo were prepared to pay around 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent harm to others. Those on citalopram, the seratonin based drug, were far more harm averse, willing to pay an average 60p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Overall, they delivered around 30 fewer shocks to themselves and 35 fewer shocks to others than those on placebo.
People given levodopa, however, were not willing to pay any more to prevent shocks to others than to prevent shocks to themselves. On average, they were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves or others, meaning they delivered on average 10 more shocks to others during the experiment than the placebo group. The dopamine drug made people more selfish, said Crockett. Most people show this pattern where they think it s worse to harm other people than to harm oneself. That s abolished by the drug. The researchers suggest that in future it may be possible to give people a simple test to assess whether their decision making behaviour has been radically altered by a drug, as well as asking them about whether their mood and symptoms have improved. We re not transforming someone from a healthy person into a criminal or anything like that, Crockett said. But in aggregate we make decisions multiple times a day and they can shape our lives. Your moral compass can be influenced more than you think. A new study published in Current Biology shows that using two common drugs, an antidepressant and a treatment for Parkinson s disease, can help sway moral decisions. The researchers randomly designated the subjects as deciders or receivers, while all the participants were given an electric shock based on their own individual pain thresholds. Deciders were to go into rooms by themselves and take part in 170 trials. Within each trial, the subject could choose from different amounts of money for a certain amount of shocks, up to 20 shocks and 20p pence per trial. By the end of the experiment, either the subject received an electric shock or the decision maker got shocked, with the decision maker getting paid either way. The experiment randomly selects half of the group to receive the serotonin enhancing antidepressant citalopram while the other group received levodopa, a dopamine enhancer. Levodopa is commonly used to treat Parkinson s disease. Each of the groups that received medication also were compared against groups who were receiving a placebo.
The researchers were surprised by the potential of the findings. The goal of the experiment was to create a real life decision making process with real consequences in order to see how these specific drugs affect behavior. The central message is we need to have more research into how these drugs affect behavior, both in healthy people and in people taking them for disorders, Molly Crockett, the lead author of the research and neuroscientist at the University of Oxford told The Guardian. In a previous experiment that was conducted by the same team, the results showed that people disliked harming others more than harming themselves. This is behavior referred to as hyper altruism, a term that another study from April of 2015 states is a trait that most people have. That was on display for this study as well. On average, the people given a placebo were prepared to pay 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent it in others. Participants who were given the citalopram were willing to pay an average of 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Conversely, those who were given the drug levodopa were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to others or themselves, meaning that they delivered an average of 10 more shocks to others during the experiment. This gives the impression that the participants who took the drug levodopa were on average more selfish than the participants who took citalopram. What the study also seems to indicate is that while on average most people wouldn t inflict harm on others, with the common drug citalopram, participants were more empathetic toward other people s pain. Lest anyone think that this study can have negative ramifications, as though serotonin enhancing medications would begin to be doled out to everybody to force them to be more empathetic, this study actually might be groundbreaking for the ways in which we can treat people with mood or behavioral disorders.
Our findings have implications for potential lines of treatment for antisocial behavior, as they help us to understand how serotonin and dopamine affect people s willingness to harm others for personal gain. We have shown that commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs influence moral decisions in healthy people, raising important ethical questions about the use of such drugs, Crockett said in a statement.

By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Four people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a spate of attempted letter bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and England, including on a number of Armed Forces recruitment offices. Two men, aged 35 and 46, and two women, aged 21 and 44, are being questioned over the sending of explosive devices to careers offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury, Aldershot, Reading, Chatham and Slough in February. They were detained in Londonderry and have been taken to the Police Service of Northern Ireland s PSNI Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. In October last year, dissident Republicans opposed to the peace process were blamed for sending a series of letter bombs to high profile political and security figures in Northern Ireland and to Army recruiting offices in England. None of the devices detonated. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and former PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott were among those targeted by letters sent to addresses in Northern Ireland . In the Northern Ireland attacks, one of the devices was sent to Stormont Castle in Belfast addressed to Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers. Another bomb was delivered to the offices of the Public Prosecution Service in Londonderry while another two explosive packages one addressed to then PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott and the other to one of his senior commanders were intercepted at Royal Mail offices in Belfast and Lisburn. The sending of bombs in the post marked the re emergence of a terror tactic that was used by paramilitaries during last half of the 20th century in a period known as the Troubles. Since 2009, republican extremists intent on achieving a united Ireland by violent means have murdered two soldiers, two policemen and one prison officer in Northern Ireland, as well as carrying out numerous other attacks on security force targets. The Army Recruitment Centre at The Queensmere Centre in Slough was one of those targeted in the attacks .
Letters addressed to Maghaberry High Security Prison were also intercepted in Northern Ireland . The PSNI said its detectives had been liaising with officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit in England. A PSNI spokesman said Police investigating a series of devices sent to addresses in Northern Ireland and England last year and earlier this year have arrested four people in Londonderry this morning. Two men aged 35 and 46, and two women aged 21 and 44, were arrested in the city and taken to the Serious Crime Suite at Antrim police station for interview. The investigation is being led by detectives from PSNI Serious Crime Branch who have been working in close liaison with officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit in England. In March this year two more letter bombs were intercepted at postal sorting offices in Lisburn and Londonderry. Both were addressed to Maghaberry high security prison in Co Antrim.

Shoppers could be told how their meat has been killed, with labels on the packaging informing them over whether the animal was stunned or unstunned , a government minister has suggested. George Eustice, the Parliamentary under secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, suggested labels such as stunned on the packaging would give a clear definition to consumers. It comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers. Scroll down for video . George Eustice pictured , the Parliamentary under secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, said labels informing consuemrs over how the animal was killed could give clear definition In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling of meat and suggested suppliers used a designated halal logo. It also emerged that major supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury s, Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer were selling the imported meat, while popular restaurant chains such as Pizza Express had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu. Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained. The European Commission is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the European Union should be labelled. But Mr Eustice suggested this week that meat products could be labelled stunned or unstunned, which would effectively alert shoppers as to whether their meat was killed according to religious guidelines. According to The Telegraph, Mr Eustice told MPs Backbenchers have made the point that it would be wrong just to label meat as stunned or unstunned , and that a fairer way would be to list all the different methods of slaughter. The only thing I would say in response is that, from the EU perspective, stunned has a clear legal definition in the legislation, and it is simply that an animal is rendered insensible to pain almost immediately.
Mr Eustice has suggested labels such as stunned or unstunned for meat packaging, to give customers clear information over whether the meat is halal pictured or non halal and suitable under religious guidelines . He also said it would be difficult to brand meat products either kosher or halal because there is no single definition of halal and that a further complication is that not all meat slaughtered by kosher methods is deemed kosher . And he added that it would be complicated to list all of the different methods of slaughter, and said there may not be a huge consumer appetite to do so. HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON HALAL . In comparison, the non halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered. KOSHER . According to the laws, in order for a meat to be kosher it must come from an animal that is ruminant and have split hooves. Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. Huw Irranca Davies, the shadow environment minister, said the labelling of meat had been roundly and rightly rejected by MPs last year.
However, he said that if all different types of slaughter should be labelled then make room on the label for slaughter by electrical current, or by carbon dioxide, inert gas, captive bolt pistol, gunshot or free bullet and so on. Some advocate doing so, and it would certainly satisfy the need for transparency, he added. The row over the labelling of halal meat was sparked in May when it emerged millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told. Several restaurants such as Pizza Express, KFC and Subway were found to be selling halal meat mainly chicken without printing the information on menus. Chains including Domino s, GBK, Nando s, KFC, Ask and Slug Lettuce also admitted to using halal meat in some dishes, mainly chicken, and locations. At least ten top higher education establishments including Oxford University and the University of Manchester were also found to be secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals. In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served was found to unlabelled halal meal, while all the chicken served at universities in Sheffield and Exeter which is halal was not marked as so. Cardiff and Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat, without telling consumers. It also emerged that most of the major supermarkets were selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels. The switch to slaughtering animals in line with Islamic ritual helps supermarket chains save money because the end product can be eaten by Muslims and non Muslims alike. Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, which is said to leave them in pain.
The ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers was sparked in May, after it was revealed millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told file picture In conventional slaughterhouses, cows, sheep and chicken are stunned, usually with an electric shock, to ensure they are unconscious before their throats are cut. This is said to minimise their suffering. After it emerged that halal was widely sold unknowingly to consumers, Mr Clegg demanded better labelling of meat. He said that while he personally had no problem eating halal meat, produce should be clearly labelled because consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate. Religious groups from all faiths, vets and animal welfare groups have also previously joined calls for new labels to identify halal or kosher meat.
Warner Bros TV has so far failed to reach any agreement with Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar over salaries. Production may be delayed if new deals are not reached in the next two weeks. According to the Hollywood Reporter, though, the cast are still expected to return to work. The long running CBS sitcom was extended for a further three series earlier this year. The show, which centres on a group of high functioning science geeks , will now air until at least 2017. The Hollywood Reporter claims that Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco currently earn 325,000 Â 190,000 per episode and are now seeking up to 1m Â 584,000 per show. Such a deal would make them the highest paid actors on US television ahead of Ashton Kutcher and Jon Cryer from Two and a Half Men, currently understood to be the most rewarded TV actors.
Orlando, Florida CNN Five hundred kids screamed when singer Ne Yo walked in on their holiday party on a recent Saturday bearing gifts and a message of hope. This is the first famous person I actually met, exclaimed Tha Banks, 16, with a huge smile. Banks, a sports fan, got a new football autographed by the R B superstar. Banks isn t Ne Yo s typical fan he and the other teens at the party are part of Florida s foster care system, all seeking a life free from neglect and abuse. For the past five years, Shaffer Ne Yo Smith has visited underprivileged children across the country, bringing toys, games, shoes and clothing as part of his charity s annual giving tour. Ne Yo and his mother, who is president of his foundation, recently visited six cities in six days, bringing Christmas gifts to more than 3,000 kids at Boys and Girls clubs, group homes and in foster care. He also talks to the children about his personal experiences. I grew up pretty much like you all, Ne Yo told the teens at the central Florida foster home. We didn t have a lot of anything ... there was no silver spoon in my mouth. A father of two himself, Ne Yo said he sees his children in the faces of the kids he meets at these events. It s hard for me to fathom any parent that would abandon their kids for whatever reason, said Ne Yo, the father of a 1 year old and a 3 month old. That doesn t compute with me. The holiday party was organized by the Kids House of Seminole County, which cares for 2,300 kids each year between the ages of 3 and 18, including victims of neglect, and others who witness domestic violence, or experience physical or sexual abuse, according to Marcie Dearth of Kids House.
This is an annual party that kids host every year, but we never have had the celebrity presence that we did this year, Dearth said, calling Ne Yo s visit a lifetime experience. The kids frost cookies and decorate stockings for the holiday season a tough time for these children, who are separated from their families. These events help fill that void, that excitement of the holiday spirit that all kids should have, said John Cooper, assistant secretary of operations for the Florida Department of Children and Families. More than 400,000 children are in the foster care system in the United States, according to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report. With about 19,000 kids in foster care, Florida has the fourth largest number of kids in state care, behind California, New York and Texas, according to the 2010 report. At the party, volunteers handed out wrapped presents donated by Ne Yo s charity, the Compound Foundation Toys for Tots Coca Cola Mattel Ubisoft and other corporate partners. Destiny Molina, 15, unwraps her gift a box filled with bottles of nail polish. You know what s funny, she says. The girls at the other foster house stole my other nail polish, and I have been trying to buy it back. She turns to her friend to ask what she got. Makeup, replies Karla Hurtado, 16. Oh that s cute, Molina says. Molina said this was going to be a good Christmas, something that doesn t happen every year for children in foster care. We don t have Christmases like this all the time, she said, a little choked up. Ne Yo told the room full of kids that he was living, breathing proof that you need to find something that you love to do and stick with it. He said something that motivates yet frustrates him is hearing foster kids referred to as forgotten children.
All you need for success is drive, passion and one person to give a damn to give you a shot, Ne Yo said. And you have a room full of people like that. Mercedes Noble, 17, says she was grateful to meet Ne Yo, who she said seemed to be a real person, just like her. The tall teen said foster care is not the best place to be at Christmas everyone would rather be with their families. Noble said, though, It s way better to be here with people who love and care for us than be at home and probably getting beat. With a big smile, the teen said, I appreciate that he took time out of his life and come and show respect to us, kindness let us know that we are still human, we are still people and we still need love.

Mountaineering Scotland wrote a joint letter with the Scottish Gamekeepers Association. It asked for upland moors to be protected from commercial tree planting. The letter to the environment secretary was prompted by the Scottish government s draft Climate Change Plan. It sets a target of increasing forest cover from 17 to 25 of the land mass by 2050. Following the letter, many Mountaineering Scotland members have said they support the planting of native species and describe the moorland as a man made habitat. Others have questioned the group s association with gamekeepers. The outdoors writer and TV presenter Cameron McNeish wrote on Twitter Disagree with Mountaineering Scotland over the issue of woodlands. Shocked they have got into bed with moorland owners. My own preference would be for reducing deer and sheep numbers to allow natural regeneration, not planting. Growth can be incredibly fast. BBC Scotland revealed on Wednesday that the joint letter had been sent to the Scottish government. The letter states Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country. Responding to the criticism, chief executive David Gibson said Mountaineering Scotland welcomes the passion shown by our members and others but regrets that our position has been substantially misunderstood and has caused concern to members. The feedback has strengthened our resolve to take a stronger stance on conservation issues, including hill tracks and land management practices. Our collaboration with the Scottish Gamekeepers Association was on a single issue and does not indicate agreement with them on any other policy or issue. Mountaineering Scotland, formerly the Mountaineering Council of Scotland MCofS , issued a clarification on Thursday saying they were not opposed to the planting of native trees.
Outdoor writer Chris Townsend said Having read the clarification, I have to say as a member and an ex president of the MCofS I think it s pathetic, disappointing and naive. But Reforesting Scotland, a charity which promotes tree planting, backed the underlying call for a government policy on upland moors. A spokesman told BBC Scotland Scotland s upland landscape is largely a man made construct caused by deforestation and maintained that way through excessive grazing and burning for the benefit of a few. There is a need to protect areas of valuable moorland but not at the level it exists at present. The balance is wrong and we need to bring all interested parties together to decide where that new balance should lie. Professor Dominick Spracklen, of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, said The distinction between plantation forestry and native woodlands is absolutely critical to this discussion open, patchy native woodlands do not have the impact on grand vistas that dense plantation forestry does. Citing Glen Affric, Glen Strathfarrar, Glen Feshie and Beinn Eighe, he added These are iconic landscapes a mix of native trees, moorland and mountain that are much more interesting than they would be if they had no trees. The clarification from the Mountaineering Council recognises this. The Scottish government s draft Climate Change Plan includes planting more trees because forests can act as a carbon sink , removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. A spokesman said The increased woodland creation targets announced by the Scottish government as part of its Climate Change Plan will be taken forward in a sustainable way, including working closely with a range of stakeholders. This will include appropriate consideration of Scotland s distinctive upland landscapes.
Alastair Cook insisted he would be leading England at next year s World Cup despite falling for just one run as Sri Lanka clinched the one day series in Pallekele. Cook s latest failure with the bat was part of a dismal 90 run defeat for England, who now trail 4 2 in this seven match series. He also dropped a crucial catch, putting down Kumar Sangakkara on 41. The Sri Lanka batsman went on to make a match winning 112. Alastair Cook says his dropping of Sri Lanka s Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a really costly drop Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI . Cook, the England captain, said Days like these don t make the job any easier. It s tough, not scoring the runs I d like. It s not a great place to be as a captain. I m a better player than I m showing at the moment. I ve just got to keep going. Cook, who averages 17 in this series and has made only one half century in his last 21 one day innings, was confirmed as World Cup captain a week ago and seems to be in no mood to relinquish the job. But when coach Peter Moores was asked by Sky Sports to confirm Cook s captaincy, he said We review everything at the end of every series. We ve always said that. We make no bones that we re passionate to try to get our best side to go out and win a World Cup. Cook needs runs but he s also had some great times as an England player. He s in a tough patch but that s something he s working hard to get out of. Sangakkara leaves the field in Kandy for the final time after spearheading Sri Lanka s 90 run ODI win . The keeper batsman s team mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series .
Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run a ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one day international on his home ground. It set up a 90 run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play. Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports It didn t help, me dropping Sanga on 40 was a really costly drop . That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we d built up quite a lot of pressure on them. It was probably a 260 run wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that. After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one . England coach Moores said We felt we could draw the series level today but we ve been outplayed in all departments. We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you ve got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well. We made some errors and didn t field as well as we could have. Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said It was a challenging wicket to bat on but Sanga was amazing once again. Together with Tillakaratne Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end. The older he Sangakkara gets, the more runs he scores. Sangakkara himself added It s great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling.
I ve had a wonderful career and it s extra special to finish off with a win.

The brave photographer admits he had still prepared an escape route should the cheetah not stop running . The big cats can accelerate from a walking speed to about 40mph in less than two seconds . He said I was always ready to move quickly. Laura Bongiorni, who accompanied Mr Mangini on the trip, added Young cheetahs arrive at the centre from different places, mainly from South Africa. The cheetah population in Zambia, as well as lions, suffered from a strong impoverishment. The centre started a very special cheetah breeding programme aimed at breeding captive cheetahs for their young to be released into appropriate National Parks and conservancies around Zambia where cheetahs once roamed freely but are now at a point of near extinction. Mr Mangini shows just how close he can get to the cheetahs which were raised in a breeding programme .

By . Sarah Johnson . PUBLISHED . 13 02 EST, 17 December 2012 . . UPDATED . 11 16 EST, 18 December 2012 . Christmas is a time for overindulgence. But this hungry hound took it too far when he swallowed a foot of fairy lights. Charlie, a seven year old crossbreed . dog from Southampton, had to be rushed to the operating table and saved by a team of vets who performed . life saving surgery on him. Scroll down for video . All lit up A team of vets had to operate on a dog that swallowed a foot of Christmas fairy lights . Owner Sharon Fay, who refers to her dog as the light of her life , became concerned when she noticed bits of wire sticking out of Charlie s faeces in the garden. The 45 year old said I hadn t even noticed that the lights had been chewed at this stage but it quickly became clear what had happened. Back in March he ate one of my scarves and needed an operation to remove it, but I thought it was just a one off incident as he hadn t shown any signs that he was going to be a repeat offender. I ve had dogs all my life and have never known a dog act like this before. An X ray shed light on Charlie s problem the tangled remains of the decorations showed up in his stomach and would have proved fatal if they were not removed. Shedding light on the situation This X ray shows the tangled remains of the decorations in the dog s stomach . A light snack Charlie eyes up some fairy lights. He has a track record for eating bizarre objects like his owner s scarf . Vets rushed Charlie to the operating table and removed the Christmas decorations, also finding a shoelace. PDSA senior veterinary surgeon Sophie Bell said that she had never seen a case like this before.
Over the years I ve seen plenty of cases of dogs swallowing strange objects socks, dummies, rubber ducks, but it s the first time any of us have treated a dog that has actually eaten fairy lights, she said. A foreign body of this nature could easily have caused severe internal injuries so Charlie was very, very lucky. He was also fortunate that the glass didn t cut his mouth or throat. And he could have been electrocuted if he d bitten through the wire when the lights were switched on. Light of my life Owner Sharon Fay became concerned when she saw bits of wire sticking out of Charlie s faeces in the garden . With the Christmas season upon us, I d advise owners to keep any edible items out of reach of inquisitive pets to avoid them from becoming ill over the festive season. Charlie returned home and has since gone on to make a full recovery, much to the delight of his owner. Ms Fay said I ll certainly be keeping an extra close eye on him from now on and have Charlie proofed my house now. PDSA is advising pet owners to be extra cautious this Christmas. Its vets see many cases of pets getting their paws on inappropriate festive items every year, ranging from Christmas decorations, chocolate and cocktail sticks to toys, balloons and bones.
Shocking claims of abuse within a secret NSW based religious group have come to light after former members revealed the years of torment they endured at the hands their cult leader . Self styled guru Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use. In harrowing and chilling detail, a young woman has recounted the experience of being born into and growing up in a twisted religious cult, as part of an in depth investigation by ABC s Four Corners. Emily Wassmann s involvement in the Christian Assemblies International CAI was predetermined before her birth, as her parents were both members of the church , and she described her childhood as a series of terrifying, confusing and lonely circumstances. Scroll down for video . Emily Wassmann relived the horrific experience of growing up in cult religious group Christian Assemblies International in a revealing interview with ABC S Four Corners on Monday evening . The teaching was that a child was born evil and that that had to be beaten out of them with a rod of iron, she told the program. Denied a life outside the church, at 14 Ms Wassaman told her parents she wanted to leave the group. She stayed living in their house but said they did not speak to her. Shortly after, at just 15, she was sent away to Canada to live with another church member. Here the young woman battled with her mental health and came close to attempting suicide on a number of occasions. Unlike some, Ms Wassmann and her parents escaped the Assembly, but said other young people who were born into the cult and left all experienced similar hardship. Every. Single. One. When she was just 15, Ms Wassmann, pictured with her father, was sent away to live with church members in Canada after she told her parents she wanted to leave the group .
Also revealed on the program was the slave like status women in the church were afforded, and the verbal and physical abuse they suffered at the hands of the men in the CAI. Every aspect of their lives were monitored, from what they wore to how they raised their children. But the most shocking account was from a man named Gunther Frantz whose former wife was beaten by other men. In front of a group of men, stripped down to her underwear Mr Frantz s former wife was beaten with a wooden stick while her husband wasn t present apparently for her lack of obedience. She was pregnant at the time, but her husband was unaware of this. When asked how he felt when he discovered his wife had been physically assaulted in his absence, Mr Frantz simply said Makes you sick to your guts, doesn t it Gunther Frantz was one of Pastor Scott Williams closest confidantes in the cult, and revealed his former wife had been beaten by other men in the church . Also aired in the shocking report, dozens of former members said bizarre sexual rituals were carried out in secret by Mr Williams, who had been given authorisation by God to sidestep biblical commands against homosexuality and train his male member to be sexually obedient. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, ranged from spiritual, financial, verbal and physical abuse to sexual abuse of adult male members. I haven t come across anything like it, Four Corners reporter Caro Meldrum Hanna told Daily Mail Australia ahead of the episode going to air on Monday night. Former members describe it as a cult. Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use .
Meldrum Hanna, who came across the story back in 2010, spoke to dozens of former members in Australia and across the world and she said all of their claims made against Mr Williams were similar. Initially it appeared almost unbelievable because it was so extreme. But it happened, she said. In the first six months you are treated like royalty but after that the screws turn. In order for Scott Williams to trust you, you had to give more of yourself, particularly for men. Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was The Anointed One . Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was The Anointed One These people are so normal. Many weren t religious but they say they were preyed upon. So you can get an idea of how they were controlled, Meldrum Hanna said. Mr Williams left Australia 38 years ago to convert hundreds of young people to his religious group throughout Europe. The headquarters of CAI are now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW. Meldrum Hanna said the revelations weren t just based on the testimony of former members, but documents and financial records from CAI. There was enormous pressure placed on members to donate to this organisation. We re talking 10 percent of their gross income plus many more offerings throughout the year, she said. The various former members interviewed by Four Corners left Mr Williams group over a number of years but said there was a mass exodus in 2006. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, will be aired as part of a four year ABC investigation . The headquarters of Christian Assemblies International group is now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW .
The ones who allege they were abused by Scott Williams... were concerned about others, like their own sons, so they came together to blow the whistle internally within the church, Meldrum Hanna said. Police carried out a four year investigation of the CAI group and the results of that investigation will be revealed by Four Corners when it airs on Monday night. The program approached Mr Williams and senior people in the church about the claims, but all requests for interviews were denied. Mr Williams, now 70, lives with his wife Ree in a beachfront apartment in Coffs Harbour. It is one of the many properties he purchased with church donations.
Refugees spoke at the gathering on Queen Street, as calls were made for concrete action. The Welsh Refugee Council s Hannah Wharf welcomed moves to resettle 20,000 Syrians displaced by war in the UK. Meanwhile, there was a demonstration on Swansea s Castle Square and a human chain is planned in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. Ms Wharf said Wales has made it clear that we are prepared to welcome refugees. Winter is fast approaching for many of the most vulnerable in the refugee camps that neighbour Syria. The need for resettlement is now. Methodist minister Paul Martin, who is based in Canton, Cardiff, called it the most serious human made disaster of our time . David Cameron announced on Monday that the UK would accept up to 20,000 people from camps surrounding Syria with priority given to vulnerable children. First Minister Carwyn Jones will hold a Wales summit on the refugee crisis next week. Local authorities in Wales have said they are willing to play their part but asked for help to meet the costs.
She s one of the most polished A listers in Tinseltown so it comes as little surprise that Victoria Beckham is passing on her beautifying tips to daughter Harper.

The two limited edition shades a warm tomato red and a pale bone hue are inspired by the designer s yet to be unveiled Victoria Victoria Beckham spring summer 2015 collection. While we saw the main Victoria Beckham collection at New York Fashion Week in September, the new polishes offer us a first hint of what Mrs Beckham has in store for her second fashion line next season. According to a press release, the upcoming VVB collection features subtle nods to Japanese culture, and this is certainly reflected in the nail polish names Judo Red and Bamboo White. The mother of four told Vogue I m very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we re in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw pedicure Beauty collaboration Victoria Beckham s nail polish duo with Nails Inc was one of her highs of 2014 . The exclusive formulation of the new nail varnishes features silica rich bamboo extract, which apparently conditions and feeds the nail bed with essential nutrients.
She and Harper both love the orangey red shade. I choose it when I m wearing something uncomplicated, like all black, she added. The collaboration is a final highlight in what has been a busy and successful year for Mrs Beckham. The designer was given the prestigious Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards 2014. Impeccably manicured Victoria picked up the Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards earlier this year . Proving all of her early critics wrong, Victoria Beckham has doubled sales of her fashion business to 30.39million in just two years. The businesswoman reported sales of 15.76million in 2012. And according to The Sun, Victoria Beckham Ltd made a 1.3m profit in 2013 selling 83,000 worth of stock or 55 handbags priced at 1,500 per day. The designer, who debuted her first collection of dresses at New York Fashion Week in 2008, has expanded her business to include handbags, shoes, sunglasses, denim, a sister line titled Victoria Victoria Beckham, and even a luxury nail polish collection in collaboration with Nails Inc. The rising sales are thought to be thanks to her recently launched website and her September store opening on Dover Street in Mayfair, London, where hundreds of fans waited in line for the doors to open. A hint of what s to come The two limited edition shades are inspired by the designer s yet to be unveiled Victoria Victoria Beckham spring summer 2015 collection .
For Luis Figo, Monday s Ballon d Or announcement is a straight fight between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi but there s only one winner. The former Portugal international, who played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona, says his fellow countryman Ronaldo has to retain his crown. And, rather amusingly, Figo claims the pair are the truffles and caviar of world football. Cristiano Ronaldo should win the Ballon d Or for a second year running, according to Luis Figo . Former Portugal international Figo says Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the truffles and caviar of world football . Messi has won the Ballon d Or four times out of the last five years for his performances for Barcelona . Messi was in fine form and on the scoresheet as Barcelona beat Elche 5 0 in the Copa del Rey on Thursday . Ronaldo, whose goals last season fired Real to a first Champions League title since 2002, is the favourite to beat both Messi and World Cup winner Manuel Neuer. It s hard to choose between truffles and caviar, but for me it has to be Cristiano. He s had a fantastic year all the way through for Real, Figo said. Neuer the sweeper goalkeeper to have captured the imagination long before the summer tournament in Brazil would become the first stopper to claim the prize since Lev Yashin 52 years ago. And while Figo is insistent Ronaldo will take the gong, he does understand the clamour for Neuer. I know Germany won the World Cup and I understand there are those who think Neuer, who is such a great keeper and was a big part of their success, should win it, he added. Figo says he understands why there is a clamour for Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to win . Germany goalkeeper Neuer left celebrates winning the World Cup with Bastian Schweinsteiger last year .
Neuer saves a shot from France striker Karim Benzema during the World Cup in Brazil last summer . Messi will be there without the Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu, who is to boycott the ceremony in protest at the transfer ban imposed upon the club by FIFA. The Catalans are not allowed to make any signings in the next two transfer windows because of a breach of rules relating to the signing of international players under the age of 18. FIFA has not told us who made the original charge and during the period of the sanction we will not maintain any institutional relations with them, Bartomeu said. I have sent a stern letter to Sepp Blatter and I will not be attending the FIFA Ballon d Or gala set for January 12. Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu will not attend the ceremony after being slapped with a transfer ban . Luis Figo was speaking at the launch of his new social media platform Network 90 .
The 19 year old midfielder inked a five year deal and has been loaned out to Salzburg s feeder club FC Liefering who play in Austria s second tier. Mwepu a key member of the Young Chipolopolo side that won the Under 20 Africa Cup in March moves to Austria from Zambia s first division side Kafue Celtics. I m so happy that my dream of playing in Europe has become a reality, Mwepu told BBC Africa Sport on Thursday. I know this league will give me experience and it will help me in so many ways. The tempo of my game will definitely go up and most importantly, I will have game time. Nicknamed Computer , Mwepu was outstanding as Zambia reached the quarter finals of the World Cup in South Korea. His goal in the 4 2 win over Iran was included in the tournament s top 10. I define discipline as the distance between dreams and reality, he opined. I had a dream to pursue and today it has become a reality. Mwepu joins compatriot Patson Daka who also signed for Salzburg in January before being sent out to Liefering.
Fiona Barnes, who also faked terminal cancer, was jailed for 15 months for the theft from Preston s Space Centre and perverting the course of justice. The 55 year old was ordered to pay back 1 at a Proceeds of Crime hearing at the city s crown court after she was found to have no money to her name . The centre said the ruling was outrageous and a complete insult . Barnes, of Brigend, Dunblane, stole 24,713 from the Space Centre in 2012. She tried to cover her tracks by faking documents indicating the centre had won non existent grants of up to 800,000 and was jailed in September 2016. Speaking after the hearing, Jane Robinson, deputy manager of the Space Centre, said It is a complete insult. I d rather she didn t pay anything than she pays 1. After what she did, it just seems outrageous. She nearly ruined us. The centre was bought out by charitable company Creative Support, based in Manchester, which has secured its future. The Space Centre, which opened in 1993 and has three sensory rooms, is the UK s largest multi sensory environment and supports children with physical, learning or emotional difficulties.
An aid worker battling the deadly and fast spreading Ebola virus in West Africa said the area is completely unprepared to deal with the crisis. Ali Readhead, originally from Perth in Western Australia, has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing. It s chaos , she told Daily Mail Australia. They re totally under resourced. Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don t have any room. Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region . In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus. They re just waiting for people to die to free up the beds, Ms Readhead said. Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children s health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease. But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military , Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can t. The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation. The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected . Ali centre seen here at the christening of her god daughter, said it is impossible to contain Ebola without expert military medical teams from Australia, the UK and the US . I ve never been more devastated in my life.
Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds. It s terrifying, and to be honest I m not sure anyone knows when or how it ll end. What I saw will stay with me forever in some places there aren t enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead, Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org. Just last week there was a direct request made by the government in Sierra Leone to Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Ms Readhead said she believes there is hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there is a risk of infection. The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy. Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system. In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals . Ms Readhead centre celebrated Australia day with fellow countrymen in Freetown this year . People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years. Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don t take them to the hospital , Ms Readhead revealed. The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients. She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work. One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area.
The country s government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone s second senior physician to die of Ebola . Fellow Australian Jo Dunlop left and British doctor Oliver Johnson have been fighting alongside Ms Readhead centre to keep Freetown s main isolation centre open . If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received. The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease. We don t have that level of contact in Australia... and we ve got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures , Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country. Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life. Ms Readhead ran the Sierra Leone marathon last year with her mum there to show her support . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun. Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with investments in the pipelines are being disbanded. The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned. It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them. Unless we have those two things on the ground we don t stand a chance. On Thursday evening the World Bank announced they would be providing a further 190 million AUD to go towards fighting the deadly virus outbreak.

By . Katy Winter . Over 21 per cent of participants in the Heidelberg research used their lucid dream to practice a skill such as a sport . It seems like the ultimate lazy girl s fantasy or the plot of a science fiction movie. But new research has revealed sporting performance can be improved while we sleep. It comes down to lucid dreaming essentially the sort of dream you have while fast asleep but in which you aware you are dreaming and can thus control your dream world. Studies have for some time noted a link between lucid dreaming during REM sleep and improved athletic performance, but had never isolated the reason why. Now research by Heidelberg University and published in the Guardian s running blog shows that the improvement stems from the fact that your mind believes you are practising the sport for real. Sportsmen and women who have engaged in training while they sleep have described enhanced performance after practising such things as a complex move, a tricky shot in basketball or a free kick in football over and over again. Others have controlled their dreams to make themselves run faster, or for longer without tiring, or simply told themselves they can move past feelings of exhaustion to carry on running. One ballerina in the study describes struggling with a complicated move for some time before sleep practising it and found she could then perform it in real life too. Though scientists are not yet certain of what brain activity is behind lucid dreaming, research by Muzur, Pace Schott and Hobson has suggested that activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, usually deactivated during REM Rapid Eye Moment sleep may be responsible for us regaining self awareness while still asleep. The amygdala and parahippocampal cortex is less intensely activated than normal to allow us to maintain self awareness and yet remain asleep. Previous research has proved that lucid dreamers are indeed asleep, but are aware that they are in a dream. Dreamers have been able to signal to researchers from within their dream using pre agreed eye movements.
In the 1980s German psychologist Paul Tholey was the first to note the link between lucid dreaming and improved performance, and in 2010 psychologists Erlacher and Schredl showed that practising a coin tossing task in lucid dreams led to an improved objective performance. It all sounds too good to be true. But becoming an accomplished lucid dreamer is not necessarily easy. If you do not naturally lucid dream it is possible to train yourself to do so. The first step is to be able to recognise that you are in a dream once asleep, which some people attempt to do by performing reality checks in a dream. However it takes considerable training to be able to perform these within a dream. Once aware you are dreaming, the dreamer . must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Most people can train themselves to lucid dream, and the possible uses for being aware and in control of your dream world are endless . However the benefits once mastered are said to be incredible with people not only being able to change nightmares into positive dreams and problem solve while asleep, but also report having immense fun. Being able to control the dream world means people report enjoying anything from flying to making a cake as large as a house, indulging in sexual fantasies and curing nightmares. Note down your target dream. What do you want to dream about Who will you be and what will you be doing What is your goal in the dream Meditate on the narrative before you go to sleep. Imagine the scenes you will appear in and what you will do. Draw pictures, use visualisation. Focus on the detail don t be too general. Make your fantasy specific. Avoid television or books before bed or those stories and images may take over your own narrative. Recognise that you are in a dream once asleep. Some people attempt . this by performing reality checks in a dream. Ask yourself regularly during the day am I dreaming Am I awake .
Once habitual, this thought process can be carried over into your dream world, . Once aware you are dreaming, be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Think about your dreams when you wake up this will help you remember them and allow them to have more effect. Learn more at Lucidity.com .
BOGOTA, Colombia CNN Preliminary DNA tests indicate a 3 year old foster child is the son of a woman being held captive by leftist rebels, Colombian officials announced Friday. Clara Rojas appears in a video released by the kidnappers in July 2002. There is a very high probability that Juan David belongs to the family of Clara Gonzalez de Rojas, Mario Iguaran Arana, the country s chief federal prosecutor, said at a news conference. The boy, known as Emmanuel, has been at the center of a hostage drama that raised hopes the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia would liberate some of their hostages. The rebel group, known as FARC for its Spanish acronym, had agreed to release three hostages as part of a deal brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. FARC said it would release Emmanuel along with his mother, Clara Rojas, and another woman, Consuelo Gonzalez, but the mission to free the captives fell apart December 31, when the rebel group said it could not release the hostages because of Colombian military operations in the area, according to a FARC statement Chavez read on Venezuelan television. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe denied the group s assertion, saying there were no combat operations in the area near the rebels, and he said the rebels could not release the three hostages because they did not have Emmanuel in custody. He raised the possibility that Emmanuel, who was born in captivity to Rojas, was living in a foster home in the Colombian capital of Bogota. Authorities in Colombia suspect the FARC duped child welfare authorities by presenting the boy as a child in need of foster care in 2005, he said. On Friday, Iguaran Arana said initial DNA results will be checked against tests being done in European labs to verify the child s identity. There was no immediate response from Venezuela after the announcement concerning Emmanuel s DNA.
However, a statement on the Venezuelan government s Web site from earlier Friday said the Colombian government had not allowed Venezuela to participate in the DNA testing. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia s oldest, largest, most capable and best equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State. The United States, the European Union and Colombia classify it as a terrorist group. FARC has justified hostage taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long running and complex civil war that also has involved right wing paramilitary units, government forces and drug traffickers. Fighting has waned, but not stopped, in recent years. Among the group s hostages are three American contractors who were captured when their plane went down in 2003 during a drug eradication flight, and Ingrid Betancourt, a French Colombian independent presidential candidate who was kidnapped in 2002. Rojas was kidnapped in 2002 while she managed Betancourt s campaign. Betancourt is perhaps the best known captive in Colombia, a country plagued by kidnapping. E mail to a friend .

The pair, who took over from Ian Davies in the summer, have agreed to stay at the Mennaye until May 2019. Both had long playing careers with the club and were assistants to Davies before taking over after cost cuts forced him to leave. The Pirates have also brought in former England forward and Nottingham coach Martin Haag on a part time basis. Paver and Cattle have led the Pirates to fifth place in the Championship this season, one point off the play off places. We ve been very fortunate to have a chance to come straight out of playing and coach at Championship level, Cattle told BBC Sport. I think we ve made a made a decent fist of it this year, there s been a lot of off pitch matters that gave us that opportunity, but we re chuffed that the board have given us the chance. The pair were teammates for over a decade and Cattle says the friendship they built up in that time makes it easy to organise their roles in joint charge. If you don t agree with something you can be open and honest and if you don t have that relationship you might have to tiptoe around a topic, he added. Working with him is pretty easy, we re two different characters and in terms of our coaching approach, we know how each other works and know when to step away, and we have a good relationship off the pitch as well.
CNN A journal written by the 19 year old gunman in last week s Maryland mall shooting offers no clues to a key question investigators are asking whether Darion Aguilar knew the young man and woman he shot and killed before turning the gun on himself. While police in Howard County, Maryland, are not yet releasing the contents of the journal, they said Tuesday that from his writings, it appears Aguilar knew he had mental health issues. They did not elaborate on that point. But why did he go to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday and fire as many as nine shots into a skateboard apparel shop Gunman s mother says he was gentle, sweet Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, a friend of his family said. As of now, that s the only known link between him and the skate shop Zumiez. Investigators are distributing fliers with Aguilar s picture to those in and around the mall, in hopes of finding people who either knew him or saw him. Aguilar was known to frequent the mall, according to police, where he would hang outside and smoke in small groups. Investigators are also working on retrieving data from Aguilar s computer and cell phone, according to police. Still, his motive remains a mystery. It started out as a routine day in busy mall . Aguilar s mother told reporters Sunday that her son was a gentle, sweet kid, and that she doesn t think he knew his victims 21 year old Brianna Benlolo and 25 year old Tyler Johnson. On Saturday, a federal official briefed on the shooting told CNN that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at Benlolo and Johnson, perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree. I know there s a lot of interest in the motive for this, and I have as much interest in that as anybody, Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said Sunday. Benlolo was an assistant manager at Zumiez.
She had worked there since November 2012, according to her Facebook page. Friend Evelyn McDonald said Benlolo, the mother of a small boy, was just full of energy. She was so nice and just an amazing artist and just an amazing person inside and out, McDonald told CNN. She loved her son. She loved being a mother, McDonald said. Cops Mall gunman expressed general unhappiness in journal . Johnson had worked at the store for about three months, according to his Facebook page. Five people went to the hospital for treatment after the shooting. All were treated and released. Four suffered injuries in the chaos after the shooting. The other injured victim suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. Police said the woman wasn t in Zumiez rather, she was on the first floor when she was hit. The mall reopened Monday afternoon, but the Zumiez store will be closed indefinitely, according to a sign on the boarded up storefront. The simple thing your mall can do to protect you .

Neighbour Zhou Bo went outside of his own property after hearing a commotion in the street in Lingwu, Ningxia, China. It was then he spotted the young boy dangling from a fourth storey window with his head wedged between metal bars. Helping hand Zhou Bo went to the aid of a young boy left dangling from a fourth storey window after getting his head stuck in a grid in Lingwu, Ningxia, China . Dangerous Zhou Bo managed to prevent the boy from suffocating by holding him up by his feet while also balancing on stool perched on a window sill . He said I went there, and saw a boy dangling in the air, as his head was stuck in between the window grid. Zhou could see that the boy was suffocating as his feet had nothing to stand on. He dashed inside and raced up to the flat but found the door locked. He then went one floor below but discovered that the gap between that window and the dangling boy was too great. Zhou said Without help, the boy would be suffocated soon, or he has the danger of dropping down . So Zhou found a chair and balanced it precariously on the third storey window ledge before standing on it and supporting the trapped boy s feet from underneath. I felt time froze, and my arms went numb but firemen still didn t arrive, said Zhou. Finally, firefighters arrived 40 minutes later and were able to break into the apartment and pull the boy, who had been left home alone, to safety. Waiting game Zhou Bo had to hold the position for 40 minutes until firefighters arrived at the scene .

HUNTINGTON, Utah CNN Rescuers trying to find six miners will begin boring a sixth hole down into Utah s Crandall Canyon mine Friday, and the search will stop if no signs of life are found, the coal mine s co owner said. Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp., says he is hurt by criticism he did not do enough to find the miners. This is the last hole, Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, said Wednesday evening. If we don t find anybody alive in that hole, there s nowhere else that anyone ... would know where to drill. Murray said work on the sixth hole, which will go down into the area where the miners were known to be working when the mine collapsed August 6, should be completed by Saturday. However, he expressed little optimism that the effort would be successful, saying it was totally unlikely any signs of the miners will be found. Murray also said that he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Utah mine. I will never come back to that evil mountain, he said. Earlier Wednesday, a fifth hole drilled down into the mine found just six inches of open space left between the roof and rubble in an 8 foot high tunnel, said Jack Kuzar, a district manager with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Kuzar said the fifth hole would be tested for oxygen, and a camera may be lowered down the shaft, although the small amount of space may limit its usefulness. Cameras lowered into previous holes drilled into the mountain turned up no signs of the miners, and tests showed that oxygen levels in parts of the mine were too low to sustain human life. Watch how the safety record at Murray s mines stacks up . An effort to send rescuers through the collapsed mine tunnel to attempt an underground rescue was suspended last week, after a new cave in killed three rescuers and injured six others.
A panel of experts brought in to examine the mine after the second collapse determined that it was too unstable to resume the underground rescue. Both the mine owners and federal officials also ruled out trying to find the miners by lowering rescuers in a capsule through a hole drilled down into the mine, saying the dangerous maneuver wasn t justified absent any signs of life. The news was a blow to the family members of the missing miners, who have been holding out hope for a miracle and criticized Murray for not at least trying the rescue capsule. Signs reading Bring them home and Bob Murray keep your promise were posted overnight at the rescuers command post. Kuzar said he met with the miners families Wednesday, and they re holding up very well. They re very strong people, he said. Earlier Wednesday, in an interview with CNN, Murray said plans were under way to establish a memorial for the missing miners at the site after the mine is closed. We re already discussing how we might go about to honor the trapped miners and make this a site for perpetuity, he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson. E mail to a friend .

Just when it seemed West Ham s bubble was about to burst and Mark Hughes would be handed three points on his birthday, Stewart Downing delivered two moments of quality to rescue a draw at Stoke. Hughes saw his team produce their best football this season and take a deserved two goal lead. Victor Moses opened his account for Stoke in a fine display and Diouf score his fourth goal of the season. But they failed to hold on as Sam Allardyce made the changes that extend his side s unbeaten run to four. While Stoke s finishing ultimately cost them victory, their manager was furious at the decision by referee Chris Foy not to send off Alex Song as Enner Valencia scored to put West Ham back in the game.

Song dived in two footed on Mame Biram Diouf and could have been dismissed but Downing broke with purpose and crossed brilliantly for the Ecuadorian to head home 22 seconds later. Hughes said I m really disappointed with their first goal. Song dived in two footed. Thankfully Mame Biram jumped out of the way but the referee should have stopped the game. It was a dangerous challenge. It was potentially a red card because Song was out of control. He Foy is one of our senior referees so he s got to be better than that. Asked whether the decision might have been different were the offending player from Stoke, Hughes replied I can t say that. I can think it, maybe. Downing scored the equaliser himself 17 minutes from time with a driven right foot shot to prove it is now more than simply a leg to stand on. Allardyce knew his side were fortunate to escape from the Britannia Stadium with a point. I was glad it was only 1 0 at half time, said Allardyce, whose team improved when Downing moved to the centre of midfield and Carlton Cole arrived from the bench to support Valencia up front.
That extra quality we ve got this year paid dividends when it looked like we might not get a point. It was not necessarily well deserved but shows the character of our team. West Ham slipped to fifth but maintain pace with the Champions League hunters in their best start since the 1999 2000 campaign. They were shorn of their most potent weapon in Diafra Sakho, who scored in each of his last seven games but failed to recover from a shoulder injury. Allardyce brought in Cheikhou Kouyate and left Valencia as his lone forward in a departure from the team that beat Manchester City last weekend. More cautious, it should have meant added stability in midfield but Stoke never allowed the visitors to settle. Early in the game, Bojan whipped a low centre from the right that Diouf, two yards out, would have scored from had he made the merest touch and in the 33rd minute Stoke went ahead.

New Zealand scrum half Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot seeing off the challenge of union convert Sam Burgess for the honour. The New Zealand Warriors playmaker, who broke England s hearts with a last minute try and conversion in the semi finals of the 2013 World Cup, produced a man of the match performance in the 2014 Four Nations Series final in Wellington last month as the Kiwis defeated Australia to lift the title a performance that impressed the 13 man Golden Boot voting panel. For the second successive year, English forward Burgess who swapped South Sydney for Bath in October came second in the voting but, whereas 12 months ago Burgess was within seven points of Johnathan Thurston, this time Johnson was a decisive winner, collecting almost twice as many points as his nearest rival. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall. Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot . Johnson said Being a rugby league fan growing up, I always knew about the Golden Boot award. I was pretty aware of the players who d won it before because they were players that I grew up watching like Stacey Jones and Andrew Johns. Then there were the current players that I admire like Thurston. To receive it is pretty unreal to be honest. I felt I finished the year really well and was able to take that into the Four Nations and was really happy with how I played for the Kiwis. It was just made easy by the culture that we have there now and the group of players that we have around us. There s no way I could have received this award without those boys playing their part, and I ll accept it on their behalf.
The panel of 13 judges comprised representatives from Australia, England, France and New Zealand, including former Golden Boot winner Garry Schofield, ex Great Britain coach Brian Noble and past Kiwi internationals Robbie Hunter Paul and Daryl Halligan. On a six man shortlist. Johnson claimed 44 points, Burgess 23, with James Graham third on 18 and Greg Inglis fourth with 17. Double winner Thurston who missed the Four Nations through injury polled 13 points and Kiwi prop Jesse Bromwich two. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall . As is always the case with the Rugby League World Golden Boot, we asked the judges to consider the performances on the international stage first and foremost, and it s undeniable that Shaun Johnson had the biggest impact at that level in 2014, RLW editor Gareth Walker said. Throughout the entire tournament he provided a devastating mix of organising the New Zealand side and producing moments of individual brilliance himself. The Kiwis Four Nations triumph is reflected in the selection of a record number of players in the world team of the year six. Dean Whare lines up at centre with Manu Vatuvei flanking him on the wing, with Johnson in the halves. Bromwich, Kevin Proctor and Simon Mannering pack down in the mythical side. Burgess is named at loose forward, with prop Graham and wing Ryan Hall England s other inclusions. The Australians are Inglis, Michael Jennings, Thurston and Cameron Smith.
Phillip Clayton claims his 86 year old mother Maureen, a retired teacher, died in agony, covered in pressure sores, after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed for 11 weeks . An 86 year old woman died covered in horrendous pressure sores after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed, her son claims. Phillip Clayton said his mother died in pain and tears and contracted MRSA as a result of the care she received. He claims a delay in fitting a pacemaker also contributed to his mother s death after she was admitted to hospital with a dangerously low heart rate. He has launched a complaint against Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent after his mother Maureen died in November. NICE guidelines advise adults at high risk should be turned at least once every four hours to prevent pressure ulcers. The hospital is now carrying out a review into her care. Mr Clayton, 56, a public sector worker, said The fact that my mother died is unfortunate. The way she died in pain and tears from the pressure sores is a disgrace and in my view, totally unacceptable. It is wrong to say my mother would not have died but I do think the care she received shortened her life. It was not the right way for her to die. The way she spent her last few weeks was shocking. The real problem is a total lack of leadership which permeates right down to ward level and results in an appalling level of service. I do not need apologies or a formal investigation, what I would like to see is change. Mrs Clayton, a retired teacher, was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham, Kent. Her heart rate was low and she spent three days on a cardiac unit before being diagnosed with liver problems and transferred to the Will Adams ward. Mr Clayton claims while there staff failed to turn her during her entire 11 week stay when it should have been done once every four hours.
Mr Clayton says his mother even contracted MRSA as a result of the disgraceful care she received at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent pictured Mrs Clayton was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham . He added that they only rearranged the pillows under her back which did not prevent her from contracting painful pressure sores. Three weeks into her stay she was diagnosed with MRSA and died on November 27 from renal failure. Mr Clayton added They simply rearranged the pillows underneath her. Turning a patient in bed is not rocket science. It is a basic nursing skill. There was a long delay before she was fitted with a temporary pacemaker and then a permanent one. During this time she deteriorated. If she had been fitted with the pacemaker in the first week and been able to get up, maybe things would have been different. A spokesperson from Medway NHS Foundation Trust, who run the hospital where Mrs Clayton was treated said The Trust takes concerns around care very seriously and is currently carrying out a review, as discussed with the family. The outcome of the review and the actions we are taking as a result of the findings, will be shared with the family.

The wife of Jerry Sandusky defended her husband on the stand during the sixth day of his child sex abuse trial, saying that she remembers most of his accusers, and never witnessed them having sexual contact with the ex Penn State football coach. Dottie Sandusky, who has stood by her husband including posting his bail told jurors on Tuesday that she never saw anything inappropriate between her husband and the boys. When asked by lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan why the men might lie in making the accusations, she said I don t know what it would be for, while shaking of her head. Scroll down for video . Wife A smiling Dorothy Sandusky, wife of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, arrives on the sixth day of her husband s trial . She said one of accusers, dubbed Victim 10 in court records, she did not know at all. She described Victim 1 as clingy, Victim 9 as a charmer and Victim 4 as very conniving, and he wanted his way and he didn t listen a whole lot. Victim 9 testified last week that he was attacked by Jerry Sandusky in the basement of their home and cried out for help while Dottie Sandusky was upstairs but she never responded. She said the basement was not soundproof and she would have been able to hear shouting if she were upstairs. Jerry and Dottie Sandusky were married in 1966, and have no biological children together. They adopted six times and were also foster parents. Back in court Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte . Dottie Sandusky, who isn t charged in the case, also said the visiting boys were free to sleep upstairs if they wanted to.
The accusers have said Jerry Sandusky directed them to the basement, where they allege he sometimes molested them on a waterbed that was in the room. Also Tuesday, a psychologist testifying for the defence in the Jerry Sandusky trial says the former coach has a personality disorder characterised by excessive emotionality and attention seeking. Arrival Dottie Sandusky emerges from a vehicle at the Centre County Courthouse, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Elliot Atkins said that he interviewed Sandusky for six hours before diagnosing the ex coach with histrionic personality disorder. Atkins explained to the court that people with the disorder often interact with others in inappropriately seductive ways and don t feel comfortable unless they re the center of attention. Sandusky s attorney Joe Amendola is hoping to convince jurors that the disorder could explain his client s letters and other interaction that prosecutors allege shows his grooming of victims. Based on my evaluation of Mr. Sandusky, I have diagnosed a histrionic personality disorder, said Atkins. The psychologist s testimony followed attempts . by defence lawyers earlier in the day to discredit the prosecution s . case by suggesting investigators had coached testimony from one of the . Sandusky s alleged victims. Sandusky . faces 51 counts of child molestation after the prosecution dropped one . charge of unlawful contact with minors on Monday. If convicted on all . counts, the former defensive coordinator for Pennsylvania State . University s successful football program faces a sentence of more than . 500 years in prison. The case has . focused renewed national attention on the issue of child sexual abuse . and prompted the firing in November of Penn State President Graham . Spanier and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno died of . lung cancer in January. Leaving court Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie left the courthouse in separate cars after the sixth day of the ex coach s child sex abuse trial .
The former defensive coordinator for the Penn State University football team, Sandusky, 68, denies all 51 counts of committing abuse. Atkins told the court that Sandusky s histrionic personality disorder definitely explained his grooming behaviour. He told the court that he spent six hours with the accused, read the personal emails he sent to some of the alleged victims and also read his autobiography, Touched. In the case of Sandusky, Atkins outlined . that histrionic means dramatic or theatrical and that people with . the disorder need the approval of other people and act up and create . unusual situations to make sure they are the centre of attention. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse . Atkins confirmed that people with this mental condition, might do something dramatic to draw attention to themselves. This would include acting in a way that is inappropriately sexually provocative. The defence move to highlight Sandusky s mental fragility comes after a string of prosecution witnesses, including eight alleged victims, testified that he groomed them and abused them while they were with his Second Mile charity for troubled children. The eight alleged victims, now men aged 18 to 28, . testified for the prosecution last week, describing in often graphic . detail being molested by Sandusky as boys, including oral and anal sex . and shared showers. Defense attorney Joe Amendola reacts to a question as he arrives at for the sixth day of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Two other alleged victims have never been . identified. Many have criticised the use of this defence. This would be an incredible stretch so much that it disturbs some of my colleagues that they are bringing it up, said Gail Saltz, an an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell School of Medicine to MSNBC. This diagnosis has no bearing on your moral compass, your ability to understand what s legal, she said.
It has nothing to do with being a pedophile. It has nothing to do with sexual behavior toward children. Earlier in the day, defense lawyers took aim . at law enforcement officers testimony that they had not discussed abuse . accounts offered by fellow accusers with other alleged victims in the . closely watched case. Amendola . questioned Pennsylvania state trooper Corporal Scott Rossman and retired . trooper Joseph Leiter about a taped interview they held with one of the . accusers, known in court documents as Victim 4, and his attorney in . April 2011. The interview was . played in court and Leiter was heard saying to Victim 4 during a break . that investigators had interviewed about nine other potential victims. In some cases oral sex has taken place by both parties, which would be . considered rape under state law, he said. Leiter . could be heard saying telling the accuser that his story word for . word followed those of others. He has taken advantage of you. We need . you to tell us what happened, Leiter is heard saying. Under . cross examination by a prosecutor, Leiter said he considered the . interview technique to be appropriate and never suggested to a victim . what he should say. It was the . second day of the defense case after the prosecution rested its case on . Monday. A still image from All my Children which ran from 1970 to 2011 and was known for its outlandish plotlines . Judge John Cleland told jurors on Monday he expected closing . arguments to take place on Thursday. Two . university officials also face charges of perjury and failure to report . suspected abuse in an alleged incident involving Sandusky and a boy at a . Penn State locker room. Earlier Tuesday, defense attorney Joe Amendola told reporters to stay tuned to find out if Sandusky would take the stand himself, comparing the case to a soap opera.
Asked which soap opera, defense attorney Joe Amendola initially said General Hospital, then All My Children. These dramatic developments came on the same day that TMZ released an unaired clip from the November telephone interview between Sandusky and Bob Costas during Rock Center with Brian Williams . Satellite trucks are parked in front of the Centre County Courthouse as the sexual abuse trial of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky . Speaking about the attention which he paid to the young boys under his care, Sandusky stopped short of denying that he ever sexually abused young children. I didn t go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I ve helped. NBC was criticised for not playing the clip back in November, but NBC Nightly News hit back saying, There were a lot of compelling comments in the original interview but we did not have time to include them all. Sandusky is charged with 51 counts involving 10 boys. He denies the allegations. Watch video here .

The horrific incident occurred after the child became stuck as it was being born in Aracaju, northeastern Brazil. The baby boy s headless body remained inside the mother and had to be removed by Caesarian. Tragic The 22 year old mother, who has three other children, was rushed for an emergency Caesarian where, according to the woman, the headless body of the baby was removed file pic A team of five doctors at the Santa Isabel maternity hospital had spent hours trying to deliver the baby in the early hours of Tuesday. The 22 year old mother, who has three other children, told her family she knew something was wrong when she heard something crack . Gilmara Azevedo dos Santos, the woman s cousin, told Brazil s Globo G1 website She went through a lot of suffering, it was hours and hours and a lot of pain and discomfort, with doctors pushing on her stomach, trying everything to make the baby come out. Then at one point, she heard a loud noise and one of the doctors said, Marcos, are you crazy He said the mother asked what was happening but didn t get an answer. She was rushed for an emergency Caesarian where, according to the woman, the headless body of the baby was removed. Ms Santos added My cousin is totally devastated, the whole family is in shock.

By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED . 04 03 EST, 7 February 2013 . . UPDATED . 05 58 EST, 7 February 2013 . Sentenced Carer Angela Perkins was jailed for two years after admitting stealing 100,000 from a 90 year old dementia sufferer . A carer who stole 100,000 from a 90 year old dementia patient has been jailed for two years. Angela Perkins siphoned money from the vulnerable patient s life savings between 2005 and 2010. Perkins, from Norwich, in Norfolk, helped patients to do their shopping and had access to the woman s PIN and bank accounts. She had originally been charged with stealing 55,000 from the woman in July last year, but it was later discovered that she had stolen almost double that amount. The 47 year old was handed a two year prison sentence at Norwich Crown Court after admitting the theft at a previous hearing. The victim is in 24 hour residential care. Det Con Huw Caine, of Norfolk Police, said after the sentencing The actions of Perkins left the victim confused, upset and extremely traumatised with worry due to the fact her savings had dwindled away and she didn t have any money left in her account. Perkins exploited the fact the victim was vulnerable and removed money from the victim s account for her own use, abusing her position of trust. When Perkins was challenged in interview about accounting for cash withdrawals from the victim s account that corresponded with deposits into her own account she was unable to give any satisfactory answers. He added The case highlights that offences of this nature and the targeting of some of our most vulnerable people in society will not be tolerated. I hope that the results of this case highlight to other potential offenders how robustly Norfolk Constabulary will investigate and deal with such incidents. Norfolk Police said it was now trying to confiscate money from Perkins under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Should a confiscation order be served and Perkins fail to pay up, she could face an additional sentence.

A Toronto man was bitten on the head by a 400lb black bear and survived. Joe Azougar, 30, was having breakfast on the porch of his cabin at about 10am on Saturday when a bear suddenly charged at him. I could hear this thud, this vibration on the ground. Then there was this bear coming towards me, Mr Azougar, who had recently moved to the remote cabin from Toronto, said. Joe Azougar gave a thumbs up with girlfriend Brooke Bowerman after surviving a bear attack in Canada . Azougar needed more than 300 stitches to his scalp and shoulder after being attacked. His dog was killed . As the internet entrepreneur ran for cover, his faithful German Shepherd dog ran at the bear. After the bear killed his dog, it charged at the cabin about 10 miles outside of Cochrane, Canada, which Mr Azougar moved about a month ago. He started rushing the window, breaking the window and chipping off wood beside the window, Mr Azougar said. Mr Azougar fled the cabin, but the bear followed. He knocked me down and I covered my head. He took my shoulder apart, then he peeled the skin off my head and started biting my skull, Mr Azougar said. I could feel his teeth rubbing against my skull ... I was just screaming. I could feel my flesh being pulled by his teeth, he told The Sudbury Star. Thankfully, two women driving near his cabin heard Mr Azougar s screams. Relief Joe Azougar is comforted by his girlfriend Brooke Bowerman as he recovers from the savage attack . They used the car horn to scare the bear away, before driving Mr Azougar to the Lady Minto Hospital in Cochrane. The businessman, who moved to the remote Ontario region to start his own internet company, needed more than 300 stitches and will be kept in hospital for several days.
When the women, who have not been identified, first arrived at the cabin they could only see the bear. The woman have not been identified but Mr Azougar is keen to thank them. They are my angels. Without them, I wouldn t be alive, he said. If it wasn t for them, my family would be attending my funeral, he told CTV News. Mr Azougar is being comforted at the hospital by his girlfriend, Brooke Bowerman,and mother, Itto Bentayed, who drove from Toronto to be at his bedside. Ontario Provincial Police and the Ministry of Natural Resources killed the bear after the attack was reported. In a study of bear attacks between 1900 and 2009 it was found that most happened in Canada. From a public safety standpoint, black bears are an unpredictable, wild animal, John Kaplanis, of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen s Alliance, told The Globe and Mail. Bear aware Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears like the 400lb one that attacked Mr Azougar . They re not the cuddly little teddy bears we see on television. Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears, but its Ministry of Natural Resources has resisted calls for the spring bear hunting season to be reinstated. Hikers and residents are offered advice on how to be bear aware to prevent attacks and what to do if they come face to face with a bear.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum holds an AR 15 assault rifle at a shooting range during his presidential campaign on January 30, 2016. Brian Frank Reuters Over the weekend, Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator and Republican who previously ran for president, suggested that student protestors should learn CPR instead of pushing for stricter gun control laws. Now he s walking back the statement. How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that, when there is a violent shooter, that you can actually respond to that Santorum, who is also a CNN commentator, said during a Sunday broadcast of the network s show State of the Union. On Wednesday, Santorum told CNN, I did misspeak in using the term CPR. He also noted that gun control advocacy has helped bolster organizations and people who have actually focused on what we can do ... to actually prevent these types of things. Santorum made his original remarks over the weekend while roughly two million people at hundreds of March for Our Lives events across the US rallied against gun violence in America. The student led protests commenced after 17 people were shot to death at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In the February 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, a 19 year old former student is believed to have committed the murders using a legally purchased AR 15 assault rifle. David Hogg, a survivor of that school shooting and a March for Our Lives organizer, responded to Santorum s remarks in a broadcast on CNN. There are many programs that work to ensure, especially in communities that are heavily affected by gun violence, ... that students are able to respond and administer whatever first aid they can, assuming the person is still alive, Hogg said on Sunday. But at the end of the day, if you take a bullet from an AR 15 to the head, no amount of CPR is going to save you because you re dead.
Medical doctors on Twitter joined Hogg s criticism of Santorum s remarks, noting that CPR is often futile following gunshot wounds. Gobsmackingly uninformed, tweeted Dr. Heather Sher, a radiologist in Florida. CPR is not effective with catastrophic bleeding. Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine and self described gun violence survivor, tweeted Victims that go into cardiac arrest after GunViolence are Bleeding to Death. CPR is NOT effective in this situation. Santorum did not immediately respond to Business Insider s request for comment. Why gunshot wounds can be so damaging that CPR doesn t work Ballistic gelatin is a model for how soft tissues respond to gunshot wounds. Nathan Boor Kurt Groover Aimed Research Wikimedia Commons To humanely probe the physics of gunshot wounds, and ultimately help police solve crimes and doctors save lives, researchers shoot bullets into inert, flesh like substances. In many cases, they use a large block of synthetic gelatin and water to simulate the impact of a speeding bullet on human tissue. Here s an example from the YouTube channel EffectiveAffect of what a gunshot simulation in gelatin looks like. This bullet was moving at about 2,900 feet per second through 575 cubic inches of gelatin. Many factors determine how damaging bullet wounds can be. The type of gun and bullet used, the range of the shot, where on the body a person was shot, and whether or not the bullet exited the body afterward all make a difference. But some basic principles remain When a bullet is traveling at supersonic speeds, it partially slows down the moment it hits a person. The energy of the blast needs to go somewhere, so it radiates outward from the bullet s path to the surrounding tissues. This creates a much larger mushrooming effect, which you can see above. This temporary ballooning of tissue is actually what causes the most damage, according to a post on Mongabay.com.
The billowing flesh lacerates blood vessels and surrounding organs, tissues, and bone. The Washington Post reported in June 2017 that this shockwave can leave a track of wounding as much as five to 10 times wider than the bullet. Gelatin isn t a perfect proxy for the human body. We have bones and cartilage, which can skew the bullet s path, sending it into a tailspin that could cause it to break apart and get lodged in different spaces, further complicating the severity of the wound. This why an increasing number of researchers are turning to advanced computer simulations. Such models can recreate the complex layers of tissue in the human body to study a practically infinite number of grievous wounds from all angles, speeds, and styles of bullets or even shrapnel from mines and improvised explosive devices . A model that debuted in 2015, for example, simulated a human leg, its skin, muscle, bone, large arteries, and even small veins. Then it applied the physics of fluid dynamics to explore the origins of traumatic blood loss, and the best methods to stop that bleeding. But as Alex Ossola reported for Popular Science, this and other models aren t perfect so there s still a lot left for scientists and doctors to learn. This makes gunshot wounds as enigmatic as they are damaging and dangerous. Julia Calderone and David Choi contributed to this post. CNN Former Sen. Rick Santorum said Wednesday he misspoke when suggesting earlier this week that students should learn CPR instead of advocating for gun control. I did misspeak in using the term CPR, the Pennsylvania Republican and CNN commentator told CNN s Chris Cuomo on New Day.

Story Continued Below Santorum s initial comment suggesting that school shooting survivors learn CPR came one day after thousands gathered in Washington and in cities across the country for March for Our Lives rallies calling for stricter gun control laws. Those rallies were prompted by last month s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people. Santorum was widely rebuked for his CPR comments. Students who lived through the shooting, and even doctors, weighed in publicly, telling the former senator that CPR would not have saved the lives of the victims.

Santorum said his comment about CPR obscured the larger point that past mass shootings have spawned organizations that he said have done significant work in combating school shootings by addressing mental health issues and bullying. Calls for divisive steps to impose stricter gun control laws obscure the work that such organizations do, Santorum said. What I ve seen happen here is avoiding the issues that are really actually unifying, he continued. I mean, that s really the most disturbing thing.
We know an industry is in crisis when its top institutions cannot establish stable leadership. That is the case with some of our nation s best public universities today. When the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia pressured President Teresa Sullivan to resign on June 10, she became the fourth leader of a flagship public university to leave office under a cloud of controversy recently. The other casualties included the highly respected leaders of the University of Wisconsin Madison, the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon. The president of the University of California at Berkeley has also announced that he will step down in December. Leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go. The men and women in these jobs seem to have a target on their backs. This can t go on. Our nation s public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world. Flagship public universities educate more of the brightest high school students than private universities in many states. They conduct the lion s share of advanced research. They also attract the largest number of foreign students. If our public universities fall into a decline because of a leadership vacuum, then our entire system will decline, too. University leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities. Government officials in state capitals want to cut funding while requiring far reaching reforms. They demand more control over costs that have risen much faster than inflation or family income in the last decade. They also ask for increased public access to flagship universities through traditional and online forms of education. Governors and legislators want all these benefits as they continue to reduce state expenditures for higher education. Professors and administrators on campus view these reforms as attacks on serious education and research. Advanced training in the sciences, engineering and humanities requires intensive small group work that cannot be subjected to assembly line efficiencies.
Anyone who has taught writing, for example, knows that there is no substitute for the instructor sitting with the student and going line by line through each sentence. The same is true for theoretical physics, medicine, law and many other fields. You need extended time and personal contact for young minds to mature as effective thinkers. That is expensive, but it is money well spent for the good of the society. It s the same for advanced research. Innovation and creativity require freedom, security and flexibility. Scholars must have the ability to pursue a question in depth and examine its many implications. Sometimes an important project may take years to complete. Without university research of this kind we would not have many of the technologies and medicines we take for granted today. Governors and legislators have a strong argument about the elitism, the inefficiency and the sometime self serving nature of university faculty. Professors have a strong case for the merits of what they do, and the remarkable record of achievements and historical job creation coming out of our best public universities. The system works for some, but not for everyone. The system produces value, but at costs that might not be sustainable. University leaders are caught in the middle. Governors are impatient for new efficiencies. Professors are adamant about protecting the freedom necessary for their work. University presidents have the title to address these issues, but they have little power when funding is tight and the two sides are equally uncompromising. No one wants to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other side s point of view. Wealthy alumni groups are very generous and loyal to their alma maters, but they cannot solve this crisis. Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support as generous as it may be cannot replace government money. Despite steep decreases in state funding for universities, state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities.
The National Institutes of Health, for example, is the dominant funder for medical research in the world. States own the land on which public university campuses are built. So where do we go from here Reforms to public universities are indeed necessary, but they will not emerge effectively from political attacks and vindictive cuts. What we need is an open and participatory process where university boards, state leaders, faculty, students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms, cost savings, and more efficiency. These discussions should also include meaningful incentives for increased excellence in teaching and research , public accessibility and international recognition. University presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals, in a reasonable time frame, with transparent accountability. While faculty must preserve the essential freedoms for their creativity, they cannot expect to do this by protecting privileges at all costs. Along with administrators, they have to accept changes to their comfortable routines. If both state and campus communities contribute to mutually beneficial changes, the reformed public university of the 21st century will be much improved. At present, the attacks on university leaders from all sides are attacks on the very idea of a public university. When Thomas Jefferson designed the University of Virginia, and when Abraham Lincoln created the federal land grant system to finance public education, they had a faith that the most advanced intellectual work would improve the nation as a whole. That is what they meant by the public in university. Jefferson and Lincoln s support for public higher education made the United States a model for the rest of the world. We need leaders in government and on campus with the same vision the same desire to use limited resources not as instruments for political or personal advantage, but as opportunities for constructive engagement and the greatest long term public good. Public universities need protection and they also need serious, thoughtful reform. Let s start with giving university presidents a fair chance to do their work.
PENSACOLA, Fla. Anyone listening to Rush Limbaugh s radio show Tuesday could be forgiven for thinking that Judge Roger Vinson has the federal government dead in his sights. Mr. Limbaugh spent some time profiling Judge Vinson, a senior judge on the Federal District Court in Pensacola, who had just announced he would allow a legal challenge to the new health care law to advance to a full hearing. The conservative radio host informed his listeners that the judge was an avid hunter and amateur taxidermist who once killed three brown bears and mounted their heads over his courtroom door to instill the fear of God into the accused. This, Mr. Limbaugh said, would not be good news for liberal supporters of the health law. But, in fact, Judge Vinson has never shot anything other than a water moccasin last Saturday, at his weekend cabin , is not a taxidermist and, as president of the American Camellia Society, is far more familiar with Camellia reticulata than with Ursus arctos. Photo Apparently, Mr. Limbaugh had fallen prey to an Internet hoax. On Sunday night, and again Monday morning, someone identified only as Pensacolian edited Judge Vinson s Wikipedia entry to include the invented material. The prankster footnoted the entry to a supposed story in The Pensacola News Journal. The article like its stated publication date of June 31, 2003 does not exist. The same person who posted the information removed it on Tuesday afternoon, Wikipedia logs show. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As calls flooded in about Mr. Limbaugh s depiction, Judge Vinson, 70, took it all in stride.

No matter what Rush Limbaugh says, Senior U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson has never killed any bears, and he isn t a taxidermist on the side. Actually, he s a flower guy, camellias in particular. On his radio program Tuesday, Limbaugh said Vinson, the Pensacola judge presiding over a legal challenge to President Barack Obama s health care reform, was an avid hunter who once had severed bear heads mounted in the court room to intimidate defendants. ... Everybody in the world knows you don t believe anything on Wikipedia, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last year. So, uh, it must be embarrassing for him that he just used Wikipedia as a source and got his facts wrong. On Tuesday, Limbaugh told his listeners about Judge Roger Vinson, of the Federal District Court in Pensacola, Florida, is presiding over a legal challenge to the country s new health care reform law. Here s a transcript, quoting liberally from Vinson s Wikipedia article Who is this judge Judge Clyde Roger Vinson is a Ronald Reagan appointee. Judge Clyde Roger Vinson is an avid hunter. He s an amateur taxidermist. Do you know what a taxidermist is That s right. For our liberal caller today, this would not be good news. A taxidermist stuffs dead game. If you go into a big, all male club, you ll see some moose head over the fireplace.
A taxidermist is responsible for it. After a 2002 hunting trip during which he killed three brown bears, Vinson had their heads mounted over the door through which defendants must pass to enter the courtroom. At the time Vinson said the sight of the severed bear heads would instill the fear of God into the accused. The heads were removed in June 2003, it didn t even take a year laughing following complaints by local defendants rights groups. What a scary, conservative sounding judge Too bad none of that is true. Judge Vinson is not much of a hunter I ve never killed a bear, and I m not Davy Crockett, he said in a statement . In fact, his main hobby is horticulture He s the president of the American Camellia Society. As his wife Ellen asked The New York Times, rhetorically Can you imagine the president of the American Camellia Society having three stuffed bears in the courthouse No, we cannot, but we also are having trouble imagining the president of the American Camellia Society, period. When Limbaugh was called out over the incorrect information, a spokesman insisted that the story had come from an article in The Pensacola News Journal. Only, the News Journal says no such article ever existed. The only reference to such an article online The footnotes to Judge Vinson s Wikipedia page, which list the article as having appeared on June 31, 2003. June 31, in case you need a reminder, is not an actual date. Well, we ve all been there, right Probably, Limbaugh just didn t know not to believe everything he reads on Wikipedia. Oh, wait.
He did know In fact, he was ranting about it last October, after a series of racist quotes was misattributed to him on Wikipedia sister site Wikiquote I mean, everybody in the world knows you don t believe anything on Wikipedia because anybody can go in there and put anything on that they want to unless you succeed in getting your site locked, and I don t even care about that. Wikipedia is as irresponsible as anything else. Anybody can post anything they want on there. But these are the professionals They re supposed to check this stuff. You re exactly right, Rush Broadcast professionals are totally supposed to check on this stuff. What s that you say People who don t fact check are literal professional scum Whatever happened to journalists calling people and saying, Did you actually say this I m doing a story on blah, blah, blah. Did you actually say this They didn t want to take the chance I didn t say it. They wanted the excuse to run the fabricated quote. They wanted the opportunity to do it. These people are scum. They are literal professional scum and they are responsible in many ways for the deteriorating standards and quality of journalism. They are leading the pack. They are found on both the news side and the sports side, and they are doing everything they can to promote disunity and discord throughout our culture and society while holding themselves up in their own minds as great unifiers and people who care only about social justice. When they re basically just incompetent, irresponsible, impersonators of journalism. Incompetent, irresponsible, impersonators of journalism. Yeah, that sounds about right.

CNN The popular Pope Francis is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague. The comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits, including on the right to insult another s faith. Speaking Thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the Philippines, the Pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say a swear word against my mother. Most journalists interpreted it as a joke, not a justification of violence, especially since the Pope had also just forcefully stated that one cannot kill in the name of God. Still, the Vatican felt the need to clarify, in response to a later CNN question about the punch, that his words were spoken colloquially and consistent with the Pope s free style of speech. I don t for one minute think the Pope is advocating for any type of violence, whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other s mamas. What concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech. One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people s faith, one cannot make fun of faith, he said. There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity. ... In freedom of expression there are limits. The Pope, responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression, was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine by Islamist militants in Paris last week. Although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of Islam, it s not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation. Let s just say it s not what most public relations professionals would advise.
And while the Pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane his Who am I to judge comment about gay Catholics came on the return flight from Brazil in 2013 , he s still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed. The Pope is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issue. Bill Donahue, a self appointed spokesman fighting anti Catholicism as the president of the New York based Catholic League, released a statement with the headline, Muslims have a right to be angry, on the day of the killings. On Thursday, his statement was headlined Pope sides with Catholic League. Such chutzpah. While no one can match the offensive tone of Donahue, who actually said Charlie Hebdo s Stephane Charbonnier didn t understand the role he played in his own death, the gist of the Pope s message was the same Criticism of religion is problematic. As an aside, I ll be curious to see if those who slammed Donahue have the same harsh words for the Pope. Perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another Christian, Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, a progressive, evangelical community and publication. He had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the Paris attacks . Jesus tells us to bless those who persecute us, to return love for hate and good for evil, and even to love our enemies, Wallis wrote. Loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech, and defending the right of free speech, even, or especially, for those who offend you. I think most American Catholics agree that while blasphemy offensive speech against God or religion is not particularly nice, it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed. In the United States, the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952.
I m hoping the Pope was only offering counsel to his followers, rather than advocating for any sort of legal position. No one has the right not to be offended. Even the Pope.
For Jack and Nancy Gatewood, not even death could separate them. A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri. They soon became sweethearts and were married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mrs Gatewood, who was a homemaker, had been in hospital dealing with complications related to a broken hip, pneumonia and flu before passing away around 5.30pm on January 15.

Before his family could tell him of the news of his devoted wife, Mr Gatewood, a retired insurance worker, died around 8.30am on January 16 as a result of cardiac arrest. However, his family believes he suffered from a broken heart. I think he was missing her and didn t know where she was, said son Jack Gatewood II, a pastor in Keller, Texas. He added We believe it was a broken heart. I know that s old fashioned to say, that it doesn t hold up medically. But she had been gone from his life, and we believe he was grieving for her. As the time apart was difficult for Mr Gatewood, his family said people at his care home would find him wandering and asking where his wife was while she was in hospital.
The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood s return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years pictured on their wedding day Suffering from dementia, he was unable to remember when they told him. And when she passed away, Jack II was on his way to see his father, who died before he reached him. The last time Mr and Mrs Gatewood were together was in December.

They loved each other a lot, they were both faithful and they depended on each other. As they enjoyed traveling and visits with friends, their favorite time together was spent with family. By standing at the front door to their home, it was even evident family was important with the special door made of oak and that had symbols to mark each of their children.
Serving as a model for a successful marriage, their sons said the pair were in sync in everything they did and it was not until later in life that they ever saw their parents argue. Jack II said it was a blessing his parents were able to depart together. Bonded together by love for nearly 69 years of marriage, Jack and Nancy Gatewood of Tulsa, Oklahoma entered into eternal life separately, less than 16 hours apart. Nancy passed away Jan. 15, followed by her husband Jack the next morning on Jan. 16. Jack Gatewood was born in Three Sands, Oklahoma on February 28, 1926.

Winkelman previously was unsure whether English football s third longest serving boss would remain in place. I m comfortable in saying that Karl will be the manager next season because he wants to be, said Winkelman. If he wants it and he s got that drive, ambition then he understands the club so much better that someone else. He continued to BBC Look East He already has a promotion out of League One and he s somebody that when we make mistakes, we make them honestly and ultimately, I trust him. Robinson, 35, was unable to keep the Dons up in their first ever season in the Championship. Following relegation, Robinson publically said he felt the club should have used the money received from Tottenham for midfielder Dele Alli more wisely, and Winkelman admitted mistakes had been made with recruitment. Everybody had to get off their chests the things they felt were wrong and that s part of the cathartic nature of sorting out problems, said Winkelman. We needed to talk. Karl needed to look me in the eye and know I would continue to invest in him and I needed to look in his eye and know that if I m going to do that he s going to work his guts out because I think we have more pressure than we ve ever had as a football club. In fact, I m quite excited by the fact we ve got more pressure because it means we re becoming a bigger club. I m excited about being a big club in League One next season.
A British forensic archaeologist has unearthed fresh evidence to prove the existence of mass graves at the Nazi death camp Treblinka scuppering the claims of Holocaust deniers who say it was merely a transit camp. Some 800,000 Jews were killed at the site, in north east Poland, during the Second World War but a lack of physical evidence in the area has been exploited by Holocaust deniers. Forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls has now undertaken the first co ordinated scientific attempt to locate the graves. Treblinka death camp in Poland where 17,000 Stone Memorial is one of the few reminders of the horrific events of the past . As Jewish religious law forbids disturbing burial sites, she and her team from the University of Birmingham have used ground penetrating radar . Her work at the site, where the Nazis tried to destroy all traces of industrial scale killing, is being followed in forthcoming Radio 4 documentary The Hidden Graves Of The Holocaust. Sturdy Colls said All the history books state that Treblinka was destroyed by the Nazis but the survey has demonstrated that simply isn t the case. I ve identified a number of buried pits using geophysical techniques. These are considerable in size, and very deep, one in particular is 26 by 17 metres. The programme s presenter says that the pits contain the burnt remains of thousands of bodies. The forensic archaeologist, who has now presented her findings to the authorities responsible for the memorial at Treblinka, added I really hope this is the first stage in a long term programme to seek out those hidden graves of the Holocaust. Survivor Kalman Taigman remembers his arrival at the camp s railway station, packed into a cattle wagon. I . was with my mother. We were about 100 people in a wagon. They opened . the doors, firing guns and hitting us, and sent us into a yard. I ran . with my mother and tried to calm her. They .
told me to leave my mother but I didn t do it quickly and I was hit on . the head. When I got up, she was gone. She went with all the rest of the . women to the gas chamber. Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in occupied Poland near the village of Treblinka during World War II . The camp was constructed as part of Operation Reinhard . Treblinka operated between July 23, 1942 and October 19, 1943 . During this time, approximately 850,000 men, women and children were killed at Treblinka. This figure includes more than 800,000 Jews, as well as a few thousand Romani people . The camp, which was operated by the SS and Eastern European Trawnikis, was split into two sections named Treblinka I and II . Treblinka I was designed for forced labour center . Treblinka II was designed as a death factory with more than 99 per . cent of all arrivals being immediately sent to its gas chambers. Treblinka II ended operations on October 19, 1943 following a revolt by its Sonderkommandos. Beginning in March 1942, the SS implemented Sonderaktion 1005 to . cover up the murder of millions of people during Aktion Reinhard. There actions were so comprehensive that ever since the end of the Second World War, Holocaust deniers have used the site as evidence of misinformation about Nazi genocide. They claim the site was merely a transit camp a myth now debunked by the latest discoveries of mass graves.
A Cardiff University rugby team was banned from a P O ferry for appalling behaviour during which a trainee medic allegedly urinated on a family dining table. A rugby team from the university School of Medicine was on a rugby tour to Amsterdam when the incident was alleged to have taken place on a ferry from Dover. P O confirmed the team were barred from the return journey after their behaviour on the outbound trip. P O Ferries have confirmed the rugby team from Cardiff University were not allowed to return on one of their ships after their appalling behaviour File Photo One anonymous student told university newspaper Gair Rhydd I was told that one rugby player got so drunk they urinated in someone s food. Company spokesman Brian Rees said It relates to a group who travelled with us from Dover to Calais in mid February. Unfortunately behaviour was such that we had to explain that we would not offer them the return journey so they made other arrangements to get back. The behaviour was so appalling we didn t have a moment s hesitation in banning them from coming back with us. A Cardiff University spokesperson said the university had been made aware of an incident involving Cardiff Medics Rugby Team. However, no formal complaints have been made to the university. Cardiff University have confirmed they are investigating the incident after allegations of bad behaviour . The spokesperson added The alleged behaviour is certainly not the behaviour we expect of our students. As far as we have been able to establish we have not received a formal complaint. However, on receiving this information, we are investigating the exact circumstances and will need to consider what action will need to be taken. Elliot Howells, Cardiff Students Union President, said We are aware of an incident involving the Medics Rugby Team and are investigating this concurrently with Cardiff University. Should any individuals be found to be responsible, appropriate action will be taken. This type of behaviour is not condoned by the Students Union and we convey this message strongly to sports teams during their yearly induction sessions.
Cardiff Medics has both a first and second XV. It is not clear which team was involved in the incident.
By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED . 11 17 EST, 3 March 2013 . . UPDATED . 11 20 EST, 3 March 2013 . Warning Dr Fred Kavalier told four directors of Harmoni in December 2010 of his urgent concerns. Two years later Axel Peanberg King, pictured with his mother Linda, died . A doctor who worked for England s largest independent provider of out of hours care has warned standards are so poor patients are being put at risk. Dr Fred Kavalier claims to have told four directors of Harmoni in December 2010 that he had an urgent concern about the quality and safety of the service Harmoni is providing. Two years later, baby Axel Peanberg King died following wholly inadequate decisions made by an out of hours Harmoni doctor based on a one minute phone call. Dr Muttu Shantikumar ignored the pleas from Linda Peanberg King for her seven week old son, who was suffering from pneumonia, to be seen as soon as possible, an inquest last week was told. He downgraded her call from urgent to routine and left her waiting for nearly four hours for an appointment because he did not deem the baby s situation an emergency. With her dying son in her arms, the 35 year old mother, from Islington, London, then had to wait in line behind six non emergency patients at the private out of hours GP service Harmoni, at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London. St Pancras Coroner s Court heard that it was only when an off duty nurse spotted that Axel had turned grey and floppy that he received emergency care but by then it was too late and he died at the hospital from bronchopneumonia five days after falling ill. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Radcliffe described the brief phone conversation between Dr Shantikumar and Mrs Peanberg King as wholly inadequate , adding that the doctor asked insufficient questions .
Harmoni have released a statement saying the coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failure in the Harmoni service . Dr Kavalier says Axel s death was the kind of incident he was trying to prevent when he sent the letter to directors. Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, he said It is what happens when services are fragmented and commercial interests become more important than patient care. Despite Harmoni s claim they treat patients like family in reality they treat them like rail passengers. Harmoni have released a statement saying the coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failure in the Harmoni service. It said it was not possible to totally eliminate the possibility of an individual s error or misjudgement. Dr David Lee, medical director for Harmoni, said I can confirm that Harmoni responded fully to Dr Kavalier s concerns and our communication was sent by both email and recorded delivery letter on March 11, 2011. We shared his concerns with both the PCT commissioners and the local medical committee LMC . Harmoni refutes absolutely any suggestion that concerns raised by any clinician, patient or commissioner have not been properly and fully investigated. The coroner s comments relating to the tragic death of Axel Peanberg King confirmed that there was no evidence to suggest that Harmoni staffing levels were unsafe. The coroner also stated she was satisfied Harmoni has made considerable efforts to ensure the competence of the GPs working in the out of hours service and that Harmoni had plans in place to ensure this process is ongoing including improving paediatric training for all its GPs. The coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failures in the Harmoni service. Harmoni was founded by five London GPs in 1996 and was bought last year by Care UK for 48million. Last year it turned over 100m and has won more than a quarter of the contracts for the new 111 non urgent phone line.
It is not the first time private out of hours care has been scrutinised. Dr Daniel Ubani was working for an out of hours medical service in Cambridgeshire when he mistakenly gave 70 year old renal patient David Gray ten times the safe dosage of diamorphine. Coroner William Morris ruled the death was gross negligence and manslaughter and Ubani was struck off by the GMC in Britain.
The Australian Federal Police is investigating reports of a Brisbane girl being taken from her home to undergo genital mutilation in Africa. It is believed the girl is between the ages of four and seven and is travelling with her father, The Guardian Australia reported. The child was born in Sierra Leone but was taken to Gambia to have the procedure before Christmas. Scroll down for video . It is believed the girl is between the ages of four and seven and is travelling with her father to Gambia for female genital mutilation . An AFP spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were investigating the allegations. AFP has received a referral in relation to FGM and as we are currently conducting enquiries, no more comment can be offered at this point in time, she said. But there are fears police intervention is too late, with west African community members in Brisbane telling The Guardian Australia the girl may have already had the procedure. Female genital mutilation is illegal in Australia, as is removing children to undergo the procedure. An example of knife and blades used for FGM, which is illegal in Australia, but three girls a day are at risk of it . Three girls a day are at risk of female genital mutilation FGM in Australia. There are four types of FGM including clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation and other. No FGM director Paula Ferrari told Daily Mail Australia more needed to be done to educate people about the dangers of the procedure. Source World Health Organisation . She said the girls who were most at risk of FGM were those who came from a community where the practice is accepted, or had a mother or sibling who had experienced it. In the case of the Brisbane girl, Ms Ferrari said the child had this history. The question could be asked if this could have been prevented because she had ticked two of these boxes, she said. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has urged relatives or friends to blow the whistle on anyone taking children abroad to undergo female genital mutilation.
But it is virtually impossible for authorities to step in without evidence of somebody s intentions, Ms Bishop told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday. If somebody just presents with a passport and they re heading off overseas and we have no evidence to provide us with any cause to prevent the person leaving, then of course that happens, she said. People are free to travel on an Australian passport if they have a valid passport. Ms Bishop said it was vital family members or friends who were in the know about such plans let authorities know. This equally applies to foreign terrorist fighters, she said. It s the families that we need to hear from if there are such matters occurring. Relatives were the ones most likely to notice changes in behaviour or the beginning of radicalisation, Ms Bishop said. Whether it s a girl leaving for overseas for this brutal, barbaric practice, or whether it s people leaving for overseas to take up with terrorist organisations.
Alan Shearer says he does not hold much hope for former club Newcastle United and fears a long, hard season lies ahead. The Magpies are without a win this term and reside in the bottom three going into Saturday s home game with Leicester City. Manager Alan Pardew has seen off intense speculation surrounding his future at least in the short term and retains the support of owner Mike Ashley. Peter Crouch scores for Stoke in one of seven Premier League games Newcastle United have failed to win . Former Magpies striker Alan Shearer worries for his club this season, saying they haven t been good enough Pardew looks unhappy as he watches his team draw 2 2 with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium . But Shearer has not been impressed by performances on the pitch. Indeed, his hometown team have collected just 20 points from a possible 78 since the turn of the year. He told the Chronicle It has been poor since January this year, said the club s record goalscorer, who netted 206 times during 10 years on Tyneside. I m exactly the same as the fans at the minute I m one of them. I pay for my ticket and I m the same. I am entitled to my opinion. Shearer scored a club record 206 goals in 10 years on Tyneside but fears for his former side this year . Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1 0 defeat at Stoke . It hasn t been pleasant watching to be honest. I don t hold too much hope for us this season. I think it could be a long, hard season for us. And Shearer says there are no mitigating circumstances for Pardew or the club to put forward as an excuse for results, admitting there is a real danger they could be dragged in to a relegation battle. Nobody can make any excuses, added Shearer, speaking ahead of the 206 Dinner in Newcastle next month. The simple fact is we haven t been good enough.
You can make whatever excuses you want. Injuries, too many games or confidence. Newcastle fans have reacted angrily to their side s start to the campaign, calling for Pardew s head . Newcastle have been denied the services of promising midfielder Siem de Jong centre through injury . Put all of that to one side, the simple fact of the matter is we just have not been good enough. We haven t been unlucky. We haven t been ravaged by injuries. We haven t been done by dodgy decisions. We just haven t been good enough. It s simple. That s the harsh reality of it. Things have to improve and they have to improve pretty quickly or we could find ourselves in a hole. The quicker we can get out of it the better. Shearer is greeted by thousands of Newcastle fans after signing for the club for 15million in 1996 .
For a man who really did not want to talk on Saturday evening, Jose Mourinho woke on Sunday having had a serious re think, invited himself on to Sky Sports and let loose. While admitting he might be talking his way to a touchline ban, the Chelsea manager launched a live verbal assault from his position on the Goals on Sunday sofa, taking aim at various targets which included an attack on Sky s own coverage. It was very neatly planned and executed by a man employed as an ambassador for rival broadcasters BT Sport, and James Beattie, the show s scheduled guest, was nowhere to be seen. Jose Mourinho says the incidents in the 1 1 draw with Burnley were clear for everyone, not just me Mourinho says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they can t get decisions right . Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege. Click HERE to read Sportsmail s Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel on Jose Mourinho s Goals on Sunday appearance . Mourinho has bemoaned these things for weeks but Burnley striker Ashley Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson pushed him over the edge as Chelsea dropped precious points in a 1 1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. He lashed out at Barnes, branding his tackle on Nemanja Matic criminal and career ending and recalled for the audience a seven match ban imposed on the striker two years ago when he tripped a referee while playing for Brighton against Bolton. And he called for more technology to help officials who can t see a penalty three metres in front of him and claimed Chelsea were not getting the respect they deserve with a long sequence of bad decisions. It was an incredible performance, even by Mourinho standards of showmanship and revolved around his four chosen moments from the Burnley game two failed penalty appeals and two challenges by Barnes. What can I say that everybody doesn t know the Chelsea manager began.
Sometimes there is space for discussion where you have one view and I have another, but I can t believe these four incidents are open to interpretation. This studs up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Mourinho backed up his player . Matic s reaction to Barnes s tackle earned the Serbian a red card he ll now miss the Capital One Cup final . Mourinho shot from the lip during his surprise appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . At half time Burnley should be playing with 10 men and Chelsea should have had two penalties and be winning 3 0, or let s say 2 0 if we miss one of the penalties. The reality is that in the end we end the game with 10 men and we lose two points. The first penalty appeal was for handball when a shot by Branislav Ivanovic crashed into Michael Kightly s outstretched arm. The arm stopped the ball hitting the target, said Mourinho. He s far away it s not one metre, not a few inches, it s quite far. Players should be taught to keep balance even in difficult situations, making difficult bio mechanical actions and putting their arms behind the body to avoid this. For me, this is a penalty everywhere. The best players in the world make mistakes, they miss penalties, and this gentleman is one of the top referees in this country and Europe and he can also make mistakes. He made four important mistakes. It is consistent but we must search for consistency in the right way. The lawyer who has lost 15 cases out of 15 is consistent but you don t want that lawyer. The second penalty appeal was for a push by Jason Shackell on Costa, but Mourinho went back to the opening game of the Barclays Premier League campaign when his centre forward was booked for a dive at Turf Moor. Mourinho requested to go on Goals on Sunday and planned guest James Beattie had to make way .
Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea s 1 1 draw with Burnley, was criticised for his decisions on Saturday . The penalty story with Diego Costa started on day one, because it is a penalty and a red card for the goalkeeper, he said. Michael Oliver also one of the top referees in the country and soon to be one of the best in Europe gives a yellow card to Diego and a free kick against Chelsea. During the course of this 29 minute section of the show, he noted other penalties his team deserved but did not get against Everton, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham and insisted only once had he benefited from a dubious decision, when Gary Cahill escaped a handball at Liverpool. Probably I am risking my place in the dug out in the final because I risk being suspended by having this conversation in a studio, Mourinho went on. I know in football sometimes you get them and sometimes you don t but it s too much. I try to be calm and controlled but my players are not getting the respect they deserve. When it came to analysing the Barnes challenges, one on Ivanovic and one on Matic, which provoked his dismissal for a retaliatory shove, the Chelsea manager said This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee. Mourinho appeared to be agitated during the game too, airing his frustrations to media after the match . The Chelsea boss was particularly unhappy with the performance of referee Atkinson . Should this player be chased because of what he did in the past I don t think so. When people look at these two incidents I hope they only see these two incidents. I don t think it should have any relation with his history.
When I see Diego Costa on day one in the Premier League, penalty and red card to the goalkeeper, game over 2 0, transformed into a free kick and yellow for Costa, I think he has changed country but brought with him his past in the eyes of the officials. This is clearly not fair. When I finish the game against Liverpool and go to the dressing room, the first thing I see on the big screen we have in the dressing room is about Diego Costa s crimes . Well, I would like to know how Sky Sports describe the actions of the Burnley player yesterday when you call what Diego Costa did a crime. With his sidekick Chris Kamara struck by temporary paralysis beside him, Sky host Ben Shephard admitted there may have been a mistake with the language in the immediate aftermath of Costa s stamp on Emre Can, in the Capital One Cup semi final, which prompted a three match ban. Mourinho covered a range of subjects during his appearance on Goals on Sunday . Did you apologise to Chelsea or to Diego or to me as Chelsea manager asked Mourinho. You did not. You never apologised. I don t like the use of language and don t like it that immediately there is public judgment. You give no space to the people who have to decide. The pressure was so much that it gave no space and you don t do this with every club and every player. When you say Diego s crimes because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle, minimum. When Diego Costa had a three match ban, tell me how many matches you think this player deserves. What happened was similar to what happened to Eden Hazard at Stoke but I would say yesterday was worse because this was end of career , I can t find an adjective any stronger than to say end of career . Matic is a lucky guy. I can t find words to describe what that player did. Matic had reason to lose his emotions.
What are the consequences of Matic s push on the other player Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career. Mourinho did not appear satisfied with a post match conversation he had with Atkinson at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. I am not attacking the honesty of anyone, he added. I am not trying to bring the game into disrepute a sentence you love in this country because this is always what they use when they want to punish me. I m just trying to be honest. Of course, they are trying but they are not doing it well. If the ref can t see a penalty three metres in front of him some referee in front of a screen can t miss it. It will protect the integrity and honesty of the referees. I think technology can help. Mourinho stuck around with Shephard and Kamara to analyse the rest of the Saturday action but by then he had got what he wanted to off his chest. 30 Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes. Barnes catches Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . 33 Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty. Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . 43 Diego Costa goes to ground after Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been soft.
Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic s left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free kick. Referee Martin Atkinson shows Matic a straight red card after his altercation with Barnes in the second half .

The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation brought in 144.4 million in 2013, a three fold growth from the 51.5 million the foundation received in 2012, according to tax documents released on Wednesday. Though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation, the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. In 2013 the Foundation reconsolidated the Clinton Global Initiative into its operations, Andrew Kessel, the foundation s chief financial officer, wrote in a letter attached to the tax forms. As such, the 990 tax document shows a corresponding increase in both revenue and expenses. According to the filing, nine donors collectively gave over 60 million. One donor gave 15 million, while three more gave around 10 million. The foundation does disclose a range of their donors online though they are not legally obligated to but the names of these donors are blacked out on the tax filing. In 2013, the Foundation expanded our work, reinforced our financial footing, and became better positioned to maximize our impact for years to come, Kessel said. Our tax statements reflect these improvements. While revenue went up, so did expenses. Nearly 10 or 8.1 million of the foundation s 84.6 million in expenses was spent on travel. The only categories with higher expenses were salaries and wages and conferences, conventions and meetings. And now at least one conservative group, America Rising PAC, is calling on Clinton to detail the foundation s expenses to reveal whether the Clintons politically related travel during the 2014 midterms was funded by the nonprofit organization. We are calling on the Foundation to release details of how their travel and fundraising budget was spent so voters know the extent to which the Clinton s use the charity to subsidize their lavish travel, courtship of potential 2016 donors, and political schedule, the PAC s executive director Tim Miller said in an email.
Early in 2013, just shortly after Hillary Clinton left her post as America s top diplomat, the foundation that was once simply known as the William J. Clinton Foundation was renamed to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton has been very visible at the foundation s events. She led a number of sessions at the group s annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York this year and just last week led a session at a foundation event in Little Rock. Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has stepped up her role in fundraising for the foundation, too. When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation pledged to disclose their donors and stopped holding events overseas in order to avoid conflict of interest claims between her role and the foundations. With Clinton eying another run at the presidency, a spokesman for the foundation said earlier this year that should Clinton run for president, the precedent of what the foundation did while she served as secretary of state would serve as a guide to how they would handle her run .

Frank Lampard captains England against Costa Rica on Tuesday and will then quit international football despite Roy Hodgson suggesting he still has an international future. Lampard thinks it is the appropriate time to bow out and will do so having won 106 caps. He has an offer to play in Major League Soccer with New York City next season and that could lead to him playing in the Premier League on loan. He will finish with just two fewer international caps than his father Frank senior s West Ham pal and former England captain Bobby Moore. One last time Frank Lampard is expected to play his last England game against Costa Rica . History boy Lampard could become England s second youngest scorer at a World Cup if he nets on Tuesday . Lampard s record of 29 England goals is impressive, although Charlton hit 49 and remains England s top all time scorer with Wayne Rooney closing the gap on 40. If Lampard scores on Tuesday he will become the second oldest player to score a goal at World Cup finals for England having turned 36 four days ago. The oldest was Sir Tom Finney, who scored a late penalty in the 2 2 draw against Soviet Union in 1958 at the age of 36 and 64 days. Although . Steven Gerrard has asked for some time to consider his international . future it is unlikely Roy Hodgson will persuade him to change his mind . on calling it a day with England. As it stands Gerrard has 113 caps, two . behind the most capped outfield player David Beckham. Goalkeeper Peter . Shilton remains the most capped on 125. Decision time Steven Gerrard will consider his international future after the World Cup in Brazil ends . The Luis Suarez camp are now dropping heavy hints that when the World Cup is over he will quit Liverpool with Barcelona and Real Madrid set to battle it out for his services. A shoot out between the two La Liga against would be appropriate. To his Uruguayan team mates Suarez is known as El Pistolero ... The Gunfighter.
In the last four World Cup finals Germany s Miroslav Klose has scored 15 goals compared to total of 17 by England over the same period. Whether or not Didier Drogba starts against Greece on Tuesday, he will no doubt have an impact on the game at some stage. Drogba, who will quit international football at the end of the World Cup, will be determined to make sure that this game is not his last for the Ivory Coast. Perhaps one of the reasons for his longevity is that the 36 year old didn t start a professional career until he was 21 with Le Mans. High flyer Didier Drogba may play his last game for the Ivory Coast against Greece on Tuesday . There is a growing feeling that too many young English strikers get burned out because they play far too much at a younger age take the case of Michael Owen. And there is an argument, endorsed by Paul Scholes, that at 28 Wayne Rooney has already peaked. At the same age Drogba moved into his pomp at Chelsea. And even a bit of racy lifestyle didn t seem to harm Drogba. In his early days his team mates called him Tupac after the America rap because of his penchant for a wild nightlife. Watch Out for... Shiniji Kagawa was dropped for Japan s last game against Greece after a peripheral display in their 2 1 defeat to Ivory Coast in their opening game. But Kagawa is set to return on Tuesday . against Columbia in a game Japan need to win if they want to progress . from Group C. Japan must also hope Ivory Coast fail to beat Greece. Centre of attention Shinji Kagawa is expected to return to Japan s startling line up against Colombia on Tuesday . Kagawa s career at Manchester United could be revived under Louis van Gaal, but if the Dutchman doesn t see him as part of his plans then he could return to Borussia Dortmund.
O ....the Japan Columbia game is at 9pm on BBC 3, Ivory Coast Greece is on BBC1 at the same time. I say Ahead of an World Cup qualifier against Poland in 1990, Ian Wright once explained with a combination of Churchillian rhetoric and Sarf London Caribbean slang that England would win because of The bulldog spirit, man . They did the next night at Wembley when a combination of panache and passion saw England blow Poland apart 3 0. Such virtues seem very much out of fashion now laughed off as old school while the appliance of more and more sports science is seen as the way forward. Young tyro Paul Gascoigne scores for England against Poland at Wembley . Left field bolt Stuart Pearce scores for England against Poland at Wembley in 1990 . But a bloated back room staff of medics, spin and head doctors has hardly succeeded. If anything it s given the players more excuses and made them more mentally fragile . Indeed when you listen to what makes other countries tick many cite national pride and desire the very qualities that are laughed off by football hipsters in this country. Explaining Spain s demise Xavi Alonso spoke of a lack of hunger . When Harry Redknapp suggested that some Tottenham players made excuses NOT to join up with England it raises questions about the motivation of many when it comes to playing for England. On that front perhaps the FA should find some sort of role for Ian Wright in the camp. On the notion that there are players who duck out of playing for England Wright has said The next young player who says he does not want play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has dies in Afghanistan, and tell him his reasons. Well said Wrighty. That s the bulldog spirit, man. World Cup Moment . Belo Horizonte, where England face Costa Rica on Tuesday, is of course the venue of England s most infamous defeat when they were beaten 1 0 by the USA in 1950.
Shock England lost to USA 1 0 in 1950 thanks to a goal from GaetJens right At the time England were regarded as the best team in the world with players like Sir Tom Finney and Stan Mortenson although Stanley Matthews was dropped for the match. England also lost to Spain 1 0 and were eliminated, although, they did beat Chile 2 1. The chastening experience suffered is said to have inspired England s right back at that World Cup to one day make amends and lift the trophy. His name Alfred Ramsey. World Cup Bet . The patriotic pound has proved very profitable for the bookies at the World Cup. So it s difficult to see the attraction of 4 5 on an England win although Costa Rica are resting players which maybe explains why you can 7 2 on them winning with the draw 11 4. A romantic punt for first goal scorer is Frank Lampard at 10 1 Joel Campbell is 13 2 to open the scoring for Costa Rica. Uruguay are 13 2 to beat Italy.
The Prime Minister has drawn a line in the sand with students and youth unemployed today, telling them to pull your weight as he made it clear there will be no softening of the government s Work for the Dole program. I want to see every Australian pulling his or her weight. That s very important, Mr Abbott said. There was an outcry from students and welfare groups after the May Budget, when Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the overhaul of Work for the Dole and unemployment benefits. Pull your weight . Tony Abbott has today signalled no softening of the Work for the Dole scheme . An angry St Vincent de Paul Society CEO Dr John Falzon said You don t help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don t help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive But the Prime Minister fired another salvo today. The last thing we want is to see young people leaving school and going on to unemployment benefits, the Prime Minister said. St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, hit back What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan. The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past. He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work. You don t help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don t help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive, Dr Falzon added. The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.
From the start of 2015, new job seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits. Further, they will then have to participate in at least 25 hours per week under Work for the Dole, to receive any payments for the next six months. The problem is structural but the government insists on using the language of demonising and blame to the very people who are suffering the affects of that structure, Dr Falzon added. A national day of action is planned by tertiary students to protest against the Work for the Dole changes and education overhaul. From the start of 2015, new job seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits.

CNN The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering that more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets be inspected for a problem which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft. According to the FAA, the inspections will focus on pins which attach the horizontal stabilizers to the fuselage. They were prompted by reports that a coating used to protect the pins from wear and corrosion was applied incorrectly. The FAA says premature failure of the pins could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane. The part number of each pin must be checked and pins with certain part numbers must be replaced with new, improved attach pins. The order, called an Airworthiness Directive, is effective May 20 and applies to Boeing 737 series 600, 700, 700 C, 800, 900 and 900 ER aircraft. The inspections are not expected to affect airline schedules. The aircraft included in the directive are relatively new, entering service in 1998 or later.

CNN Robert Kubica s Lotus Renault team said Monday that the F1 star was much better after undergoing emergency surgery in an Italian hospital following his crash while competing in a motor rally. The 26 year old Pole spent the night in an induced coma after a seven hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his right arm and hand. Kubica required several transfusions during the procedure to stabilize his condition after losing a lot of blood following the high speed accident. But in a statement on the team s official website, they said that Kubica had been briefly woken by doctors at the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure and was able to talk to his relatives. He was also able to move his fingers, which is an encouraging sign for the rest of the recovery process, it said. Dr. Mario Igor Rosello, the specialist who operated on Kubica, claimed the lack of swelling or infection on his right forearm was also a good sign but added it will be several days before it is known if the operation is 100 per cent successful. Kubica badly hurt in rallying crash . Kubica suffered multiple fractures to his right arm and leg after hitting a guard rail when he lost control of his Skoda Fabia during the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy. With the first race of the new Formula One season in Bahrain next month, his Lotus Renault team defended Kubica s decision to take part in a rally so close to the start of the season. He loves rallying, team boss Eric Boullier told Italian news agency Ansa. We knew the risks and so did he. We didn t want a robot or a corporate man for a driver. It was agreed. Kubica finished 2010 in eighth position and was due to start his fifth campaign as a first choice driver, but there are now doubts as to whether the former Sauber driver will be fit to play any part in the 2011 campaign.
When asked about the length of time it could take for 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner to recover, Rossello is reported by the BBC to have said, One year. One year is the best provision. Kubica also suffered fractures to his shoulder and elbow and Lotus Renault said the hospital would decide over the next few days if further operations were necessary on these injuries. Support has been offered from throughout the close knit world of F1 for the only Polish driver to have ever driven at this level, including a specially designed Twibbon on the social networking site Twitter. McLaren s 2009 world champion Jenson Button tweeted, Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery. Another driver to offer his sympathies was Williams veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, who used his Twitter blog to say, I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica, and we all like him and he deserves all the best. If Kubica is unable to take to the grid for the start of the season, Lotus Renault may choose to promote one of their two reserve drivers. The team s two options are Bruno Senna, who raced for HRT in 2010, and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. The 2011 Formula One season is set to get underway at Bahrain s International Circuit on March 13.
The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his shame at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some 5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver pictured , chief executive since 2011, held 5million in the bank s Geneva based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a classic case of tax avoidance . The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland pictured between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was no tax advantage and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank s chairman, Douglas Flint, said There is absolutely no story here.
There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate. Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35 year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. It seems to be a notion that Douglas HSBC chairman Douglas Flint and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn t normally how large organisations can run. HSBC has been criticised as being too big to manage after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver s watch. It was fined 1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the bank of choice for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined 400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the 3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves. I would expect to die abroad, he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was astonished that HM Revenue Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance, he said.
But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax. Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC . Despite this he received a 7.6million pay package last year, including a 1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his 8million package in 2013 his bonus was cut by 500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to 12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from 2.6billion to 2.4billion.
CNN He s a man that divides opinion and in the past has even jokingly compared himself to a James Bond villain stroking a white Persian cat. But forget felines it s equine beasts that really stir the emotions of the head of world football s governing body, Sepp Blatter. FIFA president since 1998 and bidding for a fifth term in the post, horses have always played a big part in the 78 year old s life. When I was a young boy in my home city of Visp, which is a very small village, our neighbors, our uncles and especially my godfather had a horse, Blatter told CNN Equestrian, reflecting on his Swiss childhood. And the horse for me was always very attractive, he added. I was also in the Swiss Army as a high level officer, I was a commander of a regiment definitely there you have contact with horses. Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, was recently a special guest at the CSI Zurich horse show. It s an event the Swiss has always made room for in his diary despite the challenge of running football s world governing body. This is what we like in football connecting people, Blatter said, comparing the world of equestrian and football. And you have seen the public, the public is happy with that. Because it s the big presentation, they listen, they listen. And here at the horse show they go, it s like football. It s like a football game. And I like that. FIFA even sponsors a spin off event at the CSI Zurich show, involving parents and children competing together as a team in horse jumping and with a ball at their feet. Sepp Blatter is a good friend of us, said CSI Zurich co president Rolf Theiler.
I remember 15 years ago, it was the first time he was at the horse show and he saw the spectators, he saw the horses and said, FIFA must be a sponsor at the horse show. I said, Sepp is that possible and he said, I will do sponsoring at the horse show with FIFA. It s fantastic. The FIFA chief added It s a family prize and this is wonderful. It s not about who s the best, but the best combination. He might have a special place in his heart for horses, but Blatter admits to having always preferred to admire them from afar rather than jump on board one. The horse for me was always very attractive, he said. But I have to say for the benefit of the horses, they didn t like me so much.

Tyson traveled to Suriname as part of the new... Associated Press NEW YORK AP Over his career, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson recorded 50 wins and six losses. But he recently notched another big loss in Latin America this time as a coach of a bird. Tyson traveled to Suriname as part of the new Fusion TV documentary series Outpost and was soundly beaten when he entered a bird in a songbird contest, a cherished local tradition. Cameras captured Iron Mike as he learned about the contest, located a bird to enter he dubbed the tiny guy Little Mike but then suffered a TKO when a competing champion cheeped and peeped more than his bird did in the same 15 minute period. Little Mike let us down, man. I was in his corner, though, said Tyson by phone from Las Vegas. It was just amazing meeting the people, meeting the culture I had a great time. The series, kicking off on Sunday with Tyson s episode, mixes travel adventure, history and journalism to shine a light on global stories. The first season focuses on Latin America and includes as hosts The Late Show with Stephen Colbert bandleader Jon Batiste, Brain Games star Jason Silva, and transgender model Carmen Carrera. Spanish versions air on UniMas. Tyson was lured onto the show by the chance to visit a country he d never heard of and his love of birds. The former boxer has loved pigeons and raced them since he was a kid in Brooklyn. Sunday s show recorded the moment Tyson lovingly released the bird in Suriname he competed with.
My wife always says, The reason I keep my pigeons is they connect me to my childhood, Tyson said. Once it s in your blood, it never leaves. It s just who you are. Back home, Tyson is watching his former profession lose out to professional mixed martial arts but thinks he may have the answer to put the sweet science back on top A compelling boxer somehow unifies the heavyweight title. We haven t had a really good, exciting heavyweight champion in a long time, he said. ___ Online http fusion.net series outpost
By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED . 04 57 EST, 20 March 2013 . . UPDATED . 05 33 EST, 20 March 2013 . investigations The French Foreign office is investigating reports that geologist Philippe Verdon was beheaded by terror group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on March 10 . Al Qaeda terrorists today claimed to have beheaded a French hostage in retaliation for his country s war in Mali. Foreign Office officials in Paris said they were trying to verify reports of the horrific death of Philippe Verdon, who has been in captivity for the past 14 months. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM , which is waging a terrorist campaign against the French Army in Mali, claims it cut the geologist s head off on March 10 in response to France s intervention in Northern Mali. Referring to Francois Hollande, a spokesman for the group calling himself Al Qairawani added The French President Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French hostages. There are at least 14 French hostages currently held by Al Qaeda in west Africa, including seven by AQIM. It means that France, which has already lost five soldiers fighting in Mali since the war started in January, is slowly being sucked into an increasingly bloody terrorist war. Mr Hollande sent a force into Mali specifically to prevent the north of the country from being used as a launch pad for terror attacks in Africa and in the West. Mr Verdon, who is in his 50s, was captured on November 24 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic, a colleague. The men, who were on a business trip, were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori, in the north of Mali. AQIM claimed that both men were secret agents or mercenaries, and later released a video of Mr Verdon in captivity. The hostages families have expressed growing fears about the men s safety, especially following the invasion of Mali. On Monday, Mr Verdon s father .
Jean Pierre Verdon said We are in a total fog and it is impossible to . live this way. We have no information. Captured Mr Verdon has been held captive for 14 months, having been captured on November 24 2011 along with colleague Serge Lazarevic . No information On Monday, Mr Verdon s father Jean Pierre Verdon said We are in a total fog and it is impossible to live this way. We have no information . The Verdon family were particularly concerned by Mr Hollande s firm announcement that France would not pay ransoms. French forces arrived in Mali on January 11 to help the Malian Army against Al Qaeda fighters who had controlled the north of the country since April 2012. France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground in Mali, most carrying out clean up operations after driving out most of the Islamist rebels from the area. Senior Al Qaeda commanders Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abdelhamid Abou Zeid are believed to have been killed in Mali earlier this month. A rescue operation ordered by Mr Hollande to free a French secret agent held hostage in Somalia since mid 2009 ended in failure in January after he was killed along with two French soldiers.
Fellow centre Duncan Taylor, of Saracens, is back after missing the autumn Tests through injury. Uncapped Edinburgh forwards Simon Berghan and Cornell du Preez are included but David Denton is not fit. Alasdair Dickinson is also absent through injury, while fellow Edinburgh prop WP Nel is listed but is a doubt with a neck problem. Nel lasted just 27 minutes of his return from a long injury lay off at the weekend and is awaiting the results of a scan. This year s championship will be New Zealander Cotter s last in charge of the national side. He will take over as Montpellier coach this summer and will be replaced by Glasgow Warriors Gregor Townsend. The Scots open their Six Nations campaign at home to Ireland on 4 February before facing France away eight days later. With Dickinson missing and doubts over Nel, Newcastle front rower Jon Welsh returns for the first time since the 2015 World Cup. John Hardie, who started all five matches in last year s tournament, is another Edinburgh player in Cotter s plans working his way back to fitness. Edinburgh lock Ben Toolis is also selected having not appeared since the Six Nations of 2015. It s a well balanced and exciting group that have played a lot of rugby together, know each other well and are ambitious to do well in a Scotland jersey, said Cotter. I think if we get our mind set right we can be competitive and push for wins in every game in this campaign. Last year, Scotland finished fourth in the championship after victories against Italy and France. In November s autumn Tests, the Scots beat Argentina and Georgia after a narrow defeat by Australia. BBC Scotland s Tom English The competition in Scotland s midfield is now fierce. This is probably almost certainly the best set of centres the country has ever had. Cotter has named five Mark Bennett, Alex Dunbar, Huw Jones, Matt Scott and Duncan Taylor.

Mike Jones, who led Cheshire West Chester Council until 2015, spent 4,889 on a credit card for travel, food and accommodation, and failed to provide some receipts. The authority s rules state those type of credit card transactions are barred and receipts must be provided. A police review is also under way. Mr Jones said he met the rules. In February, council officials announced an internal review of Mr Jones credit card transactions, after details of his spending were revealed by the Chester Chronicle. The BBC has been told the review will look into why the card was used for subsistence, travel and accommodation , and also why receipts were not provided on 75 occasions, after new rules were introduced in 2013. A purchase card procedure introduced in January 2013 states it must not be used to pay for food, drinks, travel, parking or accommodation. A list of transactions shows Mr Jones card was used for those purposes between 2010 and 2015, as well as paying for hospitality expenses. Mr Jones was the only councillor to own a council credit card when he ran the Conservative led Cheshire West Chester Council from 2009 until elections in 2015, when Labour gained control. He is now a backbench Conservative councillor for Tattenhall. Some of Mike Jones expenses paid for on his council credit card include In total, the card was used to spend 2,383 on the barred categories after the new rules were introduced. Mr Jones said he was given an exemption allowing him to use his card to pay for parking, adding that some of his transactions may have related to work he carried out for the Local Government Association. Records released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal Mr Jones did not provide receipts for transactions which mostly included parking and rail travel, despite rules saying cardholders are required to retain all purchase receipts . He said In all the cases where receipts are issued I have passed them into the council and if they are missing, unfortunately I have no idea why they have not been recorded.
Expenses and use of the purchase card were properly scrutinised by officers and our audit staff. No such issue was raised with me, he said. Council spokesman Mark Wynn said Councillor Jones, in his role as leader, met with potential external investors with a view to attracting regeneration and development to the borough. The council has reviewed all the transactions brought to its attention and responded accordingly and is conducting its own internal review. Cheshire Police received a complaint from a former Cheshire West Chester councillor in February. It said The allegation is currently being reviewed, in order to establish whether any offences may have been committed.
Nick Clegg wants new laws to protect journalists sources . Nick Clegg has demanded new laws to ban police from accessing journalists phone records to identify their sources without a judge s warrant. The Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to introduce the new protections before the end of the month. It comes after an official government report found there were not adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources . Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, said the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act Ripa left journalists unprotected. His report said It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information. A review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row. The commissioner found that over a three year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists. Some 608 applications for such data were authorised, by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1 of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation. It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources . Generally speaking, the police forces did not give the question of necessity, proportionality and collateral intrusion sufficient consideration, the report said. They focused on privacy considerations Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and did not give due consideration to freedom of speech Article 10 . The current Home Office Code of Practice and the recently revised draft Code said to provide protection for sensitive professions do not provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources or prevent unnecessary or disproportionate intrusions. The Prime Minister s official spokesman said David Cameron accepted the commissioner s recommendation. He very much welcomes the report.
He believes that the report makes the case well for the judicial oversight it recommends in cases of data comms applications that are relevant to journalistic sources and that is why the Government is accepting that recommendation, the spokesman said. The Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to introduce new laws forcing the police to get a warrant before accessing journalists phone records . In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for legislation to be brought forward later this month. As you know, I have consistently raised my concerns about the protection of journalists sources in relation to acquisition of communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, Mr Clegg wrote. The report published today by the Interception of Communications Commissioner recommends that judicial authorisation must be obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information . We have an opportunity to act on this recommendation at report stage of the Serious Crime Bill in the Commons on February 23. I hope that you will look urgently at drafting Government amendments to that effect.
It looked at alternatives and outlined three options, one based on property, the others on land and income. The cross party body believed any new system should continue to be one of general tax rather than a system of charges for specific services . Scottish councils typically raise 15p of every pound spent from council tax. The predominant view of the commission is that local government s tax base should, if it could be proved feasible, be broadened to include income The report has not recommended any particular option but hopes to inform the debate ahead of next year s Holyrood election. The current system contributes Â 2bn to help pay for local government expenditure such as refuse and recycling, education, roads maintenance and leisure facilities. The commission outlined three alternatives which could bring in a similar sum of money Its report said The predominant view of the commission is that local government s tax base should, if it could be proved feasible, be broadened to include income. Income is widely perceived to be a fairer basis on which to levy a tax, although a locally variable income tax presents substantial administrative challenges. The reform group was set up by the Scottish government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in February 2015 and was tasked with examining alternatives that would deliver a fairer system of local taxation . It listed a number of recommendations, including The report added We believe this is the time to reform local taxation. We have conducted more in depth analysis of potential forms of tax available than ever before to inform debate and the construction of detailed proposals. We have concluded that there is no one ideal tax but we have shown that there are ways of designing a better tax system. There is now a real prospect of beginning a programme to make local taxation fairer more progressive, more stable, more efficient and more locally empowering.
Marco Biagi,Scottish government s Minister for Local Government We will consider the findings of the report carefully and we will set out our detailed proposals for reform by the end of the parliamentary term, embodying the principles of the commission s report. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour s public services spokeswoman This is a comprehensive report that looks at a number of different options for local government finance. The challenge for all political parties now is to consider these options and come forward with their solution to put to the electorate next year. Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader This report sets out plenty of alternatives for the reform of local government finance but after eight years, people might have expected more from a government that said it was committed to reforming the council tax system. Ruth Davidson, Scottish Conservative leader The Scottish Conservatives decided to set up an independent commission into fair and competitive taxation last year, headed by Sir Iain McMillan, to study these issues. Once that has reported, we will set out our own plans on local taxation. Andy Wightman, Scottish Green MSP candidate and commission member The Scottish Green Party will consider the findings of the commission carefully and bring forward proposals in our manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood election.

Frustrated holidaymakers faced long delays at airports yesterday on the first full day of increased security checks. Queues stretched outside the terminal doors at one airport because of the crackdown brought in amid fears Al Qaeda has developed a stealth bomb undetectable to scanners. Air passengers around the country were subjected to vigorous body searches, with their shoes removed and swabbed for traces of explosives. Gatwick Travellers faced delays getting inside the terminal building after the security crackdown . Queues at Manchester Airport this morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so called stealth bombs which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners . Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport today, with many complaining of delays . They were also told to switch on their tablets, smartphones and laptops to prove they are not hiding something more sinister. Some customers said it took them 90 minutes just to get through security and holidaymakers have now been warned to allow for least three hours before their flight time. Angry travellers branded the delays an absolute joke and like wading through treacle . Airline chiefs are braced for further problems as one of the busiest weekends of the summer gets underway. The checks have been brought in due to fears that Al Qaeda s top bomb maker Ibrahim Al Asiri has developed a non metallic stealth bomb that can be hidden inside human bodies or other devices. The use of body scanners, swabs and patting down have all been increased at UK airports while some bags are being searched twice. Passengers are removing shoes and belts as a matter of course, while those on US bound flights are likely to face further screening and searches of bags at the boarding gates. The alert has sparked fears of a summer of travel chaos with holidaymakers facing invasive personal checks and long delays. Heathrow alone handles more than 190,000 passengers a day and across the country 24million people will fly abroad before September 3million to the US.
A spokesman for travel industry body ABTA said The main thing is to make sure that airports have sufficient measures in place to ensure all the available security gates are open. At Manchester Airport, officials said problems were made worse by many travellers arriving earlier than normal because of the extra checks. Some complained they were left standing outside the terminal building before they could even check in. Sam Lavelle posted pictures of fellow passengers queuing in the drop off zone outside Terminal One, writing The queue is literally outside the door and onto the road. Elissa Corrigan described the wait as soul destroying . And Ian Moreno Melgar, who was heading to Belfast for a wedding, tweeted Queuing in the car park for security isn t normal. But at Heathrow passengers appeared resigned to longer and more intrusive searches as they were subjected to what one termed American style security . Passengers wait at Heathrow Airport this morning as security staff carry out more stringent security checks . Queues to get to security at Glasgow Airport, where passengers complained of waiting times today . Christian Radnedge, who was flying to Houston, said Everyone is taking their shoes off, there are pat downs on almost everyone after being screened, a few people are having their bags tested. A traveller flying to California said it was a price worth paying for staying safe in a dangerous world . And Paul Kenyon, 59, of Poynton, Cheshire, who was on his way to Bologna, said They were looking at Apple computer equipment closely and they took my washbag through the machine a couple of times as I had my contact lenses in liquid inside. Nobody was moaning about the extra time and it s not that much of a hassle. As long as you leave yourself plenty of time then you ll get on your flight. Last night, traveller Matteo Pescarin posted a photo of a crammed North Terminal at Gatwick Airport as hundreds of passengers queued to go through security.
Taking the chaos with good humour, David Silvester tweeted Just had my croissants x rayed and then inspected... At Glasgow Airport, passengers also faced waits. Norma Decent, 59, from Stranraer, said I understand why they re doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me. Laura Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, added It s better to be safe than sorry. Don t go to Syria, imams urge young Britons . Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would be young British jihadists Don t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq. Some 100 imams asked the UK s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad. Muslims should continue the generous and tireless support for those caught up in the bloodshed but from the UK in a safe and responsible way , they said. Chilling British jihadists in a recruitment video aimed at youngsters in the UK . The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb maker Ibrahim Al Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make stealth bombs . And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda. He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah across the Islamic world. There is nothing in Britain it is just pure evil, he said.
If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah this Islamic state comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don t want to come back to what I have left behind. Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now understand that this is a good cause I am in . It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making invisible bombs non metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber s body. Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts dozens of names of interest . However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama. Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments turned a blind eye to recruitment operations and embraced extremists . He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us. US officials say iPhones left and Samsung Galaxy phones right could be subject to greater checks . In 2010, an Al Qaeda group crammed explosives into computer printers before smuggling them onto planes .
Rome, Italy CNN Two Pakistani men accused of providing logistical support for last year s deadly terror attacks in Mumbai, India, were arrested Saturday in Italy, police said. They were arrested in the northern Italian city of Brescia, said Stefano Fonzi, head of Italy s Division of General Investigations and Special Operations. The attacks on India s largest city lasted four days. The attackers targeted several sites in Mumbai, taking over several hotels and a Jewish center. The attacks left 160 people dead. On November 25, 2008, the day before the attacks in Mumbai, the two men arrested allegedly transferred 229 that was used to activate Internet phone lines used by the suspects. Two others connected with the longstanding money transfer agency in Brescia also were arrested for other illegal activity, Fonzi told CNN. Police are looking for a fifth man. Italian police started their investigation the following month after being alerted by Indian authorities and the FBI that funds had been transferred from Italy, Fonzi said. Authorities suspected the agency after money was transferred under the Muslim name of a man who had never entered Italy, a police statement said. Indian police have said 10 Pakistanis were involved in the deadly assault, nine of whom were killed in the carnage. The lone surviving suspect has linked the coordinated shooting and bombing incidents to the leader of the Pakistan based Lashkar e Tayyiba, a militant group that is banned in India. CNN s Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.
CAIRO, Egypt CNN An Egyptian real estate mogul and a former police officer pleaded not guilty Saturday to the murder of a rising Lebanese pop singer who was found slain in her United Arab Emirates apartment. Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim was found slain in her apartment in Dubai in July. Prosecutors allege that Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a Parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid Muhsen el Sukkari 2 million to kill Suzanne Tamim. Both have denied the charges. Tamim, 30, was found in her Dubai apartment in July with her throat slit. Moustafa s lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it not unusual for men such as Moustafa, a married father of three to take on additional wives. The prosecutors say the murder was a means of taking revenge but have not elaborated. Watch report on murder trial . It did not happen and I have presented all the evidence that I am not guilty, Moustafa said in the courtroom Saturday, according to Reuters. It did not happen, Sukkari said, according to Reuters. By Almighty God, my blood is innocent of her. Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary is trying the case in Cairo because Egyptian law does not allow its citizens to be extradited for trials in other countries. The defendants appeared Saturday in cages as is typical in Egypt before three judges in a crowded downtown courtroom. Heavy security surrounded the building, amid a crush of reporters and onlookers. The case, with its high profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial.
He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa s brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. The case will resume on November 15. The defendants will remain jailed until then.

Huddersfield were playing in their first top flight game since 1972 after winning promotion from the Championship via the play offs last season. A Joel Ward own goal put them ahead before Mounie struck twice. A start like this is amazing, said the Benin international. We worked all day during pre season, we worked hard and the coach gave a us a lot of advice. The consequences of our work has shown. It is crazy, I will take a picture of the table. Mounie scored 11 goals for Montpellier in France s Ligue 1 last season before joining the Terriers for a club record 12m in the summer. The 22 year old, one of eight new arrivals at the West Yorkshire club, was brought in to improve Huddersfield s goal scoring record after they got promoted with a negative goal difference last season. He missed his easy chance, joked Huddersfield boss David Wagner after the game. It was a great day for Steve Mounie perfect if you come new into the Premier League. It was far from the perfect Premier League debut for Crystal Palace manager Frank de Boer. The former Netherlands international was appointed in the summer with a desire to develop a possession based style of football at the club. However, the Eagles found this difficult to implement against a side that rarely gave them time on the ball and De Boer conceded Huddersfield were deserved victors. Huddersfield did a fantastic job and the compliments go to them, he said. We were not pressing up top and they were allowed to get crosses too. We did not make the right choices and got punished.
It is a ticking timebomb hidden on the chaotic streets of New Delhi. Despite India s booming economy, millions of people are still battling for access to clean water. The situation is so desperate that many people in this teeming neighbourhood are falling sick. Others have set up illegal taps in a bid to cash in. CNN correspondent SARA SIDNER reports from the frontline of the war for water. New Delhi, India s capital and the political heart of this diverse and vibrant country, is a vast and energetic city. One of the so called BRIC nations, alongside China, Russia and Brazil, the country s growing importance and remarkable growth is delivering new wealth to many of its citizens. Around New Delhi you can see how the expanding middle classes are changing the face of India, with fresh prosperity expanding their ranks at a dramatic rate. But the city also faces a serious problem. Water, the absolute necessity for life, is becoming harder to come by. And it is not just in India s great cities where a growing crisis is taking shape. Shazadi, a mother of six, scrubs her thin . steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as possible. There . is only one way for her to get water she must walk to the . neighbourhood spigot with heavy buckets, before filling them up and . lugging them home. Every one of these children, pictured on the outskirts of Delhi, India, has suffered from waterborne illnesses . But even when she gets the water back to her family, she worries whether it is actually safe to drink. We get sick two to three times per month, Shazadi says. I cannot afford bottled water. Her seven year old daughter, Moazmin, smiles and waves at us. She wants to play, but isn t feeling very well. My stomach aches and gurgles, she says, before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital.
There she is often given an injection, which she makes clear she is not fond of at all. There are around 100,000 people living in this neighbourhood on New Delhi s outskirts. Not one of them has ever had water piped into their homes. Instead, the government turns on just a single tap for them, just three times a day. This is how the vast majority in this part of the city gets access to water. At the pipe, people line up to fill their bottles and buckets. Children also take showers under the flowing water. The tap itself juts out just a few inches from a drain, which is littered with rubbish and sewage, as well as clumps of bright green algae. These people are among thousands in New Delhi who rely on truck deliveries for their water supply . To avoid the need to use this single tap a few enterprising people in the area have installed ground water pumps, but these are illegal. Some others get their drinking water from Prakash Sahoo. He has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses. Every day, in the baking hot sun, he rides his bicycle around the neighbourhood, making five or six trips to fill a large water container, which is strapped to the back of his bike. He is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries. There is no sanitation here, just so many complaints , he explains. So I thought Let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people, in order to help them and make some money . Prakash charges 10 rupees not much more than 10 pence per container. It is a price business owners can afford to pay but as most in the neighbourhood make less than 1.50 a day, it is beyond the budget of the majority. And so, for most people in the area, simply getting clean water to drink is a struggle they face every day.
India s government is not blind to the issue, and has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses. The figures, however, make worrying reading. The country has 18 percent of the world s population but only 4 percent of the world s renewable water sources. And demand is growing. What is more, there are major problems with leaks and pollution, which strip away the supply even further. Mother of six Shazadi, pictured cleaning dishes outside her home, has to carry heavy buckets to and from the neighbourhood spigot to get water . T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, an official with India s department of drinking water and sanitation, says rural India faces a whole range of issues that are depleting its water. Because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water, ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation, by farmers and by industries, we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water, he told CNN. And as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants. It may be arsenic. It may be fluoride. Now we are finding nitrate, iron, and salinity. Uranium is also involved in some places, he said. India has set a national river conservation plan in place, which it hopes will reduce the pollution in its rivers. The plan includes interception, diversion and treatment of sewage, as well as low cost sanitation works on riverbanks, and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals. But authorities concede that India is facing what they call water stress because of urbanisation, industrialisation and the ever rising population. Some people have installed illegal ground water pumps to avoid queuing with buckets at neighbourhood water taps in New Delhi . According to the 2011 census, India s per . capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters, down from 1,816 . cubic meters in the 2001 population count. This year an acute water . shortage hit New Delhi.
The city relies on other states for much of its . water supply, but now it is finding itself in a tug of war to get it . because those other states are dealing with shortages too. While this fight goes on, entire neighbourhoods across New Delhi rely on trucks to bring in the only water supply. Thirsty crowds emerge as soon as the truck becomes visible. Mother Bimla fills as large a bucket as possible, because the truck only comes to her area three times a week. Underneath the water truck children squat with little buckets, which they use to collect the drops of water spilling from the undercarriage. At times there are scuffles and we have to return empty handed, says Bimla. When every drop of water matters, the fight for it is ultimately a fight for survival. For India, and its capital city, it is a fight they simply have to win.
CNN A body found near Lubbock, Texas, has been identified as that of a baby sitter seen in a motel surveillance video with a longtime family friend charged in the case, authorities said Wednesday. The medical examiner identified the remains found Monday about seven miles outside of the city as belonging to Elizabeth Ennen, 15. She had been strangled, Capt. Greg Stevens told CNN. Stevens told reporters that Humberto Salinas Jr., 45, was being held on a 250,000 bond on an aggravated kidnapping charge. Police are talking with the district attorney about taking a murder charge to the grand jury, he said. Elizabeth was reported missing after baby sitting at a motel for Salinas, who was a friend of the Ennen family and the father of her boyfriend, police said. The girl did baby sitting jobs several times for Salinas at the motel, where he lived, police said. Stevens would not say whether Salinas was cooperating, but he indicated the remains were not found by chance or through a tip. Elizabeth was reported missing January 5, and Salinas was charged in the case on Friday. Are you missing a loved one Share your story . A relative of Salinas declined comment when contacted by CNN Wednesday. Stevens defended the time it took to conduct the investigation and arrest Salinas, saying the suspect was a family friend who deceived the family and police on the girl s whereabouts. But police believe Elizabeth was dead by the time they got a report that she was missing, Stevens said. They the family trusted this guy to speak ... to the officer, said the captain, who would not comment on a possible motive. Lily Huckabee, Elizabeth s aunt, told HLN s Nancy Grace that the girl s mother, Virginia, is holding on the best she can.... Salinas was married and always presented himself very respectful, said Huckabee, who described Elizabeth as loving, caring, shy and interested in music.
Police have a January 4 surveillance video of Elizabeth being taken from the Carriage House Inn, but they did not know of it when they began their investigation, Stevens told CNN. According to an arrest affidavit, the video shows Salinas holding the teen s arm and leaving the motel, he said. We believe he killed her while he was gone with her, Stevens said. Salinas went to Elizabeth s home and talked with her mother early January 5, police said. He helped her file an initial report, the captain said. According to that report, Salinas said he brought Elizabeth home from the motel and went back to get her purse. When he showed up at the house, the mother asked about her daughter s whereabouts. The suspect indicated Elizabeth might have left the neighborhood with his son, believed to be 18 or 19, Stevens said. He began misdirecting the investigation, leading it in the opposite direction of the truth, the officer said. Police initially classified the case as a runaway, but within days learned the son had a solid alibi. They began looking at the elder Salinas, who initially gave another location for the baby sitting, said Stevens, adding police for much of the investigation believed Elizabeth had disappeared from her home. We came around 180 degrees, said Stevens, adding an investigator suggested they check with the Carriage House Inn on possible video. Officers saw the video on the same day they arrested the suspect, police said. Stevens defended his department from criticism on the time it took to make an arrest and find the body. These type of cases can often take years, he said. A candlelight vigil in Elizabeth s memory is scheduled for Thursday night at Monterey High School, where she attended, CNN affiliate KCBD in Lubbock reported. Her funeral is Friday.
Diena Thompson, the mother of a girl found dead in a Georgia landfill, told HLN s Jane Velez Mitchell she has issued financial assistance from the Somer Thompson Foundation to Elizabeth Ennen s mother. Thompson s daughter, Somer, was taken from her Florida neighborhood in October 2009. The child was raped and killed and her body left under a pile of trash. CNN s Phil Gast contributed to this report. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN. For the latest from Nancy Grace click here.
By . Ted Thornhill . The traditional dimpled glass pint tankard is usually associated with old men wearing flat caps but the chunky handled beer jug is now proving a big pull among pub going hipsters. In the early 2000s it seemed that the handled pint jug which first appeared in pubs in the late 1920s was on the road to extinction. The last British factory to make the handled beer jug, Ravenhead Glass in St Helens, closed down in 2001, pub landlords found straight pint glasses easy to stack in dishwashers and beer drinkers preferred them, too. But a beer jug revival is now underway thanks to trendy drinkers and city hotspots embracing them and Al Murray the Pub Landlord toasting his audiences with them. Cheers Al Murray the Pub Landlord with a traditional dimpled pint jug . The Shacklewell Arms in Dalston, east London, a popular haunt with hipster types, has been serving dimpled jugs for the past six months. It offers straight glasses, too, but it s the jugs that the customers prefer. General Manager Rose Dennen told MailOnline The new love of dimpled pint glasses is part and parcel of the revival of the traditional idea of living. People are more aware of what they re putting in their bodies. It s all about being kind to yourself and being aware of your heritage and part and parcel of that is a return to craft beer. People aren t drinking less, but drinking better quality products. Dimpled mugs have been served in Leeds North Bar since 2000, with director Christian Townsley revealing that his mainly artistic clientele love the old school coolness of a dimpled tankard, according to the BBC. Pint jug revival The Shacklewell Arms in east London has seen its hipster clientele embrace handled pint pots . Cask in hand Shacklewell Arms hipster Dan Woodall enjoys a beer in a handled pint jug .
Keeping a handle on things Shacklewell Arms General Manager Rose Dennen . Top choice Straight pint glasses are the most popular type with drinkers, but hipsters are embracing dimpled tankards . Traditional designs The 10 sided beer jug arrived in 1928, left, while the dimpled handled pint pot, pictured right, arrived in 1948 . Evolution Straight glasses were very popular in the early 20th century and then in the 1960s, but their rims would often nick when they touched, so the nonic glass, right, was brought in to stop this happening . Pint glasses were straight from the beginning of the 20th century up until around 1928, when the 10 sided handled glass pint mug appeared in pubs. In 1948 the dimpled pint jug design arrived, which proved more popular than its 10 sided cousin. According to beer blogger Martyn Cornell, this new trend coincided with lighter coloured beers being embraced. He said The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over dark mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight sides ones the light shining through a pint of bitter in a dimpled glass is the beery equivalent of the windows of Salisbury or Chartres. Straight pint glasses became all the rage in the 1960s, but their rims easily chipped when they touched, so the nonik or no nick glass was invented, which has a bulge in the middle. This meant the glasses touched at a sturdier point and so didn t have to be replaced so often. Lofty, narrow glasses are in vogue these days often emblazoned with the logo of a beer brand. Source Martyn Cornell s Zythophile Beer now and then . He added They are solid and reassuringly comforting. Neil Walker, spokesperson for the . Campaign For Real Ale, said that some pubs use traditional pint pots to . help drinkers distinguish between brands.
He told MailOnline It s fantastic to see dimpled pint glasses making something of a comeback as real ale continues to grow in popularity, particularly in venues which might not have previously served cask beer. Britain is in the middle of a real ale revolution. With well over a thousand breweries now producing real ale, your local pub is now much more likely to be serving a locally produced brew. Many pubs which are expanding their beer range are using these traditional pint pots to differentiate their cask beers from mainstream lager brands, something which can only be good for British beer drinkers. The Pub Landlord, meanwhile, is also toasting the dimpled pint jug s return. He said The return of these glasses is a triumph. Each one looks like a precious cut diamond but contains something better than 24 carats one pint. For the first time in my life I salute the young and trendy. Though they should all bloody shave. Recent research shows that craft beer isn t just proving evermore popular in trendy pubs, but is catching wine as the drink of choice to take to dinner parties. Over half of Brits say they already prefer to take beer, not wine to dinner parties, or plan to make the switch soon, according to a new nationwide poll, by online marketplace EeBria. The site found that the trend is most pronounced among under 35s, who are 20 per cent more likely to drink craft beer over wine at social occasions than older generations. A number of factors are driving the shift in attitudes, the research showed, with 60 per cent of respondents saying they see craft beers as the ideal way to explore new exciting flavours with friends and almost half believe craft beer sparks more interesting conversation than wine. The . handled pint pot so loved by craft beer drinkers first appeared in British pubs in 1928 and had a . 10 sided design. The dimpled design first appeared in 1948, according to . beer blogger Martyn Cornell. He .
said The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter . over dark mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in . straight sides ones. British . pubs buy their dimpled glassware from factories based oversea, with a . jug costing around three times the price of a straight pint glass.
CNN The Pedophile s Guide to Love and Pleasure A Child Lover s Code of Conduct was pulled from Amazon.com, a spokesman confirmed Thursday, after thousands of users posted angry comments and threats to boycott the site. The self published e book was available on the site for download until late Wednesday for 4.79. Company spokesman Drew Herdener would not comment on the controversy or respond to questions about the company s guidelines for digital publication. On Wednesday, Amazon defended selling the book in response to a report published on BusinessInsider.com. Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable. Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts, however, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions. Before it disappeared from the site Wednesday night, the listing had more than 2,000 user comments. The vast majority of them condemned the book s stated content, as well as Amazon s decision to make it available. It is ILLEGAL to molest children, and for Amazon to promote such is insane. I m an abuse survivor, and am OUTRAGED Amazon would choose to promote this nonsense. I will not be purchasing anything from your website until this is removed, one user wrote in a comment that summed up the feelings of many others. In its product description, the book s author described it as my attempt to make pedophile situations safer for those juveniles that find themselves involved in them, by establishing certian sic rules for these adults to follow. I hope to achieve this by appealing to the better nature of pedosexuals, with hope that their doing so will result in less hatred and perhaps liter sic sentences should they ever be caught, he said. Author Phillip R. Greaves II told CNN that he published The Pedophile s Guide to address what he considers unfair portrayals of pedophiles in the media.
True pedophiles love children and would never hurt them, the Pueblo, Colorado, man said in a phone interview Wednesday night. Greaves, 47, told CNN that he has not had sexual contact with a child as an adult, but did when he was a teenager. He also said he was introduced to oral sex when I was 7 by an older female, but did not provide specifics. A small contingent of Amazon.com users defended the author s right to free speech, and a discussion on the site titled Why Amazon is Right delved into the constitutional implications of the controversy. Others floated the possibility that the e book was a hoax or a law enforcement trap for pedophiles. While I think 99.9 percent of us object to pedophilia even though I think this particular book was a publicity stunt joke , I think we can all agree that we don t want someone else censoring a subject matter that we may be interested in. Religion, atheism, homosexuality, etc. are some subjects that spring to mind ... and they have been censored in the past until we realized that it s best to let all information in even if we don t like some of it , rather than allow some authority or individual decide what we can and can t know about based on their own opinions or motivations, one user wrote. In its form as a written piece, The Pedophile s Guide is protected under the First Amendment right to free speech, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Child pornography is illegal as images. But text, which can be considered works of advocacy, has won protection in the courts under the First Amendment, Toobin said. There is an argument that some works of advocacy are incitement, but the courts have been very, very narrow in interpreting that as a crime, Toobin said. I think this one is well safe under the protection of the First Amendment. CNN s Jim Spellman and Sarah Holbrooke contributed to this report.
NSW Premier Mike Baird said he experimented with cannabis in his youth . Recently appointed NSW Premier Mike Baird has admitted to experimenting with Cannabis during an interview that canvasses his support for legalising the drug. The devout Christian and father of three, who succeeded former premier Barry O Farrell in April, said he had used cannabis as a young person but was quick to dismiss it had any part to play in his life other than as a one off experiment. The Premier told the Daily Telegraph in an interview to mark his 100th day since being thrust into the state s top job, we ve all been young, so I m not going to deny I did experiment in my youth. He made the remark when quizzed about decriminalising the drug for medicinal purposes in NSW, but said his own experience with drug taking was neither pleasant nor regular . It s got nothing to do with this issue anyway. Mike Baird supports legalising marijuana in NSW to help people cope with terminal illness . Daniel, pictured with his mother Lucy Haslam, has found relief in cannabis during chemotherapy and a campaign to legalise the drug for terminally ill patients by his parents has more than 188,000 signatures . The premier, and a number of NSW MPs, have given in principle support for legalising marijuana for terminally ill patients in the state after Mr Baird visited a Tamworth cancer patient. Daniel Haslam, a 24 year old, was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but begun taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease. He has made vast improvements in his health, his mother a former head the north west NSW drug squad said, and she is now asking politicians to legalise the controversial drug. Mr Baird said he was struck with Daniel and the battle he s in after meeting with him. It s heart wrenching, he said. I ve got deep sympathy and empathy with their position.
Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Mr Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments. Under a private member s bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis. Tamworth man Daniel Haslam is in a four year battle with terminal bowel cancer and his parents are calling for cannabis to be legalised for treatment by the terminally ill . Asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said it may well be something we have to do . I m open to that, he told ABC Radio on Thursday. But Mr Baird is waiting to see details of the bill and whether it will address his concerns about the sale and regulation of the drug. But if the bill satisfies Mr Baird, it seems likely Daniel and his family won t be forced to break the law for much longer. If we can provide relief to them in those circumstance, well, what premier would not want to do that Mr Baird said. NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson said he s willing to work with the government but, like Mr Baird, wanted to see how the bill addresses things such as supply and access before fully endorsing it. I m not writing a blank cheque, but I am very supportive of his notion, he told reporters on last week. If marijuana is part of the solution to dealing with those issues as a means of relieving people s pain, then we should be looking at that.

The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes. When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that every election needs a comedy candidate, reported The Age. His campaign slogan was vision, passion and change, and he publicised his message with adverts, T shirts, and a stream of public appearances. Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades he arrived in London aged 22. In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World.

WASHINGTON Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr R., N.C. has decided against a proposal circulating quietly on Capitol Hill to create criminal penalties for companies that decline to comply with court orders to decipher encrypted communications, a spokeswoman said Thursday night. The issue of how to pressure companies on encryption matters has become inflamed in Washington in recent days. Several people familiar with the matter previously said Mr. Burr was considering criminal provisions as part of the proposal.... Neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders was willing to pick a side Thursday in the heated battle between the FBI and Apple over the government s demand that the company create new, less secure software to comply with a warrant. The tech giant made headlines on Wednesday with its forceful response to a federal judge s court order that it help the government break into an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino killers, Syed Farook. When Democratic town hall host José Díaz Balart asked Sanders, Whose side are you on Sanders replied Both. I am very fearful in America about Big Brother. And that means not only the federal government getting into your emails or knowing what books you re taking out of the library, or private corporations knowing everything there is to know about you in terms of your health records, your banking records, your consumer practices, Sanders said. On the other hand, what I also worry about is the possibility of another terrorist attack against our country. And frankly, I think there is a middle ground that can be reached. Clinton called the situation a difficult dilemma. She discussed some of the main concerns Apple has about opening the door, creating what they call a backdoor into encryption. And she pointed out that the capability could be abused by authoritarian regimes like the Chinese, Russian, Iranian governments who want the same kind of access. But she concluded with a favorite law enforcement talking point that the smart people in America can surely solve this problem and find a way to help the FBI access encrypted communications with a little brainstorming and teamwork.
As smart as we are, there s got to be some way on a very specific basis we could try to help get information around crimes and terrorism, she said. Technologists refer to this as the magic pony solution. Try as the two candidates might, however, there really isn t a middle ground to occupy either in the war between Apple and the FBI, or when it comes to the use of unbreakable encryption generally. Technologists almost unanimously agree that there s no secure way to insert a backdoor into their products without undermining security and exposing data to criminals and hackers. And Apple CEO Tim Cook, supported by a growing legion of cryptologists, scientists, and other tech companies, said Wednesday that acceding to the government would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect. If Apple is forced to build a new way to hack its own product, the genie would be out of the bottle the U.S. government could ask for it to do so again, and other governments could demand the same. Apple users would no longer have confidence that their data is secure, and presumably, other companies would soon find themselves in the same position. NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO Reuters Apple Inc AAPL.O will likely seek to invoke the United States protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. The company on Thursday was granted three additional days by the court to file a response to the order. Apple will now have until Feb. 26 to send a reply, a person familiar with matter told Reuters. The tech giant and the Obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles handed down an order on Tuesday requiring Apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation unprecedented.
Other tech giants such as Facebook Inc FB.O , Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Alphabet Inc s GOOGL.O Google have rallied to support Apple. Apple has retained two prominent, free speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers Theodore Olson, who won the political speech case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, and Theodore Boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. Government lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. The high court said then that the All Writs Act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week. But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendment s guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it. Compared with other countries, the United States has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. Apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford University s Center for Internet and Society. A worker tries to repair an iPhone in a repair store in New York, February 17, 2016. REUTERS Eduardo Munoz The order against Apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in Apple s possession, Pfefferkorn said. I think there is a significant First Amendment concern, she said.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney s Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the possible free speech questions on Thursday. A speech rights argument from Apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the U.S. economy. Slideshow 2 Images That is an argument of enormous breadth, said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University law professor who writes about the First Amendment. He said Apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a substantive message. In a case brought by a mathematician against U.S. export controls, a three judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. The opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. The FBI and prosecutors are seeking Apple s assistance to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. U.S. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor. That is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. In addition, the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iPhone. The federal magistrate who issued the order, Sheri Pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. This is one of the worst set of facts possible for Apple. That s why the government picked this case, Froomkin said.
Froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to Apple s global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. All these demands make their phones less attractive to users, he said. The news this week that a magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI hack an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooter suspects has polarized the nation and also generated some misinformation. Those who support the government say Apple has cooperated in the past to unlock dozens of phones in other cases so why can t it help the FBI unlock this one But this isn t about unlocking a phone rather, it s about ordering Apple to create a new software tool to eliminate specific security protections the company built into its phone software to protect customer data. Opponents of the court s decision say this is no different than the controversial backdoor the FBI has been trying to force Apple and other companies to build into their software except in this case, it s an after market backdoor to be used selectively on phones the government is investigating. The stakes in the case are high because it draws a target on Apple and other companies embroiled in the ongoing encryption backdoor debate that has been swirling in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill for the last two years. Briefly, the government wants a way to access data on gadgets, even when those devices use secure encryption to keep it private. Apple specifically altered its software in 2014 to ensure that it would not be able to unlock customer phones and decrypt any of the most important data on them but it turns out it overlooked a loophole in doing this that the government is now trying to exploit. The loophole is not about Apple unlocking the phone but about making it easier for the FBI to attempt to unlock it on its own.
If the controversy over the San Bernardino phone causes Apple to take further steps to close that loophole so that it can t assist the FBI in this way in the future, it could be seen as excessive obstinance and obstruction by Capitol Hill. And that could be the thing that causes lawmakers to finally step in with federal legislation that prevents Apple and other companies from locking the government out of devices. If the FBI is successful in forcing Apple to comply with its request, it would also set a precedent for other countries to follow and ask Apple to provide their authorities with the same software tool. In the interest of clarifying the facts and correcting some misinformation, we ve pulled together a summary of the issues at hand. What Kind of Phone Are We Talking About The phone in question is an iPhone 5c running the iOS9 version of Apple s software. The phone is owned by the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, which gave it to Syed Rizwan Farook, the shooter suspect, to use for work. What Is the Issue Farook created a password to lock his phone, and due to security features built into the software on his device, the FBI can t unlock the phone and access the data on it using the method it wants to use a bruteforce password guessing technique wherein they enter different passcodes repeatedly until they guess the right one without running the risk that the device will lock them out permanently. How Would It Do That Apple s operating system uses two factors to secure and decrypt data on the phone the password the user chooses and a unique 256 bit AES secret key that s embedded in the phone when it s manufactured. As cryptographer Matthew Green explains in a blog post, the user s password gets tangled with the secret key to create a passcode key that both secures and unlocks data on the device. When the user enters the correct password, the phone performs a calculation that combines these two codes and if the result is the correct passcode, the device and data are unlocked.
To prevent someone from brute forcing the password, the device has a user enabled function that limits the number of guesses someone can try before the passcode key gets erased. Although the data remains on the device, it cannot be decrypted and therefore becomes permanently inaccessible. The government s motion to the court .pdf notes that this happens after 10 failed guesses when the auto erase feature is enabled by the user. The government says it does not know for certain if Farook s device has the auto erase feature enabled, but notes in its motion that San Bernardino County gave the device to Farook with it enabled, and the most recent backup of data from his phone to iCloud showed the function turned on. A reasonable person might ask why, if the phone was backing data up to iCloud, the government can t just get everything it needs from iCloud instead of breaking into the phone. The government did obtain some data backed up to iCloud from the phone, but authorities allege in their court document that he may have disabled iCloud backups at some point. They obtained data backed up to iCloud a month before the shootings, but none closer to the date of the shooting, when they say he is most likely to have used the phone to coordinate the attack. Is This Auto Erase the Only Security Protection Apple Has in Place No. In addition to the auto erase function, there s another protection against brute force attacks time delays. Each time a password is entered on the phone, it takes about 80 milliseconds for the system to process that password and determine if it s correct. This helps prevent someone from quickly entering a new password to try again, because they can only guess a password every 80 milliseconds. This might not seem like a lot of time, but according to Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a company that does extensive consulting on iOS security, it can be prohibitively long depending on the length of the password.
In terms of cracking passwords, you usually want to crack or attempt to crack hundreds or thousands of them per second. And with 80 milliseconds, you really can only crack eight or nine per second. That s incredibly slow, he said in a call to reporters this week. With a four digit passcode, he says, there are only about 10,000 different combinations a password cracker has to try. But with a six digit passcode, there are about one million different combinations a password cracker would have to try to guess the correct one a simple six digit passcode composed of just numbers would take a couple of days to crack, Guido says but a more complex six character password composed of letters and numbers could take more than five and a half years, according to Apple. The iOS9 software, which appears to be the software on the San Bernardino phone, asks you to create a six digit password by default, though you can change this requirement to four digits if you want a shorter one. Later models of phones use a different chip than the iPhone 5c and have what s called a secure enclave that adds even more time delays to the password guessing process. Guido describes the secure enclave as a separate computer inside the iPhone that brokers access to encryption keys increasing the security of those keys. With the secure enclave, after each wrong password guess, the amount of time you have to wait before trying another password grows with each try by the ninth failed password you have to wait an hour before you can enter a tenth password. The government mentioned this in its motion to the court, as if the San Bernardino phone has this added delay. But the iPhone 5c does not have secure enclave on it, so the delay would really only be the usual 80 milliseconds in this case.
Why None of This Is an Issue With Older iPhones With older versions of Apple s phone operating system that is, phones using software prior to iOS8 Apple has the ability to bypass the user s passcode to essentially unlock the device and access data on the phone. It has done so in dozens of cases over the years, pursuant to a court order. But beginning with iOS8, Apple changed this so that it securely encrypts all of the most important data on your phone by default photos, messages, contacts, call history using the password you choose. And Apple cannot bypass your password to obtain that data. According to the motion filed by the government in the San Bernardino case, the phone in question is using a later version of Apple s operating system which appears to be iOS9. We re basing this on a statement in the motion that reads While Apple has publicized that it has written the software differently with respect to iPhones such as the SUBJECT DEVICE with operating system iOS 9, Apple yet retains the capacity to provide the assistance sought herein that may enable the government to access the SUBJECT DEVICE pursuant to the search warrant. The government is referring to the changes that Apple made with iOS8 that exist in iOS9 as well. Apple released iOS9 in September 2015, three months before the San Bernardino attacks occurred, so it s very possible this is indeed the version installed on the San Bernardino phone. After today, technology vendors need to consider that they might be the adversary they re trying to protect their customers from. What Does the Government Want A lot of people have misconstrued the government s request and believe it asked the court to order Apple to unlock the phone, as Apple has done in many cases before. But as noted, the particular operating system installed on this phone does not allow Apple to bypass the passcode and decrypt the data. So the government wants to try bruteforcing the password without having the system auto erase the decryption key and without additional time delays.
To do this, it wants Apple to create a special version of its operating system, a crippled version of the firmware that essentially eliminates the bruteforcing protections, and install it on the San Bernardino phone. It also wants Apple to make it possible to enter password guesses electronically rather than through the touchscreen so that the FBI can run a password cracking script that races through the password guesses automatically. It wants Apple to design this crippled software to be loaded into memory instead of on disk so that the data on the phone remains forensically sound and won t be altered. Note that even after Apple does all of this, the phone will still be locked, unless the government s bruteforcing operation works to guess the password. And if Farook kept the iOS9 default requirement for a six digit password, and chose a complex alpha numeric combination for his password, the FBI might never be able to crack it even with everything it has asked Apple to do. Apple CEO Tim Cook described the government s request as asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers including tens of millions of American citizens from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. What Exactly Is the Loophole You Said the Government Is Exploiting The loophole is the fact that Apple still retains the ability to run crippled firmware on a device like this without requiring the user to approve it, the way software updates usually work. If this required user approval, Apple would not be able to do what the government is requesting. How Doable Is All of This Guido says the government s request is completely doable and reasonable. They have to make a couple of modifications.
They have to make it so that the operating system boots inside of a RAM disk and they need to delete a bunch of code there s a lot of code that protects the passcode that they just need to trash, he said. Making it possible for the government to test passwords with a script instead of typing them in would take a little more effort he says. T hat would require a little bit of extra development time, but again totally possible. Apple can load a new kernel driver that allows you to plug something in over the Lightning port It wouldn t be trivial but it wouldn t be massive. Could This Same Technique Be Used to Undermine Newer, More Secure Phones There has been some debate online about whether Apple would be able to do this for later phones that have newer chips and the secure enclave. It s an important question because these are the phones that most users will have in the next one or two years as they replace their old phones. Though the secure enclave has additional security features, Guido says that Apple could indeed also write crippled firmware for the secure enclave that achieves exactly what the FBI is asking for in the San Bernardino case. It is absolutely within the realm of possibility for Apple themselves to tamper with a lot of the functionality of the secure enclave. They can t read the secure private keys out of it, but they can eliminate things like the passcode delay, he said. That means the solution that they might implement for the 5c would not port over directly to the 5s, the 6 or the 6s, but they could create a separate solution for these that includes basically crippled firmware for the secure enclave. If Apple eliminates the added time delays that the secure enclave introduces, then such phones would only have the standard 80 millisecond delay that older phones have. It requires more work to do so with the secure enclave. You have to develop more software you have to test it a lot better, he said.
There may be some other considerations that Apple has to work around. But as far as I can tell, if you issue a software update to the secure enclave, you can eliminate the passcode delay and you can eliminate the other device erase security feature . And once both of those are gone, you can query for passcodes as fast as 80 milliseconds per request. What Hope Is There for Your Privacy You can create a strong alpha numeric password for your device that would make bruteforcing it essentially infeasible for the FBI or anyone else. If you have letters and numbers and it s six, seven or eight digits long, then the potential combinations there are really too large for anyone to bruteforce, Guido said. And What Can Apple Do Going Forward Guido says Apple could and should make changes to its system so that what the FBI is asking it to do can t be done in future models. There are changes that Apple can make to the secure enclave to further secure their phones, he said. For instance, they may be able to require some kind of user confirmation, before that firmware gets updated, by entering their PIN code or they could burn the secure enclave into the chip as read only memory and lose the ability to update it entirely . These would prevent Apple in the future from having the ability to either upload crippled firmware to the device without the phone owner s approval or from uploading new firmware to the secure enclave at all. There s a couple of different options that they have I think all of them, though, are going to require either a new major version of iOS or new chips on the actual phones, Guido said. But for the moment, what you have to fall back on is that it takes 80 milliseconds to try every single password guess. And if you have a complex enough password then you re safe. Is the Ability to Upload Crippled Firmware a Vulnerability Apple Should Have Foreseen Guido says no.
It wasn t until very recently that companies had to consider What does it look like if we attack our own customers What does it look like if we strip out and remove the security mitigations we put in specifically to protect customers He adds Apple did all the right things to make sure the iPhone is safe from remote intruders, or people trying to break into the iPhone. But certainly after today, technology vendors need to consider that they might be the adversary they re trying to protect their customers from. And that s quite a big shift. Update 2 30 pm EST To clarify the number of failed password guesses that can occur before the phone deletes the passcode key, making data on the phone inaccessible. Update 5 30 pm EST To clarify the security changes Apple made in 2014 that prevent it from unlocking secured data on phones.

Associated Press An Apple iPhone sits on a table during a news conference at New York City Police Headquarters, Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016 in New York. Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the top notch encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations.... Associated Press NEW YORK AP Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the top notch encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations. And they predicted the problem could grow worse as more criminals figure out how well the devices keep secrets. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference that investigators cannot access 175 Apple devices sitting in his cybercrime lab because of encryption embedded in the company s latest operating systems.
They re warrant proof, he said, adding that the inability to peer inside the devices was especially problematic because so much evidence once stored in file cabinets, on paper, and in vaults, is now only on criminals smartphones. Apple has marketed its encryption data as an important privacy tool, and many privacy advocates have praised the company, saying that if it opened its devices to government surveillance that ability to spy on users could be abused in places with authoritarian regimes. There is no magic key that only good guys can use and bad guys cannot, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties organization. Any vulnerability Apple is forced to create in its phones can and will be exploited by criminals making all less secure, Cohn said. This is really a question of security versus surveillance. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, is currently fighting a federal magistrate s order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in December s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a call Thursday for comment on the concerns of New York City authorities. Vance didn t specify which cases were being hindered. But Police Commissioner William Bratton said a phone seized in the investigation of the shooting of two police officers in the Bronx last month is among those detectives can t crack. It was displayed Thursday alongside other phones, iPads and tablets similar to 600 devices the prosecutor s team tested, of which the 175 proved inaccessible. Bratton said criminals are increasingly aware of the protection offered by their devices. He said a prisoner in a city jail was recently recorded saying in a phone call that iPhone encryption was another gift from God. Vance said investigators have relied on phone data to investigate killings, child pornography, robbery and identity theft. He said that might include checking a suspect s contact list to get the names of witnesses or conspirators, or viewing incriminating videos and photographs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has warned that creating software allowing the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino suspect s phone could make millions of other phones vulnerable to hackers and criminals. Cook said that if Apple were forced by the courts to hack our own users, the government could order the company to build surveillance software to intercept all sorts of messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone s microphone or camera without your knowledge.

Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, was arraigned on two counts of rape, two counts of lewd acts with a child and two counts of sexual child abuse. The professor was arrested last week after authorities received allegations from a child welfare worker he had sexually abused two teenage girls in the past two years. He denies all the allegations. Paid leave Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, has been arrested for allegedly committing rape twice and lewd acts on a child under 16 years old . A state Department of Human Services worker told Norman police that a . 13 year old reported seeing Pellebon fondle another 13 year old during a . sleepover at the suspect s Norman home, according to a search warrant . affidavit. The girl was interviewed by police . last week, according to NewsOk, and told them she woke up in his home on . at least two occasions with Pellebon lying beside her touching her . from her hair to her ankles . The alleged abuse started when she was 11. The social worker also said Pellebon sexually abused a mentally disabled 15 year old at least twice. The girl also told police the suspect would remove her from bed, take her clothes off and display her on a bed for viewing . Court documents also revealed the . girl said Pellebon kept track of her menstrual cycle and showed her . parts of the body you weren t supposed to see . The social work professor admitted . taking off the girl s clothes but said he did it to apply cream to her . chest, back and butt while they were alone in his bedroom.
NewsOk reported that though Pellebon denies any sexual contact, he described himself to investigators as an affectionate, sensual man who liked to hug, kiss, cuddle and stroke young girls that he felt close to . He also told police that he had viewed child pornography once but did not download it. University Pellebon is on unpaid leave from the university and free on 75,000 bail . In 2001, Pellebon was investigated by DHS under similar circumstances . but no charges were filed because the alleged victim the daughter of a . former Norman police officer failed to give investigators a . statement, documents show. He has been placed on administrative leave without pay and is free on 75,000 bail.

He took a leave of absence from the board earlier this year, a Cleveland County CASA spokesman told The Oklahoman. Pellebon . teaches a course on human sexuality that looks at sexual behaviour, . gender differences and sexual values , reported CNN. After he was arrested a university spokesman said they acted swiftly to suspend Pellebon from any contact with students and from use of any university facilities .
By . Gerri Peev . Ed Miliband was told by one of his MPs to get out more as his electoral strategy was condemned as suicidal. The Labour leader was hit with bruising criticism by his party s rising star Simon Danczuk just days before local and European elections. Polls show Labour s lead over the Conservatives has fallen to four points, down from six. On European voting intentions, Labour is on 24 per cent, languishing behind Ukip 35 per cent but ahead of the Conservatives 20 per cent . Bruising criticism Ed Miliband and Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk at a dinner in 2012 . Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, said the election had to be about winning over Tory and Ukip voters. I think Ed needs to be less cautious. He should have probably debated with Farage along with Nick Clegg. That would probably have been a smart move in terms of putting Cameron on the back foot. I also think he needs to get out more, he said. He told BBC Radio 5Live s Pienaar s Politics What we also need to do is occupy the centre ground and that is where we will get the breakthrough. So we need to be stronger on immigration welfare. We need to be seen in a more positive way in relation to business. Mr Danczuk has criticised the strategy of Douglas Alexander, Mr Miliband s campaign co ordinator, to rely on securing 35 per cent of the popular vote. Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, made his cutting remarks on BBC Radio 5Live days before local and European elections . This would be enough to win the general election according to some strategists because constituency boundaries favour Labour. But Mr Danczuk has said Labour should not rely on the Coalition s unpopularity to win the 2015 contest. Now we need to up our game, Mr Danczuk wrote in an article for the Mail on Sunday.
He added that continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer , and warned that the party will not win by relying on a core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals which he described as a suicidal strategy . Mr Miliband is being threatened with further open dissent if his party does not gain seats in Thursday s poll. A Labour candidate for one of the party s target seats condemned his leadership as dodgy and incoherent . Tristan Osborne, candidate for Chatham and Aylesford, was recorded making critical remarks about Mr Miliband s strategy. The machine is not functioning in any capacity, Mr Osborne said at a 100 a ticket Labour fundraising event held on Tuesday. We need to be appealing to the aspirational Southern voter. Mr Miliband dismissed as nonsense suggestions that he had hired David Axelrod, Barack Obama s election guru, to give him a makeover. Quizzed by Sky s Dermot Murnaghan, he said This makeover stuff is nonsense...I can absolutely promise that I have never talked to David Axelrod about the colour of my tie. Mr Miliband also defended a Labour party TV ad which attacked David Cameron and Nick Clegg as out of touch posh boys. He insisted he was not waging class war based on which school the Prime Minister went to. It is about what he believes and what he does, he said. The wheels came off Ed Miliband s efforts to pick up votes in Newcastle when the Labour leader picked up a parking ticket instead. Mr Miliband s driver was given a fine while waiting for his boss in a loading bay during an election campaign visit last week. A Labour Party spokesman said The car should not have been parked in this bay. The fine has already been paid. Bookies will be hit with a new tax to fund future sports stars and anti corruption programmes if Labour wins the election.

He suffered a very public humiliation when his apology over tuition fees was turned into a spoof video that went viral. And it seems Nick Clegg was hoping for a greater success from this keynote address by incorporating the moves of someone a little more popular, namely Korean pop star Psy. Speaking yesterday at the Lib Dem party conference in Brighton the Deputy Prime Minister seemed to be doing his own version of the popular Gangnam style dance routine.

Mr Clegg isn t the first to imitate the . South Korean pop star s moves Hugh Jackman, Heidi Klum, Britney Spears . and Madonna have already recorded their own versions of the dance. His flamboyant body language might have been an attempt to act out his latest metaphor for David Cameron and the Conservative party which he compared to a broken shopping trolley that keeps veering to the right. Buoyed with confidence following his party s victory in the Eastleigh by election, he gave a rousing speech to members at the Liberal Democrat Spring conference.

By . Andrew Levy . Blue eyed angel Tahlia Raven suffered a rare and fatal reaction to the common childhood bug . Smiling and bright eyed, little Tahlia Raven looks the picture of health. But shortly after this photo was taken, she died from a common childhood bug normally so benign that it goes completely unnoticed in a third of cases. Just a day earlier Tahlia had been playing outside in the sunshine with her sister Annaliese, five, and there was nothing to suggest she was unwell. The bug, commonly called the slapped cheek virus because of the bright red flush it can trigger on the face, is caught by more than half of children. Tahlia s rare reaction meant she became only the fourth child to die from the virus in the UK in the past eight years. It was only following a post mortem examination that the three year old was found to have had the bug, also known as parvovirus. The airborne virus is spread in the same way as cold or flu viruses and is most prevalent in six to ten year olds. After an inquest her grief stricken mother, Karen Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her beautiful blue eyed angel . She said She was healthy before this. I have been told it is very common in playschools and nurseries and we don t know why it killed her. The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard how Ms Glover found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year.

Sisters Just a day earlier Tahlia right had been playing outside in the sun with her older sister Annaliese left The post mortem examination revealed no evidence of a range of serious conditions, including meningitis or pneumonia. She may have had a minor heart defect, although it was unclear whether this would have affected Tahlia s ability to fight the infection. Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, told the hearing on Monday I have to consider all possible causes of sudden death in a previously well three year old child. Happier times After the inquest Ms Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her beautiful blue eyed angel Expert opinion Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital pictured in London, said that, on the balance of probability, the toddler died from parvovirus, or slapped cheek bug . The only significant thing I did find was a very swollen brain and some inflammation of the wind pipe. I identified parvovirus from the heart and brain. It is very common in children and known as slapped cheek disease. On the balance of probability, I put down the cause of death as parvovirus. This is very rare. I have not seen a case before which caused such swelling of the brain. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Essex coroner Caroline Beasley Murray concluded Tahlia sadly died at home, a sudden and unexpected death of a little girl who seemed perfectly healthy. She clearly was much loved. Beloved Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. Above, Tahlia is pictured with Annaliese left and at six months old right Ms Glover, from Southend, added the inquest had given her some closure as she accepted nothing could have been done to save her daughter.
If we had gone to the doctor all they would have given us would be Calpol, she said.

The only risk group is pregnant women as there is a risk of miscarriage. There is no vaccine, as the virus usually only lasts a few days.
The civil case brought by Judy Huth accuses Mr Cosby of sexually assaulting her as a 15 year old at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in the 1970s. The 78 year old is facing a series of sexual assault accusations dating back decades. He has always maintained his innocence and has never been criminally charged. Ms Huth alleges that Mr Cosby plied her with alcohol before sexually assaulting her. The decision by the court means that Ms Huth s lawyers will be able to question Mr Cosby under oath. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, described it as a major victory and says she intends to take a sworn deposition from the comedian within the next month. Earlier in the week, the LA police department confirmed that it was investigating certain complaints against him . The rise and fall of Quaaludes Bill Cosby America s dad under fire It has already emerged from a previous lawsuit that Mr Cosby admitted giving a woman drugs before sex. Court documents relating to the case brought in 2005 Andrea Constand an employee at Temple University in the 1970s were published earlier this month, after the Associated Press news agency applied to a judge to have the sealed papers made public. They revealed Mr Cosby had admitted obtaining Quaaludes from several doctors to give to women before sexual encounters, but did not take them himself. Mr Cosby is now suing Ms Constand for breaching a confidentially agreement after the New York Times obtained a full copy of the deposition. Dozens of women have accused the comedian of sexually assaulting them but most of the claims are barred by statutes of limitations. They restrict the length of time in which legal actions can be taken after an alleged crime has been committed. The accusations, which Mr Cosby has described as fantastical and uncorroborated , have led to some of his stand up shows being called off and the cancellation of some TV projects. 2002 Lachele Covington, a 20 year old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken.

CNN Move over Disney a Nigerian animator has produced an educational cartoon to teach youngsters about African culture. Tired of African children watching only imported cartoons that didn t reflect their lives, Nigerian animator Adamu Waziri decided to do something about it. His creation is Bino and Fino, a cartoon aimed at three to five year olds, about a brother and sister who live with their grandparents in an unnamed African city. I want to create a brand that s as good as Dora the Explorer, Charlie and Lola, quality wise, made in Nigeria, that is educational, and also shows positive aspects of Nigerian African culture, not just to Nigerian or African kids but to kids everywhere, says Waziri. The pilot episode celebrated Nigeria s Independence Day and looked at the issue of colonialism. The cartoon has also had segments teaching the numbers one to 10 in the Nigerian Igbo and Yoruba languages. He adds that he wants the program to teach kids and show that the stuff you see on TV of starving people isn t the only thing in Africa you have a middle class here who have the same aspirations as everybody else. See also Meet the Afropolitans . Bino and Fino isn t the only children s cartoon produced in Africa. Tinga Tinga Tales, for example, is made in Kenya for the BBC, while Jungle Beat is produced in South Africa and has been shown internationally. But both cartoons, like many set in Africa, tell stories about the continent s exotic animals. Waziri was determined to do something different. I said I m not going do African folk tales, animals that s what you get in animated movie Madagascar we don t want to do that, he says.
We want to show a couple of kids in a middle class life, which I know isn t the reality of all the kids in Africa, but let s show that reality the reality of people using laptops, phones, going to school, doing their daily business no talking ants, no dancing jinga jinga music just a cartoon of life. Two full length Bino and Fino episodes have been shown on a channel on Sky TV in the UK, where Waziri says it has been well received. The next step is to attract the funding and sponsors needed to get the cartoon aired in Nigeria. It takes Waziri and his core team of four a month and a half to produce a single episode of Bino and Fino, which is just eight minutes of animation. His says the slow turnaround is off putting for sponsors in Nigeria, where feature length Nollywood movies are often produced in a matter of weeks. See also Nigerian blockbusters for internet generation . Waziri adds that when it comes to entertainment, some Nigerians have a mindset of West is best, but he is determined to change people s minds by showing it s possible to make a credible homegrown alternative to imported programs. He believes that it s not enough for Africans to complain of being underrepresented in foreign cartoons, or misrepresented by international media they must also do something about it. People complain that Africa is not represented well in the media, says Waziri. I understand that, but my point is Nigeria and other parts of Africa aren t poor, you have businessmen, the infrastructure, the ability to link up and make studios, finance it and sponsor it and make the market stop waiting for Disney to do it, do it yourself.
Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has launched a furious tirade against Nottingham Forest over the non payment of a substantial fee for Britt Assombalonga.

Britt Assombalonga was sold to Nottingham Forest last summer for a fee that could rise to 5.5million . Without releasing exact details, the 38 year old took aim at Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi and called on the Football League to take action. It is believed Forest could become subject to a total transfer embargo banning even loan signings once the window for such moves re opens next week. Forest are currently barred only from bringing in permanent transfers as part of their punishment for financial fair play breaches. Writing on Twitter late last night, MacAnthony said sic Ok Posh fans, there wont be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave etc, the real reason is due To a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment not thousands btw last week on plyr they bought from us. Lee Tomlin joined Middlesbrough last summer but MacAnthony wasn t referring to the forward . Nicky Ajose also left Peterborough in the summer, signing for Leeds . This same club did this to us in August now again. Truthfully its a disgrace their chairman is the same. It has put us last minute in A terrible predicament which I shall now fix once loan window opens, we shall bring in a couple of players to help the squad. Its also a shambles the Football League allow this nonsense to carry on not for the first time.
Im also sure we are not only club who Its happened to but the knock on effect is outrageous doesnt help a club like theposhdotcom thats for sure I dont like having to share this on twitter but our fans deserve to know why its been a quiet day i have given the other chairman fair warning that I wouldnt be messed around that all within the game will know this should he not pay up. Sad thing is that he can afford to
By . Peter Rugg . An Arkansas man in custody for allegedly killing his pregnant girlfriend claims he has no memory of assaulting her. Douglas True, 21, reportedly dialed 911 for Fort Smith Police at around 11 52 a.m. on Sunday, asking that they come to a home on the 2900 block of South 66th Street. He waved them into the driveway, and upon entering the house police discovered the body of Briana Butler stabbed to death and lying on the bathroom floor. She was 22 years old and seven months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Police say Briana Butler was found stabbed to death seven months into a pregnancy this Sunday after a fight with her boyfriend . Douglas True, 21, told police that he had fought with Butler but had no memory of stabbing her to death . Butler s daughter Bonnie, 2, was discovered sleeping in a nearby room with minor facial injuries, KFSM reports. The toddler was immediately transported to a local hospital and should make a full recovery. Upon searching the home police recovered a knife they believe was used in the homicide, and it was later confirmed that lacerations on her throat and torso were consistent with knife wounds. True was arrested on suspicion of two charges of capital murder for her and her unborn child. He has been transferred to Sebastian County Detention Center to be held without bond. Police say True called his mother to say he d done a terrible thing and would spend his life in prison . True was advised of his rights and gave a statement admitting that he and Butler got into an argument that escalated to a physical altercation, according to an affidavit. True stated that he was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after that. True said that he got up in the middle of the night and found Butler s body in the bathroom and went back to the couch and passed out.
The next morning he woke up, cut a cast off his arm, then called his mother to tell her he d done something bad and would spend the rest of his life in prison. Chief deputy prosecutor Linda Ward told the Times Record the investigation will continue before charges are filed. Butler s ex husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler, told WHBS that Bonnie had been an attentive and conscientious mother. Because Butler was pregnant, as this sonogram shows, True is being charged with two murders . No human being deserves to be done like that, said Butler s ex husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler. To take your anger and rage out on another person and just totally take . them out, I mean that s just, cowardly right there Eyewitness Barry Wayne, who saw True s arrest, said that a niece living in the complex where the crime took palce told him she was scared something had happened. She had never been in nothing like this before, he said, I seen . three or four police cars and then I was sitting on the porch, and I . seen a gentlemen in the back and they said he had murdered her. He said the girl would move out soon. You never know what s going on in a person s mind, so you always got . to be careful, he said, You never know what s going on with that . person.

Ballot packs were sent to South Cambridgeshire District Council s 8,500 tenants on 17 October. The council said about 65 people had contacted it to say ex partners or dead relatives had been put on the papers. Councillor Mark Howell offered them a heartfelt apology . The Electoral Reform Services has been informed. South Cambridgeshire council tenants are being asked to elect new tenant representatives. The council said its database did include up to date details of tenants who had either moved out or died, but up to 600 were sent to people who previously held a joint tenancy and have moved out and in some cases passed away . They learnt of the mistake on Tuesday, as a result of tenants getting in touch. Mr Howell, who is cabinet member for housing, said Our team made a human error when running a report for the mailing and to avoid this happening again, all correspondence of this type will require double checking and final sign off from the head of service. In 2008, the council made a similar error when it was balloting residents about whether they wished to remain as council tenants. Mr Howell said that mistake was different In 2008, we didn t have sufficient data on the databases. What happened here was we didn t press the right button. The Electoral Reform Services has been informed and it will make sure the mistake does not affect the outcome of the election, the council added.
Villa have lost eight successive matches and are 15 points from safety with five games of the season left. They re probably going to be relegated, Black said. This could very easily implode. It could very easily turn into anarchy. I m going to try and ensure that is not the case. He added If they re all relegated I can only put certain parameters down to ensure that doesn t happen. Villa will drop out of the top flight for the first time since 1987 if they fail to win at Manchester United on Saturday or if Norwich avoid defeat by Sunderland earlier in the day. Black has told forward Gabriel Agbonlahor to undergo a personal fitness programme after deeming him unfit. He will not play for at least two weeks. Black added The players are waiting to see what s going to happen here. They re all in limbo. They are not great elements to motivate yourself every single day. That s my responsibility and I will do my utmost to ensure that it continues to be done on an extremely professional basis.

In the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal and a string of similar cases, the Thai government has passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples.

The parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the law Thursday night. Under the new law, a Thai couple is allowed to seek a surrogate to carry the fetus only if they are able to prove that they and their relatives are infertile.

Arsene Wenger believes his Arsenal side may have switched off towards the end of their victory over Crystal Palace as they escaped with a 2 1 win. The visitors had eased into a two goal lead at half time courtesy of an early Santi Cazorla penalty and an Olivier Giroud strike just before the break. But Palace rallied in the second half and had Arsenal defending deep with substitute Glenn Murray scoring a stoppage time consolation before cracking a post with the last meaningful touch of the game.

Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud holds off pressure from Crystal Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon . Arsenal moved third with the win and, although Wenger praised the fighting spirit of his players, he conceded they suffered a lapse in concentration as Palace pinned them back in search of a point. Certainly they thought that it was done, he said of his players. We know in the Premier League that it s never done, especially at 2 0. With that ball on the post we were a bit fortunate. We can learn from every game. I believe that the players know that maybe they switched off a little bit too early. Overall I still must say that our central defenders played very well today against a very direct and a very physical game at the back. We missed goal number three and when they came back to 2 1 we were a bit lucky, a bit fortunate. We did well so overall I m pleased to have won three points in a place like this.

Eagles boss Alan Pardew was left berating referee Mark Clattenberg as he felt Pape Souare s foul on Danny Welbeck that led to Cazorla s penalty occurred outside of the box with Welbeck then offside in the build up to Giroud s strike. The first goal was a mistake by Pape he should do better, although it was tough on us because it looked like the incident was outside the box, he said. The second goal was offside. That call should have been made. A minute before half time you ve got to get that call right. Despite the defeat, Pardew hailed the performance of his side as the best he has seen since taking over at Selhurst Park at the turn of the year. We took a tactical decision to take the game to Arsenal, he added. We continued with the game plan and I was very pleased with the reaction. Its probably the best we ve played since I ve been manager. The chance when it hit that post and it fell in to the goalkeeper s hands summed our day up. I thought it was going to spin into the net. There was some great team play and probably the best players were on our team. But we ve lost and sometimes that happens.

It may be one of the most quoted lines in American literature and if you dare to quote it, you might have to pay. In late October, Faulkner Literary Rights which represents Nobel Prize winning author William Faulkner s estate sued representatives of Woody Allen s Midnight in Paris for misquoting the famous line, The past is never dead. It s not even past. In the film, about a writer who travels back in time to 1920s Paris, Owen Wilson s character lightly rephrases the line as The past is not dead. Actually, it s not even past. For the film s sin, Faulkner s estate is suing for copyright infringement and asking for damages, disgorgement of profits, costs and attorney fees, according to the suit. Defendant Sony Pictures Classics, which released Midnight in Paris, quickly fired back. Last living Faulkner talks about Pappy This is a frivolous lawsuit and we are confident we will prevail in defending it, the studio said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sony is defending the quotation as a fair use under copyright law, which is a defense that lets others freely reproduce copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism, comment and news reporting. Woody Allen had no comment, his publicist told CNN. But Lee Caplin, executor of the Faulkner estate, believes the movie went over the line in its use of the quotation, which comes from Faulkner s 1950 work Requiem for a Nun. He points out that Midnight in Paris is a commercial enterprise, the line was important to the film and Allen or Sony should have asked permission. Ron Howard asked and received permission for a fee from the estate to use a Faulkner quotation in a Howard produced TV series, he says, and Sony or Allen could have easily done the same. I don t think Woody is any less knowledgeable than Ron Howard, says Caplin, a lawyer and movie producer.
I think Woody s in the motion picture business. It s called a business because you make a movie that sells tickets. ... When you attach Faulkner to your product, you re enhancing that product. You re enhancing it for artistic reasons, but you re mostly enhancing it for the entertaining business reasons of why you make a product more appealing. Moreover, he adds, If Woody could have written something better, I m sure he would have. But Neville Johnson, an entertainment lawyer who specializes in copyright and fair use, thinks the Faulkner estate is grasping. The quote is short, for one thing nine words, a tiny fraction of Requiem for a Nun. You re telling me one sentence gets you a copyright infringement action I don t think so, he says. Caplin disagreed with that line of thinking. It puzzles me that people think size matters, he says. In addition, copyright infringement comes into play if it can damage the potential market of the original work. I guess the book will never sell another copy, don t you think Johnson thundered mockingly. It s all over for Faulkner Looking backward with the bard of Oxford . Of all the writers to be involved in a copyright infringement lawsuit, William Faulkner would seem one of the least likely. The bard of Oxford, Mississippi, is known for colorfully evocative novels about a murky post Civil War Southern landscape, which though rewarding are often the kinds of books forced on unsuspecting high school students. His writing isn t exactly pithy He s been listed in Guinness World Records for constructing a record setting 1,288 word sentence in Absalom, Absalom . Some of his best known works, such as The Sound and the Fury and Intruder in the Dust, are noted for their thickets of stream of consciousness storytelling.
For many years, the Faux Faulkner Contest honored scribblers who attempted to reproduce the master s rhythmic prose, tormented Southern characters, and endless comma strung clauses with parenthetical asides . Faulkner was no stranger to Hollywood himself, signing a series of contracts in the 30s and 40s to write for various studios. He was credited with six screenplays, including the adaptations of Ernest Hemingway s To Have and Have Not and Raymond Chandler s The Big Sleep. His love hate relationship with the movies was parodied in the Coen brothers film Barton Fink through the character of W.P. Mayhew, a hard drinking Southerner hailed by the title character as the finest novelist of our time. Touring the South s literary landmarks . Indeed, Faulkner is considered a titan of American literature, often evoked with Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald among a trio of pre World War II greats. His words particularly the ones approximated in Midnight in Paris still echo, says Jay Watson, the Howry Chair of Faulkner Studies at where else the University of Mississippi. It describes themes in American history, and I think that s one of the reasons why that line has had such resonance, he says. Faulkner s line is haunting and backward looking, a warning that we forget our tangled roots at our peril a sentiment not often expressed in this country, he points out. As a culture, the U.S. is pretty forward looking and youth oriented, Watson says, and we very often tend to have a sharper eye on our future than on the past. A very gray area In a way, it s looking backward that s the nub of the lawsuit. Artists routinely stand on the shoulders of their predecessors, channeling ideas through their personal lenses. Done creatively, it can provide whole new meanings to the original source.
Francis Ford Coppola used Joseph Conrad s Heart of Darkness as the basis for Apocalypse Now Conrad, in turn, relied on Dante s Inferno. Faulkner s books, too, are full of references to other works, particularly the King James Bible and Shakespeare s plays which are both in the public domain . He even said, at moments when he was asked to give advice to young writers, that there s an element of artistic creation that is glorified stealing, says Watson. In order to be bold and ambitious as an artist, you have to be willing to use whatever you find wherever you may find it. Other artists have made frequent use of Faulkner. The Faulkner Institute at Southeast Missouri State University maintains a page of Faulkner sightings. Of course, when done less than creatively, it provides openings for the attorneys and in our remix happy society, full of self produced videos and sampled music, there s a fine line between creativity and copyright infringement or, for that matter, outright piracy . YouTube alone is full of ripped off video files and audio tracks, says Johnson. It s a morass out there of violations across the board, he says. But it is sometimes hard to determine when the line is crossed. Artists and their estates have sued in the past when they believed their copyrights were being infringed upon. In 2001, Margaret Mitchell s estate sued author Alice Randall and publisher Houghton Mifflin over Randall s The Wind Done Gone, a parody of Gone With the Wind told from the point of view of a slave. That case was eventually settled out of court, though an appeals court had upheld Randall s right to create the book. Fair use is a very gray area, says Julie Ahrens, who runs the Fair Use Project at Stanford University s Center for Internet and Society. There are lots of things that are not clear.
I get things where people are like, Are you sure I can do this And the best I can say is, Yes, you should be able to, she says. However, she doesn t see a problem with Midnight in Paris and the past is not dead. Besides, the phrase has been used many times before in news headlines, TV shows and song lyrics. President Obama even used the line in perhaps the most famous speech of the 2008 campaign, known as A More Perfect Union, which he delivered in response to the controversy involving his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama s speech chronicled the challenges of race in America, and also misquoted Faulkner The past isn t dead and buried. In fact, it isn t even past, Obama said. The idea that one person can control the use of those particular words seems ridiculous to me, says Ahrens. Any of kind of literary allusion is ordinarily celebrated. This seems to squarely fall in that tradition. It seems like a lot of effort over a few words this case of the estate of a long dead author going up against a multibillion dollar Hollywood conglomerate. But the impact can be deep. Ahrens is worried about a chilling effect Caplin is hoping that a brighter line can be introduced in the dim area of fair use. It s nothing personal, he adds. He loved Midnight in Paris. As executor, he s just looking out for the fiduciary responsibilities of the Faulkner estate, and he s willing to let a jury decide the merits of the copyright case. I d love to have Woody Allen come down and have a free tour of Faulkner s house Rowan Oak, he says. But if he wants to use any more of Mr. Faulkner, I would want him to give me a call and discuss a license fee.
A new witness in the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, told CNN that Brown and the police officer tussled at the police car window, then the officer shot the teen multiple times, as Brown backed away. What I saw was when Michael and the cop were wrestling through the window, Tiffany Mitchell told CNN s Don Lemon. A shot was fired while Brown was out the window. He got free, and the officer got out of the vehicle, followed Brown and shot him, she said. He raised his hands, and the officer kept firing, she said. Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters late Wednesday for another night, as the group gathered to protest Brown s deadly shooting. Officers in riot gear then marched toward the protesters near a burned out gas station, which has become the gathering point for demonstrations. Police announced that they no longer considered the protest peaceful, before they fired the canisters, CNN producer Yon Pomrenze said. People fled in all directions, as the stinging clouds wafted by them. A separate small group of over a dozen people gathered outside Ferguson s police station holding up signs and chanting protests for a fifth day. Officer not named . Police have said Brown died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer s weapon, but witnesses say it seemed a brazen act of aggression by the officer on Saturday, and that Brown was unarmed and not threatening. On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN that the officer had been hit and suffered swelling on the side of his face. He was taken to a hospital and released the same day, Jackson said. Five days have passed since Brown s killing, and the public still does not know the name of the person who pulled the trigger. There have been cries of a cover up. That doesn t give the community confidence. That doesn t make it transparent, attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters.
And remember, we ve got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug. Crump was one of the attorneys who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager who was killed in a 2012 altercation with Florida man George Zimmerman. But Mayor James W. Knowles said police have received death threats against the officer and his family. They want to prevent further violence, he said. Hackers have gone after his personal information and worked people up against members of government and the police, he said. A town in turmoil 5 things about Ferguson, Missouri . Trouble at night .

We understand the anger we understand that people want answers. We understand that we ve got a problem, but we re just asking people to be peaceful, Jackson said.

Mother Amber Matuska left and right , 31, has been accused of neglecting her son, Delmon Matuska, by exposing him to methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana during pregnancy . The medical examiner has ruled that the cause of death was prematurity with substance abuse by his mother as a contributing factor to his prematurity and subsequent death, according to Tuscon News Now, . Ms Matuska has not been charged in connection to her son s death due to a legal loophole in the negligent homicide statue, which states that children born within a mother s womb could be classified as a self abortion. The Tucson Police Department, who has been investigating the case for the past seven months, said that detectives are still trying to pinpoint when exactly baby Delmon was pronounced dead. On the day of the baby s passing, police executed a search warrant at Matuska s home, seizing cell phones, a counterfeit 20 bill and marijuana. No charges Ms Matuska has not been charged in connection to her son s death due to a legal loophole in the negligent homicide statue . The 31 year old woman has an extensive criminal record dating back to at least 2003, including multiple arrests on drug charges. A month after Delmon s death, the woman was again arrested on narcotics charges, according to court records. Her Facebook page indicates that Ms Matuska also has a 12 year old child.

In the typical textbook picture, volcanoes, such as those that are forming the Hawaiian islands, erupt when magma gushes out as narrow jets from deep inside Earth. But that picture is wrong, according to a new study from researchers at Caltech and the University of Miami in Florida. New seismology data are now confirming that such narrow jets don t actually exist, says Don Anderson, the Eleanor and John R. McMillian Professor of Geophysics, Emeritus, at Caltech. In fact, he adds, basic physics doesn t support the presence of these jets, called mantle plumes, and the new results corroborate those fundamental ideas. Mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis, Anderson says. They are akin to Rudyard Kipling s Just So Stories about how giraffes got their long necks. Anderson and James Natland, a professor emeritus of marine geology and geophysics at the University of Miami, describe their analysis online in the September 8 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to current mantle plume theory, Anderson explains, heat from Earth s core somehow generates narrow jets of hot magma that gush through the mantle and to the surface. The jets act as pipes that transfer heat from the core, and how exactly they re created isn t clear, he says. But they have been assumed to exist, originating near where the Earth s core meets the mantle, almost 3,000 kilometers underground nearly halfway to the planet s center. The jets are theorized to be no more than about 300 kilometers wide, and when they reach the surface, they produce hot spots. While the top of the mantle is a sort of fluid sludge, the uppermost layer is rigid rock, broken up into plates that float on the magma bearing layers. Magma from the mantle beneath the plates bursts through the plate to create volcanoes.
As the plates drift across the hot spots, a chain of volcanoes forms such as the island chains of Hawaii and Samoa. Much of solid Earth science for the past 20 years and large amounts of money have been spent looking for elusive narrow mantle plumes that wind their way upward through the mantle, Anderson says. To look for the hypothetical plumes, researchers analyze global seismic activity. Everything from big quakes to tiny tremors sends seismic waves echoing through Earth s interior. The type of material that the waves pass through influences the properties of those waves, such as their speeds. By measuring those waves using hundreds of seismic stations installed on the surface, near places such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Yellowstone National Park, researchers can deduce whether there are narrow mantle plumes or whether volcanoes are simply created from magma that s absorbed in the sponge like shallower mantle. No one has been able to detect the predicted narrow plumes, although the evidence has not been conclusive. The jets could have simply been too thin to be seen, Anderson says. Very broad features beneath the surface have been interpreted as plumes or super plumes, but, still, they re far too wide to be considered narrow jets. But now, thanks in part to more seismic stations spaced closer together and improved theory, analysis of the planet s seismology is good enough to confirm that there are no narrow mantle plumes, Anderson and Natland say. Instead, data reveal that there are large, slow, upward moving chunks of mantle a thousand kilometers wide. In the mantle plume theory, Anderson explains, the heat that is transferred upward via jets is balanced by the slower downward motion of cooled, broad, uniform chunks of mantle. The behavior is similar to that of a lava lamp, in which blobs of wax are heated from below and then rise before cooling and falling.
But a fundamental problem with this picture is that lava lamps require electricity, he says, and that is an outside energy source that an isolated planet like Earth does not have. The new measurements suggest that what is really happening is just the opposite Instead of narrow jets, there are broad upwellings, which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs. What is driving this motion is not heat from the core, but cooling at Earth s surface. In fact, Anderson says, the behavior is the regular mantle convection first proposed more than a century ago by Lord Kelvin. When material in the planet s crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. What s new is incredibly simple upwellings in the mantle are thousands of kilometers across, Anderson says. The formation of volcanoes then follows from plate tectonics the theory of how Earth s plates move and behave. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them. Stresses in the plates, cracks, and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out, like how water is squeezed out of a sponge. That magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes. The magma comes from within the upper 200 kilometers of the mantle and not thousands of kilometers deep, as the mantle plume theory suggests. This is a simple demonstration that volcanoes are the result of normal broad scale convection and plate tectonics, Anderson says. He calls this theory top down tectonics, based on Kelvin s initial principles of mantle convection. In this picture, the engine behind Earth s interior processes is not heat from the core but cooling at the planet s surface. This cooling and plate tectonics drives mantle convection, the cooling of the core, and Earth s magnetic field. Volcanoes and cracks in the plate are simply side effects.
The results also have an important consequence for rock compositions notably the ratios of certain isotopes, Natland says. According to the mantle plume idea, the measured compositions derive from the mixing of material from reservoirs separated by thousands of kilometers in the upper and lower mantle. But if there are no mantle plumes, then all of that mixing must have happened within the upwellings and nearby mantle in Earth s top 1,000 kilometers. The paper is titled Mantle updrafts and mechanisms of oceanic volcanism. At school, we were all taught that volcanoes just like the one rumbling away in Iceland erupt when narrow jets of magma are forced outwards from the core of the Earth. It s a compelling enough story that it s appeared in textbooks for decades but it s also, apparently, completely wrong. So, the theory we all know and love goes that these long, thin columns of magma referred to by those in the know as mantle plumes act a bit like pipes. There s a well of liquid rock close to the core of the Earth and, though we don t quite know how when they formed, these narrow outlets that are 2,000 miles long and less than 200 miles across allow it to vent out to just below the Earth s crust, in the mantle. Where those columns sit in the mantle there are hot spots and when the Earth s stiff crust fractures slightly, the magma can burst up and out as a volcano. The problem is that such long, thin columns of magma aren t easily explained by basic physics. Mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis, explains Don Anderson, Professor of Geophysics at Caltech. They are akin to Rudyard Kipling s Just So Stories about how giraffes got their long necks.
Advertisement That may sound harsh, but he has evidence to back his point despite scientists holding that the current volcano theory is accurate, seismological searches for the plumes the only way to look that deeply into the planet have yielded no trace of them. But Anderson has a new theory, which he s just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Based on the latest seismological analysis of the planet s structure, Anderson and his team have discovered that the plumes are far bigger than anyone ever considered in the past in fact, there are huge chunks of hot mantle rising at any one point, which are thousands of miles across. Sponsored Imagine a lava lamp inside the planet, with wax replaced by molten rock, and you re not far off. When the hot stuff gets to the top, some of it cools and then falls in long, narrow channels. So, in essence, the new theory is kind of the reverse of the old one. In terms of volcanoes on the surface, the new theory means that their magma actually comes from much closer to the surface of our planet, at the top of Earth s mantle, rather than jetting up from closer to the center of the Earth. Interestingly, that means that volcanic eruptions aren t fueled by excess heat from the core, but rather how the magma close to the surface cools over time. Of course, that doesn t make eruptions any less damaging when they happen but it does mean that we can rewrite the textbooks. PNAS via Caltech via PhysOrg Image by Pablo Hidalgo Shutterstock
By . Toni Jones . Girls rock. And this season the only accessory you really need hanging off your arm is your best friend. Model mates Poppy Delevingne and Alexa Chung set out on a seriously stylish girls only roadtrip for online fashion magazine The Edit earlier this summer. As well as posing in their classic convertible the two beautiful BFFs opened up about their ten year friendship, their wildest nights out, and why they feel it s so important to support and encourage the women in their lives. Poppy, 28, first met Alexa, 30, ten years ago at a casting call, and recalls that even then the brunette had stand out style. Poppy says I remember thinking she was very beautiful, almost cat like, but definitely a bit of a bloke. She was wearing skinny jeans that I wanted needed in my life immediately a feeling I had no idea would resonate every time I saw her.

The real turning point was when we went moonlit skinny dipping in the sea at Cannes. It was spectacular.
At 4 00 a.m., rummaging through bushes for our stray couture, I realized it wasn t just another friendship, says Poppy. The fashionista friends are lucky enough to have toured the world together, for work and fun, but of the two Poppy maintains that it is Alexa who has the most amazing stories I love living vicariously through tales of her love life. That was one of the reasons for inviting her on this trip we re boy crazy. James Poppy s new husband knows I m boy crazy and always will be, but Alexa is really boy crazy.

Poppy, pictured in a selection of Americana inspired designer denim and dresses, also delves into her relationship with sister and model of the moment, Cara Delevingne When it comes to work, I m not competitive at all. Having Cara as my baby, I had to learn quite quickly that I couldn t be competitive because I had a sister who meant more to me. And I knew she was going to be brilliant, so I had to become very aware of not comparing. I don t understand women who don t encourage each other. I think compliments and showing affection are really important, too. Women don t do that enough and it s so essential, because even if you re shy about giving a compliment, it s good energy, it s uplifting.

Editor s note On CNN s State of the Union, host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Neal Williams has installed both high and low tech security as crime has risen in his neighborhood in decline. LAS VEGAS, Nevada CNN Neal Williams carefully picked his house 14 years ago with his wife and children in mind. Just a nice neighborhood, is how he recalls it. A lot of comfortable people to be around. Enjoyable nights ... walk around and walk down the street and say hi, talk to people. Not any more. I have sat in my upstairs windows and watched kids trying to break into a house next door, Williams laments. One of his windows was recently broken, and he came home one day to see evidence someone had tried to kick in his door. He has installed new security systems, some high tech, and also taken a low tech precaution of deliberately not applying oil to a gate hinge. This is my infamous squeaky gate, he tells a recent visitor. That is one of my alarms. Las Vegas is in many ways ground zero of the nation s housing crisis. Bank Owned signs are visible all over town so many foreclosures, in fact, that local real estate brokers have set up bus tours to take potential buyers and investors around town. Some agents are beginning to see evidence of progress. They report that inventory is down some and that more properties now bring multiple offers. Williams, however, says all he sees are the downsides. There are many vacant homes in his neighborhood because of foreclosures, and others have been rented out by banks that can t sell them. And with renters, he says, the sense of community has given way to more trash, graffiti and worse. There was a shooting just recently a couple of doors down, Williams said. We ve been robbed on several occasions.
There is a financial price as well Williams is current on his mortgage, but his home s value has collapsed. Watch the pain and joy of the Vegas housing market . I m scared to look really scared to look, Williams says. I know it has gone down quite a bit. My wife says more than half. I honestly don t know. His neighbor of just six months is moving, at a big loss, because of the rising crime. But not Williams. Do I want to put up with the embarrassment of people saying, You look like you live in a prison Yeah I ll deal with that embarrassment, but I know that I am safer and that is how I look at it. Why not move Well I m a stubborn son of a gun. This is my house. This is where I am staying. Only a few miles away is what you might call the flip side of the foreclosure fallout. Donald Leffert and his wife, Robyn Eddy Leffert, just moved into their first home. It was pre wired for stuff networking, Donald said. It was in a location we wanted. There was very little that needs to be done. They had been looking at condos, but the crash in housing prices made bigger homes within reach. While checking out the yard, Donald found the stunning evidence The real estate brochure from when the house was on the market two years ago. It is identical to his brochure, with two exceptions. The list price then 400,000. Now 179,000. Everything else on the paper is exactly the same, Donald says as he puts the papers side by side. The only difference is the date and the price. A few small toys they found while preparing to move in makes them mindful their joy comes at the expense of some other family s foreclosure. It s pretty sad when you think about the people who have lost their homes, Eddy Leffert said.
You can t go into a house thinking of it being someone else s house or someone s home.
Military officials say they will register weight before professional exams, to link promotion and fitness. Defence Minister Ruben Saavedra has said soldiers must be prepared both on an intellectual and physical level . And the police have forbidden overweight members to wear uniforms until they slim down. The move may already have delivered results, if unexpected ones. In the town of Oruro south of La Paz, two policemen patrolling in civilian clothing succeeded in catching some thieves in a street market, apparently because they weren t in uniform. On 2 December, President Evo Morales suggested that soldiers and officers who neglected their fitness should not be promoted, insisting that staying in good shape was a responsibility of the security forces. Soldiers and police have complained of a lack of sports facilities, so the government has been supplying equipment to barracks and police stations.
By . Lydia Warren . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today claimed that rehab saved his life as he returned to work following nearly two months in rehab. The beleaguered politician, 45, looked decidedly slimmer at the press conference as he apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions. Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial, he said at the press conference at City Hall. But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor. After experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life, I decided that enough was enough. I had become my own worst enemy. Scroll down for video . Apologies Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for his actions on his first day back on the job following rehab . Do you think Rob Ford will relapse Ford said he underwent intensive therapy and physical training at Greenstone rehab center in Bala, Ontario, where staff forced him to confront his personal demons . I now know that the staff at Greenstone saved my life, he said. Thanks to my treatment I can proudly say today that I have begun the process of taking control of my life. He continued But folks, this is a long long road to recovery. No matter what I do, I will never be able to change the mistakes that I have made in the past. When I look back on some of the things I have said and some of the things I did when I was using, I am ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated. I was wrong and I have no one but no one to blame but myself. I want to sincerely apologize. Echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re election in November, Ford vowed to serve Toronto for many, many years . Back to work Toronto Mayor Rob Ford arrives at City Hall on Monday after nearly 2 months in rehab . Exclusive event Media Relations officer Amin Massoudi .
center organizes the select media outlets who are permitted into . Ford s news conference after he arrived at City Hall in Toronto . Although he thanked his family, he did not mention his long suffering wife Renata by name in the speech. Rob Ford . Ford, who said he will continue to undergo treatment, spoke shakily throughout the appearance and would not take any questions before he left the room. He had . entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for . alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking . treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack Ford . admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked . crack in a drunken stupor, following months of denials. He held Monday s press conference in his protocol office a space that holds just 25 people so only certain publications were invited, Ford s communications director Amin Massoudi told the Star. Unhealthier days Ford is pictured in November last year he looked decidedly slimmer at Monday s press conference and said he had been working with personal trainers while in rehab . The venue meant that reporters from the . national wire service The Canadian Press, Now Magazine and Toronto . Community News are not welcome and even the president of the city hall . press gallery. The decision allowed for yet another chapter in Ford s rocky relationship with the media. City spokesperson Wynna Brown said the member s lounge, which is available, would have been more appropriate because it allows for more people. From a city point of view, this is not reflective of the approach or the collaborative relationships we have and value with members of the media, particularly our colleagues in the city hall press gallery, she said. Jonathan Goldsbie, a Now Magazine reporter who was left off the invite list, told the Sun he felt shock, anger, frustration and momentarily, disbelief to have been left of the list.
Out and about Toronto Mayor Rob Ford spent his final Saturday before returning to work shopping in Barrie, Ontario, where he posed for photos. He has been in rehab since the start of May . The . decision to hold it in the protocol lounge is an entirely arbitrary one . that offers no tangible benefit to the mayor or his staff, he said. David . Nickle, president of the city hall press gallery and a reporter for the . Toronto Community News, said the mayor has often limited the media s . access, but never to news conferences. I feel the mayor should be facing all the Toronto media that are interested in hearing him, he said. Ford previously announced plans to launch his re election campaign on July 1 Canada Day. Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford. He said he felt great and was benefiting from the self imposed exile. Treatment Ford had entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario, pictured, in May and likened the experience to going to football camp as a youngster . It . reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I . went to as a kid, he said, adding I am working out every day and I am . learning about myself, my past and things like that. But he said he was missing his family the only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe s on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault. He said No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.
By . Chris Pleasance . Her sculptures may be wooden, but artist Stefanie Rocknak s creations are anything but lifeless as these beautifully detailed pictures show. From a cyclist with veins standing out on his arms, to a face contorted in fear, Rocknak, who is also a professor of philosophy, hand carves each figure when she is not busy in the classroom. While a basic design can take just a few days to complete, more detailed work can take anything up to a month and a half to finish. Sculptor Stephanie Rocknak takes anywhere between a few days and a month and a half to create wonderfully detailed wooden designs such as this one, called The King . Made from two pieces of basswood, one for the body, head and crown, and another for the hands, The King was displayed in the windows of Saks on 5th Avenue, New York . The figure, which was completed in February 2008, was inspired by exhibits in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and the National War Museum in Warsaw, Poland . This piece, The Queen, was finished in August 2010 and designed as a counterpart to The King. The figure is also made from basswood, and her crown is made from many pieces slotted together . Her work has been exhibited all over the world, and a statue of Edgar Allan Poe she designed will take pride of place in Edgar Allan Square in Boston after it is unveiled in October. The brass figure beat 265 other entries from 42 and 13 countries to win the commission, and is designed to look as if Poe has just stepped off the train to visit his parents. Her sculptures have also been displayed in the Smithsonian, the windows of Sak s on 5th avenue, and in the Mariner s Museum, on the Hudson River Sloop.
Rocknak can spend up to 1,000 hours getting the details of a sculpture just right, such as the delicate floral designs which run down The Queen s sleeves and the garlands around her neck . The Biker sculpture was created from two pieces of wood in 2005 and was one piece in a three part commission called The Triathlete, which included a runner and a swimmer . The arms on the rider show the level of detail that goes into Rocknak s work, with his veins, sinewy muscle and wristwatch all painstakingly carved out . Rocknak was artistic from a young age, . training as a painter, before travelling to Rome in 1987 where she was . inspired by the likes of Michelangelo, Dontatello and Bernini and turned . to sculpture instead. While she intended to become a stone sculptor, she started working in wood first as her mother used to refurbish wood furniture, her father was a carpenter, and her grandfather had a wood shop in his ship yard. She always intended to start using stone, but fell in love the warmth and unpredictability of the wood, and never went back. The Swimmer was part of the same commission. Speaking about the work, Rocknak said she was interested in capturing people in motion, as she found posed characters uninteresting . The Swimmer was carved from a single piece of wood and formed part of a three part collection, which included The Rider. The third part, The Runner, was a huge runner s leg, also made from basswood . Rocknak says her art is deliberately simple to understand, and aims to be visually rich and detailed rather than intellectually complex or conceptual . Steering . away from modern conceptual art which Rocknak says is often . overly complex, she aims to create figures which are immediate and . obvious ideally, they do not need a theory to do their talking. One .
of her commissions, The Triathlete, featured three figures including a . bike rider, a swimmer and a giant runner s leg to represent the three . stages of a race. At . the time she was creating the work, Rocknak said she preferred creating . figures in motion as she found posed figures uninteresting. Rocknak says she was inspired by stone masters such a Michelangelo and Donatello but chose to work in wood as her father was a carpenter and her mother used to repair wooden furniture . Rocknak also uses her talents to capture human emotions in wooden sculptures. This piece is simply called Terrified and captures a wide eyed woman with her head thrown back in fear . This work, called Ghastly Nights, captures a woman s fear and frustration which keep her awake .

ComeOnChelsea Drogba said I am very pleased to be able to return to the number 11 shirt and I am very grateful to Oscar for allowing me to make this change. Elsewhere in the squad, Thibaut Courtois is handed the No 13 jersey, with Petr Cech keeping his No 1 shirt. Eden Hazard is Chelsea s new No 10, replacing Juan Mata who left to join Manchester United, and Victor Moses switches to the No 18 shirt previously worn by Romelu Lukaku. Taking a tumble Oscar goes down injured in pre season but should be fit for the start of the new campaign . As a gesture of goodwill, Chelsea are allowing fans who have bought shirts with the old names and numbers on the back to exchange them at the club s shop. All returned shirts will be donated to the Chelsea Foundation, the club s charity organisation which attempts to use sport to bring about positive changes in people s lives and their communities. Unlucky for some Thibaut Courtois has been given the No 13 shirt, as Petr Cech keeps the No 1 jersey .

The cyclist shot dead in the Alps may have been the main target of the massacre, French police say not the British al Hilli family. Investigators made the extraordinary claim as Sylvain Mollier, who worked in the nuclear industry, was temporarily buried in a secret ceremony yesterday. This went against the wishes of the 45 year old s family, who had asked for him to be cremated. Crime scene The bullet riddled BMW where the bodies of Saad al Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and mother in law Suhaila Al Allaf were discovered along with his daughters Zeena and Zainab . It is believed forensic experts still want to examine his body for clues, which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed. Just 30 people attended the funeral, . which took place at 6.30pm last night a day when the burial site is normally closed. It was deliberately . kept hidden from the media, employees told French broadcaster RTL. French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a double life and been the intended target of the shooting. Until now the investigation had focused on the deaths of British aerospace engineer Saad al Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother in law Suhaila al Allaf, 74, who were shot in the countryside near Annecy in their BMW estate car. Mr al Hilli s seven year old daughter Zainab was discovered badly beaten by a passing British cyclist shortly after the attack. Burial Relatives of Sylvain Mollier at Ugine Funeral Home after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation . Her four year old sister, Zeena, was found unscathed hiding under her dead mother s skirt eight hours later.
The family, from Claygate, Surrey, had been camping near Lake Annecy when they were attacked. Victim Saad al Hilli, 50, the father murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute Savoie region of France . It had been thought that Mr Mollier was killed because he witnessed the shootings as he cycled past. But Lt Colonel Benedict Vinnemann, who is leading the gendarme inquiry, revealed he was considering other possibilities. He said Was the al Hilli family the main target Was it not the cyclist Only ongoing work on the scene can answer this question clearly. We re talking about someone whom everybody says was a gentleman, but who s to say he did not lead a double life Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers. Cezus is owned by the Areva group which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in Der Spiegel that it had flouted UN sanctions by providing Iran with enriched uranium. He lived in Ugine, close to the isolated beauty spot on the edge of the village of Chevaline where the shootings took place. He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his second wife, a pharmacist, gave birth in June. Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside. He was identified after his partner, worried about not seeing him return, alerted the police. The two survivors, Zainab and Zeena, are back in Britain and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near London. They are being closely protected, amid fears that whoever was responsible for the attack may try to harm them.
Wuhan, China CNN Professor Kou Zhangbing conducts a health check. He tenderly calls the patient over with a tap of his hand, checks tongue and teeth for injuries, eyes for mood, and skin for scratches. As a treat, he hands out a salted fish. The most important thing we can do is to keep them healthy, he says. Kou is one of a handful of Chinese scientists trying to save the finless porpoise, a freshwater species found in the Yangtze River. Rarer than China s giant panda, this famed species now teeters on the brink of extinction. Recent surveys suggest that there are a mere thousand animals left, down dramatically from similar surveys conducted just six years ago. If proper measures aren t taken they will be extinct in 10 years, but to be honest, we only have five years to take action, said Zhang Xinqiao of the World Wildlife Fund. Professor Kou and his colleagues research the rare mammal in a series of deep blue pools at the Institute for Hydrobiology in Wuhan. They are trying to understand these curious creatures and possibly breed them for the wild. I spend more time with them than with my family, said Kou, They have become an indispensable part of my life. It s mating season, so they dance underwater and act a little strange. Occasionally, a porpoise swims right up to the viewing glass and all but presses its face against it. The porpoise s face is set in a permanent quizzical smile. Dark and forward facing eyes carefully monitor the movements of its visitors. Porpoises are smaller and stouter than their dolphin cousins they have shorter beaks, and live in smaller groups. Those groups could be getting even smaller in the wild. Asia s longest river is also one of its most polluted. Scientists estimate that about 800 million tons of wastewater is dumped into the Yangtze every year.
Pollution, overfishing, and intensive development on the Yangtze have all combined to push the porpoise near extinction. All of these human activities have destroyed the natural habitat of the finless porpoise, taking away their food supply and even injuring and killing them directly, said Zhang. He said the prospect of survival in the Yangtze is bleak, but he clings onto hope for the species. That hope, such as there is, can be found West of Wuhan in Tian e Zhou oxbow lake. Once part of the Yangtze, the lake was formed from a bend in the river and then separated from the main stream. This is the best chance we have to keep the species alive, said Gao Daobin, an official in charge of the park. We only have this animal in China and kids will start asking questions when they learn about it. They will ask why did it go extinct It s no idle fear. The Baiji dolphin, a regal animal with its trademark pointed beak, went functionally extinct in the Yangtze in 2006. Scientists believe there may be individual animals in the murky water, but it could never sustain the species. So the finless porpoise is the last remaining freshwater cetacean left in China. Gao shows us a breeding pen separated from the lake by just a net. A handler drops individual fish into the mouth of the captive porpoises. They have to make sure to give exactly the right nutrients. They will be released into the lake, where the fewer than 40 porpoises could represent their last stand. Nobody cared about them in the past, but attitudes are changing. Now, if they go extinct, all of our years of work will be meaningless, said Gao.
A woman who spent a decade trying every diet under the sun has undergone a body transformation in just 12 weeks. Lisa O Daly, 33, from South East London, struggled with her shape since her early 20s and has never managed to shift excess weight, especially around her middle. After giving everything from Weight Watchers to the Dukan diet a go over the last 10 years, she finally got the toned, taut body she dreamed of after discovering weightlifting, and pairing it with a healthy diet. Scroll down for video . Lisa s body fat percentage went from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, and she lost 2.3kgs in just 12 weeks . While her weight only dropped 5lbs from 9st 12lbs to 9st 7lbs, her size changed dramatically. The former size 14 can now fit into size 8 clothes, and her body fat percentage has dropped from 24 to 19 per cent, showing off her toned muscles. Lisa said I ve tried every diet you can think of but nothing really stuck. At first, it was bizarre muscling my way into the weights room at the gym. Lisa had spent every year since she finished university trying two or three diets a year. Her eating plans included the Zone diet, the 5 2 diet, weight watchers, Carol Vorderman s 21 day detox, No carbs after 5pm, Low carb evenings, the Ducan diet, and juice fasting. But Lisa yo yoed and couldn t keep the weight off, ranging between a size 8 and 16 over 10 years. As soon as she was under stress she would turn to doughnuts, chocolate and coffee and would skip the gym when her job in HR got busy. She embarked on the USN fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training . All her eating and exercise habits have changed and she s clued up on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
When her friend Tarryn suggested she try the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme Lisa never thought she would find herself at home with bench pressing in the weights section. But in just 12 weeks of the fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training she lost 2.3kg and developed a six pack. The free body transformation challenge is based around a five day programme with two rest days, booked online, but the optional USN supplements and shake powders are paid for, available through their website. Thanks to switching snacking on Ben and Jerry s and Dairy Milk to lean meat, veg and brown rice Lisa sent her body fat from 24 per cent down to 19 per cent. She followed a plan of daily exercise to tone her abs, arms and legs and tried out protein supplements to help kick start her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8. Breakfast Nothing . Lunch Three courses of soup with bread, cheesy pasta, and a cake for desert . Dinner Large spaghetti bolognese . Snack Lots of full fat milk coffees, doughnuts . Pre and post workout whey protein shake . Breakfast Porridge . Lunch Salad with grilled chicken, brown rice . Dinner Fish with steamed vegetables . Snacks Handful of nuts . Pre workout USN supplements Xedra Cut Slim Pack and CLA Thermo . She took protein supplements to help her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8 . Day 1 Legs and abs squats, lunges, free weights Day 2 Chest and triceps flat bench dumbbell presses and overhead chest extensions Day 3 Shoulders overhead presses and raises Day 4 Back and biceps barbell rows, dead lifts and curls Day 5 Circuit with plank and crunches . Lisa followed the USN programme pretty closely, working out for 45 minutes a day throughout the 12 weeks, for five days a week with two days off.
She gradually increased the weights as she got further through the programme. Week 1 arm curling 2kg, leg press 65kg . Week 12 arm curling 8kg, leg press 200kg . Lisa said I d started loads of diets, and sometimes finished them, but it never worked. I d fall back into my old eating habits and put it all back on. I thought I was eating healthily and even went to spin classes at the gym but I still had rolls around my stomach. I assumed food was good for me just because it says low carb and low fat on the label. I assumed it was good for me. I wasn t obese or and people didn t look at me and think I was fat, but I wasn t happy and I knew that I needed to lose a few pounds. When I hit 11 and a half stone I became officially classed as overweight and that shocked me into action. But I wanted to do something that was maintainable which USN is. The weight came off really quickly and after just six weeks people were noticing that I d changed. But it s stayed off too. All my eating and exercise habits have changed and I ve clued up on healthy eating.
Relatives of the 96 fans who died gasped as David Duckenfield told the new inquests I apologise unreservedly to the families. He said Everybody knew the truth, the fans and police knew the truth that we d opened the gates. Mr Duckenfield, 70, said he would regret the lie to his dying day . He was in charge of policing at Sheffield Wednesday s stadium on 15 April 1989 when a fatal crush developed in terraced pens allocated to Liverpool fans. The court heard that on the day Mr Duckenfield told Graham Kelly, of the FA, that some fans had got in themselves through gate C, when the truth was that he had ordered the gate to be opened. Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquests, said some witnesses have spoken of having a clear recollection that Mr Duckenfield made reference to gates having been stormed . He said he does not recall being as dramatic as that. Ms Lambert asked Did you appreciate that what you said and indeed, what you did not say, could or might bear that meaning to Mr Kelly and others He replied Yes ma am. I didn t give him sufficient information to appreciate the situation as it occurred. Mr Duckenfield went on to say It was a situation I was totally untrained for, totally unprecedented, and I make no excuses. I was the man who did it. But I faced a difficult situation. I said something rather hurriedly, without considering the position, without thinking of the consequences and the trauma, the heartache and distress that the inference would have caused to those people who were already in a deep state of shock, who were distressed. I apologise unreservedly to the families. He told the court that he had no idea what motivated him to lie. Earlier, Mr Duckenfield said it was one of the biggest regrets of his life that he did not consider the consequences of opening the gate.
He said he was unaware that turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end fed into an inner concourse and that gate C was opposite a tunnel into the terraces. Mr Duckenfield said he did not think before opening the gates about blocking the tunnel off with a line of police officers as had happened in previous years. The inquests heard he had not been aware that at 14 30, some 5,700 fans were still trying to enter the ground outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles because he did not know the club had a system for monitoring the supporters. It meant 800 fans would have to go through each turnstile in 30 minutes to get in for kick off. Mr Duckenfield said he accepted this was not going to happen . Mr Duckenfield, who had been stationed in the police control box with a bank of TV monitors, said he was shocked at the request from Supt Roger Marshall to open the Leppings Lane gates after police became overwhelmed by the number of fans. The witness continued I was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking, Where are these people going to go if I open the gates He said another message then came through on the police radio from Mr Marshall saying If we don t open the gates someone s going to get killed. Mr Duckenfield said That really was a shocking, terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation. Another officer in the police box, Mr Bernard Murray, then said to him Are you going to open the gates the jury heard. Mr Duckenfield said I remember saying to him quite clearly, Mr Murray, if people are going to die I have no option but to open the gates. Open the gates. He said he thought fans would feel relief and comfort in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse.
I think it is fair to say it is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life that I did not foresee where the fans would go when they came in through the gates, he continued. I was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision I had to make and, as a result of that, this is probably very hard to admit, as a result of that I was so overcome probably with emotion of us having got into that situation that my mind for a moment went blank. Mr Duckenfield was questioned in front of about 200 relatives of those who died as a result of the disaster. Ms Lambert asked him if he should have taken steps to delay the start of the match. He responded I accept that view now, ma am . Asked what he would have done had he known there were so many supporters waiting to enter, he replied I would have informed the club. I would have informed the referee that we had a difficulty arising and that on the evidence we had available, we should consider delaying the kick off. On the day of the match, police could only judge how full the pens in the terraces were by looking at CCTV and the terraces. There were counters on the banks of turnstiles but these did not track how many people were going into each pen. Earlier, Mr Duckenfield also told the jury he could not account for his movements for a period of more than two hours before he took up his position in the police control box on the afternoon of the semi final. He told the inquests his mind was a complete blank and he could only remember being taken taken out in a police car by a colleague and we drove around . Ms Lambert put it to Mr Duckenfield that this was a significant period of time and would have been a golden opportunity to get to know the ground better, on what was to be his first match as commander.
Mr Duckenfield agreed that it was, but said he could not recall whether it was an opportunity he had taken. Ms Lambert also said it would have been a good opportunity for Mr Duckenfield to survey the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end. Again, Mr Duckenfield agreed. He accepted it was part of his job as a match commander to have a basic knowledge of the layout of the stadium . Earlier the retired officer said he had urged police to ensure both sets of fans had a good day out. He wrote a briefing document for officers before the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, the jury was told. In the note he said I cannot stress too highly the word safety. The ground will be full to capacity . He recalled telling officers that ...it was supposed to be a wonderful occasion for both the Liverpool and Notts fans. They were to come along and enjoy themselves, and we, the police service, were to ensure that they had a good day out. We were to be tolerant, understanding of their enthusiasm, treat them with respect, and put ourselves forward as a professional and caring organisation . The inquests continue.

BEIJING, China CNN Travelers to China who display flu like symptoms may be randomly quarantined over concerns of the swine flu virus, the U.S. State Department warned. A child traveling with his parents wears a face mask after they arrive at the Beijing, China, airport. There have been cases of children being separated from parents after either tested positive for the virus, also known as H1N1, a travel alert said Friday. Chinese officials may give medications to minors in such cases without consulting their parents, according to the alert. Although the proportion of arriving Americans being quarantined remains low, the random nature of the selection process increases the uncertainty surrounding travel to China, the alert said. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs transmitted to humans and caused by type A influenza virus. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. There have been about 48,000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 519 in China, according to the World Health Organization. The Chinese government has taken measures to stop the spread of the virus. They include placing passengers who have fever or flu like symptoms on a seven day quarantine, the alert said. Others facing quarantine include those sitting close to travelers with symptoms, those with elevated temperatures and those from areas where virus outbreaks have occurred. A 15 year old from Topeka, Kansas, told CNN on Monday that she was quarantined in Beijing for a week. Apparently, I was sitting too close to a man who had a fever on the 14 hour plane ride, Kaitlin Hannigan said, adding that she initially thought she had a fever, but her temperature was fine when officials checked it. A day after she arrived in Beijing with an educational group, government officials showed up at her hotel.
They were wearing quarantine suits, goggles and masks and, like, full body suits and gloves, and said I had to be quarantined for seven days because I came in contact with that guy, Hannigan said. Earlier in June, New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin was quarantined in Shanghai after possible exposure to the virus. Nagin was headed to Australia on an economic development trip when he was quarantined for four days after sitting beside a passenger who was being treated for suspected swine flu symptoms. Nagin showed no signs of illness. State officials warned Americans traveling to China that they have to follow local quarantines procedures. The U.S. Embassy will be unable to influence the duration of stay in quarantine for affected travelers, the statement said. The travel alert expires in September.
The Swiss third seed s 300th Grand Slam match win was secured 6 4 3 6 6 1 6 4. Australian Nick Kyrgios was involved in an argument with an umpire as he lost 6 3 6 4 1 6 6 4 to Tomas Berdych. Top seeds Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic won in straight sets, while former champion Maria Sharapova also went through. Williams, of the United States, was in imperious form, taking just 45 minutes to beat 18 year old Russian Darya Kasatkina 6 1 6 1. Serb Djokovic was not at his best against Italian Andreas Seppi, but won 6 1 7 5 7 6 8 6 , thanks in part to the Italian finding the net too often with his returns. Sharapova needed three sets to beat unseeded American Lauren Davis, the Russian fifth seed dominating the latter stages to win 6 1 6 7 5 7 6 0. Poland s number four seed Agnieszka Radwanska had a rather more straightforward day, beat Puerto Rican Monica Puig 6 4 6 0. The 34 year old Swiss had won a tight battle against Dimitrov in Brisbane in the build up to the Australian Open, but was a more comfortable winner on the bigger Grand Slam stage. Both men displayed the elegant shot making for which they are known, but had Federer been more effective on break points in the second set, he might have won it in three sets. Federer failed to recover an early deficit in the second set and had converted only one of eight break points going into the third, only to step on the gas and leave Dimitrov in his wake. Grigor was playing well and I thought I was struggling a little bit, said Federer, who plays Belgian David Goffin in round four. It was an important start to the third set. Thankfully I got the early break and was able to stay in the lead.
Kyrgios has rarely been far away from controversy at the Australian Open, having been fined for uttering an audible obscenity during his first round win over Spain s Pablo Carreno Busta. He then had to leave the court during his second round match against Uruguay s Pablo Cuevas because of a problem with his shorts. Against Berdych, Kyrgios launched into a rant at umpire James Keothavong, claiming that he could hear music from the stands, and that it was disrupting his game. The Australian, having lost the first two sets, took the third convincingly following the confrontation with Keothavong, but sixth seed Berdych came through to close out the match. It took two hours and 14 minutes for five time Grand Slam champion Sharapova to see off Davis, the world number 103, and claim the 600th victory of her 15 year career. Wow. I ve won 600 matches said the 28 year old. Is this like a friendly reminder that I m getting old Might be. Sharapova next faces a tough test against 18 year old Bencic, with the winner earning a potential quarter final against Serena Williams. Bencic, coached by Melanie Molitor mother of Martina Hingis , has won her last 15 three set matches dating back to the 2015 French Open. Australia s Daria Gavrilova followed up her shock victory over two time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova with a dramatic 6 4 4 6 11 9 win over Kristina Mladenovic of France. The 21 year old, who beat three top 10 players in 2015, has made the fourth round for the first time and will face Spain s Carla Suarez Navarro next. I m just really excited and I want to hug the whole stadium, Gavrilova, the world number 39, said afterwards.
Among the many matches postponed on a day of rain in Melbourne was the all British doubles meeting between Johanna Konta and Heather Watson, and Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith. With all four players in the GB Fed Cup squad, and team captain Judy Murray sure to be courtside, it could yet prove significant in terms of planning for next month s qualifier in Israel. The postponements mean a packed schedule on Saturday, with Konta up against Czech Denisa Allertova first on Hisense Arena at 00 00 GMT, and fellow British number one Andy Murray against Portugal s Joao Sousa first in the Margaret Court Arena night session at 08 00.

The firm s final results for the year ended 31 March 2015 also show a rise in pre tax profit by 11 to 10.8m. Without one off costs, adjusted profit rose to 16.6m. Iomart listed its highlights as strengthened relationships with major vendors such as Microsoft and EMC and better opportunities from the market for Hybrid Cloud solutions . A hybrid cloud is where some resources and provided and managed in house where others are sourced externally. Iomart said it had benefited from the increasing complexity of a hybrid cloud. These include questions about cost, value, effectiveness, security and compliance, around the core business of providing data storage capacity in several centres. Chief executive Angus MacSween said customers were seeking to combine their own IT hardware with contracts for use of private space in a separate data centre, along with use of the publicly available cloud. The effective management of all these is the opportunity for Iomart which we would collectively term the hybrid cloud, he said. The company has been buying other firms over the past year, helping to drive up those revenue figures figures. Including acquisitions, the hosting of cloud data rose in value by 23 to 55m, though without them, growth was 9 . Revenue fell slightly in Easyspace, the division which supports clients websites and email. On Monday, it was announced that Iomart had bought the London based cloud computing consultancy, SystemsUp, for at least 9m.
The billionaire and reality TV star said Mr McCain was only considered a hero because he was a prisoner of war. He then added I like people who weren t captured. The comments prompted strong criticism across the party. Rival contender Rick Perry said the remarks were a new low in US politics. Mr Trump later sought to clarify his remarks, although he did not apologise. If a person is captured, they re a hero as far as I m concerned, he said. I don t like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate because he is not taking care of our veterans. The two have clashed before, with Mr McCain accusing Mr Trump of having fired up the crazies with his attacks on Mexican immigrants. Mr McCain was held for five and a half years after his plane was shot down in the Vietnam war. Mr Trump avoided service through student and medical deferments. The 2008 presidential candidate is yet to respond to Mr Trump s remarks, although his daughter Meghan tweeted she was disgusted . Many of Mr Trump s rivals for the nomination lined up to attack him. There are currently 15 people running to be the Republican presidential candidate. Mr Trump has led in some early polls, although analysts have predicted his appeal is likely to wane as the contest develops.
The race was held over three days in May, with starts or finishes at Bridlington, Leeds, Scarborough, Selby, York and Wakefield. The tourism body said the event was seen by more than 1.2 million people. In 2016, the three day men s race is to start on 29 April, with a women s race on 30 April. More on this story and other news from Leeds and West Yorkshire There were one million spectators at the race with about one in five from outside Yorkshire, said Welcome to Yorkshire. Some of those attended more than one day of the event, boosting the overall figure. The new race was set up after the successful Tour de France Grand Depart was held in Yorkshire during 2014. Those scenes prompted the tour s race director Christian Prudhomme to describe 2014 as the grandest Grand Depart . Spending by all spectators at the Tour de Yorkshire amounted to 49,711,436 and the average stay for visitors from outside the county was two and half nights, according to the survey of the race. The total included accommodation costs and spending on items such as food, drink, transport and souvenirs. The survey was conducted by independent research agency GRASP, using 1,500 respondents who were questioned at a race stage or online. The data was analysed by Leeds Beckett University.
Royal Bank of Scotland s bosses were warned about the danger of a computer meltdown two years before an IT glitch caused chaos for millions of its customers. But it has paid customer less than 5 compensation on average, with 2.7million receiving less than 1. The explosive details emerged yesterday as the state backed lender was hit with a record 56million fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 which locked millions of its customers out of their bank accounts. Royal Bank of Scotland was hit with a record 56m fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 . Underlining the seriousness of the failings, the fine marks the first joint penalty between City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England s Prudential Regulation Authority, established to prevent another financial crisis. Issuing its first penalty of 14million the PRA said the RBS s IT incident could have had adverse effects on the stability of the financial system by disrupting the clearing system, which is used to settle payments among banks. Tracey McDermott, the FCA s director of enforcement and financial crime, said Modern banking depends on effective, reliable and resilient IT systems. The bank s failures meant millions of customers were unable to carry out the banking transactions which keep businesses and people s everyday lives moving. Business Secretary Vince Cable said This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures. RBS s priorities under Fred Goodwin meant that it neglected its IT systems, which in some cases are now decades out of date. The issues in June 2012 stemmed from a botched upgrade to the software that processed updates to customers accounts overnight. The disruption lasted for more than a week for RBS and NatWest customers, and more than three weeks for Ulster Bank, RBS s Irish subsidiary.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures RBS admitted to unacceptable weaknesses in its computer systems as around 6.5million customers equivalent to 10pc of the UK population could not pay bills or receive money and wages into their bank accounts. It revealed that it has paid a total of just over 70million in compensation to customers who were hit with overdraft charges or incurred other expenses because of the meltdown. But the lender, which promised to ensure no customers are left out of pocket, admitted this equates to an average of just 4.83 for the 4.7million retail customers of RBS and NatWest customers affected. Some 2.7m customer received less than 1 due to lost interest on current accounts and savings. The bank could not provide a breakdown of compensation for Ulster Bank and business customers. Last night one MP branded the compensation derisory . John Mann, Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee said This compensation is equivalent to not much more than a pint of beer. Yet again customers are not being looked after while people at the top get excessive pay and bonuses. Yesterday regulators revealed that the dangers of the batch scheduler software failing were flagged up to management on August 1 2010, just under two years before the systems meltdown. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago For this reason it fined RBS for breaches covering the period from August 1 2010, to July 2012, when the problem was finally fixed. RBS s new chief administration officer Simon McNamara, brought in last year to clean up the mess, yesterday insisted the specific problem was not explicitly called out to RBS bosses by internal auditors. He said the bank had committed to spend 750million by 2015 on making its IT systems more secure and added that the door is open to customers who believe they are still out of pocket as a result of the failings.
Former chief executive Stephen Hester waived his 963,000 bonus over the IT debacle. The latest fine comes as he already faces pressure to hand back a 1million long term shares bonus he received earlier this year, despite being ousted from his position last summer. Last week RBS was fined 400million by UK and US regulators for rigging the 3 trillion a day foreign exchange market under Mr Hester s watch. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said Our IT failure in the summer of 2012 revealed unacceptable weaknesses in our systems and caused significant stress for many of our customers. As I did back then, I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago. RBS and NatWest have 26million UK customers, 4,000 ATMs and 2,120 bank branches.
Chapel Hill, N.C. CNN Margo Balboni is cramming college into three years to cut down on the cost of her student loans. As it is, the University of North Carolina sophomore expects to graduate in a few years with 20,000 in debt. I try not to think about it too much, said Balboni, The last thing I want is to be financially dependent on my parents. Balboni is scared of the student loan bills she may face when she graduates in a few years. But come July, millions of college graduates may see their payments jump. That s when the interest rate on federally subsidized college loans is set to double. Unless Congress decides to freeze current interest rates, the more than 7 million Americans will see their annual rates jump from 3.4 to 6.8 . Just the thought of that, said Balboni, definitely makes my anxiety go up several notches. The issue is fast becoming a political football, and one President Barack Obama hopes to score with young voters. But his likely Republican opponent is trying to take the ball off the field by also supporting the freeze. Romney camp Why we will get the young people . This week, Obama begins an all out push for Congress to extend the low rates on these loans. We can t make higher education a luxury, he said during a rally in North Carolina Tuesday. It s an economic imperative. Every American family should be able to afford it. That message is red meat to the college crowd, a group the president has to energize in big numbers before November. In 2008, the president won two thirds of 18 29 year olds. Sen. John McCain won 32 . That year young voters made up one fifth of the electorate. That may not sound like a large enough voting block to decide an election but, on the state level, young voters can make a big difference. In North Carolina during the last election, Obama won by just 1 , or 14,177 votes.
But he carried the state s young voters by an overwhelming 74 . The youth vote clearly helped provide a cushion for his upset victory and the state s 15 electoral votes. Since then, the dynamic has changed. Youth turnout dropped 6 between the 2008 presidential election and the 2010 midterms. Though a drop off in turnout among young voters is predictable when there s no presidential candidate on the ticket, there are other reasons the Obama team has to worry about a lower turnout. Young people have been hit especially hard during the recession, with more than half of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed. And a recent Harvard University Institute of Politics survey showed that while young people still overwhelmingly support Obama, they are now less likely to vote this fall, more disillusioned about the economy and politics in general. It s not too late for Obama to relight some fires, said Hodding Carter, Public Policy Professor at UNC. I do not think it s possible for him to ignite the kind of conflagration in the entire youth that he did last time. Carter believes young voters are easily disillusioned by the gridlock in Washington. They essentially looked up and said but it didn t work right away so the hell with it. And that s always a problem with the youth vote. Student loan rate hike What you need to know . So the president is now stepping up his effort to appeal to young voters. This week he s visiting college campuses in states he carried in 2008 and those that will be in play in 2012 North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. He is pushing the keep college loans affordable message and pointing the finger at Republicans. His speech in North Carolina included an attack on a Republican congresswoman for her position on student loans. He didn t mention her name but the president recounted the comments of Rep. Virginia Foxx R NC who had told a talk radio host that she had very little tolerance for students who graduate with large amounts of debt.
Can you imagine that the president asked the crowd, which responded with loud boos. What he doesn t mention is that Romney came out this week in favor of extending a freeze on the current interest rates. With the number of college graduates who can t find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans, Romney said before a campaign event in Astor, Pennsylvania on Monday. Romney is making a play to dampen enthusiasm for the president among young voters. At the Pennsylvania event he told reporters, I think this is a time when young people are questioning the support they gave to President Obama three and a half years ago. One issue the Romney campaign is certain to hit on the unemployment rate among 20 24 year olds is five points higher than the national average. In his comments on the youth vote, Romney added, He the president promised a future with good jobs and good opportunity that hasn t happened. But it may be in the administration s interests to keep the subject in the headlines, continuing to suggest that the Republicans will stand in the way of a deal. It will cost the United States 6 billion to extend the student loans for just one year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. John Kline, the Republican chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, has called it an untenable situation in which we must now choose between allowing interest rates to rise or piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers. Kline said he is working to find a responsible solution a way to pay for an extension of the freeze. On Tuesday, Obama attacked Congress for continuing subsidies for oil companies and for its failure to increase taxes on the wealthy, leading the crowd to chants of no to questions such as Do we want tax cuts for the rich The current interest rate reduction passed with bipartisan support in 2007, but Republicans have pointed out that then Sen. Obama missed two votes on the issue.
The White House has pointed out the president was campaigning at the time and was prepared to return to cast his ballot if needed for the vote then Sen. Joe Biden and Sens. Chris Dodd and John McCain also missed the vote. The back and forth in Washington is seen as just more noise to the students who face a rate increase on July 1. Balboni, the UNC sophomore, said her biggest fear is the possibility she ll be so deeply in debt, she ll have to move into her parent s home after graduation. Yeah it s the 800 pound guerilla in the room. It s everyone s plan Z. Nobody wants to go all the way to that.
By . Daniel Martin . Controversial The health watchdog NICE has called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass . Free weight loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog yesterday called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, NICE s ruling doubles to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer funded surgery. But campaigners said it was wrong to offer operations costing 5,000 when the NHS faces a 30billion deficit and NICE is denying cancer patients life extending drugs. They warned the obese should instead be told to eat less and exercise more. We ve got a mismatch between what NICE recommends and what the country can afford, said Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum. Thousands of people will look at this and say I fit that criteria, I want the surgery. This is going to stretch clinical commissioning groups to the limit we ve got a creaking Health Service as it is. We could end up with a situation where clinical commissioning groups say we can t get the extra midwives we need for the local hospital, we can t pay for life saving drugs for people with cancer because other people have been given the right to have expensive bariatric surgery. The surgery covers procedures including gastric bands and gastric bypasses, where the digestive system is rerouted past most of the stomach. NICE said a gastric bypass on the NHS costs 5,410 and a gastric band 2,473. Weight loss surgery is given to patients who are morbidly obese with a body mass index score of more than 40. It is also offered to those who have a BMI over 35 with another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Around a million people qualify under these rules although in practice only around 10,000 operations are carried out every year.
But now NICE is suggesting that diabetics with a BMI score of 30 or more should be considered for an assessment for weight loss operations on the NHS. Diabetes UK says the new rules mean between 850,000 and 900,000 extra people could qualify. Rise The ruling would double the number of people who could qualify for taxpayer funded surgery to 1.8million . It will be up to individual clinical commissioning groups, which hold local NHS budgets, to decide whether the surgery should be funded in their areas. Britain is in the grip of an obesity epidemic and 2.9million people now have diabetes, a condition which in its type 2 form is linked to poor lifestyle. Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said Obesity rates have nearly doubled over the past ten years and continue to rise, making obesity and overweight a major issue for the Health Service. Updated evidence suggests people who are obese and have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may benefit from weight loss surgery. More than half of people who undergo surgery have more control over their diabetes following surgery and are less likely to have diabetes related illness in some cases surgery can even reverse the diagnosis. NICE says that by losing weight patients can reduce the damaging consequences of diabetes, such as the risk of blindness or heart attack. Its guidance states that an operation is repaid in savings to the NHS within three years. After that, there are gains of around 4,000 per year per patient. But Roger Goss of Patient Concern said NICE doesn t seem to know the NHS is heading for a deficit. They are wasting our money. Obese people should be encouraged to eat less and take more exercise rather than having this expensive treatment paid for. Simon O Neill, from the charity Diabetes UK, said Bariatric surgery should only be considered as a last resort if serious attempts to lose weight have been unsuccessful and if the person is obese.
It can lead to dramatic weight loss, which in turn may result in a reduction in people taking their type 2 diabetes medication and even in some people needing no medication at all. This does not mean, however, that type 2 diabetes has been cured. These people will still need to eat a healthy balanced diet and be physically active. The BMI score is a simple measure based on height and weight with a score higher than 25 indicating overweight and 30 or more being judged as obese.
By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED . 21 43 EST, 17 October 2013 . . UPDATED . 04 38 EST, 18 October 2013 . An off duty police officer shot dead while tackling a psychotic gunman has been named the bravest officer in England and Wales. Pc Ian Dibell, 41, was hit at point blank range as he tried to stop Peter Reeve, 64, gunning down his neighbours. Just minutes earlier the paranoid gunman fired seven times at his neighbour and his girlfriend in the communal hallway of their home. Pc Ian Dibell, left, who has been posthumously given a national bravery award . after he was shot dead when he tried to wrestle a weapon from deranged . gunman Peter Reeve, right . The Essex officer s self sacrifice was honoured at the Police Bravery Awards, organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May joined dozens of police officers at the annual event in Central London. Among them were frontline officers who tackled armed robbers, rescued people from burning buildings and dived in freezing water to save drowning children. Mr Cameron said it is humbling to read the extraordinary acts of heroism undertaken by officers in the line of duty. Every single day, around our country, the police put themselves in harm s way to keep us safe, he said. Without the rule of law, there is no freedom worth its name and it is right that we recognise the work of those who do so much to uphold it. Britain s police are the best in the world, ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things. Theresa May honoured Pc Dibell at the London event . The awards come during a tense week . for relations between the police and the Government amid further . fall out from Plebgate Andrew Mitchell affair. Mr Cameron said his Tory party . colleague, who rowed with officers at the gates of Downing Street .
deserves an apology over his treatment by three senior police . representatives. Pc Dibell was killed in an extraordinary confrontation a short distance from his home in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. The . officer walked out of his home to see Reeve chasing his neighbour in . his car while firing a pistol at him through the windscreen. Grabbing his warrant card to put himself on duty, Pc Dibell ran towards the car and dived through the driver s side window. Witnesses . described hearing a loud bang before the officer fell to the road, . clutching his chest. He died at the scene from his injuries. Reeve then ran over his neighbour who escaped with minor injuries and crashed his car before travelling to a village graveyard where he turned the gun on himself. Mrs May said Ian Dibell s death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. Pc Dibell was off duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm s way. His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world. Steve Williams, who leads the Police Federation, said For every act of courage and bravery recognised here today there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised. Officers put others lives before their own. Sadly, as our winner s story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. Pc Ian Dibell was a valiant team player, his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life always putting others before himself. Merseyside Pcs Nathan Jackman and Peter Stevens who tackled a violent knifeman after he attacked a man and a woman.
Off duty Pc Sara Widdrington, from North Yorkshire, who fearlessly tackled a gunman in a local store while shopping with her son. West Midlands Pcs Stephen Fletcher and Rory Stuart Knill who were ambushed by a masked gang of up to 40 people armed with petrol bombs during the 2011 riots. Pc Martin Bentley, of Norfolk who pursued and caught a violent armed wife beater despite being stabbed. Pc Alun Morgan, of Dyfed Powys Police, who dived into freezing quarry waters to rescue a drowning 15 year old boy. Pc Nicholas French, of Gloucestershire, who single handedly tackled a man armed with a knife who was trying to kill his wife in a garage.

Longtime Fox News contributor and fill in host Laura Ingraham is in line for her own show on the channel, possibly in a key prime time hour. On Monday a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN that there are talks underway between Ingraham and Fox executives, but no decisions have been finalized. The addition of an Ingraham talk show could be part of a bigger picture reshuffling of Fox News Channel s highly rated schedule. A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment and Ingraham did not respond to a request for comment. Ingraham has been a paid contributor to Fox News since 2007. The show that s been discussed would be a big promotion. Matt Drudge, who is well sourced in conservative media circles, spurred intrigue about potential changes when he tweeted this on Monday FALL PREVIEW Laura Ingraham s prime time to shine After years in the trenches, much deserved. Drudge got tongues wagging, which may have been his goal. The prime time hours on cable news are 8, 9 and 10 p.m. When Megyn Kelly left for NBC in January, Tucker Carlson took over her 9 p.m. time slot. Then in April when Bill O Reilly was removed amid a sexual harassment scandal, Carlson moved into O Reilly s 8 p.m. time slot and the channel s 5 p.m. conservative talk show The Five moved to 9 p.m. Sean Hannity remained in place at 10 p.m. Now there is speculation inside and outside Fox that another schedule shake up is in the works. The cable news channel seems to be exploring programming options in the event that Eric Bolling does not return. Bolling is the centerpiece of the 5 p.m. show that was created when The Five moved to 9. It is called Fox News Specialists. Earlier this month Bolling was suspended pending a probe into accusations that he sent lewd texts to colleagues, which he has denied.
If Fox News executives need to replace The Specialists, The Five could be shifted back to its original 5 p.m. time slot. Then Ingraham could take over at 9 p.m. Alternatively, Hannity could move up one hour to 9, and Ingraham could take over at 10. Or maybe Fox executives have something in mind that nobody else has thought of yet. Along with the Bolling suspension, another subplot is the ratings race between Fox and MSNBC. The MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has snapped Fox s winning streak in the 9 p.m. hour. So Fox executives are asking themselves Would Ingraham be a better match against Maddow than The Five currently is Ingraham is a vocal supporter of President Trump, just like some of the co hosts of The Five. She is already a popular radio talk show host, with a three hour morning time slot on stations across the country. She also operates a conservative themed news and features site called LifeZette. Fox News Channel is in discussions with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that could result in her coming to the 21st Century Fox owned cable news network as a regular host, a person familiar with the outlet s plans confirmed early Tuesday. The two sides are believed to be in early talks, and no decision has been made regarding the time slot Ingraham might anchor, or even when she might join the company in the new role. No deal has been signed, and there is no sense at this time when one might come to fruition, this person said. She already serves as a Fox News contributor. Revelation of the talks, which surfaced Monday on The Drudge Report and were further detailed by CNN, show Fox News Channel continuing to mull tinkering with its program line up as it grapples in real time to find alternatives for hosts who have come under recent fire.
Fox News replaced mainstay Bill O Reilly in April after he parted ways over advertiser reaction to disclosures of settlements paid to women who had accused him of sexual harassment and other improprieties. The network s current primetime lineup features Tucker Carlson at 8 p.m, the panel show The Five at 9 p.m., and Sean Hannity at 10 p.m. And though Fox News remains cable s most watched news network, it has had to contend with a resurgent MSNBC, where a primetime lineup led by Rachel Maddow has expanded its audience. Related Fox, Major League Baseball Strike New Rights Pact Official Name of New Fox Is, Uh, Fox and Other Takeaways From Annual Stockholders Meeting Ingraham has a long association with Fox News, having served as a fill in for both Hannity and O Reilly. Executives at the network have remained open to the idea of tweaking its primetime lineup, Fox News co president Jack Abernethy told Variety in July. Fox News is also mulling talent options due to the recent suspension of Eric Bolling, the former commodities trader who served as co host on the late afternoon program Fox News Specialists, this person confirmed. Bolling was suspended earlier this month, when Fox News said it planned to investigate recent allegations made in a Huffington Post report that Bolling may have sexually harassed colleagues. Bolling has denied the charges and said he intends to clear his name. Fox News is not commenting, but people familiar with the talks who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly said Ingraham is seen as a compatible fit between the network s conservative prime time hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. Under that scenario, the roundtable show The Five which moved to 9 p.m. Eastern time when the network had to shuffle its program line up after Bill O Reilly exited in April would move back to its original time slot of 5 p.m. Eastern to make room for Ingraham.
New Delhi CNN The leaders of five of the world s top emerging economies moved closer Thursday toward establishing a development bank that could one day serve as an alternative to the World Bank. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa collectively known as the BRICS agreed to examine in greater detail a proposal to set up a BRICS led South South Development Bank, funded and managed by the BRICS and other developing countries, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. The leaders were meeting in New Delhi on Thursday for their fourth annual summit. Finance ministers from the five countries have been directed to look into the idea of the development bank and report back at the next summit, Singh said. The leaders also asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up changes in its governance to better represent the developing world as a voting bloc. The rapid recovery of the BRICS economies from the financial crisis highlighted their role as growth drivers of the global economy, Singh said. Together, the BRICS nations make up more than 40 of the world population and one fifth of the global economy. The group called for peaceful resolutions of the Syria and Iranian crises. We agreed that a lasting solution to the problems in Syria and Iran can only be found through dialogue, Singh said. Besides the IMF, the leaders also urged reforms of the United Nations and other international bodies for a larger voice for the developing world. Institutions of global political and economic governance created more than six decades ago have not kept pace with the changing world. While some progress has been made in international financial institutions, there is lack of movement on the political side, Singh said. BRICS should speak with one voice on important issues such as the reform of the UN Security Council.
The tech firms are investing in rival efforts to beam the internet down to the ground from flying objects in the stratosphere twice as high as aeroplanes normally fly. Facebook aims to build a network of laser beaming drones that will tightly circle known black spots. Google also has a drone project about which it s tight lipped. But the company is more open about an attempt to send strings of giant balloons circumnavigating the globe to provide persistent data links to the parts of the planet they pass. The schemes may both seem far fetched. But the brains behind both companies efforts told the BBC they are convinced they have a real shot at connecting the 57 of the world s population still offline. Of the two projects, Facebook s plan is arguably at an earlier stage. It has not flown yet, that s the next milestone, the social network s engineering chief Jay Parikh acknowledges. But he says he hopes the first drone will be airborne before the year s end. Don t tell Mark I said that, he hurriedly adds, referring to Facebook s chief executive. I m trying to manage Mark s expectations. The aircraft is called Aquila 1 and was recently built in Somerset, England before being shipped to a secret test site. The drone is wider than a Boeing 737 jet but looks quite different, since there s no need to carry passengers or a pilot. The sleek giant structure is made of a thin layer of foam covered in carbon fibre, with four propellers attached. The whole structure is 142ft 43m wide but weighs less than a Toyota Prius, Mr Parikh explains. The structure and stiffness of the plane is all in the carbon fibre of the wing and that supports everything, the internet providing payload, the batteries, and the solar panels on top. The aim is to build a fleet of the drones with radio transmitters fitted underneath to beam data across a 100 mile 160km diameter zone below.
Terminals on the ground would use the signals to provide the internet to people s computers. Facebook wants the drones to stay aloft for three months at a time. That alone would be an impressive feat the current record is about a fortnight. But the really tricky bit involves creating a sky high network with several drones acting as intermediary connection points, so that a fast connection sent from a city can be distributed outwards to the final aircraft in the chain as far as 300km 186 miles away. To help keep data speeds high, Facebook aims to beam lasers between the aircraft across significant distances. The analogy that we have come up with is this If I took a US dime 18mm in diameter and I walked 11 miles away from you, and then you had a laser in your hand, you would have to hit that dime, says Mr Parikh. And by the way, these are not stationary targets these are moving. So, we have to do this and keep this pointed and connected while the one point and the other point are moving. It s pretty freaking hard. The firm has already trialled the tech in its California labs, but making it work 27km above ground will not be easy. Project Loon s balloons have been taking to the skies since June 2013. We ve flown almost 1,000 balloons at this point, Mike Cassidy, vice president of Project Loon, tells the BBC. We ve flown almost 20 million kilometres around the world. One of our balloons went around the world 19 times. The balloons travel with the winds, usually along an easterly or westerly latitude. Google keeps each one on course by pumping helium in and out of a bag fastened inside the balloon s outer plastic envelope. This causes it to rise or fall, letting it find winds that will take it in the desired direction. Rather than try to keep each balloon over one spot, Google s goal is to create a circular sequence.
So, as one goes out of range of antennas on the ground, another takes its place, providing a continuous internet connection. Initially, the firm struggled to keep its balloons aloft for much more than a week. But it now regularly keeps them aloft for 150 days. Even a millimetre sized hole in a balloon will bring it down in a few days, explains Mr Cassidy. So, you need to study every phase of the process from manufacturing to packaging to shipping to launch. We just slowly found the holes by failure analysis. Rather than use lasers, Google relies solely on radio frequencies to transmit its data. Equipment hanging below each aircraft connects to a base station in range below and then sends out the resulting data link to other antennas it can reach, which in turn link up to people s individual computing devices. At present, Loon balloons can cover a circular area spanning 80km 50 miles in diameter. The balloons can also transmit signals to each other to extend the internet when there is no base station nearby. The firm says it has already linked up two balloons more than 100km apart and transferred data at about 500 megabits per second. But that s a fraction of the tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second rates Facebook believes its lasers are capable of. Radio technology is generally a more developed technology than freespace optical communication, Google s Mr Cassidy said, explaining his approach. It s been around longer, the components are typically less expensive. But we ll definitely look at all technologies that provide good performance. As both schemes advance and more equipment takes to the skies, the risk of an accident increases. Even if Aquila weighs less than a car you still wouldn t want one hurtling towards you or a passenger jet at speed. Mr Parikh, however, is quick to stress there is no imminent risk. This thing is not yet certified to fly over people s heads, he says.
We will have to do thousands or tens of thousands of fight hours, induce failures, see how these things manage the stress, the cold temperature, all of that. But Google s balloons are already active. Indeed, the firm hopes to start providing connections to early adopters in Indonesia and Sri Lanka soon. We put transponders on all our balloons, which is not required, says Mr Cassidy, so, just like an aeroplane, air traffic control can always see where the balloons are. But he acknowledges, things do not always go according to plan. We have had some balloons come down at a time earlier than we expected, he discloses. But in all those cases we did steer them to an area that was safer to land and contact air traffic control to co ordinate the descent. Assuming life threatening collisions can be avoided, one expert agreed both projects had potential, not least because they should prove much cheaper than sending up more satellites or other existing alternatives. They are talking about co operating with existing communications service providers, which convinces me they won t be Wild West kinds of projects, says William Hahn from the tech consultancy Gartner. We are seeing more options in a number of different areas as well we have lower Earth orbit satellites than we used to have and the cost of optical fibre is coming down. But there are still some very large populations that are hard to reach and hard to serve, and at least in the mid term I think these new schemes could be part of the solution. That just leaves the problem how do you work out where best to deploy all this gear No one is suggesting the drones or balloons could provide blanket access. But at present, even the best internet coverage maps break down when you zoom in close enough. Facebook believes its artificial intelligence division could have the solution. The team has just developed deep expertise at image recognition, reveals Facebook s Mr Parikh.
We ve adapted that technology to be able to take in high resolution satellite imagery and then be able to process it understanding what human dwellings look like. So, here s a building, here s a home, here s a teepee, here s a train, here s a car whatever it is, we are now able to come up with a way of better understanding where these people are. The social network has not made its data public yet. And like much else involved with the two connectivity projects, a lot has to be taken on trust at this point. But both Google and Facebook have a big financial incentive to get more people online and a willingness to keep spending until they achieve it. Our philosophy is to do lots and lots of testing, concludes Google s Mr Cassidy. If your choice is to sit around for a year or two planning and design and then do one big test, then the test may or may not work. We like rapidly iterating, and I think from an engineering perspective that s the fastest way to get to a working system. Mr Parikh will provide more details about Facebook s drone at a meeting later this Wednesday, and will feature on Friday s edition of Tech Tent on BBC World Service

CNN Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai s Royal Emirates Group. The Madrid based team followed in the footsteps of Malaga and Racing Santander, which were also taken over by overseas interests in the past year. Royal Emirates Group, a conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, has a portfolio of more than 200 companies including oil and gas, renewable energy, travel and tourism, health care, water purification, real estate construction. The deal is worth between 70 90 million 101 131 million and will see the club s title rebranded to Getafe CF Team Dubai. Getafe s previous owner and president Don Angel Torres Sanchez signed over to his successors in a ceremony at Dubai s Burj Al Arab hotel on Thursday, accompanied by club captain Manu del Moral. The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. The investment in Getafe CF is an evolution of this vision and an expression of renewed confidence that Dubai s businesses are more confident today to make large investments abroad as well as at home, Royal Emirates partner managing director Dr. Kaiser Rafiq said. Caring for community needs through sport is at the heart of what the Royal Emirates Group aims to achieve. This will send the positive message to the world that Dubai cares. Rafiq said that, being conscious of football s popularity with young Arabs, the group hoped to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East ahead of the 2022 World Cup to be staged in Qatar. Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region, he said. Getafe, first formed in 1946 and refounded in 1983, has been in Spain s top flight since 2004 05. The club made a strong start to this season but hopes of qualifying for Europe have evaporated, with coach Michel s team 14th out of 20 with six matches remaining.
Malaga became the first Spanish club to be bought by a foreign investor when Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani paid a reported 36 million 52 million in June 10. He splashed out on players and hired former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, but the club is battling to avoid relegation. Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over. Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club s former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria based team is four points above 17th placed Malaga.
By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband today boasted he is more competent than David Cameron, as a damning poll showed Labour is more unpopular than any opposition party for three decades. The Tories have secured a two point lead in to separate opinion polls, with just a year to go until the general election. Labour is on just 31 per cent in the latest ICM survey, lower than even Neil Kinnock, William Hague and Michael Howard who all led their parties to defeat on polling day. The latest ICM poll puts Labour on just 31 per cent, the lowest level of support for an opposition party a year out from a general election . The polls will make grim reading for Ed Miliband, after he launched a new policy to guarantee patients would see a GP within 48 hours . The economic recovery has seen an improvement in the Tories fortunes in the polls. The new ICM poll for The Guardian puts the Conservatives on 33 per cent with Labour on 31 per cent, the lowest since the immediate aftermath of the disastrous 2010 election. A year before the 2010 election the Tories were ahead on 39 per cent, with Gordon Brown s Labour on 28 per cent. In 1996, 12 months before Tony Blair s first electoral landslide, Labour was on 45 per cent with John Major s Tories on just 28 per cent. Labour under Mr Kinnock was also ahead in 1986 and 1991, before being beaten by the Tories a year later. The polls are certain to trigger fears in Labour ranks that the party is failing to seal the deal with voters with a year until Mr Miliband tries to take power. Polls at the weekend showed two thirds of people backed Labour s policies on energy bills, railways and rent controls, but only 23 per cent think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister. It is the first time the Tories have been ahead in the polls since before the disastrous omnishambles budget in 2012 .
The rise in the Tory fortunes has come as the economic recovery gains pace, raising fears in the Labour party that their attacks on the cost of living could be eroded if voters start to feel better off . Former Labour trade minister Lord Diby Jones today slammed the party for being anti business. Several senior Labour figures are worried about the party s reputation in the business community, after a series of attacks on banks, energy firms and house builders. Speaking on the BBC s Daily Politics Lord Digby Jones, former Trade Minister, said The Labour leadership is one of the least business friendly leaders of political parties I ve seen for years. Tory MP Brooks Newmark said Even Digby Jones, who served alongside Ed Miliband under Gordon Brown, realises that Labour s short term gimmicks would stop businesses creating jobs and risk the recovery. Ed Miliband has no plan and his only policies are the same old Labour solutions of more spending, more borrowing and more taxes. To counter the criticism, Mr Miliband today insisted he was better than Mr Cameron. The Labour leader played down the significance of a set of polls which showed Conservatives establishing a lead over his party for the first time since George Osborne s omnishambles budget more than two years ago. Two surveys an ICM poll for The Guardian and another carried out for Tory peer Lord Ashcroft gave Mr Cameron s party a two point lead, a year ahead of the 2015 general election. Just days ahead of elections to English councils and the European Parliament on May 22, Mr Miliband insisted he was right to focus on the cost of living crisis facing British families. Despite positive economic figures over recent months, ordinary people were deeply discontented with the way in which the country is being run, and feel that the benefits from growth have been skewed towards those at the top of society, he said.
Challenged over whether voters saw him as a potential prime minister, Mr Miliband told BBC1 s Breakfast My approach has been to talk consistently about the big questions our country faces and the biggest question of all that every country is wrestling with are we going to be run for a few people at the top, with growing gaps between the richest and everybody else, or are ordinary people going to get a fair shot I am going to keep talking consistently about that, because I think that is the biggest question our country faces. Asked if this approach would make him a better PM than Mr Cameron, the Labour leader said It makes me more personally competent because I get what people are feeling and we can do something about it. The most important thing as a Prime Minister is to understand what people think and what you can do about it and to show the difference you can make to their lives, and that s what I will do, and solidity of belief and purpose. David Cameron and Boris Johnson celebrate winning a table football game yesterday, as the first poll emerged putting the Tories ahead . The ICM poll for the Guardian, released as US president Barack Obama s former campaign guru David Axelrod arrived in London to begin work with Mr Miliband s party, put the Conservatives on 33 per cent, with Labour sliding six points since April to 31 per cent, Ukip on 15 per cent a four point gain since last month and the Liberal Democrats up one point to 13 per cent. Mr Miliband was given a net approval rating of minus 25, with 51 per cent of voters believing he is doing a bad job and just 26 per cent believing he is doing well. Mr Cameron enjoyed a dramatic improvement from the minus 15 rating he received 12 months ago, to plus two now, with 44 per cent of voters believing he is doing a good job, against 42 per cent who think he is doing badly.
The first in a series of weekly telephone surveys carried out for Lord Ashcroft put David Cameron s party on 34 per cent, two points ahead of Labour on 32 per cent, with the UK Independence Party third on 15 per cent and Liberal Democrats trailing on 9 per cent. But Mr Miliband said Polls go up and down. I ve seen that over three and a half years in this job. I think what matters is talking about the bread and butter issues people face energy prices, childcare, the NHS, how we can improve GP access, something Labour is leading the other parties on. We will talk about the issues that matter to people. We will focus on these questions. The people will make the decisions a week on Thursday and at the general election. Mr Miliband said he was very disappointed at the Government s response to his high profile announcement yesterday of a Labour promise to give all NHS patients access to a GP within 48 hours. They say doctors can t deliver it, he said. They are writing off the idea that we can deliver appointments in 48 hours and so we are going to have to wait more than a week. That s not good enough. I m determined we can make a difference.

By . Michael Zennie and Alex Greig . PUBLISHED . 00 59 EST, 5 July 2013 . . UPDATED . 02 48 EST, 5 July 2013 . The two women who are suing after they were subjected to a humiliating and invasive cavity search on a Texas roadside on Memorial Day last year have spoken out about their ordeal. Brandy Hamilton, 26, and Alexandria Randle, 24, told reporters how they were ordered out of their vehicle, not permitted to put on clothes to cover the bikinis they d been wearing at the beach that day, and given cavity searches right by the side of the road. The disturbing video of the event, which was caught on the dashcam, captures one of the women asking in disbelief, Are you serious when the officers tell her they re going to give her a cavity search. Humiliated Alexandria Randle left and Brandy Hamilton right were subjected to a roadside cavity search last year . Ordeal Randle centre, bottom and Hamilton right, bottom speak out about the event last year . Trooper Nathaniel Turner is one of three officers involved in the traffic stop being sued. He is accused of ordering the invasive body cavity search . The women are sharing new details about what happened to them that day. Alexandria . Randle still can t believe what happened to her and her friend. She felt violated and embarrassed by the body cavity . search on the side of a Texas highway after they were stopped . returning from a weekend at the beach. I couldn t even imagine if this were to happen to... one of my little cousins... I just want this to be the last time this happens here, she told KHOU11. Speaking about police searching people for drugs, Brandy Hamilton said, If it comes to that, then take the person into jail, you don t have to do it on the side of the road. It s been traumatizing, she said.
I don t know if I can trust the cops anymore, it s just been very a very horrific situation to me. The women are suing the Texas . Department of Public Safety and the sheriff of Brazoria County, Texas, . where the stop occurred. Their lawyer alleges that the search was meant . to humiliate them and was conducted without probable cause. The . female officer who performed the invasive search, which included inserting a finger into the women s vaginas, is accused of using the same . pair of gloves to search both women. The entire 40 minute traffic stop . was caught on the trooper s dashboard camera. Brandy Hamilton foreground and Alexandria Randle background were both forced to get out of their car and handcuffed while wearing their bikinis . Painful Miss Hamilton can be seen grimacing in pain as she receives and invasive body cavity search . Attorney . Allie R. Booker told MailOnline her client s case is startling similar . to a July 2012 case in Dallas in which DPS trooper Kelly Helleson . aggressively searched Angel Dobbs and her niece, Ashley Dobbs . including giving them a body cavity search and not changing gloves . between searching the two women. Booker said a third case, that has yet to become public, bears the same hallmarks, as well. How are these people behaving in the same manner, hundreds of miles away from each other. There s got to be some factor at the DPS that makes these officers think they can do this, she said. Trooper Turner has been suspended as part of an internal investigation by the Department of Public Safety . Miss Hamilton and Miss Randle were on . their way home to Houston from Surfside Beach on May 28, 2012, when they . were stopped for speeding by DPS trooper Nathaniel Turner. Turner . immediately asks both women to step out of their car. Both were wearing . only their two piece swimsuits from their time at the beach.
Ms Hamilton, the driver, asks if she can put her dress on to cover up. Don t worry about it. Come out here, the trooper tells her. Turner . says he can smell marijuana in the car and accuses the women of smoking . and driving. He later claimed that he found a piece of a smoked . marijuana blunt under the back seat of the car. He then makes the two women sand on the side of a busy highway in their swimsuits while he calls for backup. One of them has got her zipper open on her pants of her daisy dukes shorts whatever they are, the trooper says on the radio. Two more troopers show up including Jennie Bui. Bui, as trooper Turner explains, is going to search you. I ain t, because I ain t about to get up close and personal with your woman areas she is going to put some gloves on, he says. You re going to go up my private parts asks Hamilton, sounding bewildered. Despite numerous pleas from the two women not to perform a body cavity search, Bui ignores them. Both women can be seen with pained looks on their faces as the trooper probes their genitals. Both Miss Hamilton left and Miss Randel right allege their civil rights were violated and they suffered pain and humiliation in the searches . Miss Randle sobs uncontrollably as she is probed. At one point Turner says Don t smoke weed in your car and you won t have to go through this. Booker, the lawyer for the two women, said the behavior of the troopers was outrageous. If the cavity search alone isn t enough and say it s their fault that you basically just sexually assaulted them that s humiliating, she said. Turner later released both women and issued Miss Hamilton a citation fro possession of drug paraphernalia. She is still fighting the charges in court, though she contends the marijuana wasn t hers. Trooper Bui was fired last week by the DPS.
Trooper Turner has been suspended, Booker said. These police officers are here to protect and serve, Brandy Hamilton told KHOU11. And they did not protect me at all. Not one of them.
Updated Michael Wolff To Head E5 Global s Adweek Group Updated Several more sources have confirmed that Michael Wolff will be joining E5 Global Media as the editorial director of the Adweek Group of magazines. While all acknowledge that major change is needed in terms of the group s strategic direction, many are uncertain if Wolff is the person to provide it. As one source put it, How does E5 Global Media CEO Richard Beckman go from Peter Kaplan to Wolff Does he have a plan or is he flailing for a big name We will probably find out as soon as this afternoon, according to additional sources. Other sources also said that the announcement had been delayed on Friday due to Beckman being out of town. The expectation is for a formal announcement on Monday, or Wednesday at the latest. SEE ALSO Wolff On Times Liddle, AA Gill, Lawson And I Are Fundamentally Useless Original post We re hearing a great deal of rumbling about dramatic changes coming Friday to E5 Global Media s Adweek Group, including the strong possibility that professional media provocateur Michael Wolff could be announced as the group s editorial director. And with that, comes the expectation that after years of hanging together separately, Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek could eventually be combined into one single publication. Repeated emails to Wolff, who currently sits on the board of Newser.com, the aggregation site he founded three years ago, and E5 Global CEO Richard Beckman, were not returned. At the publications, lower level staffers are concerned and senior execs are staying mum. One exception an elliptical evening tweet from Adweek Digital Editor Brian Morrissey predicting tmrw should be an interesting day at the office. Newser CEO Patrick Spain told us Thursday that he hadn t been informed of Wolff taking the job, but said that it shouldn t affect the company. He blogs for us, he s founder and a director but not actively involved in operations.
He added, I ve never been too focused on Michael s outside activities. Those include his column for Vanity Fair and a new gig as contributing editor to Wired. Rumors that Wolff is joining E5 Global began after ex Daily Finance media reporter Jeff Bercovici wrote that Wolff had been sighted three times at the E5 Global s offices late last month. Both E5 Global and Daily Finance s parent, AOL NYSE AOL , have offices in the same building. E5 Global, which bought eight of Nielsen s media entertainment related trade mags, including The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek at the end of last year, has been trying to find an editorial director since the start of the summer.

Portuguese coach Jardim emphasised the threat of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla and is trying to prepare his players for an expected attacking onslaught from Arsenal, with the Barclays Premier League side needing to at least three goals to go through in the Champions League tie. Jardim said At this stage we re now at half time and we re two goals ahead but it s true that our opponents have so many quality players in their squad. So it will be very difficult for us and everyone knows if it will be the most difficult game we ve had in years.

When facing such a team as Arsenal with players like Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Danny Welbeck, it s true we can t take it easy and have to focus on the game we played at Emirates. In comparison to pervious years French teams are playing at a better level in the Champions League. Paris Saint Germain knocked out Chelsea and they showed the quality of the work done here in France. It was the same case for Monaco. What we re trying to do is to show the quality of the work.

CNN The human rights group Amnesty International is calling on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on Israel and the Palestinians, saying both sides used weapons supplied from abroad to carry out attacks on civilians during their three week conflict in Gaza. Palestinian children make coffee behind a bullet and rocket riddled wall in Rafah, Gaza, on January 24, 2009. The London based group issued a 38 page report Sunday night that detailed evidence of war crimes and other serious violations of international law by all parties. Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the United States, killing hundreds of civilians and destroying homes, the group said. The use of white phosphorus is restricted under international law. In the early days of the Gaza conflict, the Israel Defense Forces denied using the ordnance. But later, Israeli officials said only that any shells fired in Gaza were in accordance with international law. Amnesty said its researchers found munitions fragments littering school playgrounds, hospitals and homes after the 22 day fighting in Gaza ended in January. Many of the munitions used by the Israeli army were American made, and included bombs, white phosphorus remains and missiles seemingly launched from unmanned drones, Amnesty said. To a large extent, Israel s military offensive in Gaza was carried out with weapons, munitions and military equipment supplied by the U.S.A. and paid for with U.S. taxpayers money, Malcolm Smart, Amnesty s Middle East director, said in the report. He called on the United States to immediately suspend military aid to Israel. The United States is to provide 30 billion in military aid to Israel under a 10 year agreement that runs till 2017 a 25 percent increase compared with the period preceding the Bush administration, Amnesty said. The group also took to task Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. It said it found remains of Qassam and Grad rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups in civilian areas. Grad rockets have a longer range than the crude, home made Qassams.
Israel said Palestinian militants have fired about 10,000 rockets and mortars into Israel in the past eight years. These unsophisticated weapons are either smuggled into Gaza clandestinely or constructed there from components secretly brought in from abroad, Amnesty said. Israel s foreign ministry responded harshly to the report, calling it biased and dedicated almost exclusively to the censure of Israel. The ministry said the report does not mention Hamas deliberate use of civilians as human shields. It also said Israel s use of weapons complied with international law and denied that its forces targeted civilians. The comparison of the supply of weapons to Israel and the Hamas in inappropriate, the ministry said in a statement. Israel is a sovereign nation that is obligated to use force to protect its citizens, while Hamas is a terror organization. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with airstrikes.
Wayne Rooney, Mario Balotelli and Frank Lampard are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape. That s according to new research, which compared the facial width to height ratios FWHRs of high ranking footballers to their on pitch record. It discovered that players with faces that are wider than they are tall are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls. Wayne Rooney left and Mario Balotelli right are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape, claims new research. Experts discovered that players with a high facial width to height ratios FWHRs are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls . The Manchester United star, nicknamed Shrek because of the shape of his head, has the features that mark out the best forwards from the rest, claim experts from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Mr Rooney, who will be awarded with a Golden Cap at Wembley on Saturday to mark his 100th appearance for England, has also received six red cards in his career. While Italian Mr Balotelli has scored 33 goals in his international career, but has also received 50 yellow cards in his career for fouls and other offences. Dr Keith Welker from the university analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. Researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. They measured each of the players faces on a FWHR chart pictured . FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid brow and the upper lip . Footballer Peter Crouch left has a low ratio face, while Frank Lampard s face scores higher on the FWHR scale. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls . He measured each of their faces on a FWHR chart. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls.
Forwards with higher FWHRs also were more likely to score or lay on goals, according to the findings published in the journal Adaptive Human Behaviour and Physiology. A recent report found that men with wider faces earn around 1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus. However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. A separate study from Singapore Management University found that women are drawn to men with broader faces for short term relationships, but they do not tend to see them as husband material. This could be because men with wider faces are perceived to be more dominant and aggressive. While this may initially make them appear desirable, they are less appealing traits in a long term partner. Previous research into facial structure of athletes has been primarily in the United States and Canada, said Dr Welker. No one had really looked at how facial width to height ratio is associated with athletic performance by comparing people from across the world. FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid brow and the upper lip. Past studies have shown a high FWHR is associated with more aggressive behaviour. For example, high FWHR is associated with greater antisocial and unethical behaviour, but also greater success among CEOs and achievement drive among US presidents. A recent report found that men with wider faces earn around 1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus. However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. The Colorado based researchers for the latest study chose to look at the World Cup because of the quality and quantity of the data available. The theory also applies to other sports, such as rugby and cycling. Examples include rugby player James Haskell left and Olympic medal winner Chris Hoy right .
Scientists have several ideas about how FWHR may be associated with aggression. One possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life . Dr Welker said There are a lot of athletic data out there. We were exploring contexts to look at aggressive behaviour and found the World Cup, which quantifies goals, fouls and assists, provides a multinational way of addressing whether facial structure produces this aggressive behaviour and performance. The theory also applies to other sports, such as rugby and cycling. Examples include James Haskell and Olympic medal winner Chris Hoy. Scientists have several ideas about how FWHR may be associated with aggression. One possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life. Testosterone during puberty can affect a variety of physical traits, including bone density, muscle growth and cranial shape, added Dr Welker.
The 25th Oil and Gas Survey found 67 of north east Scotland businesses had shed staff at a faster rate than at any time in the survey s history. But a similar proportion felt the sector had reached rock bottom and the rate of job cuts would now slow. More than 40 had cut pay or changed benefits to cope with low oil prices. The survey, conducted by Aberdeen Grampian Chamber of Commerce in partnership with the Fraser of Allander Institute, canvassed the views of 130 businesses, employing more than 308,000 UK staff in total. The findings included James Bream, research and policy director at Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said We re likely to remain in an uncertain position through 2017 and the bottom will arrive at different times and feel different for each company. It is clear that companies are striving to become fitter, leaner and they are working hard to look for new markets to secure their future and employment levels where that is within their control. There is no question of complacency in the north east and our brilliant people will continue to demonstrate that the oil and gas sector should be considered a success story in generating economic value for the UK economy. The survey was conducted in September. Meanwhile, the UK s oil and gas industry has claimed chemical discharges to sea and emissions to the air have continued on a downward trend over the last 15 years. Trade body Oil Gas UK said the average oil in water concentration last year was less than half of the recommended limit set by the OSPAR Commission. That was despite the industry s first increase in production since 2000. The findings are contained in Oil Gas UK s Environment Report 2016. Mick Borwell, health, safety and environment policy director with Oil Gas UK, said The environment report comes at a challenging time for the UK oil and gas which is working extremely hard to navigate through the downturn, while maintaining environment and safety standards.
Despite the UK Continental Shelf being a mature basin with technically challenging production, the overall trend for the last 15 years is downwards for discharges, emissions and accidental releases. Put simply, we are using the same amount of chemicals and emitting less CO2 in the production of more oil and gas. Industry is committed to minimising the effect on the natural environment and all operators have an environmental management system which is designed to minimise environmental effect.

John Coatman has been awarded nearly 70,000 after winning an unfair dismissal case against Salford Council for being sacked after raising concerns about inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse . A council worker sacked after pointing out inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse has been awarded 67,995 in an unfair dismissal case. John Coatman, 59, received the payout after a battle with Salford Council, which started in 2008. He says the case caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke. But Mr Coatman, from Salford, has now said it felt fantastic to know he had won after years of hell . He said Even though the tribunal was a success I still wasn t sure I d get the pay out I felt I deserved, so this is very important to me. I would have taken 50,000 three years earlier if they had offered it, but this has caused me years of stress. Mr Coatman won his case after an employment tribunal, which began in September 2011. It heard that he emailed a top Salford council director in 2008 over concerns that figures in his line manager s report on the safety of children at risk of abuse were inaccurate. The council s children s services department was under pressure at the time because it was deemed inadequate by government inspectors. Mr Coatman, a statutory returns analyst, says he raised concerns but they were dismissed and his manager asked him to lie about the figures which his manager denied before the tribunal. But the tribunal heard Mr Coatman was disgusted and sent an email raising his concerns to Jill Baker then director of the department. He also sent the email to Ofsted, the Audit Commission and Government Office North West.
The figures were eventually rectified, but Mr Coatman alleged that after sending the emails he was threatened with disciplinary action, subjected to intimidating behaviour by some staff and forced to move desks before being suspended. His managers said they suspended him for allegedly communicating with colleagues in a highly inappropriate and threatening manner and failing to follow management requests. At a disciplinary hearing, it was alleged the council s trust and confidence in Mr Coatman had broken down. He claimed the allegations were malicious and took the council to a tribunal, which ruled his dismissal was unfair. His award takes into account loss of earnings and pension over three years. Stress Mr Coatman said the case has caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke . In 2009, Mr Coatman was admitted to Salford Royal hospital suffering from a minor stroke. He said The doctors couldn t work it out because I was physically fit, I played football and worked out, but then they asked if I d been experiencing stress, and of course I had. It has been very, very difficult. Mr Coatman has since found a new job with a management consultancy firm. He said I am enjoying being in work again and even more so because my colleagues are great to work with. Councillor John Merry, who oversees children s services, said We are in a different place now to when Mr Coatman was employed at the council and action has been taken to improve the service. Ofsted has recently lifted the improvement notice and congratulated officers for the good progress made in the last two years. Inaccuracies Mr Coatman says he raised concerns but they were dismissed, and his manager asked him to lie about the figures which his manager denied.

Chief Tim Longo, of the Charlottesville PD, had identified a dreadlocked man now identified as Matthew as the person of interest in the hunt for Graham. He was spotted in surveillance footage with his arm round her waist before apparently vanishing in his car together, police said on Friday. Police believe he bought the underage girl an alcoholic drink and have every reason to believe that she was with him when he left 15 minutes later in his 1998 burnt orange Chrysler coupe. The car was searched and seized by police after it was found parked outside a housing complex on Hessian Hills Way, where Matthew lives.

Nairobi, Kenya CNN Twenty men are engaged in fiery debate on a sidewalk near Nairobi s Westgate mall, where terrorists stormed the shopping center and killed at least 67 people. A man at the center gestures emphatically as some listen and nod. Others shake their heads. Here and at coffee shops and barbershops and social spots the debate is much the same Should Kenya withdraw its troops from Somalia after terrorists stormed the mall The terrorists who attacked the mall on Saturday claimed to be members of Somalia based Al Shabaab and barked out their resentment of Kenyan troops in their country. They said, We are the Al Shabaab, we are here to kill you for killing our women in Somalia, said Jane Kamau, who hid in a box when attackers opened fire at the mall. Kenya entered a high stakes gamble two years ago when it sent troops to neighboring Somalia to flush out the Islamist militants it accused of kidnapping and killing foreigners in the coastal area. The abductions affected Kenya s once bustling tourism industry, a major hit to the nation s revenue. Al Shabaab vowed to attack Kenya until it withdrew its troops. Since then, grenades have landed at bus stops, churches, mosques and bars, killing dozens. Militants have regularly taken to social media to brag about their attacks and to threaten more. We need to protect our borders John Mutua, part of the sidewalk debate, said keeping troops in Somalia is not the best option. We need to get them out, said the 34 year old businessman. They ll keep killing us, and we ll continue killing them it will never end. We should all stop fighting, start afresh. Next to him, bank teller John Kamau, 28, shakes his head vehemently. That s nonsense, it s not that easy, he said. We re already in too deep. We will be considered cowards if we get out.
They Al Shabaab started it by killing and kidnapping people in our own land. Mutua waves him off. He tries to draw in a Kenyan soldier standing guard near the cordoned off area near the mall. Do you guys like being in Somalia Mutua asks. The soldier glares at him and turns the other way, clutching a long rifle. At a barber and hair stylist shop about 20 miles from the mall, a similar debate is under way. Jane Njeri sits under a buzzing hair dryer. She pops her head out long enough to give her two cents, before tucking her head back. The reason the troops invaded is because our borders were porous to begin with, she said. We need to fix our security. We need to protect our borders. Those troops fighting in Somalia, we need to bring them home to help with those efforts. If we fix our security, we don t have to fear terrorists. Philex Ambani, 23, said sending the troops there was not a good idea to begin with. But they should stay, he said. If they want our soldiers to get out, they need to stop killing us, he said. It s that simple. It wasn t worth it to go there over a bunch of tourists, but we are already there. We can t give up now. The Westgate mall standoff ended Tuesday, according to government officials. It was the worst terror attack in the nation since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy in 1998, leaving more than 200 dead. Kenya s president steadfast . Kenya is East Africa s biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudans.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has ruled out the withdrawal of the military, which is now part of the African Union forces battling the militants in Somalia. We went as a nation to Somalia to fight the war against terror unleashed on Kenyan people, Somali people and people around the world, Kenyatta said this week. This is not a Kenyan war, this is an international war. Godwin Murunga, deputy director of the African Leadership Centre in Nairobi, said the threat facing Kenya is complex and withdrawal from Somalia is not advisable. But revamped security in the nation, he said, will go a long way. Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in, Murunga wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. Don t ask me about Shabaab Having seen what happened to many of the victims of the mall massacre, Agnes Mumbua said she will do whatever she can to help protect herself. A Catholic, she plans to learn how Muslims pray and the names of major Islamic figures. Survivors of the mall massacre have said attackers asked victims whether they were Muslims. Those who failed to answer questions about Islam were killed, they said. If learning the Quran will help save me, I will do what it takes, she said. It seems the Kenya government is not leaving Somalia soon, so I might as well protect myself. Government officials have said the terror attack killed 62 people and five of the suspected 15 terrorists. At least 61 people remain missing, the Kenyan Red Cross has said. Back on the sidewalk near Westgate, insurance agent Frederick Omolo shakes his head when asked his opinion about Al Shabaab. Don t ask me about Shabaab. I don t want to hear that word in my life, ever, he said. He s listening to the debate on the militant group, a brown envelope in his hand.
In it are life insurance documents for his friend John, whom he was going to meet at a coffee house at the mall. He was in the parking lot on his way to drop them off for John to sign when he heard gunshots and took off, clutching the envelope. His friend never left the mall. No one has seen him since. On second thought, Omolo said, let s improve our security big time, post armed cops in major public venues, do a sweep of areas suspected of harboring terrorists, then keep our troops in Somalia to do the job. Omolo passed by the mall every day during the hostage crisis and sat on a sidewalk behind the police barricade, holding the insurance papers. They are still in the brown envelope.
By . James Rush . Created . 11 18 EST, 3 March 2014 . An investment banker who claims a man with the same name stood in for him at his own wedding has failed in his attempt to avoid a big money divorce suit. Former top earning UBS banker Amit Goyal, 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita married another Amit Goyal at a ceremony at a four star hotel. He said he was relaxing at home six hours away while the service was taking place. Amit Goyal left , 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita right married another Amit Goyal at a ceremony at a four star hotel . The high flying city couple, who lived at Canary Wharf, London, met on Indian dating site Shaadi.com. They were married on September 15, 2003, in the Indian city of Meerut but Mr Goyal insists he was not present at the ceremony . He claimed his 33 year old wife could neither divorce him, nor claim any financial support, because they were never married in the first place. However, Judge Mark Everall QC granted Mrs Goyal a decree nisi last year after describing her husband as an unreliable witness and ruling that there was a valid marriage between the couple . Challenging that decision at the Court of Appeal, Mr Goyal pointed to a mysterious thumb print on his marriage certificate and an absence of wedding photos in a bid prove himself a bachelor. In his judgement, Judge Everall also said that Mr Goyal was 300,000 in debt despite earning 185,000 a year, plus bonuses, before he was made redundant. The Hotel Samrat Heavens, in the Indian city of Meerut, where the marriage between Ankita Goyal and Amit Goyal took place . His complaints were thrown out by the judge, who said he had no prospect of blocking his wife s divorce petition. Mr Goyal met his wife on the Indian matrimonial website in 2003.
He had then been accepted to study at the very prestigious INSEAD business school in Paris, having worked in London since 2002, but agreed to meet his prospective bride back in his homeland. The pair became engaged three days after they met and a wedding was fixed for the following month with the consent of Mrs Goyal s senior army officer father. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was very happy at the outcome which would have massive implications for her future . Mrs Goyal and her parents were happy to go along with the plan. Mr Goyal was a well educated young man with evidently good prospects in the well paid world of international finance, Judge Everall said in his ruling. He flew to New Delhi and his fiancee s family arranged a short marriage ceremony , in advance of the full festivities, in order to speed along her French visa application prior to the couple s flight to Europe. However, the banker asserted that his wife tied the knot with an imposter at Meerut s luxury Hotel Samrat Heavens, claiming that he had been six hours away in his home town, Bathinda, on the morning of the nuptials. His case is that Mrs Goyal and he were not married on September 15, 2003 he was not present at any ceremony that may have taken place on that day. His case is that she married another man that day, Judge Everall explained. Mr Goyal said this meant his subsequent marriage , celebrated just three days later, was invalid even though the groom s name on the wedding certificate for the previous ceremony matched his own. The pair moved to France and then the UK, before their daughter, now six, was born in 2007. But their relationship irretrievably broke down and Mrs Goyal moved out of their Docklands home in 2011.
Mr Goyal claimed that he had not read the certificate carefully enough in 2003 and that the first time he noticed the discrepancies in the dates was more than a year after the relationship ended. Judge Everall heard expert evidence that a photograph, supposedly depicting the groom on the marriage certificate, was not of Mr Goyal, and a thumb print on the document, which was purportedly his, belonged to someone else. The expert also highlighted a number of oddities about the registration of the marriage. Standing back and having regard to . all the evidence and Judge Everall s reasoning, I do not detect that he . had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. Indeed, . having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal s evidence pointed to him . being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came . was, in reality, the only one which was open to him Lord Justice Kitchin . Nonetheless, the judge said that the overwhelming probability on all the evidence is that Mrs Goyal did not marry, and did not intend to marry, a different Amit Goyal on 15th September, 2003. Why should she do so Why should she do this on September 15 and then marry Mr Goyal on September 18 and fly with him to France the judge asked. Mr Goyal was a highly educated and intelligent man who had worked for Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS and who was precise and careful . But the judge said of him I did not find him a satisfactory witness . Rejecting his claim that he did not check the marriage papers until long after the split, the judge said his evidence about that was unconvincing and implausible . I find there was a valid marriage between Mrs Goyal and Mr Goyal on September 15, 2003, in Meerut, India, the judge concluded, before formally ending their union.
On appeal, Mr Goyal argued in person that it simply was not possible that he could have made the ceremony in time, because he was in Bathinda at 9am on the day of the wedding. Pointing to the lack of wedding snaps, he said Marriage is the one of the most sacred things in the Hindu religion. If you say to someone there is a marriage without photographs, it simply does not add up. But Lord Justice Kitchin said Standing back and having regard to all the evidence and Judge Everall s reasoning, I do not detect that he had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. Indeed, having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal s evidence pointed to him being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came was, in reality, the only one which was open to him. The judge concluded I m satisfied there is no prospect of success in this application. It must therefore be dismissed. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was very happy at the outcome which would have massive implications for her future.
The two firms say they have reached agreement on a cash and shares offer which gives investors a 50 premium on BG Group s share price on 7 April. The deal could be one of the biggest of 2015 and could produce a company with a value of more than 200bn 296bn . BG Group s shares opened up 42 on the London Stock Exchange at 1,293.5p. Shell s 177bn market capitalisation dwarfs that of BG, which now stands at 31bn after a 20 fall in its share price over the past year. BG Group is the UK s third largest energy company, and currently employs about 5,200 people in 24 countries. It was created in 1997 when British Gas demerged into two separate companies BG and Centrica. BG took control of exploration and production while Centrica took charge of the UK retail business of the former British Gas. In 2000, BG split into BG Group and Lattice Group. Shell said BG Group shareholders would enjoy higher dividends, as it confirmed its intention to pay its existing shareholders 1.88 per ordinary share this year. That compares with a dividend of just 0.14 that BG Group shareholders can expect to receive this year. The oil giant also said it expected to commence a share buyback programme in 2017 of at least 25bn. Shell said it would also provide BG Group shareholders with a mix and match facility , allowing them to vary how much they receive in cash and new Shell shares. Shell and BG Group expect to make annual savings of 2.5bn following the deal. But Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said he remained committed to North Sea oil and expected to invest 4bn between 2016 and 2018. Shell said the deal would also add 25 to its proven oil and gas reserves and 20 to production capacity, particularly in Australia s liquid natural gas LNG market and in deep water oil exploration off the Brazilian coast. BG Group shareholders will own approximately 19 of the combined group following the deal.
The deal comes at a time of uncertainty for oil and gas companies. In the past six months the price of oil has fallen by about 50 . Meanwhile, analysts have warned that investment in North Sea oil exploration has all but dried up, threatening the entire industry. Last month, the Chancellor, George Osborne, lowered the supplementary corporation tax levied against oil companies that operate in the North Sea. BG Group warned in February that it would write down the value of its oil and gas assets by nearly 6bn 9bn due to the oil price slump. Similarly, Shell announced in January that it would be cutting spending by nearly 10bn over the next three years. As it announced the takeover bid, Shell said it expected to make asset sales totalling 30bn between 2016 and 2018, although it did not specify which assets it was reviewing for sale. Asked about potential job losses in the North Sea, Shell and BG Group said they expected there to be global synergies , while adding that if the deal had not happened, they might both have had to make job cuts. Current BG Group chief executive Helge Lund, who took up the post last month, will remain with BG Group while the deal goes through, but is expected to leave once it is completed. BG Group chairman Andrew Gould said the BG board remained confident in the energy firm s long term prospects under Mr Lund, but that Shell s offer allows us to accelerate and de risk the delivery of this value . Even so, the payout that Mr Lund is likely to receive, alongside the boost he will receive to his income from his BG Group shareholdings, could raise eyebrows. In December, BG s board revised Mr Lund s proposed 12m upfront shares bonus, after shareholders and the Institute of Directors complained. Analysts gave a mixed reaction to news of the deal. Investec analyst Neil Morton said a tie up had been mooted for about 20 years . He added BG investors receive what we see as a compelling offer.
For Shell shareholders, we are less convinced of the merits. The deal is predicated on a strong recovery in oil prices 90 per barrel from 2018 , while we suspect that Shell is pouncing on BG s imminent free cash flow to protect its burdensome dividend payout. Christian Stadler associate professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School said BG would fit well with Shell s portfolio. Shell has a very good track record in offshore oil and gas fields, and BG will help them solidify this area, he said. He added acquiring BG would help Shell s replacement ratio the amount of oil fields Shell has lined up to replace the oil it is currently producing. But he warned cost savings would be hard to achieve and with the current downsizing in the oil industry you would expect some job losses .
More U.S. troops are committing suicide than are being killed in active service in Afghanistan, shocking figures have revealed. Even before not yet released data from October, the number of suicides among active and reserve army personnel this year has surpassed the number of combined military combat deaths from January to October 22, according to CNS News. A total of 247 U.S. army personnel are believed to have taken their own lives between January and September this year, army data shows. This compares to 222 deaths from hostile causes in Afghanistan. Shocking statistics More U.S. troops are committing suicide than are being killed in active service in Afghanistan file photo The figures, collated by the Brookings Institution, show an extra 40 troops were killed by non hostile causes while on deployments in the country. This means their deaths were not caused by the Taliban, insurgency forces or Afghan forces. The latest army statistics on troop suicides were released last Friday and show 15 active duty soldiers are suspected of killing themselves last month alone. The same number of potential suicides was recorded in August. Every suicide in our ranks is a tragic loss for the Army family, adversely affecting the readiness of our Army, Lt. Gen. Howard B. Bromberg, deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel, said in a Department of Defense release. I am asking soldiers, family members, Department of the Army civilians, neighbors, and friends to look out for each other and reach out and embrace those who may be struggling, he said.

For the year up to September, 146 potential suicides were recorded among active duty army personnel and an additional 101 possible suicides were recorded for troops not on active duty. Marine Corps commandment James Amos . said the problem wasn t confined to the army and that all armed services . were experiencing a tough year when it came to suicides, according to . CNS.news. Even with the attention of the leadership, I think all the services this year are feeling it, Amos said. I . guess what I would tell everybody here is there is, through no shortage . of great effort and leadership on the part of all the services to try . to abate this, but this year, I think, is going to be a tough year for . all the services.

Annaick, who lives in Lyon, told the BBC her heart was with Socialist Party candidate Benoit Hamon, but she had voted for Mr Macron in the second round of the election and was relieved he had been elected I m very happy. My family and I will be staying in and having a celebratory meal, she said. Student Margot Cadic, from Paris, voted for Mr Macron in both stages of the election because she felt he represented her centrist and open values. I was a bit nervous during the day, but I m relieved, she said. I wish there had been a bigger gap between him and Marine Le Pen. The country would appear divided, but at least Macron had a large victory. Hopefully, he ll be able to unite France. He understands that some people in France feel left out and misunderstood. He said he wants to represent them too. That will be difficult. Both left and right parties have to reconsider their position, and if they d be willing to change their views to have a coalition with him. Thierry Guedj, a finance director in Bordeaux, voted for Francois Fillon in the first round and then Mr Macron in the second. I am pleased with the result, he said. Emmanuel Macron was very presidential in his message of reconciliation and unity. I was surprised by the way he handled himself during his speech, and when confronted by Marine Le Pen in the recent TV debate. I m feeling much more optimistic than at the start of the campaign. I feel Macron has improved a lot. In the company of the Duke of Edinburgh DogsAtPollingStations Exercising paws and voting rights North Korea crisis Why now, what happened, what next Nadia Darcy, a therapist in Surrey, who has lived in the UK for 26 years, told the BBC she had voted for Jean Luc Melenchon in the first round, then Emmanuel Macron in the second. I m simply relieved, she said.
I was a bit worried during the TV debate between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. She was very aggressive and put his ideas down instead of providing her own. I still felt I had to vote for Macron, even though I didn t support him. However, he did impress me. He s got leadership. It s not over yet. His popularity has gone up because of the way he handled himself, but we need to watch over the next few weeks. Pierre Gas, who has lived in the UK since 1993, and always voted for a Republican candidate was disappointed that Francois Fillon did not get through to the second round. I reluctantly voted for Macron, he said. I m not very happy with the result, but it s a case of the lesser of two evils. I m now hoping there will be a coalition. That could be possible. A lot of those who voted for Macron were not his supporters but did so to keep Le Pen out. A lot of people are fed up with the politicians of the last 40 years. I don t want five years of socialism. I want a coalition. I think Macron is too young and part of the elite, but let s just wait and see. Test pilot Pierre Gatty voted for Francois Fillon in the first round, and Emmanuel Macron in the second. He told the BBC he had been confident that Marine Le Pen would not become president. We re not exactly celebrating, he said. I think Francois Hollande is behind Emmanuel Macron. This has been arranged for some time between them. I d like to be sure Emmanuel Macron will lead with the interests of France. I m not so sure now. I ve seen so many people saying he s the best. Most of the socialists were fighting him, and now they re saying he s the best. Let s see what happens now. I m staying a bit optimistic. I m half happy. David Edwards is a French national living in Brittany with his wife and four children.
He voted for Emmanuel Macron in both stages of the election. It has been an eventful and quite emotional campaign, he said. Witnessing the normalisation of nationalist ideas on a grand scale is a thing I never thought I d see. This campaign will probably leave scars across the electorate, the country will remain deeply divided for the coming months and years. Change must take place. The Front National will be right at the corner if Emmanuel Macron doesn t deliver the goods. Democracy and common sense have prevailed. La France est en marche. Let s celebrate, for now.

Editor s note CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist Jim Spellman reports from Denver, Colorado. Hari Dallakoti says business at his UPS store in Denver, Colorado, is down 25 percent. DENVER, Colorado CNN The conventional wisdom here in the Mile High City is that Denver entered the recession early and is pulling out of it ahead of the rest of the country. Time and again I have heard politicians, journalists and business people tell me that it isn t so bad here, that Denver is poised to lead the nation in an economic recovery. Maybe, but the signs on the ground are a little harder to read. Down on Broadway I stop by a UPS store a couple of times a week. The owner s name is Hari Dallakoti. Dallakoti always has a smile on his face and seems to know all his customers by name he was calling out to me by the second time I entered the shop. People drop by to ship out packages, make copies and pick up deliveries. There is always a crowd when I have been in, but Dallakoti tells me business is down 25 percent this month versus the same time last year. Finally it s hitting in this area, and I believe that people are afraid of spending money, he says. It s like a ripple effect, and I think I am feeling it now. Dallakoti says customers who once sent birthday presents across the country are now only sending cards. Also, eBay related shipping is down, and he has seen a falloff in people sending mortgage related documents. He has five employees and says he hasn t had to let anyone go, but he has had to cut back their hours.
He agrees that business is better in Denver than in other parts of the country and is confident he will weather the economic storm, but it may be a while before things get better for him. In my opinion it s going to get worse for the next couple, three months, and I m hoping it will turn around after June, he says. Watch how the downturn is affecting Denver . A block up Broadway is a little guitar store called Music Gear Guys. I play guitar, and this was one of the first businesses I stopped by when I moved to Denver in January. I have been in the shop four or five times and have been surprised that every time I drop by, the place is packed. The recession affected us a little last year but overall knock on wood it hasn t really affected me too much, says owner Gregory Decker, who thinks the recession may actually be helping his business. I have a feeling that people are looking for hobbies or different forms of entertainment that aren t too expensive, Decker explains. His store is crowded with new and used guitars, amplifiers and accessories. He says guitars based on designs from the 1960s are the hot items in the store. Like Dallakoti, the UPS store owner, Decker seems to know all of his customers by name. He says that in this economy you have to focus on customer service to stand a chance. He doesn t advertise, instead relying on word of mouth, and keeps overhead low He is the sole employee. Relationships are what make my business thrive. Without them I wouldn t be as successful, he says. But even here in a relatively successful small business there are signs of the hard times other people have been experiencing. Beginning last year more customers started coming in to sell Decker their guitars in hopes of making ends meet. A lot of people are selling their gear due to job layoffs and needed the money, he says.
The recession started with free falling housing values and, in this respect, the signs are harder to read. Over the weekend I took my dog for a walk through my neighborhood near Sloans Lake in Northwest Denver and decided to count how many houses were for sale. In a six block walk, I counted two houses for rent and 13 for sale, including the house next door to me. These homes sit like ghosts in the neighborhood. There are open houses on Sundays, but few people come by. The houses are all well maintained, though most of them appear to be empty. My neighbors hope these places don t fall into foreclosure they are worried the neighborhood will fall apart if they do. I ll be keeping my eye on the house next door, and keeping my fingers crossed that my new hometown will be back on track soon.
CNN The former Miami Beach mansion of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace sold for 41.5 million Tuesday, an auction company said. Fisher Auction Company and the Jills, a Coldwell Banker Residential Real estate team, announced the sale of the Casa Casuarina, formerly the Versace Mansion. Auctioneer Lamar Fisher said the buyer was Joe Nakash, whose family owns the Jordache denim brand. The family also owns the Victor Hotel next door and they told Fisher that they plan on turning the mansion into a boutique hotel. Donald Trump the real estate magnate and TV personality placed the second highest bid on the mansion at 41 million, according to Rhona Graff, a senior vice president at the Trump Organization. Versace was shot dead outside the mansion in 1997. He purchased the property five years earlier and invested 33 million on expansions including a 54 foot mosaic pool lined with 24 karat gold. We are very pleased to have had the opportunity to manage the sale of this iconic property, Fisher said. This beautifully appointed estate drew significant attention from prospective buyers from around the world. Jill Hertzberg of The Jills called the property the crown jewel of Miami. Jill Eber and I are delighted that we were able to be a part of this once in a lifetime sale, she said.
Washington CNN South Carolina officials head to federal court on Monday to defend a controversial new voter identification law, dismissing suggestions the requirement would deny tens of thousands of people, many of them minorities, access to the ballot. A weeklong trial will kick off in Washington before a panel of three judges who will decide whether the law should take effect. It is one of several legal challenges to voter identification laws nationwide. A key enforcement provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, gives the federal government open ended oversight of states and communities with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in those areas must be pre cleared with Washington. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has defended the law, saying it will not harm any potential voter. The changes have neither the purpose nor will they have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority, Wilson said. The Justice Department blocked the measure from taking effect last year, concluding it was discriminatory. Federal officials cited figures that registered minority voters were about 20 percent more likely than white voters to lack state issued photo identification. The Justice Department estimated that more than 80,000 people in South Carolina could be adversely impacted by the planned requirements. Republican Gov. Nikki Haley has called the Justice Department s decision outrageous and ordered a lawsuit. State officials have deflected criticism the legal battle could end up costing taxpayers 1 million or more. It wouldn t cost anything if U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice would get out of the way and let us protect our citizens and enforce our laws, Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley, said earlier this year. A decision in the case could take weeks. In legal filings with the court, South Carolina officials said a law dating to 1988 requires a state issued voter registration card and the voter s signature at the polls.
The amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification a state issued driver s license, a non driver identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, military identification, a U.S. passport, or state voter registration card. Waivers are allowed, but the voter must sign an affidavit specifying why she or he has a reasonable impediment to getting the necessary identification or has a religious objection to being photographed. If the law takes effect, South Carolina would be among 11 states that require official photo identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information. Supporters say having valid, government issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern day necessity. Opponents assert that the effort disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters. Obama administration officials have concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in the state warranting the legislative changes. A coalition of civil rights groups is expected to testify at next week s hearing, offering testimony from college students and elderly residents. Those groups say claims of voter fraud are exaggerated. South Carolina s photo ID measure is a solution in search of a problem. Credible studies show that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to perceive an instance of in person voter fraud, Ryan Haygood, a top lawyer at the NAACP s Legal Defense Fund, said. The upcoming trial will make clear that the state s proposed photo identification measure will have a significant impact on its minority voters. The NAACP says that a quarter of African Americans and 16 percent of Latinos nationally lack any kind of government issued photo identification. A separate federal panel is considering similar challenge to a voter identification law in Texas. A federal trial was held last month and a ruling is expected soon. Both South Carolina and Texas say they will put their laws in place in time for the November elections, if they are upheld.
It is possible the losing sides could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, delaying any immediate implementation. Other Republican controlled states with similar laws under legal challenge include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The Justice Department this week gave approval to Virginia s less restrictive voter identification measure. North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue vetoed a law passed by the GOP led General Assembly. The Supreme Court in 2008 allowed Indiana s voter identification law to stand in 2008, saying the stated goal of stopping voter fraud was a legitimate exercise of legislative power.
By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED . 04 27 EST, 29 April 2013 . . UPDATED . 09 49 EST, 5 June 2013 . The girl at the centre of the child cruelty trial told the High Court she went along with her mother s shocking attempts to get her pregnant because she thought If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more. The girl had been adopted as a baby and raised in a toxic cocoon of her mother s making an atmosphere of intimidation and disapproval behind the closed curtains of their terrace house. Despite the bullying and coercion, the girl remained pathetically devoted to her adopted mother and obeyed her commands, driven by a powerful mix of fear and love. Authorities missed four significant opportunities which may have prevented a woman from forcing her adopted daughter to impregnate herself with sperm bought on the internet . In a moment of unbearable poignancy . the girl, known only as A, told how she had gone along with her mother s . plans to win the woman s affection. She told the High Court Mum said to me, A, the only way I can have a fourth child is for you to get pregnant . I was shocked, pretty shocked at . first. And then I suddenly thought, Maybe if I do this then everything . will be over. Mum will be happy like she was before . And I also thought from a selfish point of view, If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more . A was only 13 when her mother revealed her plans, and just 14 when the . humiliating and painful ordeal of the insemination programme began. In March 2009, aged 15 and having . already suffered a miscarriage, she sent a Mother s Day card. The girl . wrote Happy Mother s Day List the things I cannot give you but would . if I could . She stuck photographs of her mother s favourite singers and television programmes on the card.
Below them, next to a photograph of a . positive pregnancy test, she wrote And the one thing that I can. And . will. Remarkably, A told the court hearing she was grateful to her . mother for adopting her and her sisters, saying My mum has done as . much as she could to give us a good and happy life. But Mr Justice Jackson heard the . mother had excluded her ex husband from her daughters life and had . schooled them at home, leaving them isolated from the world outside. She could be critical, rigid, . suspicious and obsessive , the judge said, adding For the children, . who love her deeply, the threat of her disapproval is always in the . air. Eldest daughter A in particular had . coped with her domineering mother by becoming submissive to her, even . dropping her voice so she could barely be heard. Neighbours said she was so quiet and . timid that they had wondered if she had a vocal disability . Remarkably, it was only by becoming a mother herself that A found the . strength to stand up to the maternal bullying she had suffered. Midwives noticed that she refused to . hand her baby son to her mother, and she rejected the woman s demands . that she call him Kalei, instead choosing a traditional English name. Astonished Family judge Mr Justice Jackson expressed his abiding sense of disbelief in a High Court judgement . Fears for her son s wellbeing finally . drove her to confide in a family friend, an act of courage and defiance . she had been unable to make on her own behalf. A, now 19 and living in a foster home . with her toddler son, told the court I was scared to go home, because I . knew I wouldn t be able to raise him as my child and I was scared at . how my mum might raise him. Her mother, an educated and highly .
articulate woman, also gave the teenager recordings to listen to which . contained subliminal messages, saying I am going to conceive a girl. The girl, who was adopted, had not wanted to become pregnant but was terrified of jeopardising hermother s love for her. The plan fell apart after the girl . gave birth to a boy and midwives at the hospital became suspiciousof her . mother s pushy and insensitive behaviour towards her and the baby, . and raised the alarm. The Daily Mail can reveal that social . workers were warned three times about the mother, but decided her . children were not at risk. On one occasion a social worker closed the . case after speaking to the mother on the telephone, without even . visiting the family s home or seeing the children. The mother, a 48 year old former . nanny, was jailed for five years for bullying her daughter into the . surrogate pregnancy plan and for cruelty towards another of her adopted . children. The case raises worrying questions about the regulation of adoptions from abroad and the sale of donor sperm over the internet. The High Court case was heard in secret but can be reported following a legal challenge by media groups. Family Division judge Mr Justice . Jackson said he felt an abiding sense of disbelief that a parent could . behave in such a wicked and selfish way towards a vulnerable child . The court heard the American born . mother, who cannot be named to protect the identities of her three . adopted children and her grandson the child born to her daughter, . chose to be sterilised in 2001 so she did not pass her diabetes on to . any children. The case was heard in the High Court but reporting restrictions prevent the naming of the family, the local authority and the area they lived in . Instead, she adopted three daughters . as babies from foreign orphanages and foster homes, two while married to . an Irish man and a third as a single parent, and raised them in .
Britain. She was banned from adopting more children but longed for another child, and forced her eldest daughter to conceive. She told the girl about her plans . when her daughter was only 13, and the two year insemination programme began when the teenager identified in legal documents only as A was . 14. The judge said A did not want to . take part in the programme, but she allowed her body to be used by her . mother because she loves her. A s participation in the programme . caused her continuous anxiety. The physical steps that the mother asked . her to take were degrading, humiliating and, on occasions, painful. The mother bought frozen sperm over . the internet and prepared syringes full of it for her daughter to use to . inseminate herself. She was desperate that any resulting . baby should be a girl, and forced her daughter to follow a special diet . of dairy and alkaline foods in the belief this would affect the gender . of the child. In July 2010, the mother wrote an . affirmation on her computer, setting out her wishes for the future a . lottery win and a healthy baby girl, who she wanted to call Kelia. She wrote I desire to win the . Thunderball jackpot of 500,000 and for A to conceive and carry Kelia to . term for birth in April. In October that year, A became pregnant and . she gave birth to a son in June 2011, after a difficult labour which . left her needing surgery. Nurses knew she planned to give her . baby to her mother to raise, but were worried by her mother s aggressive . behaviour, including a refusal to let A breastfeed her baby, saying . We don t want any of that attachment thing. Midwives raised the alarm when the . mother tried to take the newborn baby from the ward, and A later . confided in a family friend about her ordeal. All four children were .
taken into care and the mother was charged with child cruelty. She initially denied the allegations, . accusing her daughter of being a fantasist, and told authorities the . girl was mentally ill. She later pleaded guilty to five charges of child . cruelty. The High Court heard she had raised . her three adopted daughters in a toxic cocoon , teaching them at home . so they would not go to school and isolating them from friends or . neighbours. When she was 15, A was left alone to . look after her youngest sister, then only four or five, while her mother . and the middle sister went to the US for a ten day holiday. A told the court she had seen her . mother smack her youngest sister regularly, and said she had tied the . little girl to a chair when she would not sit still and had stuck duct . tape over her mouth for answering back. The court also heard disturbing . details about failed attempts to alert social services to the family s . set up. Neighbours described the mother s terrace home as like a . fortress , with the curtains always closed and no one allowed inside. In 2006, a GP neighbour contacted . social services, saying she could hear the mother shouting and swearing . at her youngest child, who was then two, and said the toddler was left . crying for up to two hours at a time. Social workers investigated and saw . all three children and the mother, but decided there was no cause for . concern. In January 2007, an anonymous letter was sent to social . services and other authorities. A social worker s report warned that . the mother appears to be doing things secretively for her own gain , . but concluded there was no evidence of significant harm to the . children, and the case was closed again. In 2008, the GP made another referral . to social services. A third investigation was launched but the case was .
closed after social workers spoke to the mother on the telephone, . without seeing the children or visiting the house. Mr Justice Jackson said Between . 2006 and 2008, the mother succeeded in keeping social services at arm s . length so that their investigations were essentially superficial. Concerns were seen off by a parent who was recognised to be domineering. The children were never heard. The local authority cannot be named . for legal reasons but its Local Safeguarding Children Board has launched . a serious case review, due to be published next month. The LSCB said Nothing can change what has happened to the children in this truly terrible case. It is clear that public bodies must highlight the major public policy issues which arise from this case.
By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED . 19 06 EST, 6 February 2013 . . UPDATED . 03 07 EST, 7 February 2013 . Threat Air pollution to trigger potentially fatal pre eclampsia in expectant mothers, a study has found . Exposure to air pollution could trigger potentially fatal pre eclampsia in pregnant women, researchers have warned. Women with asthma are particularly . vulnerable to the condition marked by high blood pressure and fluid . retention according to a new study. It blamed one in every 20 cases of pre eclampsia on higher levels of ozone pollution in the air during the first three months of pregnancy, as well . as an increase in premature births. The rate would mean pollution was a factor in up to 2,000 cases of pre eclampsia in the UK each year. As many as one in 20 first time mothers develop pre eclampsia, while . around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood . pressure. It is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year. The only treatment is to deliver the baby early with an emergency Caesarean. The new study adds to evidence of a link between air pollution and . premature birth, with international research earlier this week showing . higher pollution levels raised the risk of low birth weight. The study looked at almost 121,000 births in Greater Stockholm, Sweden, between 1998 and 2006. It compared the records with national data on the prevalence of asthma . among the children s mothers and levels of the air pollutants ozone and . vehicle exhaust nitrogen oxide in the Stockholm area. In all, 4.4 per cent of the pregnancies resulted in a premature birth . and the prevalence of pre eclampsia was 2.7 per cent, say findings . published in the online journal BMJ Open. There was no association between exposure to levels of vehicle exhaust . and complications of pregnancy, nor were any links found for any air .
pollutants and babies that were underweight at birth. But there did seem to be a link between exposure to ozone levels during . the first three months of pregnancy and the risk of premature birth . before 37 weeks and pre eclampsia. Each rose by four per cent for every 10 microgram per cubic metre . increase in ambient ozone during this period, says the analysis. Mothers with asthma were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born . prematurely and 10 per cent more likely to have pre eclampsia than mums . without this condition. Vulnerable Pregnant women with asthma were 10 per cent more likely to have pre eclampsia than those without the condition . The effect of pollution on inflammation processes in the body may be a potential mechanism, say the Swedish researchers. Asthma is an inflammatory condition and ozone may therefore have . worsened respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation, so accounting . for the larger increase in the risk of premature birth among the mums . with asthma, suggest the researchers. After taking account of various factors, they calculated that one in . every 20 five per cent cases of pre eclampsia were linked to ozone . levels during early pregnancy. Lead researcher David Olsson, of the department of public health and . clinical medicine at Umea University, said the findings should lead to . improved monitoring of women with asthma during pregnancy. He said It s difficult to put into practice measures that will . effectively reduce the risk, but it shows the importance of ensuring . women s asthma symptoms are under control during early pregnancy. They . need to use their medication to help counteract the possible health . effects of pollution. The study increases the evidence suggesting we should strive to keep . reducing pollution levels to improve human health he added.
The inquests focused on the final movements of Tony Bland, who was left severely brain damaged by the 1989 crush but lived until 1993. He was left in a persistent vegetative state but his life supporting treatment was removed after a legal battle. Mr Bland was 18 at the time of the disaster but died aged 22. The court heard the teenager, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, attended the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 with a friend, Allan Gill. They entered the Sheffield stadium at about 14 25 BST and made their way to a central terrace enclosure known as pen three at the Leppings Lane end. Mr Gill said the crowd seemed to really tighten up when the players came onto the pitch. He said he heard screams and shouts from people saying they could not breathe and needed to get out of the pen. In evidence read to the court, he said he did not see Mr Bland from that point on and that he eventually fell forward and was pulled through a gate. Footage showed Mr Bland, wearing a red and white Liverpool hat, being lifted over a fence into pen two and then being carried onto the pitch by two police officers at about 15 23 more than 15 minutes after the match was halted. PC Steven Plows and a doctor, Colin Flenley, who was at the ground as a fan, said they thought Mr Bland had no pulse and was not breathing when they first attended him. They eventually detected a heartbeat at 15 26 after several rounds of heart compressions and Mr Bland was put into the back of a St John Ambulance seven minutes later. The jury heard there were already three casualties inside, with one unconscious adult on the floor, and that Mr Bland was placed on top of him. PC Paul Jenkinson told the court that he performed mouth to mouth on Mr Bland en route to Sheffield s Northern General Hospital and that the casualty began breathing as they arrived.
He said I am fairly sure it was before he went on the trolley because I seem to have got this feeling of relief that we pulled into the hospital and... he was going to get some proper medical attention. Rani Naidoo, a senior house officer at the Northern General s gynaecology department at the time, went to assist in A E after she heard a number of sirens and ambulances coming up the hill . She said she attended Mr Bland because there was no other medical or nursing staff with him . Dr Naidoo said she had not been told that a crush had taken place at Hillsborough and recalled an unidentified person telling her they thought a stand had collapsed. Hospital notes recorded Mr Bland as being unconscious on arrival and unresponsive to painful stimuli . Breathing was spontaneous but laboured , it was added. She said she judged him stable following her initial assessment and thought he did not require any further intervention at that point as his observations were reasonable and satisfactory . Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the coroner, asked her Did you believe that there was any need for steps to be taken to either secure Tony s airway or indeed to provide him with assisted ventilation She replied I believe at that time my assessment was that his condition was stable. He was breathing by himself spontaneously. The jury was told that Mr Bland was first transferred to a general ward for ongoing care at the Northern General, rather than the intensive care unit ICU . Asked if she was concerned that he was not transferred to ICU, Dr Naidoo said Well, it was a very extraordinary day. I was aware there were a significant number of extremely ill casualties in the A E department, all receiving varying levels of care. Mr Bland was later intubated and ventilated on the receiving ward by other clinicians before his condition deteriorated and he was eventually taken to the cardiac ICU.
At about 18 00 it was noted that ventilation was becoming harder and emergency intervention was needed, the court was told. The hearing was adjourned until Monday. BBC News Profiles of all those who died
By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . An airline passenger is lucky to be alive after he suffered a mid air heart attack during a long haul flight and was saved by three fellow travellers. The man was midway through a flight from Canada to Hong Kong when he complained of chest pains and his heart suddenly stopped beating. Luckily, a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman trained in first aid were all on board and, with the help of crew, kept him alive. A man suffered a heart attack while flying from Canada to Hong Kong last month, but his life was saved by a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman who were on board . He has now made a full recovery in a case which is being used as an example of why portable defibrillators should be carried on all flights. The dramatic incident, which happened last month, came to light after the doctor involved reported it to the British Medical Journal, which called the episode a remarkable story of survival against all the odds . Dr Dave Monks, an anaesthesiologist who has worked at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said the man was taken ill hundreds of miles from the nearest airport in some of the most remote airspace on earth. Dr Monks said the man told him of striking pains moving from his chest to his head. The passenger then lost consciousness and had no pulse, causing Dr Monks to ask other passengers for help. Luckily, a pharmacist who had worked in an intensive care unit and a trained policeman came forward and, using a portable defibrillator, they gave the man an electric shock to get his heart pumping again. The doctor involved said the incident highlighted the importance of having defibrillators on flights and in training as many people as possible in how to use them . When the man s health again deteriorated, the brave trio kept him alive using adrenaline from the plane s medical kit.
The pilot of the aircraft then landed in Beijing, China and the man was rushed to a nearby hospital. Remarkably, he was discharged 10 days later having made a complete recovery. Dr Monks told Live Science This guy was extremely fortunate to have this team there. These guys just happened to be on the plane and even with the basic medical skills they had, they were able to perform a quite dramatic and sophisticated critical care resuscitation. He said the episode shows the importance of keeping defibrillators on passenger planes and training people in first aid. He cited research that shows people are more likely to have heart attacks on flights due to stress, disturbed sleep patterns and lower levels of oxygen. One study suggests about 1,000 passengers per year experience sudden cardiac arrest while on flights.
The 21 year old joined the Tykes last summer from QPR following the club s promotion to the Championship, but made just seven league appearances. He had a brief loan spell at Colchester from QPR in the 2014 15 season, featuring six times for the Essex side. The left sided player signed a one year contract, with a 12 month option, at John McGreal s team. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.
The glitch caused iPad software used by the planes pilots and co pilots for viewing flight plans to stop working. The firm s cockpits went paperless in 2013 to save its staff having to lug heavy paperwork on board. AA estimated the move would save it more than 1.2m Â 793,600 in fuel every year. The company said that it was still investigating the cause of the problem. Some American Airlines flights experienced an issue with a software application on pilot iPads yesterday evening, a spokesman told the BBC. In some cases, the flight had to return to the gate to access a wi fi connection to fix the issue. We apologise for the inconvenience to our customers and we had them on the way to their destinations soon afterwards. Serge Gojkovich, chief executive of car parking app maker Curbstand, was among the passengers affected. He tweeted that his San Francisco to Los Angeles flight was only able to get airborne after the crew had printed off the maps they needed. A spokesman for the airline was unable to confirm the report. American Airlines is not the only carrier whose pilots and cabin crew have switched from using physical charts and paper manuals to tablets. United Airlines was also an early adopter of iPads, while Delta has opted for Microsoft s Surface tablets instead. British Airways and Ryanair are among others still in the process of shifting to so called Electronic Flight Bag based systems. In addition to saving on fuel costs, it is also suggested that such kit reduces flight preparation time, reduces the likelihood of injuries and helps staff by offering real time updates. There is competition between several firms to provide the software and support that make the technology possible. American Airlines pilots use an app called FliteDeck, which is made by the Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen. A spokeswoman for the firm was unable to provide comment when contacted by the BBC.
By . Steph Cockroft . A friend of Peaches Geldof s late mother has claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, while friends who knew about her heroin addiction turned blind eyes . Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she reached out to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother, who died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. But she said Peaches, a mother of two, suffered after those around her said nothing despite the 25 year old relapsing. Scrool down for video . A family friend of Peaches Geldof and her late mother Paula Yates has told how she tried to confront the 25 year old about her drug use as others turned blind eyes to her heroin habit . This picture, which Peaches posted hours before her death, shows Paula Yates, who died of an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, with Peaches as a young girl. Gerry Agar said I d lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn t want to lose Peaches She told Grazia magazine I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it. So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I d lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn t want to lose Peaches. The author said she had written Peaches a letter in 2008, encouraging her to wean off the drugs, but that she never heard from her again. Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she wrote Peaches a letter in 2008 but did not hear from her again . She said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her two sons Astala, two, and Phaedra, one but that she soon relapsed.
She told the magazine that Peaches death had been a horrible waste , just as it was with Miss Yates. Ms Agar previously told the Daily Mail how she had blown the whistle on Miss Yates drug habit in 1996 after she found opium under her bed in a Smarties box. Detectives did not prosecute Miss Yates because of insufficient evidence. She told the paper When Paula took drugs she became another person, really a diabolical being. I don t think anyone truly understands what life was like in that family and Peaches got the worst of it. I can t even begin to describe what that poor girl lived through. Peaches was found dead at her 1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen. Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption Me and my mum. Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41. At an inquest into Peaches death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family s country home. Ms Agar said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her . two sons Phaedra and Astala but that she soon relapsed . Peaches, pictured with her husband Thomas Cohen, had managed to wean herself off the drug but had a relapse in February . North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death. She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling. So many people around her knew about it but said nothing Gerry Agar . In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit.
But Mr Cohen, a 24 year old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. When he confronted her about it, she . retrieved a stash she had hidden in the loft and flushed it down the toilet to show . she was serious about giving up. But she failed to break the habit. Mr Hatch said Peaches death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates death, because Miss Geldof had tried to . break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one . would ever know. She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died.
By . Damien Gayle . Abu Hamza saw violence as necessary to defend Muslims and saw physical training for jihad as an obligation for all Muslim men, a court heard on Wednesday. James Ujaama, a U.S. based associate of Hamza, told jurors in the New York court that the Islamist cleric had instructed him to set up a jihadist training camp in the U.S. U.S. prosecutors hope Ujaama s testimony will convince a federal jury that the preacher is guilty of trying to set up the camp to aid al Qaeda. The charges against him carry a potential life sentence. Facing life in jail Islamist cleric Abu Hamza pictured in a court sketch at the Federal Court in Lower Manhattan, New York, where he is on trial for allegedly setting up terrorist training camps in the U.S. One eyed, handless Hamza, 56, is also accused of supporting al Qaeda in Afghanistan and of providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998. Four of the hostages were killed during a rescue operation. Hamza s lawyers have argued that he used inflammatory rhetoric but did not commit any crimes. The court saw a copy of a fax that Ujaama sent to Hamza, then a preacher at London s Finsbury Park mosque, telling him about a ranch in Oregon where he hoped to set up the training camp. The land that we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan, Ujaama said in the fax. He added that Oregon was a pro militia and firearms state where it would be easy to stockpile weapons for combat training. Ujaama, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to conspiring to aid the Taliban, appeared as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors and is expected to remain on the witness stand for several days. As a former associate of Hamza, Ujaama is a key government witness.
His testimony is expected to cover not only Oregon but the allegation that Abu Hamza sent a man to Afghanistan to receive military training with al Qaeda. Hamza with a masked bodyguard, outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque Government witness James Ujaama met with Hamza at the mosque soon after the American returned from training in Afghanistan . Ujaama said he first met the fiery preacher in London in 1998, shortly after returning from a trip to Afghanistan where he attended training camps with religious extremists. The two men discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies at Abu Hamza s second floor office at the Finsbury Park mosque, Ujaama said. I walked away from that meeting very impressed with Sheikh Abu Hamza, Ujaama was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Soon after, Ujaama was working for Abu Hamza, writing and publishing articles online for an organization called Supporters of Sharia run by the preacher. One piece titled A Declaration of War summarised Osama bin Laden s call to take up arms against the U.S., Ujaama said. Was Abu Hamza overseeing you when you posted this statement asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan. Yes, he was, Ujaama replied. Police outside Finsbury Park mosque after a raid Ujaama told the court that he and Hamza discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies in a second floor office there and he then began working for the preacher . In 1999, Ujaama said, the two men arrived in Oregon from the United Kingdom and were disappointed to find that Ujaama s camp did not have many weapons or recruits. Ujaama said he was threatened by one of the men, Oussama Kassir, who claimed to be a former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.
In the coming days, Ujaama is also expected to testify that Abu Hamza ordered him in 2000 to take another man, Feroz Abbasi, to Afghanistan to seek out training with al Qaeda. Egyptian born Hamza lost his hands and one eye in Afghanistan in the 1980s. A British court convicted him 2006 of inciting followers to violence and he served six years in prison before his extradition to the U.S. in 2012.
By . Matt Lawton . Follow Matt_Lawton_DM . Gareth Bale is talking about positioning. More specifically, about getting into better positions more often to score more goals. It is a part of his game he would like to improve and what, you might ask, is so unusual about that when this is a player already reflecting on so many goals for Real Madrid Well it s the fact that this is the same player managers once regarded as a left back.

The 24 year old is now ready to play in a European Cup final on Saturday, when Carlo Ancelotti s side face Atletico Madrid in Lisbon. Since arriving in Spain he has been christened The Cannon , and it is a nickname that captures the sometimes spectacular nature of his goals. But to this observer none has been more spectacular than his 20th of the season the goal that secured the Copa del Rey against Barcelona. We knew Bale was quick.

A 23 year old man with Down Syndrome in mixed martial arts MMA training for years is now fighting to get into the ring. Garrett Holeve, of Florida, has been denied permission to fight against David Steffan, another disabled fighter. The two men were presented with a cease and desist order Aug 2 by the Florida State Boxing Commission just before they were scheduled to step into the ring, according to reports. The fight was organized against Mr Steffan because, having cerebral palsy, he was seen as a fair opponent. Let him fight Garrett Holeve pictured has amputee fighter Nick Newell in his corner . Though state boxing commissions do not . typically regulate amateur MMA fights, they stepped in to stop the fight . between the two disabled men on grounds it was unsanctioned, according . to Headline News. Despite training non stop for two months and having the backing of promoters, Mitch Holeve, Garrett Holeve s father, fears the fight might never happen. It s our belief, based on conversation with people within the MMA community, that getting it done in any state isn t going to be easy, the father told HLN. Mitch Holeve further explained that he feels his son not being allowed into the ring is a public relations move by the sport. There is a core group of people involved in MMA that are trying to protect the sport from bad PR, Mitch Holeve told the network. They feel having disabled people compete would give the sport a black eye. They are also afraid of the sideshow effect. A conspiracy Mitch Holeve, the 23 year old aspiring fighter s father, feels his son isn t being allowed into the ring because insiders want to protect the sport s image a sentiment with which a promoter who spoke to MailOnline agreed .
A prominent New York based promoter echoed Mitch Holeve s concerns in comments to MailOnline. This . is all image, if somebody gets hurt on your show I don t see the . upside to doing that, a New York based fight promoter said. If somebody gets hurt, then you re the guy who put a disabled person in the ring, the promoter added. There is a wide gulf between the people in favour of G Money as Garrett Holeve is known in the ring fighting, and those against it. One respected athletic inspector said that allowing Garrett Holeve to fight in an MMA bout was exploitative, no matter if the audience cheered and gave Holeve a standing ovation after the fight, Zach Arnold, editor of MMA website Fight Opinion told HLN. The concept of allowing someone with limited cognitive ability and brain issues to take punches and get slammed drew a swiftly negative reaction amongst the people I interviewed, Arnold added. It s his dream All Mr Holeve wants to do is get in the ring, in a fair fight he s not gunning for the UFC . Nick Newell, famous for going undefeated in his first 10 professional MMA fights as an amputee, has trained with Holeve and feels he s getting a raw deal. I think we should give him a chance, Mr Newell told MailOnline. Everyone deserves an equal chance. Explaining that he s also trained with Mr Steffan, Mr Newell who goes by Notorious in the ring, said that both men are equal competitors. I think that s a good fair fight, the kid s not asking to fight in the UFC, said Mr Newell, adding that he just wants a small time, amateur fight. Explaining that it s not a street fight, and that there are referees and medics, Mr Newell said it s safety first... it s not like he s even going to be on TV.
Notorious Mr Newell has won his first 10 pro fights and is a champion, he doesn t feel it s fair to keep Mr Holeve out of the ring . Mr Newell said that he noticed no physical limitations with Garrett Holeve when he trained and that it will not matter if he wins or loses, he just wants to get into the ring. People said the same things about me and look at me, I m 10 0 and a world champion, the undefeated fighter said. For now, according to HLN, the two fighters are looking to fight in Nebraska and Mr Newell is all for it. If the kid s training hard and chasing his dream, who s anyone to say he can t it s not fair.

Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that lacked conviction. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that made you wonder just what their defensive training entails at their Melwood training ground. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that posed more questions than answers for their manager Brendan Rodgers. At half time, Liverpool had seemed well on their way to a third win in a row and although this particular showing remained lightyears away from the dynamic and eminently watchable performances of last season, it would have taken them only five points behind Manchester United and within touching distance of the top four. Rodgers side, however, do not resemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League football, despite the best efforts of Arsenal and Manchester United to invite them back into the race. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail s Big Match Stats . Leicester City s Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates after scoring the goal to make it 2 2 against Liverpool at Anfield . Schlupp strikes the ball past Simon Mignolet on the hour mark to equalise for Leicester . It is a measure of Liverpool s difficulties this season that a victory here following successes over Burnley, Swansea City would have represented their longest winning sequence in the Barclays Premier League this season. In truth, they were lucky to escape from this game with a point. Leicester hit the post inside the opening exchanges when Simon Mignolet was caught cold and a Riyad Mahrez free kick cannoned off the inside of the post. Liverpool failed to heed the warning. Further chances passed Leicester by before their hosts were granted the initiative by a referee decision that Gary Lineker described as the worst ever on Twitter. Certainly, Wes Morgan did not help his cause by sliding in, arms outstretched and flailing like an octopus but it did strike his head and Leicester have justification to be aggrieved.
For a while, there were signs that Liverpool were discovering the zest and rhythm of happier days, particularly in the speed and skill of Raheem Sterling and Coutinho. They remain the two Liverpool players most eminently capable of raising this Liverpool team when they feel the need. It was this combination that combined so beautifully to slice open the first goal, as Coutinho received the ball on the half turn, pirouetting into space and zipping a reverse ball into the run of Sterling.

There was one wonderful effort from Jordan Henderson who arrowed a volley inches past the juncture of post and bar, almost replicating the Paul Scholes effort at Bradford City all those years. In the second half, however, all that momentum dissipated. The vulnerabilities of the 3 5 2 system were exposed by a direct Leicester outfit. Gaps appeared between the defence and midfield, defenders backed off as Gerrard and Lucas were caught too high up the pitch. At 2 2, Liverpool were the side that appeared edgy, short on confidence and unable to seize the initiative.
There was a telling moment when Steven Gerrard had possession on the right flank and with those in front of him stood like statues, he gestured furiously for some movement. A familiar groan rang out from those fans around the Press box. They have seen this ordinary level of performance far too often this season.

By . Michael Zennie and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED . 00 56 EST, 25 August 2013 . . UPDATED . 11 52 EST, 25 August 2013 . George Zimmerman s lawyer has chided him for visiting a firearms factory that makes the type of gun he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in July, was this week pictured at the Kel Tec plant in Cocoa, Florida, grinning and shaking hands with an employee. We understand how George visiting the factory that produces the gun used to shoot Trayvon Martin is seen as inappropriate, Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman s lawyer Mark O Mara, told Reuters on Friday. Scroll down for video . Shopping around This is the first public image of George Zimmerman to emerge since his acquittal on murder charges. He poses here with an employee at the Kel Tec gun factory . Zimmerman and his lawyer stopped at the gun maker s headquarters to check out the high capacity Kel Tec KSG pump action shotgun. TMZ.com reports that Zimmerman was interested in buying the weapon, though it is unclear whether he actually left with one. Kel Tec is the same company that made the . PF 9 9mm pistol he used to shoot 17 year old Trayvon last year. Zimmerman contended he killed the teen in self defense after he . sustained a beating. TMZ . reports that the son of Kel Tec s owner personally gave Zimmerman a tour . of the company in Coca, Florida, including a view of the manufacturing . plant and showroom. Making a statement The Kel Tec KSG holds up to 15 shotshells nearly twice the capacity of traditional tractical style shotguns . In the market for a new gun George Zimmerman was seen shopping for a high tech shotgun at the headquarters of Kel Tec arms .
Zimmerman and his lawyer, Mark O Mara, were looking into the legality of buying a Kel Tec KSG, a cutting edge weapon that has two magazines to hold shotgun shells, according to reports. He posed for at least one photograph with a worker at the plant. It is unknown whether he actually bought the weapon. The KSG can fire up to 15 12 gauge shotgun shells without re loading, nearly twice the capacity of other tactical style shotguns, which are usually converted hunting arms.The gun costs about 1,200. Shotguns like the KSG are primarily used for home defense. Shotshells fire multiple pellets at once that are meant to spread out. Zimmerman s 9mm pistol, also made by Kel Tec, was returned to him after he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Trayvon Martin . They can be devastating at close range and much more effective than the 9mm bullet fired by his handgun. Shotshells lose most of their effectiveness at ranges over 25 to 35 yards. Whereas Zimmerman s Kel Tec pistol is small and concealable, the shotgun he examined is meant to make a statement. It emits an audible sound familiar to any hunter or fan of zombie movies whenever the action is cycled. Zimmerman, 29, has been a free man since he was acquitted of all charges July 13 in the shooting of unarmed Trayvon. The racially charged case brought thousands of death threats to Zimmerman and his family. A fringe black panther group reportedly put a price on his head, as well. After his acquittal, police returned the pistol that killed Trayvon to Zimmerman. He was carrying it in his truck when he was pulled over in Texas less than two weeks later. The former neighborhood watch volunteer from Sanford, Florida, was forced to flee his home and has been in hiding ever since the case began receiving international attention. Controversy Zimmerman says that supporters of slain teenager Trayvon Martin have sent his family thousands of death threats .
CNN Inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in Georgia that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak, according to reports released Monday by the state Department of Agriculture. A salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people, the CDC says. But the owner of the Blakely, Georgia, plant Virginia based Peanut Corp. of America described the problems as relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site. PCA this month stopped production at the Blakely plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after July 1, 2008. The New York Times reported Monday that Georgia agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the Blakely plant. Citing an inspection report from August 23, 2007, the Times noted at least three incidences in which food contact surfaces were not properly cleaned and sanitized. In an apparent response to the Times article, PCA released a statement saying, When the observations were noted during inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible. The statement, which PCA sent to CNN accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last October, said the most recent inspection observations by the state the October inspection report were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site. In the October 23, 2008 report, an inspector said she found mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room. The report did not specify the amount of mildew. The report continued with the notation, Correct By 11 05 2008, but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow up inspection occurred. Moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago. That outbreak was traced to a different Georgia peanut processing plant.
A June 2008 inspection of PCA s Blakely plant found violations including dust buildup on a fan in the butter room, and possible metal flakes from metal scrubber which is used to clean outside of equipment, according to an inspection report. The report did not indicate where the flakes were found. PCA has said that the peanut butter and peanut paste made at the Blakely plant were sold in bulk to manufacturers, and that the recall does not involve any peanut butter jars sold directly to consumers. However, more than 125 products that include peanut butter or peanut paste, including Trader Joe s celery with peanut butter packs and nutrition bars from Clif Bar, NutriSystem and Luna, have been recalled in connection with the PCA s recall. See a list of recalled products . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted nearly 500 cases of salmonella illnesses in 43 states from the most recent outbreak, and says the bacterial infection might have contributed to seven deaths. The American Peanut Council has a list of peanut products that are not affected by the recall.
One in 20 women 5 aged between 16 and 59 reported using an illicit substance in the past year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales found. This was the lowest level since the records started in 1996. It had peaked at 8.8 in 2000 and 2003 04. Among men, 11.8 reported using drugs over the past year a figure which has also fallen in recent years. Susanne Hakimi, from the charity Action on Addiction s Hope House a residential treatment centre for women said drug use among women has been hidden away behind closed doors . She said Some women tell us they are afraid to seek help for fear of losing their children. Although addiction generally is still highly stigmatised, we are seeing more women coming to us for treatment for drug use and being a little more open about their recovery. Once this starts to happen, we believe it can be contagious and one person in recovery can, with the right support, encourage and support someone else to recover from addiction. The Home Office figures suggested drug use was higher among young people. Nearly one in five 18.0 of young adults aged 16 24 had taken an illicit drug in the last year around 1.1 million people, the figures show. This was similar to the 2014 15 survey 19.5 , but lower compared with a decade ago 25.2 in the 2005 06 survey . Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, commented These new figures show that drug use has been largely stable over the last five years and continues to be considerably lower than 10 to 15 years ago. However, usage of cocaine and ecstasy jumped among people from wealthier households, the figures suggested. In 2015 16, 3 of people aged 16 to 59 from households with incomes of at least Â 50,000 reported taking cocaine up from 2.2 in 2014 15. The proportion in the same category who had used ecstasy was 2.2 up from 1.5 .
Simon Antrobus, chief executive of the charity Addaction, said the increases reflected factors including wider availability and a cultural shift which has increasingly normalised those substances . It comes as separate figures showed that the number of people being admitted to hospital after being poisoned by illegal drugs has soared by more than 50 in the past 10 years. There were 14,279 hospital admissions where poisoning by illicit drugs was the main diagnosis in 2014 15, a rise of 57 since 2004 05, figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, showed.
CNN A convicted rapist needs to rethink his strategy as he attempts to resume his professional football career, according to the chief of player welfare in the game in Britain. Ched Evans had been on the cusp of a move to Oldham Athletic, which plays in English football s third tier, but the club pulled out of the deal because of unbearable pressure on its staff. Linked with a return to former club Sheffield United last year, Evans remains without a club after being released from prison in October having served half of a five year sentence for raping a 19 year old girl. Both Oldham and Sheffield United were dissuaded from signing Evans due to pressure from sponsors as well as criticism from leading politicians and also the British public, with thousands signing petitions against his proposed moves. Asked if Evans looked likely to sign for another British side, chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association Gordon Taylor told the BBC At this moment in time, you would have to say you d be very doubtful of that. It may well be he would have to go abroad but at the moment because he s out on license he can t go abroad so we need a serious rethink now. Previously refused leave to appeal, Evan s case is now before the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body that reviews potential miscarriages of justice. Hull manager Steve Bruce admitted he had backed Oldham to sign Evans and also believes the Criminal Cases Review Commission will be key to his hopes of playing again. I might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he s been convicted by a jury, said Bruce in his press conference prior to Saturday s English Premier League game between Hull and West Bromwich Albion. When you do look at the case and look at the evidence then certainly Ched has got a case. For me the appeal can t come quick enough for Ched.
It must be a frustrating and difficult time for him and I think the events of the appeal, for me, will see Ched be allowed to play football again. Sheffield United, whom Evans originally joined on leaving Manchester City in 2009, pulled out of their initial approach to sign the player on his release from prison in October following a 160,000 strong petition against the move. And more than 60,000 people signed a petition calling on Oldham not sign Evans. Hartlepool also signaled their interest only to then back away, while a potential move to Maltese club Hibernians was quashed when the Ministry of Justice clarified its zero tolerance policy on sex offenders working abroad. Evans case has also put PFA chief Taylor under pressure after he likened the situation with Evans to that of the families of the 96 people that lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The tragedy struck following a crush of people at the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield. After years of appeals by the families involved over the miscarriage of justice, an inquest is now ongoing into events and culpability surrounding the tragedy. He wouldn t have been the first person to be found guilty, maintained their innocence and be proved right., said Taylor in an interview with the BBC, referring to Evans. We know that happened with Hillsborough. It s now unraveling and very different to how it was portrayed at the time, indeed by the police at the time. Taylor s comments led to calls for him to stand down from his post while Dr Phil Scraton, the main author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, wrote to him concerning his ill judged remarks. Drawing Hillsborough into the maelstrom that has surrounded the Evans case... while suggesting a parallel between these two entirely distinct cases demonstrates not only poor judgment but also extraordinary naivety, Scraton wrote. Taylor has since backtracked on his previous remarks apologizing for any offense called.
I wasn t comparing the case but I was looking for a comparison of the principle really of people looking to have the right to maintaining their innocence and how it s become a national issue and campaign with regard to Ched Evans, said Taylor In an interview with BBC Radio. In no way was it a comparison of the offenses, it was the principle of establishing the truth and his right to do that. As it has turned out, I don t want to upset any of the Hillsborough family support groups. We ve always been supportive of them. It s far from that. I admire the way, the tenacity and determination to get to the truth and that was the point I was looking to make. The last thing I was wanting to do was offend any of them quite the opposite. And with Ched Evans of course he similarly has that right. He s done his time in prison and has done longer in prison than normal because he s determined to prove his innocence and has the right to return to work. Under current rules, Evans is permitted to return to playing football despite still serving his conviction on license. But chairman of the Football Association Greg Dyke admitted the regulations may change the over eligibility of players to return to the game under certain circumstances. In the first statement from the FA amid the Evans furore, Dyke said in a statement Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable. This cannot be overstated. We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in some detail at the FA and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations, and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case. That said, it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognize the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game. I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct.
The FA will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behavior.
Players can often be seen before a big game nowadays with earphones in as they try to drown out any distractions during their pre match routine. Sometimes though, it is better to soak it all in. At a packed out Celtic Park heaving with 60,000 Scotland and England fans, Gary Neville implored midfielder Jack Wilshere to take out his earphones and enjoy the building atmosphere.

Neville was also trying to impart a message to the Arsenal star on a night when England faced the Scots north of the border for the first time in 15 years. Wilshere s attention to detail was called into question by Wayne Rooney soon after kick off when the England captain remonstrated with the Gunner over a careless pass in the early stages. The midfielder recovered, however, and laid on a superb pass for Alex Oxlade Chamberlain s opener. Incredibly, it was Wilshere s first assist in an England shirt. He drove on his side from his less familiar deep lying midfield position a role which he is growing into for his country as the visitors won 3 1. After that display, maybe Wilshere should jettison the earphones for good. Wilshere runs to join Wayne Rooney and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain after his superb assist for the opening goal .

The group of retired generals and admirals declared the Republican nominee has the temperament to be commander in chief . Mr Trump, who has highlighted veterans issues during his campaign, called their support a great honour . He has meanwhile been dismissing claims of impropriety over a political donation to a Florida official. The Washington Post reported on Monday that in 2013 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi had been considering fraud charges against Trump University. But she dropped the investigation after a 25,000 Â 18,600 contribution to her political campaign from the Donald J Trump Foundation. Mr Trump was fined because he did not disclose the contribution to the US tax authorities. The letter released on Tuesday by his campaign was signed by four 4 star generals. The former top brass stated they believe Mr Trump is more trusted to be commander in chief than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . We believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world, they added. Both Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take part back to back in a national security forum on Wednesday. The forum, to be hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, will include questions from an audience of military service members. Also on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton released a campaign ad featuring veterans who are critical of Mr Trump. Her ad includes a clip of Mr Trump from July 2015 casting doubt on leading Republican John McCain s war hero credentials. Arizona Senator McCain was tortured for more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. Despite making support for the military a signature issue in his campaign, Mr Trump has at various times drawn criticism from military members. Most notably, he was involved in a recent spat with family members of a Muslim American soldier killed during the Iraq War. Mr Trump, who has not served in the military, also created a stir last month when he accepted a veteran s gift of a Purple Heart.
I always wanted to get the Purple Heart, he said of the medal, which is awarded to soldiers wounded in war. This was much easier.
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia CNN On the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the dusty crowded neighborhood of Akaki, I ve just been treated to a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. The beans are roasted and the coffee boiled in front of you then served piping hot with a heaping spoonful of sugar and a side of freshly popped corn. As I step out onto the dirt road to leave, one of my hosts wants to ask a question do I know anyone who can donate some wheelchairs, so adults don t have to carry disabled children on their backs to school anymore I wish I did. The woman who needs the wheelchairs is one of the 20,000 volunteers for Yekokeb Berhan, a USAID funded program trying to help half a million highly vulnerable children. The name means Light from the Stars in Amharic, and is meant to reflect the resiliency of children. After spending a week working with the volunteers here, I have no doubt those wheelchairs are going to find their way, due to the resiliency of the adults. Read more Ethiopia s rock churches built by angels Yekokeb Berhan volunteers are chosen by community committees and given training in health, parenting, budgeting and life skills. Then they go out into communities, to find and identify the most vulnerable children. Each volunteer will take in 25 of those kids as her own. I have 29 children says Sintayehu Kenna, a mother of four plus 25 , I can t separate them from my own. I love them. The program s philosophy is that the way to help children is to help their families. More often than not, assistance is needed in multiple areas and that means these volunteers have had to become master networkers calling on friends, family, neighbors, local businessmen and faith leaders to get the kids what they need.
Leyela Ayele, from the Kolfe neighborhood, tells me about a family of eight in which the father was sick and the mother was the breadwinner until she had a heart attack and died. Ayele volunteered to foster the six kids. One of the boys was malnourished and Ayele went to every health center in the area, telling doctors about him, until she found one to admit and treat him. She visited the local bakery and convinced the owner to provide breakfasts for another child. And she linked up the eldest with a government association that gave a scholarship to study hairdressing. Volunteers receive a stipend of about 10 a month to cover phone and transportation costs. They are expected to give about 15 20 hours a week, but I found they all are giving much, much more. Alemitu Yemes has 31 kids, four of her own, two foster kids plus her 25 kids from the program. She s given a small room in her compound, rent free, to a family of five. Everyone except the youngest toddler is HIV positive. Yemes is working to keep the kids in school and making sure the family keeps to their anti viral medical regime. We don t want them to be dependent, she says, I m telling them to be self reliant and we are all working towards that together. Yekokeb Berhan is also working in conjunction with local government and 40 civil society organizations to recruit, train and supervise the volunteers all over the country. In Ethiopia, formal education doesn t begin until age seven. So, the Hiwot Integrated Development Association HIDA struck a deal with the local government. HIDA would renovate and supply an early childhood development center if the government would pay the teachers. That partnership resulted in new brightly colored classroom expanded to serve 128 children, many of them considered highly vulnerable.
Amharic and English are taught, and on the day I visited, I was treated to a version of the nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb. But the backbone of the Yekokeb Berhan program is the individual volunteers. A majority of the women I met were single mothers with big families of their own. Some work as bread makers and vegetable sellers, but about half of those I spoke with seemed to have no other support. But yet everyone I met said it was their moral obligation to help others. Even after they turn 18 years we will still help them, by linking them up with the woreda local government and getting them skill training and jobs. We will empower our graduated children, says Gete Tefera, who has two children of her own, plus her 25 fosters. Read more War orphans turn tragedy into triumph . On my last day in Addis, I met with a group of women entrepreneurs in a half built concrete mid rise with broken windows, which will one day be a youth center. Through Yekokeb Berhan s Community Self Help Savings Group each is getting help with a new venture and for the first time in their lives, saving money. The women enthusiastically describe their plans one is switching from selling bananas to housewares, because the latter doesn t spoil another is expanding her business from selling used clothes to new. But the profits will not be all theirs. As part of the program, two birr a week, about 10 cents, has got to go into a kitty to help out those in need. Before I leave, one woman says there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood unable to go to school because of poor eyesight. She wants to know if I know anyone who can get them the glasses they need. I don t. But I m going to look into it. Find out more about Yekokeb Berhan.
Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEW ORLEANS All last week, people were calling Louis Charbonnet to find out how they might avoid lying down at their funerals. Funeral directors have called so have people with their own requests, such as the woman who wanted to be seen for the last time standing over her cooking pot. The calls started coming in to the Charbonnet Labat Funeral Home during its June 12 viewing for Miriam Burbank, who died at 53 and spent her service sitting at a table amid miniature New Orleans Saints helmets, with a can of Busch beer at one hand and a menthol cigarette between her fingers, just as she had spent a good number of her living days. Word of the arrangement began to spread, hundreds showed up, the news spread online, and now here was Mr. Charbonnet getting a call from a funeral director in Australia. Ms. Burbank s service was the second of its kind that Mr. Charbonnet had arranged, and the third in New Orleans in two years. But there have been others elsewhere, most notably in San Juan, P.R. Viewings there in recent years have included a paramedic displayed behind the wheel of his ambulance and, in 2011, a man dressed for his wake like Che Guevara, cigar in hand and seated Indian style. Photo I never said it was the first, said Mr. Charbonnet, who mentioned the 1984 funeral of Willie Stokes Jr., a Chicago gambler known as the Wimp, who sat through his funeral services behind the wheel of a coffin made to look like a Cadillac Seville. New Orleans, which has long boasted of its ability to put the fun in funeral, seems like the place where this kind of thing would catch on, and Mr. Charbonnet boasts that his 132 year old funeral home is well known for its funeral parades.
Couple weeks ago we even had a mariachi band in here, he said, while checking text messages from people he referred to almost gleefully as his haters apparently other funeral directors. They were criticizing such viewings as improper or even sacrilegious, a concern Mr. Charbonnet admitted was shared by his wife. But he said that he had gotten the O.K. from a local priest and that, besides, he was honoring family wishes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The phenomenon first appeared in Puerto Rico in 2008, four years before the first such funeral in New Orleans, with a 24 year old murder victim whose viewing took place in his family s living room, the body tethered against a wall. Angel Luis Pantojas s funeral called muerto parao, dead man standing became an instant sensation. Another murder victim, on a motorcycle, followed, along with the paramedic and the man dressed like Guevara. This year, a boxer s body was arranged standing in a ring, and an elderly woman was propped up in her rocking chair. The same funeral director, of the Marín Funeral Home in San Juan, arranged all of these. Photo It s been a real boom in Puerto Rico, said Elsie Rodríguez, vice president of the funeral home. People have requested every type of funeral that could possibly come to mind. We have only done six so far, because the people who have requested the funerals have not died yet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Rodríguez said the idea had come from Mr. Pantojas himself. His family has said that ever since he attended his father s funeral at age 6, Mr. Pantojas had told relatives that he wanted to be viewed on his feet. This is not a fun or funny event the family is going through a lot of pain, Ms. Rodríguez said.
With these kinds of arrangements, the family literally suffers less, because they see their loved one in a way that would have made them happy they see them in a way in which they still look alive. At first, some in Puerto Rico were against the services which start around 1,700 an opposition that Ms. Rodríguez attributed to professional jealousy. The Puerto Rico Legislature held hearings in which the Department of Health and other funeral directors weighed in. I thought it would propagate competitions for the most exotic funeral, said Jorge Lugo, president of the Puerto Rico Funeral Home Association. These people not all of them, but some of these people who had these funerals belonged to the underworld and had a life of fast money. It seemed to me that with these kinds of people doing this, there could be negative consequences. As it happened, Mr. Lugo said, the only other time a funeral home tried something unusual the wake of a dog it was a fiasco, as the dog had not been embalmed. A law passed in 2012 officially made the wakes with posed cadavers legal, as long as the position is not immoral, Mr. Lugo said. Photo Such funerals are still quite rare in the United States, though not unheard of This year, a deceased biker in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, was towed to a cemetery in a homemade plexiglass coffin, his body astride his Harley Davidson motorcycle. There, in accordance with his longstanding request, he was buried, motorcycle and all. The services began in New Orleans in 2012 with the death of Lionel Batiste, a brass band leader and dapper man about town. Mr. Batiste had said he did not want to have people looking down at him at his funeral, so at his service, here at Mr. Charbonnet s funeral home, Mr. Batiste stood with his hands on his walking cane, derby tipped rakishly to one side.
Then in April of this year, there was the service for Mickey Easterling, a socialite and proficient party hostess. What my mother said to me some years ago was, I want to be at my own funeral having a glass of Champagne in one hand and a cigarette in the other, said Ms. Easterling s daughter, Nanci. And so she was, greeting her funeral guests from an elegant bench in the lobby of a historic downtown theater. Then this month, Zymora Kimball came to the Charbonnet funeral home to ask about arrangements for Ms. Burbank, who had raised Ms. Kimball like a daughter. Ms. Burbank had been neither wealthy nor widely known outside the neighborhood over which she presided from a table on her front porch. Ms. Kimball wanted something out of the box, said Lyelle Bellard, the intern funeral director, and when he suggested his plan, she thought it brilliantly captured Ms. Burbank s style. Mr. Bellard said it did not end up costing much more than a typical funeral. Despite the recent interest, organizations representing funeral home directors say this kind of viewing is still rare, and just about everyone, including Ms. Kimball, acknowledges that it is not for everyone. Even Ms. Rodríguez in San Juan said she has had to refuse a few suggestions that she found distasteful or that made no sense. She will not, for example, do a wake with someone in a swimsuit, she said.
This party s dead Daughters throw bizarre party funeral for mother including her own body propped up at a table under a disco ball with a cigarette and whiskey in hand Miriam Burbank died on June 1 at 53 years old Her daughters wanted her funeral to reflect how full of life she was The decided on propping their mother s body up at a table stocked with cigarettes and booze This is the second New Orleans funeral this year that included the body of the deceased seated with booze and cigarettes A New Orleans woman was laid to rest earlier this month but only after one final party, during which her body was displayed sitting at a table that is fully stocked with beer, whiskey and menthol cigarettes. But no party is complete without a flashing disco ball, and 53 year old Miriam Burbank s funeral service was complete with one of those, as well. Burbank died on June 1. When the funeral home directors at Charbonnet Funeral Home asked Burbank s two daughters what their mother liked, the two women decided they wanted her funeral to reflect that she was full of life. Scroll down for video Full of life Miriam Burbank s daughters wanted their mother s funeral be representative of how full of life she was and this is what they came up with Party animal Burbank s funeral was complete with her dead body propped up at a table with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey Menthols Burbank s daughters also included a pack of menthol cigarettes So the daughters came up with the interesting concept of having their mother s body displayed as though she were at a party where, presumably, she sat and smoked menthol cigarettes while drinking beer and whiskey as a disco ball lit up the room. To honor Burbank s love of the New Orleans Saints football team, her fingernails were painted black and gold the color of the team s uniforms.
According to WGNO, Burbank s daughters said that other family members liked the idea, and thought it was a very fitting goodbye for their mother. This is the second time this year when New Orleans has played host to a rather taboo funeral service. In April, well known New Orleans philanthropist Mickey Easterling was sent off in a similar fashion. Trend In April, New Orleans socialite Mickey Easterling had a similar funeral service Smokers Like Burbank, Easterling s funeral service included a cigarette and alcohol Planned Unlike Burbank, Easterling planned her entire funeral service, from the champagne to the elaborate hat More than a thousand people attended the popular, 83 year old socialite s funeral at which her body was propped up on an iron bench with a glass of champagne in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other. She s in a Leonardo outfit, Sammy Steele, who did Mickey s hair and make up, told WGNO at the time. And I actually dressed her tonight for the occasion. Easterling was known for being a bit on the fabulous side, so for her funeral she also was wearing and ornate hate and a fancy outfit.

Mr Nasheed was succeeded by then Vice President Mohamed Waheed, who denies that a coup took place and says the transition was legal and necessary after the former leader resigned. Maldives saw its first multi party presidential elections in 2008, before which it was ruled for 30 years by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who is still said to have an influence on politics. The first round of the election will be held on 7 September. If no candidate wins more than 50 of the votes, then a second round, or run off, will be held. According to the Election Commission, 240,302 people above 18 years of age are registered to vote, including 31,000 newly registered voters and 65,745 who have registered to vote at a location other than their home island. In the 2008 elections there were about 209,000 registered voters, with an 85 turnout in the first round, and 86 in the second. Parliamentary polls are to be held in 2014. There are four candidates in the bid for the presidency former President Mohamed Nasheed, incumbent President Mohamed Waheed, business tycoon Gasim Ibrahim and former President Gayoom s half brother Abdulla Yameen. Mr Nasheed leads the Maldivian Democratic Party MDP , which is the single largest party with the highest number of registered members. Mr Nasheed was the Maldives first democratically elected president. His 2008 election win brought an end to Mr Gayoom s 30 year rule. His running mate Mustafa Lutfi is a veteran politician and a former education minister. Mr Nasheed is seen as a strong contender. Incumbent President Mohamed Waheed s Gaumee Itthihaad Party leads a coalition which includes the Dhivehi Rayithunge Party DRP and its leader Ahmed Thasmeen Ali, who is also Waheed s running mate.
Former President Gayoom s half brother Abdulla Yameen is standing for the Progressive Party of Maldives PPM , the second largest party both inside and outside the parliament. His running mate Mohamed Jameel Ahmed is a former home minister and a vocal opponent of Nasheed. Gasim Ibrahim is the presidential candidate of the Jumhooree Party. The prominent businessman heads the Villa Group of companies, described as one of the largest private conglomerates in the Maldives. He is also said to be popular for his philanthropic work. Mr Ibrahim s party is contesting the election in coalition with the Dhivehi Qaumee Party DQP which is known for its opposition to the former Nasheed administration. Mr Ibrahim has picked the DQP s Hassan Saeed as his running mate. Candidates have been largely focusing on religion, nationalism, economy and education in their election campaigns. Mr Nasheed s party is focusing on economic development through reforms and tourism. The MDP manifesto pledges tax reform, development projects and the setting up of a national development bank. Other parties are using religion as a political tool to woo voters. President Waheed s campaign promises to promote the teaching of Islam and to encourage religious thought and teachings. Other key areas include social protection, education and the environment. Mr Gasim s manifesto also proposes to strengthen Islam in the Maldives, including the establishment of an Islamic university and making the Koran a mandatory school subject. Mr Gasim has also pledged to pursue oil exploration, increase taxes on the wealthy and provide laptops for students. Mr Gasim s coalition includes the religious conservative Adhaalath Party. The alliance means that a win for Mr Gasim could bring the country closer to the party s dream of turning the Maldives into an Islamic state. Mr Yameen has taken a strong position on law and order, campaigning in favour of implementing the death penalty and calling for harsher prison sentences.
Independent poll monitors, including teams from Transparency Maldives and the Commonwealth Secretariat, will observe the elections. India has also said that it will send a team of former chief election commissioners as observers. The controversial power transfer in 2012 has led many to question the legitimacy of the polls. Concerns also remain over whether the nascent democracy will be able to sustain itself, given a background where the judiciary and military are said to function under heavy political influence. Transparency Maldives, a non governmental organisation, has warned that the election will take place against a backdrop of uncertainty of democratic transition, existing polarisations and other challenges that have been aggravated by the controversial transfer of power on 7 February 2012 . India and China have been trying to extend their influence in the region and the Maldives strategic location drives their engagement with the tiny island nation. India arguably enjoyed greater influence in the Maldives under Mr Nasheed. Bilateral ties suffered a setback after President Waheed s administration evicted Indian infrastructure giant GMR which had been developing Male s airport under an agreement signed with Mr Nasheed s government. India is also mindful of China s expanding military and economic footprint in the Maldives. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 8 54 PM on 10th October 2011 . Occupy Wall Street has its first corporate backing after Ben Jerry s today announced it is getting behind the protesters. The Vermont based ice cream company, known for standing up for liberal issues, slammed the immoral inequality between classes in the U.S. It followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi backing the movement as the political debate around the protests intensified. Ice cream Ben Jerry s said it has the deepest admiration for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education . Ben Jerry s said it has the deepest admiration for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education. We know that words are relatively easy but we wanted to act quickly to demonstrate our support, a statement on its website said. We realise that Occupy Wall Street is calling for systemic change. We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy. Liberal attitudes Ben Jerry s co founders Ben Cohen, left, and Jerry Greenfield, right, are known for giving away free ice cream file picture Ben Jerry s, which is part of the Unilever conglomerate, is well known as an outspoken anti capitalist company. We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy Ben Jerry s board of directors . We seek and support nonviolent ways to achieve peace and justice, its mission statement on the Unilever website reads. We believe government resources are more productively used in meeting human needs than in building and maintaining weapons systems. It was founded in 1978 and two years ago launched a Hubby Hubby ice cream in support of same sex marriage. Big protest A large group of protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement attempted to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1 . The company also launched a Yes Pecan flavour to celebrate Barack Obama s becoming U.S. president.
Ben Jerry s often holds free ice cream giveaways so Occupy Wall Street protesters will be hoping that will be the case again here. It comes as concerns were raised that the protesters New York camp in Zuccotti Park is being infiltrated by opportunists looking for sex and drugs. The National Air and Space Museum was closed in Washington D.C. on Saturday after anti war protesters stormed it and were repelled by guards. They were the unlikely pair who used a 5 course in ice cream making to become one of America s most iconic success stories in recent decades. Ben Greenfield and Jerry . Cohen set up a business with 12,000 in 1978, and it turned into one of the . most well known ice cream firms worldwide. The Vermont company tries to promote linked prosperity , so it is big on ethical business practices, sustainable growth and being socially responsible. It became a multimillion dollar publicly traded company before being bought by conglomerate Unilever for a whopping 326million in 2000. Mr Cohen and Mr Greenfield kept away from the running of the company, but they often help out at openings of new stores. The duo were disillusioned that Unilever had not vigorously pursued the mission of corporate social responsibility it accepted with the purchase. But they have maintained their political affiliation despite the sell out, and Unilever has brought out its own liberal flavours over the last two years. The Hubby Hubby ice cream was launched in 2009 to support same sex marriage and Yes Pecan marked Barack Obama s presidential election. But it caused a stir with its latest creation, Schweddy Balls , which was boycotted by a leading mothers organisation who branded it vulgar .
Media playback is not supported on this device Saturday s 2 0 home loss to Hamilton left the Dens Park club in the relegation play off position. I m disappointed not to have got the chance to see out the season because I firmly believe we would have retained our Premiership status, Hartley said. But Dundee managing director John Nelms said Unfortunately, the business we are in, sometimes change is necessary to achieve the goals we have set. With five games remaining to climb out of the bottom two, Nelms informed the players of Hartley s departure today. I want to thank Paul for his time with the club, he added in a club statement. I think somebody in the near future is going to get a good, hard working manager. Hartley succeeded John Brown as Dundee manager in February 2014 and guided the club to the Championship title that season. In the Dens Park club s first season back in the Premiership, Hartley achieved a top six finish. Last season Dundee narrowly missed out on the top six again and ended the campaign in eighth place. Media playback is not supported on this device He took training this morning but was informed on his return to Dens Park that his services were no longer required. And in a statement, Hartley added I was confident we would have moved up the league table as there are some excellent players in the dressing room, led by captain Darren O Dea. However, I respect the decision made by the Dundee FC board and would like to wish everyone success in the final five games of the campaign. I m very proud of what I achieved at Dundee since I was appointed manager in February, 2014. We won promotion to the SPFL top flight and we finished in the top six. There is no doubt I m leaving the club in a far stronger position now from when I first joined.
Dundee won their opening match of this season away to Ross County but then failed to win in their next 10 Premiership games, with seven of those ending in defeat. They were bottom of the table in October but then recovered and were sixth in February following a 5 1 victory at Motherwell. That result, however, preceded the start of their current woeful run, which has included a 7 0 home defeat to Aberdeen. Hartley is the fifth manager to leave or be sacked by a Premiership club this season. Robbie Neilson left Hearts to join MK Dons, Lee Clark departed Kilmarnock for Bury, Mark Warburton and Rangers parted company, and Motherwell sacked Mark McGhee. Due to the Scottish Cup semi final weekend, Dundee s next match is away to Motherwell on 29 April.
Hess s bones were exhumed at the graveyard in the town of Wunsiedel, southern Germany, early on Wednesday. The remains were later cremated and are to be scattered at sea. Hess was captured after flying to Britain in 1941 and sentenced to life in prison. He killed himself in a Berlin jail in 1987 at the age of 93. As he requested in his will, he was buried in the small Bavarian town of Wunsiedel, where his family had a holiday home and where his parents were already interred. The local Lutheran church which supervises the cemetery gave its permission for the burial at the time, ruling that the wishes of the deceased could not be ignored. But they and local people have since become concerned by the number of far right groups visiting the grave. Each year on the anniversary of his death, neo Nazis have attempted to stage a march to the cemetery, saluting the grave with its epitaph I dared , and laying floral wreaths. The enduring myth of Rudolf Hess A member of the church council, Hans Juergen Buchta, told the Associated Press news agency The whole town was shut down and in turmoil and there was a huge police presence. We here at the graveyard were not always able to cope. A 2005 court order banning such gatherings had little effect so the church decided to terminate the family s lease on the grave as of October 2011. A granddaughter of Hess objected to the decision and filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent it going ahead, but was eventually persuaded by the parish council to drop the case and allow the exhumation to go ahead. Roland Schoeffel, the deputy mayor of Wunsiedel, told AFP news agency that the monument had been razed in an operation not open to the public . Cemetery administrator Andreas Fabel told AP news agency on Thursday The grave is now empty. The bones are gone.
One resident, named as Mrs Koenig, said Perhaps we will now have some peace when he is gone. Perhaps they won t come any more, which is what Wunsiedel wants. Charlotte Knobloch, the head of the Jewish community in Munich and Upper Bavaria, welcomed the move. For decades this town and its inhabitants were terrorised by far right extremists from all over the world, she is quoted as saying by AFP. Hess was one of Hitler s closest aides. But in 1941 he made a solo flight to Scotland, where his plane crash landed, in an apparently unauthorised peace mission which was denounced by the fuhrer. He was imprisoned by the British for the duration of the war. At the Nuremberg Trials in 1946, Hess was cleared of war crimes and crimes against humanity but convicted of crimes against peace and jailed for life. He spent 40 years in Spandau Prison in Berlin. He was the last remaining inmate at the prison when he was found hanged there in August 1987.
By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED . 09 57 EST, 8 September 2013 . . UPDATED . 10 05 EST, 8 September 2013 . An 107 year old man in Arkansas was killed yesterday after entering into a gun fight with a SWAT team. Authorities in Pine Bluff, Arkansas have only released one statement on the incident so far. They say they were responding to a domestic disturbance call around 5pm at a residence and learned that an aggravated assault had occurred against two people in the house. Centenarian killed An 107 year old man was shot and killed by a SWAT team after engaging with them in a fire fight at a residence in Pine Bluff, Arkansas . The suspect, 107 year old Monroe Isadore, had pointed a gun at the two people. Police ushered out the two victims and Isadore barricaded himself in a room. When officers tried to get into the room, Isadore shot at the door and so the officers retreated to a safer area. A SWAT team was then called in and a negotiator tried to speak with Isadore. When negotiations were unsuccessful, SWAT inserted gas into the room. Shooting Police were responding to a domestic disturbance call at the residence, which turned out to be an aggravated assault case . Again, Isadore shot at the officers inserting the gas from outside a bedroom window. No officers were injured in the shootout. Shortly after throwing gas into the room, the SWAT team attempted to enter the room and Isadore started shooting. The entry team shot back and killed Isadore. The incident is currently under investigation.
By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9 47 AM on 17th February 2012 . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were left terrified after a plane flying them into Britain narrowly avoided colliding with another aircraft which hadn t cleared a runway in time, it was claimed today. Passengers on Prince William and Kate Middleton s aircraft back from Copenhagen were said to have been very frightened after the pilot had to ascend quickly to avoid ploughing into another plane. The royals flight back from Denmark was about to land at Heathrow when the pilot of the Airbus A320 200 was forced to perform a steep climb at the last minute. Trip Hours before the flight drama, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had been pictured in Copenhagen on their first joint humanitarian mission . Passengers on the on 162 seat airliner back to Britain all escaped the episode unhurt, but The Duchess of Cambridge was said to have been deeply unsettled by the incident. Prince Willam and Kate Middleton were returning from a joint trip to the Danish capital on their first humanitarian mission. A source close to the incident told The People This really was a serious incident and would have been terrifying for those on board. The aircraft ahead of them hadn t cleared the runway in time for the plane carrying the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to land. For anyone who didn t know what was going on it would have been extremely worrying. Staff at British Airways dismissed the emergency ascent at Heathrow as a standard procedure British Airways admitted one of their pilots was forced to perform the mid air manoeuvre during the flight on November 2, but dismissed the incident as standard procedure A spokesperson said Our crew were told by air traffic control to perform a go around a perfectly standard operation with no safety implications because an aircraft from another airline hadn t fully cleared the runway. Safety is always our priority and all our pilots are fully trained to deal with procedures of this kind. Our aircraft landed safely and customers left the plane as normal.
A Clarence House spokesperson would not comment on the incident, while a Heathrow Airport spokesperson did not return a request for comment.
CNN In a bookstore, I saw a woman taking photograph after photograph of newly released titles that were arranged on a shelf. She was using her phone to take the pictures. I didn t understand. Why would anyone want to take pictures of books Then, at a restaurant, waiting for a table, I heard two men, also waiting, talking. One said he had just ended a frustrating day at the store he owned. Do they think I m a showroom he said. He mentioned people who had come into his shop that day, had looked at the merchandise, had taken notes and then had left. Do they think I don t know what they re doing he said. It is a relatively new phenomenon. Among retail merchants owners of stores both small and large it has a name . Showrooming. No one showrooms by choice. And it represents a potential sea change in American life. Its implications are vast. As described in an article by reporter Amy Zimmerman in the Wall Street Journal, showrooming is when shoppers come into a store to see a product in person, only to buy it from a rival online, frequently at a lower price. Say a merchant owns a retail store a brick and mortar store, on a city street. He or she hires staff, pays rent, writes checks for electricity and telephone service, pays for janitorial work, pays real estate and sales taxes, invests heavily in merchandise. And hopes against hope that customers will come in, look around and buy something. This is how the retail sales business has always worked. But in recent years, as online companies without a single physical store have risen to prominence, something new has occurred. People will come into stores, look around, stop at items they particularly like and instead of carrying them to the cash register, will take photos of them, or type a description into their smartphones.
Then, in many cases, they will go home, enter the product into a search engine and find some online only merchant a merchant who has no real life stores who is selling the item for less money. A tap of the Enter key, a few keystrokes to provide credit card information, and the item the item the person has examined and liked in the brick and mortar store is on its way to the buyer s home. It s all so effortless. The online merchant wins. The purchaser wins. Who loses You know the answer. The loser is the owner of that real life store the person who has stocked the merchandise, hired the staff, paid to keep the store cool in summer and warm in winter, written the rent checks and the tax checks. It is no wonder merchants are feeling frustration and anger that their stores are being considered as little more than showrooms by some shoppers showrooms displaying merchandise that, if the people wandering the aisles go home and buy from an online vendor, will provide not a cent in revenue to the owner of the real store. Do the customers ever look into the eyes of the proprietor of the store and wonder if this new way is fair to him As Brad Tuttle of Time magazine has written . Most consumers don t really care how, or even if, a retailer makes money. All they care about is which one has the best products at the cheapest prices. The ideal situation is one in which they can inspect merchandise in person, and then buy it at the cheapest price without having to schlep it to and from the car, and without having to pay extra for delivery. What s the difference, you may ask Why does this matter It will matter when and if critical mass is reached, and online only merchants, who don t have to underwrite the expense of having traditional stores on city streets, reach dominance. Then, one by one, the stores that have unwillingly become showrooms for the online merchants will fold up.
And the American downtown and mall landscape will begin to look barren. A doomsday scenario Perhaps. But just browsing has taken on a different meaning in the context of shoppers who go home and use their computers browsers to find online retailers who will undercut the conventional stores. Last weekend I was in central Ohio for the annual charity race we hold to raise cancer research money in memory of my late friend Jack Roth. I asked his daughter, Maren, who owns a women s boutique called Rowe, whether she was familiar with the showrooming phenomenon. She said she has seen it with her own eyes, in her own store. If they tell you how much they like an item, and take a picture of it and then leave the store and you never hear from them again, it s a pretty good indication that they may be going home and looking for a better price online, she said. And if they call the store later and ask you to tell them the specific style name and number of the item then you really know. They re putting the merchandise they saw in your store into a search engine. It s not just smaller merchants like Roth. Target, the retail store giant, wrote a letter to its vendors this year that said, What we aren t willing to do is let online only retailers use our brick and mortar stores as a showroom for their products and undercut our prices without making investments, as we do, to proudly display your brands. What all this will eventually do to old style stores is anyone s guess. Perhaps they will be judged to have outlived their usefulness. In the meantime, merchants will continue to open their doors each morning in the hopes that the people who come in will really intend to buy something. There is a longstanding axiom that business owners are supposed to believe in The customer is always right.
But in this emerging era in which people come into stores taking photos and making lists, with no intention to give the store owner their business, worried merchants can t be blamed if they look around their shops and ask themselves . Who, and what, is a customer The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.
Children are being banned from seeing Keira Knightley in the role of sultry temptress in a TV perfume commercial. The British actress has ridiculed her lack of curves, however it seems her bare shoulders are enough to confuse and upset some youngsters. As a result, advertising watchdogs have banned showings of the commercial for Chanel s Coco Mademoiselle around children s programmes and films. Scroll down for video . Too sexy for her shirt a Chanel advert starring actress Keira Knightley has been branded too seductive . Overtly sexual parents complained when Keira Knightley s raunchy advert was aired during an ad break for the PG cartoon movie Ice Age The Meltdown . The idea that children s eyes need to be shielded from the British actress s performance will surprise viewers. Chanel defended the commercial, insisting it was playful and sensual rather than overtly sexual. However, the Advertising Standards Authority ASA disagreed at a time when many parents, including the Prime Minister, are becoming increasingly concerned about the sexualisation of children. The commercial opened with Keira in tight leathers astride a motorbike racing through city streets, before cutting to a modelling scene where she is being photographed on a bed. The relationship with the photographer becomes increasingly flirtatious and sexual as the man is seen unzipping her leather boots and attempting a kiss. At one stage the actress s bare shoulders are seen, while she is assumed to be naked beneath some sheets. Just as the relationship seems certain to become even more intimate, she disappears out of the window and rides off leaving her would be lover disappointed. The commercial was aired during a screening of the cartoon Ice Age 2, which has been a hit with families. Unconcerned Actress Keira Knightley out with her mother in Rome on Tuesday night . A woman viewer complained that it was not suitable to be shown during a children s film because it was overtly sexual.
Chanel rejected the claim and said its founder, Coco Chanel, was known for being a strong, independent woman and the character in the ad was intended to reflect her spirit. The perfume giant pointed out that there was no nudity in the ad and that the character only briefly revealed her shoulders as part of a photo shoot. They said the photographer helped the actress remove her boots, rather than her clothes, as part of a wardrobe change during the photo shoot. Keira s signature look her famous backless dress in Atonement, left, and at a premiere with her elegant shoulders as a focal point of her outfit . Chanel said while a degree of sexual tension was common in perfume ads, this particular commercial was playful and sensual . However, the ASA sided with the complainant arguing the scenes involved sexually suggestive content . The watchdog said We noted that the photographer was directly involved in unzipping the actress s garments and that there was a suggestion that she was naked aside from a bed sheet. We also noted that there was clear sexual tension between the pair and that they appeared about to kiss on the bed. We considered the ad was suitable for older children, but that the sexually suggestive material was unsuitable for young children.

Media playback is not supported on this device The four time champion in Melbourne is making his competitive return after last playing at Wimbledon in July. Federer beat Mischa Zverev 6 1 7 5 6 2 to set up Thursday s last four match against fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka. Feeling as good as I am, playing as good as I am, that s a huge surprise to me, said the 35 year old. If someone would have told me I d play in the semis against Stan, never would I have called that one. For Stan, yes, but not for me. I honestly didn t even know a few days ago that he was in my section of the draw or I m in his section. Federer, who has not won a Grand Slam title since triumphing at Wimbledon in 2012, had been sidelined by a knee injury throughout the second half of last year and has slipped from third in the world to 17th. He played in the non ranking Hopman Cup in Perth earlier in January, but has come through 18 sets in Melbourne. I think winning back to back matches in best of five sets against quality, great players has surprised me most, he said. Really that s been for me the big question mark, if I could do that so early in my comeback. I felt I was always going to be dangerous on any given day in a match situation. But obviously as the tournament would progress, maybe I would fade away with energy, you know, that kind of stuff. Federer holds an 18 3 winning record against Wawrinka, but the 31 year old will go into the semi final as the world number four and looking for a second consecutive Grand Slam title after last year s US Open success.
Federer has won their past two meetings, at the ATP World Tour Finals and in the US Open in 2015, but Wawrinka holds a Grand Slam win against his Davis Cup team mate, coming in the quarter finals of the French Open in the same year. Against Roger, it s always special because he s so good. He s the best player of all time, said the three time Grand Slam winner. He has an answer for everything. But I managed to beat him in a Grand Slam, so we ll see. It s great to see him back at that level. Hopefully I can manage to play a great match. All of Wawrinka s three Grand Slam titles have come since Federer won his last five years ago. And Wawrinka s rise to becoming a consistent top 10 player did not come until he was aged 28, and after plenty of help from his fellow Swiss. I remember giving Stan a lot of advice on how he should play certain guys, said Federer. Then the day came where he didn t call me so much any more. He called me less and less. I also felt like I didn t tell him any more, because he created his knowledge, his base, had his team. Only from time to time would I give him advice if he asked me. Otherwise I was happy that he was able to let go and go on his own path. British Davis Cup captain Leon Smith on BBC Radio 5 live It s a great match because Wawrinka wants to stay back and bludgeon the ball with huge swings and power. Federer s job, in the lively conditions, is to take time away from Wawrinka and not allow him to get into that rhythm. Federer has to come forward and test Wawrinka s passing shots a lot. That s important because I don t think Stan s the best passer in the world.
Roger will be able to come in a lot because Wawrinka does chip and block a lot of first serve returns. The way Federer is playing, even though he has missed six months of tennis, I think he s maybe the slight favourite from what I ve seen.
Hundreds of farmers supplying chickens to the poultry processing company are recipients of the heating subsidy. Earlier Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said the meeting had raised fresh concerns over the operation of the scheme. Poultry farmers use the wood chip boilers to heat the buildings where chicks are housed. Many took advantage of the scheme to replace LPG heating systems. In his statement, Mr Ó Muilleoir said the Moy Park briefing with his officials had raised further issues . But in a statement the company made no reference to any concerns about the operation of the scheme. It said it had met officials from the departments of economy and finance in order to help find a solution to secure the Northern Ireland RHI scheme within budget . It said it had extensive experience of benchmarked energy use in the poultry industry. That appears to be a reference to attempts to establish what would be considered acceptable levels of heat use by poultry farms. Moy Park said it advocated responsible use of heat . The finance minister also said cost control proposals had been submitted to his department by Department of Economy officials on Monday evening only to be withdrawn 10 minutes later. Mr Ó Muilleoir has already described the proposed cost control measures as a sticking plaster . He said he wasn t interested in a botched solution to the RHI scandal .

CNN Before he was Pope Benedict XVI, before he earned the nickname Cardinal No as the enforcer of church doctrine, he was Joseph Ratzinger the son of Maria and police officer Joseph Ratzinger, learning about life and God in Germany between two world wars. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, Benedict is not only the church s leader but God s representative on earth and infallible. He is also a man one who savors his meat and potatoes, an accomplished pianist who loves Mozart, and a teacher who for years commanded university classes. His humanity became apparent Monday, when the Vatican announced he d resign at month s end because of advanced age, becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so. After his birth on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, in southeastern Germany near the Austrian border, Ratzinger s early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times, as well as his faith. Adolf Hitler rose to power during Ratzinger s adolescent years in Traunstein, in the heavily Catholic region of Bavaria. When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. He left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. For the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army. According to CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen, Ratzinger s family was strongly, if quietly, anti Nazi and his father took a series of less significant jobs to steer clear from what was happening under Hitler. In June 1945, Ratzinger was released from a POW camp.
Hitching a ride on a milk truck, he headed home. And life began anew. Opinion Why pope will be remembered for generations . The soldier became a scholar, studying philosophy and theology at the University of Munich and another school in Freising between 1946 and 1951. Two years later, he earned a doctorate in theology, after submitting a thesis titled, The People and House of God in St. Augustine s Doctrine of the Church. Eventually, he became a professor teaching dogma and fundamental theology at four German universities. In 1969, for instance, he was appointed vice president and professor of theology at the University of Regensburg in Germany. Books are his best friends, Allen said. All the while, he grew more ingrained in the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. In 1962, 11 years after his ordination as a priest, the then 35 year old was a consultant during Vatican II to Cardinal Josef Frings, a reformer who was archbishop of Cologne, Germany. As a young priest, Ratzinger was on the progressive side of theological debates. But he began to shift right after student revolutions of 1968, according to Allen, also a correspondent with the National Catholic Reporter. In fact, it was Ratzinger s conservative defense of strict doctrines that defined him in many people s eyes until he became pope. A defender of church doctrine and a simple, humble worker In the late 1970s and 1980s, Ratzinger shot up the church s ranks. In spring 1977, he was named archbishop of Munich and Freising. A few months later, Pope Paul VI appointed him cardinal. One of his most significant steps up came in 1981 when he took over as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the Vatican office that oversees the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world, according to the Vatican.
Ratzinger became known as Cardinal No stemming from his efforts to crack down on the liberation theology movement, religious pluralism, challenges to traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, and calls to ordain women as priests. Liberation theology combined Christian theology with political activism on issues like human rights and social justice. While partially compatible with Catholic social teachings, it was rejected by the Vatican, which objected to the mixing of church theology with Marxist ideas such as class struggle. It was his job to police the doctrinal boundaries of the Roman Catholic Church, and inevitably when you do that, there are going to be hurt feelings by people who find themselves on the wrong side of those lines, said Allen, the author of Cardinal Ratzinger The Vatican s Enforcer of the Faith. Over subsequent years, he made news when, for instance, he labeled homosexuality an intrinsic moral evil and called the Soviet Union and its communist satellite nations a shame of our time. In the 1990s, Ratzinger openly challenged a fellow German cardinal who had encouraged divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to return to the sacraments. Ratzinger also argued Muslim Turkey did not belong in Christian Europe and issued a document saying that Catholicism was the only true religion questioning the validity of other religions, even Christian ones, even as his Pope John Paul II was trying to reach out to other faiths. Although objections came from some of his fellow cardinals, the pope did not restrain Ratzinger, in part because their friendship went back four decades, to the time when the two were young priests at the Vatican II meetings in Rome. The Pope s resignation explained . That bond persevered until John Paul s death in 2005, by which time Ratzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals the high level group that advises the pope and, when called upon, picks a new pontiff. In April 2005, they picked him, then 78 years old.
Now called Benedict, his reputation was seen as more subdued than his predecessor. He traveled extensively, if not at John Paul s pace. His words carried special weight, as in 2006, when he quoted from 14th century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus saying the Muslim Prophet Mohammed had only brought into the world things only evil and inhuman. The remarks set off protests by Muslims worldwide, and Benedict apologized for any offense taken by Muslims. For some, the defining element of his papacy was the sex abuse scandal, with the church being accused of not doing enough to deal with reports of abuse by priests over decades, and on multiple continents. Two years after acknowledging shame over the evils of abuse, Benedict issued a statement in 2010 saying the church had not been vigilant or fast enough in responding to the problem one of the most forthright admissions to date, though it still did not placate some who criticized then Cardinal Ratzinger for not cracking down sufficiently. Such missives demonstrated his power, in the church and on the world stage. But for all the headlines he generated, Benedict as he did in his first blessing after being elected pope insisted he was merely a simple, humble worker in God s vineyard. I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools, he said then, and I especially trust in your prayers.
Economic inactivity refers to people of working age who are not seeking work. Its rate in Northern Ireland is just under 27 and can cover students, people with health conditions, or those with caring or parenting responsibilities. The UK average is 22 . The strategy, called Enabling Success , has been jointly launched by Employment Minister Stephen Farry and Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster. The strategy involves 11 projects, based on the voluntary participation of individuals. Three groups will be targeted those with work limiting health conditions or disabilities, lone parents and people with caring commitments. I recognise that there are some who will never be able to work due to the severity of their health conditions, Mr Farry said. However, there are many people with work limiting conditions who, with the right support, may be able to participate. Mrs Foster added that the problem could hold back the economy unless addressed. The strategy will seek to contribute to an increase in the employment rate in Northern Ireland and to increase our economic competitiveness and productivity in the global market, she said. By 2030, the strategy hopes to have raised employment levels to above the UK average. The current employment rate here is 68.6 compared with a United Kingdom average of 73.4 and achieving this goal will be challenging, Mrs Foster said.
The grieving family of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have criticised the timing of a new book that claims the plane may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up. The family of missing Brisbane man Rod Burrows say they are at pains to understand how still, after 71 days of ongoing global search efforts, no one knows what happened to the missing plane which vanished on March 8 and how a book could be released so soon after. Flight MH370 The Mystery makes the incredible claim that the airline was shot down by US Thai joint strike fighters accidentally as part of a training drill gone horribly wrong. The book goes on to claim the search party was purposely sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. Scroll down for video . Flight MH370 has been missing since March 8 but could have transmitted a GPS fix on its location if its tracking software had received a 6 upgrade, it s been claimed . Huge task The search for MH370 is the most expensive and extensive ever undertaken . Investigation The book weighs all the theories about what happened to MH370 . Irene Burrows, Rod s mother, told the Sun Herald that the book had been released too soon, and that despite the speculation, it offers no concrete answers. There s absolutely no answers, she said. It s devastating for the families, it s been 10 weeks tomorrow and there s nothing. She said both her and husband George are still trying to comprehend what happened, and that a book full of conspiracies released just 71 days after its disappearance, does nothing to alleviate the pain of losing their son. But according to the book s author, Nigel Cawthorne, there may never be a clear answer. He writes in the book how the Burrows, and hundreds more in their situation, will almost certainly never know the real story behind how the ill fated plane vanished on March 8.
He writes Did they die painlessly, unaware of their fate Or did they die in terror in a flaming wreck, crashing from the sky in the hands of a madman It is then that Cawthorne makes the incredible assertion that the plane was shot down accidentally over the South China Sea by a joint US Thai joint strike fighter team, and the searchers sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. He describes how a man, while working on an oil rig in the ocean at about the same time the plane s transponder went off, saw a burning plane and how this was right near the military exercise being conducted with personel from various other countries. He claims that these countries may have then sent searchers in the wrong direction in order to cover their tracks. After all, no wreckage has been found in the South Indian Ocean, which in itself is suspicious. He said with the amount of disinformation regarding MH370, it is best to be skeptical. Cawthorne also raises more doubt into toe plane s disappearance, claiming it could have been located if its tracking software had been upgraded something that costs just 6 10 per flight. According to Cawthorne the Boeing 777 200ER had a data package that only transmitted the most basic flight information, so authorities weren t able to get a GPS fix on it. For just 10, however, this package could have been improved, the book says, resulting in far more detailed information about the 777 s movements being pinged. For US 10, you could have told within half an hour s flying time where the plane would have gone, a source told the paper. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, has called for real time tracking of planes and improvements to their communication systems to prevent a repeat of the 370 tragedy.
In an opinion piece published on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Najib called for changes that would make it harder for an aircraft to simply disappear, and easier to find any aircraft that did. One of the most astonishing things about this tragedy is the revelation that an airliner the size of a Boeing 777 can vanish, almost without a trace. In an age of smartphones and mobile Internet, real time tracking of commercial airplanes is long overdue, he said. Inmarsat Plc, a British provider of global mobile satellite communications services, said Monday it will offer free basic tracking services for planes flying over oceans. The service will be available to most of the world s long haul commercial fleet. The Malaysian plane sent a signal to an Inmarsat satellite, but not location data. Engineers conducted a novel analysis of those signals to determine the plane s flight path, but the effort took time. Australia s Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor for MH370 s black box . Najib also urged the aviation industry to consider changing planes communications systems so that they can t be disabled midair. The government has said someone severed the plane s communication systems with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370. He said the capacity of the cockpit data recorder, one of a plane s two black boxes, should be extended from two hours currently to recording the entire flight, while its location beacons should be made to last at least 90 days, instead of 30 days now. The global aviation industry must not only learn the lessons of MH370 but implement them, he added. Najib reiterated that Flight 370 was one of world s greatest aviation mysteries. Nobody saw this coming, nobody knows why it happened, and nobody knows precisely where it is, he said. He said the government has done its best but admitted there were mistakes in the early days of the crisis, with a disorderly public communication and a slow start to search efforts.
He said an independent investigation is ongoing so the government can learn from mistakes. A Malaysia Airlines employee writes a message expressing prayers and well wishes for passengers of MH370 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport mosque . Najib assured families of passengers that Malaysia will keep searching for the plane for as long as it takes. Australia is leading the search, which is moving into a second phase in which commercial underwater operators will be contracted to scour a vast expanse of seabed with sonar equipment looking for wreckage for the next one year. An Australian ship on Tuesday returned to the area where underwater sounds consistent with black boxes were heard in April, the search coordination center said. The ship had returned to port briefly to be resupplied. The Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor. A spokeswoman for John Blake, the publishers of the book, said . The tragic disappearance of Flight MH370 is an extraordinary and terrible . mystery. Inevitably hundreds of wild theories are circulating about what has . really happened. Nigel Cawthorne is a serious and highly respected author and . journalist. He has spent weeks scientifically analysing all the available data . to produce the book, which is a serious and measured . study of this tragedy.
CNN Chelsea became the first defending champion to crash out at the Group Stage of the Champions League despite thrashing Danish side Nordsjaelland 6 1 at Stamford Bridge. The win was Chelsea s largest in the competition, but it still wasn t enough to prevent them slipping into the Europa League. Rafa Benitez s side needed Shakhtar Donetsk to do them a favor and defeat Juventus, but the Italian team triumphed 1 0 in Ukraine. That meant that Chelsea s victory was meaningless, despite the margin of victory. It looked as if the Blues would endure a difficult evening when Nordsjaelland was awarded a penalty on 32 minutes. But Chelsea keeper Petr Cech saved well from Nicolai Stokholm to keep the game goalless. Just minutes later, it was Chelsea s turn to miss from the spot when Eden Hazard s effort was saved. Chelsea collapse heaps pressure on Benitez . Any frustration around Stamford Bridge was finally extinguished when the home side was awarded another penalty following a handball and David Luiz swept home. Fernando Torres netted a second on the stroke of halftime before Nordsjaelland halved the deficit through Joshua John. But the Blues steamrolled the Danes in the second period with Torres grabbing his second, before Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar completed the rout. In the end, it was Olexander Kucher s 56th minute own goal in Ukraine which sealed Chelsea s demise and Juventus place in the knockout phase. Both Shakhtar and Juve only needed a draw to progress with the Ukrainian side already guaranteed of a place in the last 16. But the Italians secured victory and top spot with a hard fought win. Barca s unbeaten run ended by Celtic . In Glasgow, Celtic secured a dramatic 2 1 win over Spartak Moscow to secure second place in Group G. Kris Commons netted an 81st minute penalty to seal the three points and ensure the Scottish champion leapfrogged Benfica.
Gary Hooper s strike had given Celtic the lead before Spartak struck back through Ari six minutes before the break. But when Marek Suchý was adjuged to have brought down Giorgos Samaras, Commons blasted the ball home from 12 yards to spark wild celebrations. Spartak s misery was compounded when Kim Kallstrom was sent off for a wild tackle on Commons. Benfica and the curse of Bela Guttmann Meanwhile, Benfica was left to think of what might have been after finishing goalless at Barcelona. The Catalan side left out a whole host of star names including Xavi and Andres Iniesta, while Leo Messi started on the bench. Messi map How Argentine maestro conquered the world . Messi, who still needs two goals to beat Gerd Muller s record of 85 goals in a calendar year, did come onto the field after 58 minutes, but was forced off on a stretcher after suffering an injury late on. But despite Barca fielding a relatively inexperienced side, Benfica was unable to find a way through and must now settle for the Europa League. Bayern Munich share points with Dortmund . In Group F, Bayern Munich secured top spot with a comfortable 4 1 win over 10 man BATE Borisov. Mario Gomez gave last season s finalist a 22nd minute lead with Thomas Muller adding a second. Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed Bayern s third before BATE was reduced to 10 men when Denis Polyakov was shown a second yellow card. David Alaba hammered home a fourth with seven minutes remaining, before Yegor Filipenko hit an 89th minute consolation. Valencia was forced to settle for second place following its 1 0 win at Lille courtesy of Jonas 36th minute penalty. In Group H, Galatasaray pulled off a crucial 2 1 win at Braga to book its place in the next round.
Mossoró had given the Portuguese side a 32nd minute lead as Galatasaray s hope began to fade. But top scorer Burak Yılmaz equalized with his sixth goal of the competition, before substitute Aydın Yılmaz hit the winner. It was hard to swallow for Romanian side Cluj, which recorded one of the most famous results in its history to win 1 0 at Manchester United. Luis Alberto s stunning strike ensured Cluj became the first Romanian team to triumph at Old Trafford. But with Galatasaray also winning, Cluj will now have to fight it out in Europa League.
Work to bring down the building on Kingsway started in October 2015 and was due to take six months. But the outer structure of the building is still standing as there was more asbestos than first thought. The council bought the site as part of plans to transform Kingsway into a business district. All internal works at the building have now been completed, with scaffolding in place to support the exterior s demolition. The work is scheduled to finish by the spring.
The respectful relationship curriculum will be mandatory in all schools in Victoria from next year. Students will explore issues around social inequality, gender based violence and male privilege. However, a report on a 2015 pilot trial accused it of presenting all men as bad and all women as victims . Pay inequality, anger management, sexual orientation and the dangers of pornography will be among the topics explored by students in the programme, costing A 21.8m 13.5m 16.5m . Primary school students will be exposed to images of both boys and girls doing household chores, playing sport and working as firefighters and receptionists. The material includes statements including girls can play football, can be doctors and can be strong and boys can cry when they are hurt, can be gentle, can be nurses and can mind babies . In high school, students will be taught the meaning of terms including pansexual, cisgender and transsexual and the concept of male privilege. A guide for the Year 7 and 8 curriculum states Being born a male, you have advantages such as being overly represented in the public sphere and this will be true whether you personally approve or think you are entitled to this privilege. It describes privilege as automatic, unearned benefits bestowed upon dominant groups based on gender, sexuality, race or socio economic class . Year 11 and 12 students are introduced to the concept of hegemonic masculinity which requires boys and men to be heterosexual, tough, athletic and emotionless, and encourages the control and dominance of men over women . Some critics have suggested that although more needs to be done to protect the female victims of domestic violence, the programme lacks objectivity and nuance. Jeremy Sammut, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies, a libertarian think tank, told The Australian newspaper that it amounted to taxpayer funded indoctrination of children. The idea behind this programme that all men are latent abusers by nature of the discourse is an idea that only cloistered feminist academics could love, Dr Sammut said.
A lot of evidence suggests that like child abuse, domestic violence is a by product of social dysfunction welfare, drugs, family breakdown. The royal commission that recommended education as the key measure for preventing future family violence found that 25 of victims of family violence are men. Critics argue that point is often overlooked. Education Minister James Merlino has said education is the key to ending the vicious cycle of family violence. This is about teaching our kids to treat everyone with respect and dignity so we can start the cultural change we need in our society to end the scourge of family violence, he said.
At least 13 samples, taken from post mortem examinations following unexplained deaths, were found stored at South Tyneside District Hospital. Northumbria Police said 26 families were being contacted, with Cleveland Police dealing with 13 families. Both forces admitted samples were kept longer than necessary . In a statement, Northumbria Police Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine, said We understand the gravity of this situation and the devastating affect it has had on the families involved. The human tissue samples of cases that happened many years ago have been identified and we have specially trained officers contacting relatives of 26 people to inform them of this. It is our priority to make sure this is done as quickly and sympathetically as possible. The remains were found during an audit at the hospital in March 2015. South Shields MP Emma Lewell Buck said I think in terms of overall transparency, it s important that the public know the level of numbers involved. I m very disappointed that it s happened in a hospital in my constituency and I think it s such a shame for those families. Something like this can just open it up the grieving process and it can feel like it just happened the day before all over again. Sarah Simpson, whose father Terence died in a fall from a roof 22 years ago, said she was appalled to be told his tissue samples had been stored. She said she was now considering legal action. The Human Tissue Authority HTA said that significant improvements had been made to the systems governing the retention of human tissue samples.

CNN It s time to end the posturing and give the world s boxing fans the bout they desperately want Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather. That s Bob Arum s message to everyone involved in trying to navigate a way through the quagmire that is negotiations for a contest that has long been top of fight fans wish list. Pacquiao s promoter has been in touch with Mayweather s camp to kick start talks and finally attempt to get two of boxing s best ever fighters in the ring. Though both boxers are arguably past their prime any match up between Mayweather unbeaten in 45 fights across five different weights and Pacquiao an eight division world champion with 55 wins from 62 fights is likely to ignite huge interest. We ve put out the olive branch saying we would welcome the start of discussions for such a fight, Top Rank chief executive officer Arum told CNN World Sport. While Manny fights on HBO and HBO pay per view and Floyd fights on Showtime and Showtime pay per view, there is a precedent for both networks to come together and put on big event. They did it when heavyweight Mike Tyson, who was a Showtime fighter, fought Lennox Lewis, who was an HBO fighter, a number of years ago. That was a hugely successful event and set a record for pay per view sales in the US. We can t keep posturing,. If people want to make a deal and put aside egos and making statements to the press who was right, who was wrong and really sincerely want something to happen it generally gets done. And it is my hope that s what will happen when and if both sides sit down to discuss seriously an event the sports world is crying out for. With Mayweather approaching 37 and Pacquiao, 34, suffering two successive defeats before his most recent victory over Brandon Rios in Macau Arum acknowledges time is running out to make a deal.
While the pair may not be as the pinnacle of their careers as they were when the fight was mooted three years ago, Arum still believes it would generate worldwide interest and reportedly might bring in 100 million. I think if an event like that was made people would really flock to watch it, he added. I think it s very fair to say the clamor is not as fervent as it was a few years ago when they were both at the height of their careers but it s still an event the public are clamoring for, perhaps not as much as three years ago but we can t roll back the clock. Pacquiao s most immediate focus in the aftermath of his victory over Rios earlier this month has been to defend himself amid accusations that he owes 50 million in unpaid taxes in his home country the Philippines. The 34 year old s assets have been frozen, meaning he had to borrow money to help victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan that tore through the country. But Arum says the allegations amount to a political vendetta against Pacquiao, who is a member of congress in the Philippines, and will be ironed out shortly. The assessment is based on fights he had in the United States and in every one of those fights four fights in the two years in question we withheld 30 of the amounts we paid him and paid those amounts to the Internal Revenue Service IRS , Arum explained. We supplied the Philippine tax authorities with the schedule of our payments and receipts from the IRS. For some unknown reason they are insisting the IRS send certification of the payments. Manny applied for those certifications a while ago and of course the IRS was bogged down partly because when the government was shut down they weren t working. There s been a hold up but I m sure once those certifications arrive, it will all go away. He doesn t owe anything.
Under the Philippine U.S. tax treaty, he was taxed in the U.S. for income earned in the U.S., and he gets a dollar per dollar credit against his Philippine taxes. Once that credit it given to him they ll find there is no further tax liability in the Philippines. I think it s great for his image because it shows the nature of politics in the Philippines. Manny Pacquiao is a member of a coalition in the Philippines that is in political opposition to the president and it seems to me as a foreigner, that this is nothing more than a political vendetta. Arum hailed Pacquiao s showdown with Rios in Macau, a province of China, as a triumph and said he is planning another event with three former Olympic gold medalists in February. Along with the emergence of fighters from Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as the traditional boxing heartlands of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, Arum pointed to Asia as having huge potential. Is Asia an up and coming market for everything Of course it is, he said. There s 1.3 billion people in China, there s fans all over Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia. There s tremendous interest in boxing and we expect to do many events in the years to come in Asia. There will be a lot of talent in Asian fighters just as there are so many great fighters now coming out of Eastern Europe, from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Boxing is a world wide sport and our best fighters and champions are coming from all over. I m very, very excited as far as the future of boxing is concerned.
Cape Town, South Africa CNN It was supposed to be an ordinary night out with friends for 20 year old Zukiswa Gaca but it ended with her lying on a railway track attempting to take her own life. Gaca was at a bar, drinking with friends in Khayelitsha township, less than 40 kilometers outside Cape Town, South Africa, when a man tried to ask her out. I told the guy that no I m a lesbian so I don t date guys and then he said to me, no I understand. I ve got friends that are lesbians, that s cool, I don t have a problem with that. Gaca says he was nice and she trusted him, and they left the bar to go to the home of one of his friends, and that is where his friendly exterior turned nasty. He said to me, you know what I hate lesbians and I m about to show you that you are not a man, as you are treating yourself like a man, she told CNN. I tried to explain I m not a man. I never said I m a man, I m just a lesbian . And he said, I will show you that I am a man and I have more power than you. Then he raped her, she says, as his friend watched. Gaca said Afterwards I went to the railway train road, because I was suicidal at the time. I was lying on the tracks. I think the train was 100 meters away from where I was. Then some other guy came and grabbed me. The train passed. He called the police. It is called corrective rape where men force themselves on lesbians, believing it will change their sexual orientation. The extent of the problem is hard to know as South African police do not compile corrective rape statistics separately from other rape cases. But human rights groups in the country where gay rights are constitutionally protected are outraged.
Cherith Sanger, of the Women s Legal Centre in Cape Town, which provides legal support for rape victims who cannot afford good lawyers, said We believe that corrective rape warrants greater recognition on the basis that there are multiple grounds of discrimination. It s not just about a woman being raped in terms of violence against women, which is bad enough, but it s also got to do with sexual orientation so it s another ground or level of unfair discrimination leveled against lesbians. It was not the first time Gaca had been raped. She says she ran away from her home village, in the rural Eastern Cape, after the first rape when she was 15 years old and too afraid to press charges. She says running was easier than dealing with a community that didn t accept lesbians. She moved to Khayelitsha Township, a sprawling shanty town near Cape Town, Africa s gay capital where she hoped to find tolerance. Instead, she was confronted by more hate. Being a lesbian in Khayelitsha is like you are being treated like an animal, like some kind of an alien or something, she said. While there are no official statistics on corrective rape, there have been enough publicly reported incidents to spark widespread alarm. This time Gaca is fighting back. New York based Human Rights Watch recently conducted interviews in six of South Africa s nine provinces and concluded Social attitudes towards homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people in South Africa have possibly hardened over the last two decades. The abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal, physical, or sexual and may even result in murder. The group added This is a far cry from the promise of equality and non discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation contained in the country s constitution. Most known victims, like Gaca, are poor and black and so are the perpetrators, prompting many to ask how a people who fought against discrimination during apartheid can today treat some of its most vulnerable in such a violent manner.
Siphokazi Mthathi, South African director at Human Rights Watch, said We ve failed to make it understood that there is a price for rape. Sexism is still deeply embedded here. There is still a strong sense among men that they have power over women, women s bodies and there s also a strong sense that there s not going to be consequences because most often there are no consequences. Interpol estimates that half of South African women will be raped in their lifetime. But corrective rape is not even recognized as a hate crime and rights groups say few victims report their cases to the police. But Gaca did. In many African countries being gay is illegal. In South Africa, those entrusted with enforcing the country s tolerant laws now stand accused of re traumatizing victims. When a woman is raped she is re raped by the system and for me this is a big thing because it s a serious violation of our constitution and the duties that are placed on the state in terms of what the state needs to do for survivors, Sanger said. CNN saw the treatment meted out to survivors firsthand with Gaca as she trekked from police station to police station trying to first find, and then get answers from, her investigating officer. He was the third assigned to her case since she reported the attack in December 2009 and she eventually found him at the sexual offences unit in Bellville, a 30 minute drive from her home. Despite the sensitive nature of her case, he met her in the wide, open office. When Gaca asked why the police had failed to interview her alleged attacker s friend, who witnessed the rape, another officer in the room told her I never take a statement from a suspect s friend. He added The suspect s friend is obviously going to say you are in a relationship with the suspect or that he didn t see anything. The only statements that are important here are the ones from your friend, a neutral person or a neighbor.
Not someone who was there watching while you were being damaged and he wasn t helping. CNN requested an interview with the investigator and was referred to his superiors, before being granted an interview with South Africa s Minister of Police, Nathi Mthethwa, who promised an investigation. I feel bad, the minister said. I feel bad about all these things. That is why I m saying people who are responsible have a case to answer. No action has so far been taken against the police officers who not only treated Gaca with disdain but who she also had to push every step of the way to do their job. When they let her alleged attacker go without taking DNA evidence, potentially crucial in proving his guilt, it was Gaca who insisted they re arrest him. After neglecting to question the eyewitness who was allegedly there throughout the incident, it was Gaca who forced the police to talk with him. She says she sat in a car while they questioned him, as he leaned in through an open window to tell the police officer what he saw of the assault, forcing Gaca to once again relive the experience. South Africa s Victims Charter was drafted in 2004, granting seven fundamental rights to every victim of crime. Among them is the right to be treated with fairness and with respect to your dignity and privacy. Gaca says these rights are ideals she has never experienced. Yet she s determined to press on. She said They always get away with it. I m just pushing so that there will be a different story on my case. Maybe if this guy could be sentenced or something happens to him I think a lot of my friends will report their cases because some of the lesbians, they don t report their cases, they don t go to the police station because they know that it will just be a waste of time. Nearly two years after reporting her case, Gaca is still awaiting her day in court, still hoping for justice, and still fighting.
