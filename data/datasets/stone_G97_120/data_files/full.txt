Chapter 97
Lin Daiyu Burns Her Manuscripts, Severing Her Foolish Love;
Xue Baochai Emerges from Her Boudoir for a Grand Marriage Ceremony

It happened that when Daiyu reached the gate of the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, a word from Zizhuan struck her heart so deeply that she suddenly began to vomit blood and nearly fainted. Fortunately, Zizhuan and Qiuyun quickly supported her and carried her inside. Just then, with Qiuyun having gone off, Zizhuan and Xueyan kept vigil over her. When Daiyu gradually regained consciousness, Xueyan asked Zizhuan, “Why are you crying while keeping watch?”
Seeing that he could speak clearly now, Zizhuan relaxed a little and explained, “Miss, when you returned from the old lady’s place, you felt unwell, and that frightened us so much that we couldn’t think of what to do, so we began to cry.”
Daiyu smiled faintly and said, “I could never die so easily…” Before she could finish, she began to gasp again. In truth, the news about Baoyu and Baochai that day—long a torment of his heart—had driven her into a sudden fit of anger and confusion. On her return, after spitting out that mouthful of blood, her mind had gradually cleared, and she could recall nothing of what had passed in her troubled mind. At that moment, seeing Zizhuan weeping, she vaguely recalled what “Silly Big Sister” had said earlier. But now, rather than feeling sorrow, she wished only for a swift death to end her debts.

Zizhuan and Xueyan could do nothing but remain at her side, wanting to alert someone but fearing that it might, as before, provoke Fengjie’s wrath for causing a fuss. Meanwhile, Qiuyun returned in a flurry, and just then Jia Mu, awakened from his afternoon nap, came out to see what was amiss. Seeing the scene, he asked, “What has happened?” Qiuyun, frightened, recounted the events in haste.

Jia Mu was horrified and exclaimed, “This is intolerable!” He immediately summoned Madam Wang and Fengjie, and together they briefed the two mother-in-laws. Fengjie said, “I did warn you—what sort of person has let this rumor spread? Isn’t this making matters even more difficult?”

Jia Mu replied, “Never mind those details; first let us see what condition she is in.” Rising, he led Madam Wang, Fengjie, and others to inspect her. They found Daiyu’s face as pale as snow, devoid of color, her spirit languid and breath shallow. After a short while she began coughing violently; a maid brought her a spittoon, and she expectorated thick phlegm streaked with blood, causing everyone to panic.

Daiyu slowly opened her eyes and, upon seeing Jia Mu beside her, managed to gasp, “Grandmother! You’ve cared for me in vain…”
Hearing these words, Jia Mu was stricken with sorrow and said, “My dear child, just endure; do not be afraid.” Daiyu offered a faint smile and closed her eyes again.

Shortly afterward, a maid came in to report to Fengjie, “The physician has arrived.” Everyone quickly made room. Dr. Wang, accompanied by Jia Lian, entered and took her pulse. After a brief examination, he said, “It’s not serious—this is stagnation of qi injuring the liver. When the liver cannot store blood, one’s spirit is affected. We must use medicine to arrest the loss of yin and stop the bleeding, and there is hope.” With that, he left with Jia Lian to prepare the prescriptions and fetch the medicine.

Seeing that Daiyu’s condition was precarious, Jia Mu went out to confide in Fengjie and the others, “I fear this child’s illness is incurable—not because I have cursed her, but because it is a malady of the heart. You must prepare to do everything possible to buoy her up; if by some chance she recovers, it will spare us much trouble. Even if she does not, we cannot be caught unprepared. Our household has pressing matters these days.” Fengjie readily agreed. Jia Mu then inquired of Zizhuan once more about who had spoken earlier, but no one knew for sure. Only a lingering doubt remained in his heart. He said, “Children who have played together from a young age naturally understand one another. Now that they are older, it is proper for a girl to keep some reserve. I love her dearly; if her heart turns elsewhere and she becomes attached to another, it would be as though I had cared for her in vain. Tell me truly—what did you hear?”

After Xiren recounted, as she had earlier told Madam Wang, Jia Mu lamented, “I thought she was not yet confused. I cannot fathom this. In a respectable household like ours, nothing untoward should occur, and yet this heartache persists. If Lin Guniang were not burdened with this affliction, I could spend any amount of money to remedy it. But as it is, not only does her illness defy treatment, I am at a loss in my heart.”

Fengjie interjected, “There is no need to fuss over Lin Sister. Your elder son visits the doctor daily—what matters more are the affairs on your sister’s side. This morning, I heard that the new house is nearly ready. Madam, when you and the old lady go over there, we might as well have a word with your sister-in-law. Perhaps we should invite her over tonight so that we can settle matters in one go—it will all be easier that way.”

Both Jia Mu and Madam Wang agreed, saying, “That sounds good. It is late now; after tomorrow’s meal, we shall go over.” With that, they broke for dinner, and Fengjie and Madam Wang each retired to their rooms without further mention.

The next day, after breakfast, Fengjie went in to test Baoyu’s state. Entering the room, she announced, “Second Master, rejoice! The old master has chosen an auspicious date for your marriage. Do you like it?”
Baoyu merely grinned at Fengjie and nodded ever so slightly.
Fengjie continued, “They have decided to have you wed Lin Guniang. How does that sound?”
Baoyu burst into hearty laughter. Not sure whether he understood or was simply in his confused state, Fengjie pressed further, “The old master has decreed that once you recover, you shall be married to Lin Guniang. But if you remain in this muddled state, then no marriage shall be arranged for you.”
Suddenly, Baoyu grew serious and declared, “I am not confused—you are the one who is!” Rising, he announced, “I must go see Lin Guniang so that she may be assured.”
Fengjie hurriedly tried to restrain him, saying, “Lin Guniang already knows everything. Now that she is to become your new bride, she will naturally be shy and not wish to see you.”
Baoyu retorted, “But once she is wed, will she still not see me?”
Fengjie, laughing yet anxious, thought, Xiren was right—though he utters mad words about Lin Guniang, deep down he understands. If he truly comprehends, and if he were to shatter this farce, then the drought of fortune will be even greater. She forced a laugh and said, “You will see her properly; if you continue acting foolishly, she will refuse to meet you.”
Baoyu said, “I have already entrusted my heart to Lin Guniang. When she comes, it will be as though she dwells within me.”
Fengjie, hearing his mad words, went to see Jia Mu with a smile. Jia Mu himself smiled and said, “I have heard of it before. For now, let us not worry; have Xiren see to it that she comforts him, and then we may proceed.”

Later that evening, Madam Wang also came. The party then went to see Aunt Xue. They explained, “We are all deeply concerned here.” Aunt Xue, grateful, spoke of Xue Pan and other matters. After tea, she intended to send word to Baochai, but Fengjie quickly intercepted, saying, “Aunt, there is no need to inform Miss Baochai.” Then she added to Aunt Xue with a smile, “The old lady has come over not only to see you but also with some important news; please join us in discussion.”
Aunt Xue nodded, “Very well.” The conversation drifted to trivial matters, and soon they departed. That very night, Aunt Xue came over, met with Jia Mu, and later went into Madam Wang’s room; she could not help but mention the matter of Prince Wang Teng, and tears were shed. Aunt Xue then asked, “I went to see the old lady earlier—Baoyu came out to greet her, albeit rather thin; why have you spoken so harshly?”
Fengjie replied, “It is not so much his fault as the old lady’s deep worry. Now that our father is about to leave on his assignment for an unknown number of years, the old lady’s wish is twofold: first, she wishes to see our son married so that she may rest assured; and second, she hopes to appease his spirit with a good match—using Miss Bao’s golden lock to ward off evil. She believes that will be sufficient.” Aunt Xue was pleased but worried for Baochai’s feelings, saying, “That is acceptable—provided we plan carefully.”
Madam Wang then, following Fengjie’s account, said, “Since the second mistress’s household has no one here at present, why not waive the customary bridal trappings? Tomorrow, send Ke’er to inform Pan’er; we shall have a small ceremony and then settle the official matters.” Without mentioning Baoyu’s inner state further, she added, “Once the second mistress is married, everything will be in order, and everyone will be relieved.”
At that moment, Jia Mu signaled for Yuanyang with a message. Aunt Xue, though worried that Baochai might feel slighted, had little choice and promised wholeheartedly. Yuanyang then returned to Jia Mu, who earnestly called Yuanyang once more, requesting that Aunt Xue and Baochai be spared any indignity. Aunt Xue agreed, and soon Fengjie was appointed as the matchmaker. After all the arrangements were made, Madam Wang and the other ladies chatted deep into the night.

The next day, Aunt Xue went home and explained every detail to Baochai, “I have already given my consent.” Baochai at first looked down in silence, but soon tears began to stream down his face. Aunt Xue consoled him in gentle words, explaining many things. Baochai then retired to his room, and Baoqin went with him to ease his sorrow. Aunt Xue also informed Xue Ke, instructing him, “Tomorrow, go and inquire into the details and send word to your brother. You should return at once.”

Xue Ke was gone for four days before returning to report to Aunt Xue, “Regarding our brother’s matter, the authorities have now pardoned the unintentional killing. Once the court session begins, he is to be recorded, and we must prepare the silver for atonement. As for your sister’s matter, they said: ‘Mother has decided well. In hastening the arrangements we have saved much silver. Let mother proceed as she wishes.’”
Aunt Xue, hearing this, felt relieved on two counts—Xue Pan could now return home, and Baochai’s matter was settled. Yet, noticing that Baochai seemed unwilling, she reasoned, “After all, he is a proper young lady, modest and respectful; knowing I have given my consent, she cannot complain.” She then instructed Xue Ke, “Prepare the gold seal papers, fill in the eight characters, and send them to Jia Lian. Also, inquire about the wedding date so you may prepare accordingly. Originally, we did not wish to disturb our relatives—your friend, as you said, is nothing but a scoundrel; as for our kin, only the Jia and Wang families remain. Now that the Jia family is all men and there is no one from the Wang family in the capital, and since Sister Shi’s matter has been settled without any invitations from their side, there is no need to notify anyone. Instead, invite Zhang Dehui to look after matters—being older, he will understand.”
Xue Ke accepted the orders and saw to it that the papers were sent forth.

The next day, Jia Lian came to see Aunt Xue and paid his respects. He said, “Tomorrow is a propitious day. Today, after you return, we shall see the second mistress, and that will mark the beginning of the wedding festivities. We only hope that the second mistress will not be too particular.” He then presented the official document. Aunt Xue modestly replied with assent. Jia Lian hurried back and reported to Jia Zheng, who then said, “Tell the old lady that we will keep the matter secret from our relatives and simplify all the proceedings. If there is any issue with the dowry, the old lady will see it and need not inform me.”
Jia Lian agreed and went in to report to Jia Mu. Meanwhile, Madam Wang ordered Fengjie to have all the wedding items presented to Jia Mu for inspection and asked Xiren to inform Baoyu.

Baoyu, believing everything to be true, felt great joy and his spirits lifted, though his speech remained somewhat foolish. The documents that came in contained no names, so although all the servants knew the truth, Fengjie’s orders prevented anyone from revealing it.

Meanwhile, although Daiyu was taking her medicine, her condition worsened day by day. Zizhuan and the others earnestly pleaded with her, “Now that matters have reached this point, there is no more hiding. We all know your secret heart. As for any unforeseen accident, there will be none. Miss, if you look at Baoyu’s condition—this grave illness—how can you possibly get married? Do not heed such idle talk; take care of yourself.”
Daiyu managed a weak smile, saying nothing further, then coughed repeatedly, spitting out more blood. Zizhuan and the others, seeing that she was barely clinging to life, realized that no amount of coaxing would help and could only weep as they kept vigil. Every day they went in three or four times to update Jia Mu; yet Yuanyang reported that Jia Mu’s concern for Daiyu had lessened compared to before, so few inquiries were made. In recent days, Jia Mu’s attention had been entirely on Baochai and Baoyu, and Daiyu’s condition was scarcely mentioned—only that the physicians were treating her.

Daiyu, who had long been ill, had always received visits from everyone—from Jia Mu down to the maids—but now, not a single person came to see her. When she opened her eyes, only Zizhuan was by her side. Feeling that there was no hope of recovery, she struggled to speak to Zizhuan, “Sister, you are the one who understands me best. Though the old lady has ordered you to attend to me, these past years I have come to think of you as my own sister.” But she could hardly get the words out. Hearing this, Zizhuan’s heart ached, and soon she burst into tears, unable to speak clearly. After a long moment, Daiyu, still panting, said, “Sister Zizhuan, I cannot remain lying down like this. Please help me sit up for a while.”
Zizhuan replied, “Miss, you are so weak—if you try to sit up, you might collapse.”
Daiyu, hearing this, closed her eyes and fell silent; after a while she attempted to rise again. With no other option, Zizhuan and Xueyan helped her up, propping her gently with soft pillows while they themselves leaned by her side. Daiyu could not sit comfortably; her lower body ached unbearably, and she clutched at it in pain. She called out, “Bring me my book of poems…” and gasped for breath.
Xueyan, suspecting it was the manuscript she had tidied up the previous day, fetched it and brought it to Daiyu. Daiyu nodded faintly and then raised her eyes to look at the box that held it. Xueyan, puzzled, stared for a moment. Suddenly, Daiyu’s eyes fixed in a fierce glare; she began coughing violently and spat out another mouthful of blood. Xueyan quickly went to fetch water. Daiyu rinsed her mouth and expectorated into a bowl. Zizhuan dabbed her mouth with a silk kerchief, and then Daiyu, taking the kerchief in trembling hands, pointed at the box and murmured, “It has words on it…”
Realizing she desired the old kerchief on which she once wrote poems, Zizhuan called for Xueyan to fetch it. After retrieving it and handing it to Daiyu, Zizhuan gently urged, “Miss, please rest—why strain yourself? Wait until you feel better before reading it.”
But Daiyu, after receiving it, could not bring herself to examine it. With trembling hands, she tried to tear the kerchief, though her feeble strength made little progress. Zizhuan, already aware that Daiyu resented Baoyu deeply, dared not speak the truth and only said, “Miss, why must you let anger take hold?”
Daiyu only gave a slight nod, then tucked the kerchief into her sleeve. She called for someone to light a lamp.
Xueyan immediately lit a lamp. Daiyu looked at it for a moment, then closed her eyes to sit quietly. After a while, she said, “Place the brazier over the fire.”
Noticing that Daiyu felt cold, Zizhuan suggested, “Miss, lie down and cover yourself with an extra blanket; the cold from the coals may worsen you.”
Daiyu shook her head. Xueyan then covered her with a woven silk cloth on a brazier stand. Daiyu nodded as if to indicate she wanted to be moved onto the kang (heated platform). Xueyan carried her over, fetching the brazier table. Daiyu tried to lift her body, and Zizhuan had to support her with both hands. Finally, Daiyu took the kerchief from her sleeve, stared at the fire, nodded slightly, and then threw it onto the flame.
Zizhuan jumped in alarm, and as she moved to seize it, she hesitated, her hands frozen. Xueyan went out again to fetch the brazier table; by that time the kerchief was already alight. Zizhuan pleaded, “Miss, what are you doing?” But Daiyu ignored her, turned, and retrieved her manuscript, setting it near the fire. Zizhuan, fearful that Daiyu might burn everything, tried in vain to snatch it away—but Daiyu, with trembling determination, clutched it and threw it onto the flames. Soon, the paper caught fire and, within moments, was reduced to ashes as Xueyan desperately tried to rescue it. Daiyu closed her eyes and leaned back; she almost toppled over Zizhuan’s outstretched arms, but Zizhuan quickly called for Xueyan to help lay her down. Her heart pounded wildly as she wanted to summon help, yet it was too late in the evening; and if she called out, she feared further trouble. Thus, they endured the long, agonizing night.

At dawn the next day, Daiyu gradually regained a modicum of strength. After breakfast, she suddenly began coughing and vomiting, her condition worsening. Alarmed, Zizhuan summoned Xueyan and the others to keep watch, while she herself went to report to Jia Mu. Yet when she arrived at Jia Mu’s upper chamber, it was silent—only a few elderly maids and some laboring servants were there.
“Where is the old lady?” Zizhuan inquired.
They all replied, “No one knows.”
Startled by this response, Zizhuan went to Baoyu’s room to look, but found it empty. Asking the maids there also yielded nothing. Zizhuan, realizing things were becoming heartlessly callous, thought bitterly, “How can our people be so cruel and indifferent?” She remembered that no one had inquired about Daiyu these past days, and her heart sank further with sorrow and anger. Unable to bear it, she resolved to see for herself what form Baoyu now took. “Let’s see what he’s like,” she thought as she left, vowing, “If he dies tomorrow, you’ll be spared—not that you can hide away! Once you’ve enjoyed your selfish ways, how will you face me?” She wept bitterly as she returned.

Before reaching the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, she saw two little maids peeking out. One cried out, “Is that not Sister Zizhuan coming?” Alarmed, Zizhuan hastily waved them to silence and went inside. There she found Daiyu, flushed with anger—her cheeks red and her expression fierce. Sensing that something was amiss, Zizhuan called for Daiyu’s wet nurse, Lady Wang. When she arrived and saw Daiyu, she burst into uncontrollable sobs.

Zizhuan, relying on Lady Wang’s authority despite her indecision, felt her heart tumultuously. Suddenly, she remembered someone and immediately sent a maid to fetch him. Who could it be? Zizhuan recalled that Li Gongcai, now a widow, would naturally avoid such matters on the day of Baoyu’s marriage, especially as all affairs in the garden were being managed by Li Wan. So she sent someone to call him.

At that moment, Li Wan was busy revising a poem for Jia Lan. When a maid came in saying, “Grand Aunt, I fear Miss Lin is gravely ill—everyone is crying,” Li Wan was startled and quickly got up to leave. Suyun and Biyue followed, half walking and half weeping, lamenting, “Our sisters have suffered so much—and with his gentle looks and refined talent, truly only Qing and Su can compare. To think that at such a young age, he has become a bride of the north; yet Fengjie has devised a cunning plan, and even though she could not escape the Xiaoxiang Pavilion entirely, she has not been able to alleviate our sisterly sorrow. How pitiful and lamentable!”

Lost in thought, they reached the door of the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Inside, it was deathly silent. Li Wan, anxious, murmured, “Surely she must have already passed away? Has anyone prepared her funeral shrouds and bedding?” Hastily, she strode inside. At the inner door, a little maid announced, “Grand Aunt has arrived.”

Zizhuan quickly went out with Li Wan, meeting outside. Li Zhi then asked, “What is the matter?” Zizhuan tried to speak, but only a choked sound emerged from her throat as tears flowed like broken pearls. She raised a trembling hand and pointed at Daiyu.

Li Wan, seeing Zizhuan’s condition, felt profound sorrow and hurried over. Daiyu could barely speak when Li Wan softly called her twice. Daiyu’s eyes fluttered open ever so slightly, as if she understood, but her eyelids and lips barely moved; though a feeble breath came and went, not a word could form, nor a single tear be shed.

Turning around and noticing that Zizhuan was no longer in sight, Li Wan called out to Xueyan. Xueyan replied, “She is lying on the spare bed outside.”

Li Wan quickly went out and found Zizhuan lying on a bed in the outer chamber, her face sallow and her eyes closed, with tears soaking a richly embroidered quilt to the size of a bowl. Li Wan hurriedly called to her, and Zizhuan slowly opened her eyes and attempted to sit up. Li Wan chided, “You silly girl, why do you keep crying? Why haven’t you changed Miss Lin’s bedding? Do you expect her, as a proper young lady, to remain bare and exposed?”
Hearing this, Zizhuan broke into uncontrollable sobs. Li Zhi also wept as he anxiously patted Zizhuan’s shoulder, “Good child, you are breaking my heart with your tears! Hurry and tidy up her things; if we delay any longer, it will be disastrous!”

Just then, someone rushed in in a panic, startling Li Wan. It turned out to be Ping’er, who, upon seeing the scene, stood dumbfounded. Li Wan asked, “What were you doing over there?” as Lin Zhixiao’s attendant entered as well.

Ping’er explained, “Grandmother was anxious and sent me to see what was happening. Even though Grand Aunt is here, our old lady only cares about one thing now.” Li Wan nodded. Ping’er then said, “I also wish to see Miss Lin.” As she walked in, tears already streaming down her face, Li Wan urged, “You must go out and see; then inform the steward to prepare Miss Lin’s final arrangements. Once it is all settled, have him report back to me; there is no need to go there yourself.”

Lin Zhixiao’s attendant agreed and stood by. Li Wan asked, “Is there anything more to say?”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant replied, “Earlier, the second mistress and the old lady discussed; over there, they are having Zizhuan serve them.”
Before Li Wan could reply, Zizhuan said, “Aunt Lin, please come in first! When someone dies, we naturally go out—but why must we…” She hesitated and then rephrased, “Besides, while we are here tending to the patient, our clothes are not clean. Miss Lin still has some strength left; she keeps calling out to me.”
In response, Li Wan explained, “Truly, Miss Lin and this maid are bound by fate from a previous life. It is only that Xueyan was brought from the south; she pays him no heed, but Zizhuan—oh, I think the two cannot part for the moment.”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant, upon hearing Zizhuan’s words, felt somewhat indignant, but Li Wan’s remarks left him with nothing further to say. Observing Zizhuan’s tearful state, he managed only a slight smile and said, “Zizhuan, your idle chatter matters little—but how am I to explain this to the old lady? Moreover, did you not inform the second mistress?”
Before he could finish, Ping’er, wiping her tears, came out and asked, “What did you tell the second mistress?”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant repeated the earlier conversation. Ping’er lowered her head and said, “Very well then—let us send Sister Xue away.”
Li Wan asked, “Can Xue do it?”
Ping’er whispered a few words to Li Wan, who nodded and said, “Then send Xueyan over; it is as good as sending her.”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant asked Ping’er, “Is Xueyan capable?”
Ping’er replied, “She is; it is all the same.”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant said, “Then, Miss, please come quickly with me. I will first return to the old lady and the second mistress. This was decided by Grand Aunt and Miss Lin; once I return, each of you shall report back to the second mistress.”
Li Wan said, “Very good—you, even at your age, do not neglect even the smallest matters.”
Lin Zhixiao’s attendant laughed, “It is not that we neglect: firstly, this matter—between the old lady and the second mistress—is too obscure for us to fully understand; moreover, there is also Grand Aunt and Miss Lin.”
Just then, Ping’er had called Xueyan out. It turned out that Xueyan, lately chided by Daiyu for being “childish,” had grown sullen and dared not refuse the orders from the old lady and the second mistress. She quickly tidied herself. Ping’er told her to change into fresh clothes and follow Lin Zhixiao’s attendant. Soon, Ping’er and Li Wan spoke a few more words. Li Wan then urged Ping’er to hasten Lin Zhixiao’s attendant so that her husband might handle the matter quickly.
Ping’er agreed, and turning a corner, she saw Lin Zhixiao’s attendant leading Xueyan ahead. She called out, “I’ll take her in; you first inform Uncle Lin to prepare Miss Lin’s things. I will report back to Grand Aunt for you.” Lin Zhixiao’s attendant nodded and departed.

Meanwhile, Xueyan, witnessing all this, recalled her own lost sweetheart and felt sorrow. Yet in front of Jia Mu and Fengjie, she dared not reveal it. She thought, “Baoyu’s home was once sweet as honey, but now he never appears. Is it genuine illness or feigned madness? Perhaps he fears that if word of the lost jade spreads, and if he is forced to feign foolishness, his heart may harden—thus, he might even purposefully act the fool. I shall watch him, see whether he continues to act foolishly. Does he still pretend to be daft today?” Lost in these thoughts, she crept up to the door of an inner room to secretly observe. At that moment, though Baoyu was still in a muddled state from the loss of his jade, he had heard that Lin Daiyu was now his wife—a notion that, from ancient times to the present, was the most delightful and satisfying affair. Suddenly, his body seemed to regain vigor, though not as perceptive as before. Fengjie’s ingenious plan had struck true. He was eager to see Daiyu; indeed, he longed for the marriage to be consummated that very day, and danced with joy—though he uttered a few foolish words, they were a far cry from the incoherent state he had been in during his illness.

Xueyan, witnessing this, felt both anger and sorrow—she knew nothing of Baoyu’s inner thoughts, and as they parted, each went their separate way.

Meanwhile, Baoyu called for Xiren to help dress him anew and sat in Madam Wang’s room. Observing Fengjie and You Shi bustling about, and with the auspicious moment not yet arrived, he asked Xiren, “Why hasn’t Miss Lin come to the garden yet?”
Xiren stifled a laugh and replied, “She is waiting for the right time.” Soon, she overheard Fengjie and Madam Wang discussing, “Even though the bride has her trappings ready, there’s no need for music outside—the custom requires a proper wedding ceremony, not a cold and barren affair. I have summoned the ladies who are skilled in music and drama to play and liven the atmosphere.”
Madam Wang nodded, “That will do.”

Before long, a magnificent sedan chair entered through the main gate. Delicate music and festive cheer greeted its arrival, and twelve pairs of imperial lanterns were arranged in order—a display both fresh and refined. The herald invited the newlyweds out from the sedan; as Baoyu looked on, he saw Xi, the bride, adorned in red and veiled, being assisted down. And who was to support the bride? It turned out to be none other than Xueyan.

Baoyu, upon seeing Xueyan, thought, “Why is it that Zizhuan does not come? It is Xueyan, after all!” He then reasoned, “Yes, Xueyan was brought from our southern family, while Zizhuan is our own; naturally, she need not come along.” In that moment, upon seeing Xueyan, he felt a joy reminiscent of seeing Daiyu.

The herald proceeded with the ceremony, bowing to heaven and earth, inviting Jia Mu to come forward for four formal bows, then summoning Jia Zheng, his wife, and others to ascend the hall. Once all the rites were performed, the couple was escorted into the bridal chamber. The remainder of the wedding customs followed the old practices of the household—no further details are necessary. Jia Zheng, having acted on behalf of Jia Mu, dared not oppose the notion of “restorative marriage” (marriage as a cure), and was pleased to see Baoyu appearing as a good man.

After the newlyweds took their seats in the bridal chamber, it came time for the unveiling of the bride. Fengjie, having long been cautious, had already arranged for Jia Mu and Madam Wang to be present to attend to matters. In his muddled state, Baoyu approached the bride and said, “Sister, are you well? You haven’t been seen for so many days—why are you wearing such a covering?” Just as he moved to lift the veil, he startled Madam Wang so that she broke into a cold sweat.

Baoyu then reconsidered, “Lin Guniang is prone to anger; I must not be rash.” After pausing, he could no longer contain himself and advanced to lift the veil. The bride’s attendant quickly took over, and Xueyan stepped aside while Ying’er came forward to attend. Baoyu opened his eyes and saw what appeared to be Baochai. Dismissing his disbelief, he held a lamp in one hand and wiped his eyes with the other—sure enough, wasn’t it Baochai? She was resplendently made up, with graceful shoulders, a soft figure, her hair neatly styled and falling in gentle waves; her eyes, though demure, shone like dew on lotus powder—a vision of tender beauty.

For a moment Baoyu was stunned, and then noticed Ying’er standing aside as Xueyan disappeared. In his confused state, he fancied it all a dream and stood dumbfounded. The assembled guests helped him sit down; all fell silent. Fearing that his illness might relapse, Jia Mu himself came to urge him. Fengjie and You Shi ushered Baochai into the inner chamber. Baochai, for her part, remained silent and bowed her head.

After a while, Baoyu gathered himself. Seeing Jia Mu and Madam Wang seated nearby, he softly called to Xiren, “Where am I? Is this not a dream?”
Xiren replied, “Today is your lucky day—speak not of dreams! Father is waiting outside.”
Baoyu, in a low voice, pointed with his finger, “Who is that beautiful lady sitting over there?”
Xiren, covering her mouth to stifle a laugh, finally said after a long pause, “That is your new second mistress.”
Everyone turned and could not help but laugh. Baoyu then said, “How foolish! You say ‘second mistress’—but who exactly is she?”
Xiren replied, “It is Miss Bao.”
Baoyu then asked, “And Lin Guniang?”
Xiren replied, “Father has decreed that you marry Miss Bao. How can we mix in Lin Guniang?”
Baoyu retorted, “Did I not just see Lin Guniang? And what about Xueyan—did I not see her?”
“—What are you all doing?” he mumbled in confusion.
Fengjie stepped forward and gently admonished, “Baoyu, Miss Bao is seated inside; do not speak out of turn. You would surely offend her, and the old lady would not allow it.”
Baoyu, now more muddled than ever, found himself further confused. Already weakened by illness and now beset by these ghostly apparitions of his thoughts, he clamored repeatedly that he must seek out Lin Guniang. Jia Mu and the others tried to comfort him, but he did not understand. With Baochai present, none dared speak openly. A hush fell as incense was lit to calm his spirit, and he was gently helped to sleep. In the silence that followed, he sank into a deep slumber, and only then did Jia Mu and the rest feel a measure of relief. Fengjie was sent to call Baochai to rest as well, and Baochai, unresponsive, changed her attire and retired with no further word.

Outside, Jia Zheng—unaware of the inner turmoil—reflected on what he had witnessed, and his heart lightened a bit. The next day was the auspicious day for his departure. After a brief rest, the family gathered to bid him farewell. When Jia Mu saw that Baoyu had fallen asleep, he too returned to his room to rest.

Early the following morning, Jia Zheng bade farewell to the ancestral hall and came to see Jia Mu, saying, “Though I am leaving far away, I beg you, old mother, take good care of yourself. When I reach my post I will send a memorial—do not worry. As for Baoyu, his affairs have been settled in accordance with the old lady’s wishes; I only ask that you instruct him wisely.”

Fearing for Jia Zheng’s peace of mind on the journey, Jia Mu did not mention Baoyu’s renewed illness. He said only, “I have one request: Last night, Baoyu’s marriage was completed in form only—not consummated. Today, when you depart, be sure to have him see you off properly. But since he is ill and already exhausted from yesterday’s labors, he might catch a chill if he goes out. Tell him immediately to see you; if you truly care for him, have him come and kowtow before you.”

Jia Zheng replied, “And what is there to do about that? As long as he studies diligently from now on, I would be overjoyed.”

Jia Mu, relieved, then called for Jia Zheng to sit while summoning Yuanyang and others. Not long after, Jia Zheng’s order was carried out and Baoyu was brought in to perform his bow. By then, though still in a confused state, Baoyu’s mind had cleared somewhat at the sight of his father, and everything seemed acceptable.

Jia Zheng gave a few instructions, to which Baoyu agreed. Then Jia Zheng had him carried away, and he himself returned to Madam Wang’s room. There he earnestly instructed Madam Wang, “Do not let him be as spoiled as before. Next year, for the provincial examination, you must ensure that he faces the world properly.”

Madam Wang, listening intently, immediately ordered that Baochai be brought in so that the newlywed rites might be performed according to tradition. The remaining family members saw them off at the secondary gate. Jia Zhen and the others also received a stern lecture. Everyone toasted with wine as they accompanied him to a long pavilion ten li away for the parting ceremony.

Thus, there is no more to say about Jia Zheng’s departure. Now, after returning, Baoyu’s old illness suddenly flared up again. His mind sank further into confusion, and he could no longer eat or drink. What fate awaits him? We shall have to wait for the next installment.
Chapter 98
The Sorrow of the Crimson Pearl: Its Soul Returns to the Heavens of Parting, While the Tearful Illness of Ying Brings Sorrow to the Land of Longing

When Baoyu returned to his room after meeting Jia Zheng, he felt even more heady and dazed. His mind was clouded, his limbs heavy and unwilling to move, and he didn’t even eat his meal before he sank into a deep, troubled sleep. Day after day, physicians were summoned to treat him, yet no remedy proved effective. In his state he could no longer recognize even those around him, though when others helped him sit up he still appeared like his former self. This disarray continued for several days.

That very day was the deadline for “Returning Nine” (a traditional time when a person in mourning is expected to resume social life). If Baoyu did not recover and rejoin the world, Aunt Xue’s honor would be at stake; yet if he did recover, it was widely known that his condition was born of his love for Daiyu—a truth he was desperate to communicate, though he feared that too much agitation might bring about further changes. Moreover, Baochai—now his new bride—was difficult to console; it was hoped that only when Aunt Xue herself came would she be comforted. If Baoyu failed to resume his proper duties by the Returning Nine, Aunt Xue would surely scold him. Thus, after consulting with Madam Wang and Fengjie, they decided: “Look, Baoyu’s spirit is wandering so that if we set him in a small sedan chair and help him out of the garden on the auspicious day of Returning Nine, then later, when Aunt Xue comes to comfort Baochai, we can attend to Baoyu with a single, unified plan.”
Madam Wang agreed, and preparations were made immediately. Fortunately, with Baochai now a new bride and Baoyu reduced to a mad, bewildered state, he was literally wheeled away by servants. Baochai, understanding the situation, silently reproached her mother for the muddle, but said no more. Only Aunt Xue, upon seeing Baoyu’s condition, was stricken with regret—and the matter was concluded in a rather hasty manner.

Back at home, Baoyu’s condition grew ever heavier. The next day he was so weak he could scarcely sit up; day by day his strength waned until even nourishing soup refused to go down. Aunt Xue and others frantically summoned well-known physicians from everywhere, yet none could determine the source of his malady. Finally, a poor doctor named Bi from a dilapidated temple on the outskirts was found. He diagnosed Baoyu’s illness as one of extreme emotional distress—a condition of overwhelmed sorrow and joy, a disruption of the body’s internal warmth and cold, disturbed appetite, and an accumulation of repressed grief that had blocked the vital qi. In short, it was an “internal injury compounded by external factors.” With careful measurement and a tailored prescription, after a late dose and about two hours past midnight, Baoyu’s senses began to stir, and he was able to take a sip of water. Only then did Jia Mu, Madam Wang, and others finally relax; Aunt Xue was sent along with Baochai to Jia Mu’s residence, and they all rested for a time.

For a while Baoyu’s mind cleared, but he still seemed unable to truly recover. After everyone had dispersed, and with only Xiren in the room, Baoyu called her over. Clutching her hand and weeping, he said, “Tell me—how did it happen that Sister Bao came to be here? I remember the old master had arranged for Lin Guniang to be brought over, so why was Sister Bao forced out? Why does she now occupy this place? If I were to say something, I fear I’d offend her. Tell me—did you hear how Lin Guniang cried?”
Xiren, unable to speak plainly, only murmured, “Miss Lin is gravely ill.”
Baoyu insisted, “I must see her for myself.” He tried to rise, but his weakened state prevented him, and he burst into tears, “I’m going to die! I have a truth burning in my heart—please, go and tell the old lady. Surely Lin Guniang is destined to die, and I cannot protect either of us. If both of us perish, it will be impossible to make any arrangements. Better to clear out an empty room at once—so that whether we live or die, we might be cared for together. Promise me this, so as not to waste all these years of love.”
Xiren, moved by his desperate words, wept, half laughing, half anguished.

At that moment, Baochai, who had just arrived with Ying’er, overheard the exchange. She said, “Why do you speak such ominous words when you should be taking care of yourself? The old lady has only just comforted you, and now you’re stirring up more trouble. The old lady loves you so dearly—even though she is over eighty, she cherishes you as if you were the sole light of her life. And Madam Wang has devoted her heart to raising you; if you were to die prematurely, how could they bear it? Even if my fate has been harsh, it is not so extreme. Consider these things—if you truly were to die, there would be no time to arrange anything. So you must not die. Stay calm and wait a few more days until the wind of illness passes and your vital energy is restored, so that these malignant symptoms will vanish.”
Baoyu could only remain silent for a long time, then managed a weak, silly laugh, “You haven’t spoken to me for so long—and now you lecture me with such grand truths. Who is there to listen?”
Baochai then said gravely, “Truly, listen well: In those past days when you were too muddled to know your own mind, Lin Guniang already passed away!”
Baoyu suddenly sat up, exclaiming, “She—she has truly died?”
Baochai confirmed, “Yes, she has died. How could anyone with such silvered tongue curse a person to death? The old lady and Madam Wang knew of the harmony among your sisters; if you had heard of her death, you would have surely followed her to death yourself—so they kept it from you.”
Upon hearing this, Baoyu broke into loud, despairing sobs, collapsing onto his bed. Suddenly his vision went black, and he lost all sense of direction. In the midst of his delirium he perceived someone approaching.
“Pray tell, where am I?” Baoyu asked, bewildered.
“That is the path of the netherworld,” the figure replied coolly. “Your life has not ended—why have you come here?”
Baoyu replied, “I heard that a dear friend had died, so I sought him out and inadvertently lost my way.”
“And who is this friend?” inquired the specter.
“Lin Daiyu,” Baoyu answered.
The figure laughed bitterly, “Lin Daiyu was never meant to be possessed by mortal love; in death she has no soul or spirit—where would you search for her? All mortal souls, when in life, gather into forms and disperse into mere qi upon death. If ordinary souls vanish, how could Lin Daiyu be any different? Return now.”
Baoyu, stunned, murmured, “But you say that when one dies the soul disperses—then how is there a netherworld?”
The figure sneered, “The underworld exists if one declares it so; if not, it does not. It is merely a tool for the world to warn against the folly of clinging to life and death. Some do not know how to remain at peace; some perish before their time; some, overcome by base desires, bring calamity upon themselves. For these souls a hell is prepared, where they must suffer endless torment for their sins. You, seeking Daiyu, have trapped yourself without reason. Moreover, Daiyu has already passed into the realm of illusion. If you are determined to seek her, cultivate your spirit in earnest—and perhaps one day you shall meet her again; if not, you will be forever imprisoned in the netherworld for daring to yearn for her.”
After saying this, the specter withdrew a stone from his sleeve and hurled it at Baoyu’s heart. The impact startled Baoyu so that he wished to return home, yet he was utterly disoriented and could not find his way. As he hesitated in despair, he suddenly heard voices calling his name. Turning, he saw not a specter but his family—Jia Mu, Madam Wang, Baochai, Xiren, and others—gathered around him, weeping, while he remained lying on his bed. Glancing around at the red lanterns and the bright moon outside the window, surrounded by lush splendor in the prosperous world, he slowly realized that it had all been one great dream. His entire body broke into cold sweat, and his heart felt inexplicably light. Yet after deep reflection, he could only sigh repeatedly in helpless resignation.

It turned out that Baochai had long known of Daiyu’s death. The old lady and the others had forbidden anyone to reveal it to Baoyu for fear that it would worsen his condition. But Baochai, understanding that Baoyu’s illness stemmed from his love for Daiyu—and then from the loss of his precious jade—used the opportunity to explain matters so that his grief might become resolute, and his spirit might return to balance, thus offering a chance for recovery. Neither Jia Mu nor Madam Wang fully understood Baochai’s subtle plan; they were deeply troubled by his apparent rashness. Later, when Baoyu finally regained consciousness, they felt relieved and promptly called in Dr. Bi to examine him. The doctor, upon taking his pulse, remarked, “Now his pulse is steady and his spirit at peace. Tomorrow, if we administer a tonic to harmonize his qi, he may well recover.” With that, he departed. One by one, everyone gradually relaxed.

At first, Xiren resented Baochai for revealing such bitter truths, though she could not bring herself to voice her complaint. Ying’er later whispered that Baochai was overly hasty. Baochai retorted, “What do you know? At least I am here.”

Baochai’s focus was not on her own reputation but on alleviating Baoyu’s heartache. In time, Baoyu’s spirit grew steadier. Though at moments he recalled Daiyu and still appeared muddled, Xiren gently reminded him of the old master’s decree that “Miss Bao is of noble character and gentle by nature, whereas Lin Guniang’s nature is odd and fated to wither early.” Such words gradually drew tears from Baoyu’s eyes. He even flirted with the idea of ending his life, yet the strange words of his dream and his hope for the old lady’s comfort held him back. Moreover, with Daiyu dead and Baochai now the preeminent lady of the household, he began to accept the fated union of “gold and jade.” Although Baoyu could not fully shake off his grief, and even after performing the household rituals for his family he later devised subtle means to ease his sorrows, his condition remained that of a fragile, tormented soul.

In time, as Baoyu’s illness slowly improved though his unyielding infatuation remained, he would often see Baochai sitting by his bedside, and her gentle presence seemed to soothe some of his old wounds. Baochai would consistently speak in a calm, earnest tone, “Taking care of one’s health is paramount; now that we are husband and wife, it matters not if our recovery is gradual.”

Though Baoyu’s inner torment was not entirely assuaged, and though daily Jia Mu, Madam Wang, and Aunt Xue took turns to care for him, at night Baochai retired alone to sleep. Jia Mu, ever vigilant, dispatched servants to attend to him. Gradually, as Baochai’s graceful conduct reassured him, Baoyu’s once singular love for Daiyu began to shift slowly toward Baochai. (This, however, is a story for another time.)

Meanwhile, on the day of Baoyu’s wedding, Daiyu had already fallen into a coma during the day. Yet throughout that day a faint spark of life persisted within her—a small, nearly imperceptible breath—as she made Li Wan and Zizhuan weep bitterly. That evening, Daiyu stirred slightly, opening her eyes as if longing for water or soup. By then, Xueyan had departed, leaving only Zizhuan, the nurse, and a few little maids at her side. Zizhuan served her a bowl of longan soup mixed with pear juice, feeding her two or three spoonfuls with a small silver spoon. Daiyu, with her eyes closed, rested for a while until her mind seemed to clear dimly.

At that moment Li Wan, noticing that although Daiyu’s condition had improved slightly—a transient “return of the light”—she sensed it was but a brief reprieve, since there was still much time left in the day. Li Wan then returned to Daoxiang Village to attend to other matters.

When Daiyu finally opened her eyes and saw only Zizhuan, her wet nurse, and a few small maids about, she clutched Zizhuan’s hand tightly and cried out, “I am useless! For years I’ve had you by my side as though you were my very own sister—and now I…” She could say no more, then panted for breath before closing her eyes to rest again. Yet the grip on Zizhuan’s hand only grew tighter, and her breathing became labored—exhalations large, inhalations small—as if her condition were rapidly deteriorating.

Alarmed, Zizhuan quickly called for Li Wan. Fortuitously, Tan Chun arrived at that moment. Seeing Daiyu’s plight, Zizhuan whispered, “Third Sister, please come and see Lin Guniang,” weeping as she spoke. Tan Chun came over and felt Daiyu’s hand—now cold and lifeless, her gaze vacant. Tan Chun and Zizhuan cried out, summoning help and water to cleanse and comfort her. Just then, Li Wan entered. The three gathered around her in silence. As they were tending to her, suddenly Daiyu cried out in a clear, anguished voice, “Baoyu! Baoyu! You are so…” Before she could finish the word, a cold sweat broke out all over her body, and she fell silent. Zizhuan and the others rushed to hold her, but as her sweat flowed, her body grew colder. Tan Chun and Li Wan hurried to dress her hastily, but as they did so, Daiyu’s eyes rolled and—alas!—she exhaled a final, despairing cry.

Her fragrant soul drifted away with the wind, while her sorrow penetrated deep into the night’s dreams...

At that moment, as Daiyu passed away, it was the very hour when Baoyu was being married to Baochai. Zizhuan and the others broke down in tears. Li Wan and Tan Chun, who had always cherished Daiyu, wept bitterly in sympathy. Because the Xiaoxiang Pavilion was far from the new residence, the news did not reach that place. For a time, the family mourned together, until faint strains of music were heard in the distance—then nothing but the sound of rustling bamboo and the shifting moonlight against the walls, evoking a profound, chilling desolation.

Eventually, they summoned the attendant from Lin Zhixiao’s household to arrange for Daiyu’s coffin and to have her properly laid to rest, pending the next morning’s discussion with Fengjie. Fearing that if the terrible news of Daiyu’s death reached Baoyu it might devastate him further—especially now that his mind was so fragile—they decided that Jia Mu should personally go to the garden. Once inside the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, Jia Mu too wept bitterly. When Li Wan and Tan Chun arrived, they learned that all preparations were in order, and Jia Mu said, “Very well. But why did you not speak earlier to allay my worries?”
Tan Chun replied, “It is difficult to explain when one is escorting the old master.”
Fengjie interjected, “It is your pity for him that has brought you to this state. In any case, I must now go attend to that wretch over there. But this matter is so unbearably heavy—if we do not act today it will be impossible; yet if we do, the old lady might not be able to bear it.”
Li Wan said, “You go and act according to the situation; it is best to delay until later if needed.”
Fengjie nodded and hurried off.

Fengjie then went to Baoyu’s side. Hearing from the doctor that his condition was not irreversible, and seeing that Jia Mu and Madam Wang were somewhat reassured, she took it upon herself to relay the news about Daiyu. When Jia Mu and Madam Wang heard, they were horrified. Jia Mu wept, “It is my doing that I have ruined him! But that maid is so foolish…” He then contemplated going to the garden to weep over him, yet his concern for Baoyu left him torn. Madam Wang and the others, with heavy hearts, consoled him, “There is no need to; your old lady’s health is paramount.” Ultimately, Jia Mu insisted that Madam Wang go instead. He added, “Tell his spirit in no uncertain terms, ‘It is not that I did not wish to see you off—I have my favorites. You are my granddaughter by adoption; compared with Baoyu, you are even more dear. If Baoyu falters, how can I face his father?’” Then he wept again. Madam Wang tried to comfort him, “Lin Guniang was the apple of your eye, but destiny has its fixed course. Now that she is gone, there is nothing left for us to do except to prepare for her funeral with the highest honors. This will ease our hearts, and allow the spirits of our relatives to find some solace.” Hearing this, Jia Mu wept all the more. Fearing that the old lady might be overwhelmed by grief, Fengjie covertly fabricated a little ruse to console her: “Baoyu surely misses you, old lady.” Hearing this, Jia Mu ceased his weeping and asked, “But what is the reason?” Fengjie smiled lightly and replied, “Nothing in particular—he simply longs for your presence.” Jia Mu then quickly gathered Precious Pearl to accompany him, and Fengjie followed. On the way they encountered Madam Wang, and after explaining everything to Jia Mu, he, though heartbroken, said, “I suppose I must go too. My heart is heavy—please, do not let him suffer any more.” Madam Wang and Fengjie both agreed, and eventually Jia Mu made his way to Baoyu. When he saw him, he asked, “Why have you sought me out?”
Baoyu, smiling feebly, replied, “Last night I saw Lin Guniang come. She said she was returning south, and I thought no one could detain her—so I begged the old lady to keep her with me a while.”
Jia Mu replied, “Very well. Be at ease.” Xiren then helped Baoyu lie back down. Jia Mu went out and then approached Baochai.

At that time, Baochai had not yet celebrated the “Returning Nine” ceremony, so whenever she met someone she appeared bashful. On that day, when she saw Jia Mu with tears streaming down his face, she was offered tea and, after sitting down, she inquired softly, “I hear that Lin Guniang has fallen ill. Is she any better?”
Jia Mu, unable to stem his tears, said, “My child, do not let Baoyu know. It is all because of your Lin Guniang that you have suffered so many misfortunes! Now that you are his wife, I must tell you that Lin Guniang died two or three days ago—she passed at the very moment when you were meant to be wed. And it is for this reason that Baoyu’s present ailment persists. You must remain in the garden; everyone will soon understand.”
Baochai’s face flushed with sorrow, and she too shed tears at the thought of Daiyu’s death. Jia Mu spoke a little more before departing.

From that time on, Baochai deliberated many times and devised a plan—but she was cautious and did not act rashly until after the Returning Nine, when things had improved somewhat and conversations could resume without the ever-present tension. Although Baoyu’s illness seemed to gradually improve each day, his foolish, obsessive heart could not be cured, and he insisted on mourning deeply. Jia Mu and the others, aware that his illness was not yet entirely resolved, forbade him from brooding over it; yet his depression recurred so often that the doctors eventually advised him to “distract his mind” before continuing treatment. Baoyu then resolved to return to the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Jia Mu ordered that a bamboo chair be brought so that Baoyu might be helped to sit, and soon Jia Mu and Madam Wang accompanied him.

Inside the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, upon seeing Daiyu’s funeral casket, Jia Mu wept until his tears had dried, and Fengjie and the others tried repeatedly to console him. Madam Wang herself cried bitterly. Li Wan invited Jia Mu and Madam Wang to retire to an inner room, still weeping. When Baoyu arrived, the memory of happier times when he had once visited Daiyu here overwhelmed him, and now, with the final farewell, he broke into uncontrollable wailing. He remembered once how close they had been; now that death had separated them, his sorrow was indescribable. Fearing that Baoyu’s grief might exacerbate his illness, everyone assisted him until he finally calmed down. Among those present, Baochai too wept bitterly. Yet Baoyu insisted on summoning Zizhuan to ask, “What final words did my dear Lin say on her deathbed?”
Zizhuan, who had long harbored resentment against Baoyu, now, seeing that he was slowly recovering and with Jia Mu and Madam Wang present, reluctantly recounted every detail of how Daiyu’s illness had worsened, how she had burned the old kerchief and her manuscript in her despair, and what she had whispered in her final moments. Baoyu wept anew, choked by sorrow. Tan Chun then added the account of Daiyu’s last instructions that her coffin be taken back south. Jia Mu and Madam Wang wept once more. Fortunately, Fengjie’s words of comfort eventually eased the atmosphere, and Jia Mu and the others were sent away. Yet Baoyu was inconsolable—and though Jia Mu tried to force him to return to his room, Baoyu would not be dissuaded.

Jia Mu, being advanced in age, had been sleepless ever since Baoyu fell ill, and now, after another bout of intense pain, he felt dizzy and feverish. Though he constantly fretted over Baoyu, he himself could barely hold on and eventually retired to his own room. Madam Wang, her heart equally heavy, also returned, sending Caiyun to help Xiren care for Baoyu, instructing, “If Baoyu becomes too sorrowful, come at once and tell us.”

Baochai, aware that Baoyu could not bear to part from his sorrow, refrained from reproach and instead spoke wryly, “You haven’t spoken to me in ages, and now you lecture me with these grand principles—who is there to listen?”
Baoyu, fearful that Baochai might take it amiss, wept quietly and stilled his grief. After a night’s uneasy rest, his condition stabilized somewhat. The next morning, everyone examined him and found that though his qi was still weak and his body fragile, his heartache seemed to have lightened a fraction. With increased care, he gradually improved. Jia Mu himself recovered without falling ill, but Madam Wang’s heartache persisted. That day, Aunt Xue came to visit, and when she saw that Baoyu’s spirit had brightened somewhat, she felt relieved and stayed for a while.

One day, Jia Mu specially invited Aunt Xue to discuss matters, saying, “Baoyu’s life is owed entirely to the second mistress’s intervention. Now that he has recuperated for a hundred days, and his body seems restored, and after completing the mourning period, it is time for him to consummate his marriage. I ask that you, as head of your household, choose an auspicious day.”
Aunt Xue replied, “Old Mother, your plan is excellent—why even ask me? Though my daughter-in-law has always been plain in her ways, her heart is clear; the old lady has always known your deep affection. May they soon live in harmony, and then the old lady and I will find some comfort. You set the date; there is no need to notify the relatives.”
Jia Mu then said, “This is the greatest event in Baoyu’s life—after all the trouble we have endured, now that he is finally at peace, let us celebrate with a grand feast. Relatives shall be invited—first to repay our kindness, and second, so we may all enjoy a cup of celebratory wine, thereby justifying all our labors.”
Aunt Xue was delighted, and she proceeded to discuss the bridal trappings. Jia Mu then remarked, “Since we are all one family, I think it is unnecessary to be so extravagant. If items are used, his room is already filled; surely my daughter-in-law will desire a few prized things, which the second mistress will supply. I have faith that she is not a capricious person—if not, our grandchildren would never have a long life.” At these words even Aunt Xue wept. Just then Fengjie entered with a laugh, “Old Mother and Aunt, what are you both thinking of now?”
Aunt Xue said, “I was just speaking of Lin Guniang, and it brought me sorrow.”
Fengjie laughed, “Old Mother and Aunt, do not be sad. I have just heard a little jest that I will share with you—but I promise it is not meant to offend.”
Jia Mu dabbed his eyes and smiled faintly, “Whom shall we assign this joke to? Tell me, and your Aunt and I will hear it. Speak, and if it is not funny, we shall not heed it.” Fengjie began to mime with both hands, laughing until she bent over. (What she said shall be revealed in the next installment.)
Chapter 99
The Officials’ Strict Admonitions and the Slaves’ Breaking of Precedent; Reports from the Mansion Bring Dire Worries to the Old Uncle

Fengjie, noticing how deeply Jia Mu and Aunt Xue were grieved over Daiyu’s passing, declared, “I have a little joke to share with the old lady and aunt.” Before she could begin, she burst into self-amusement. “Tell me,” she continued, “where do the old madams get their jokes? It’s all about our new son-in-law and new daughter-in-law!”
Jia Mu asked, “What do you mean?”
With a flourish of her hand, Fengjie mimed, “One sits like this, one stands like that; one twists this way, one turns that way; then one… and then another…” By the time she reached the punchline, Jia Mu was laughing heartily. “You speak so well,” he chuckled, “but it isn’t really about them—it’s you who has such a way with words that you can’t help provoking a reaction.”
Aunt Xue also laughed and urged, “Just go on—no need for comparisons.”
Fengjie explained, “Earlier, when I went into Baoyu’s room, I overheard several people laughing. I looked out the window and saw that Sister Bao was seated on the edge of the kang while Brother Baoyu stood on the floor. Baoyu was tugging at Bao’s sleeve, repeatedly saying, ‘Sister Bao, why can’t you speak? If you utter one word, my illness will vanish!’ But Sister Bao just turned her head to avoid him. Then Baoyu made a deep bow, reached up and tugged at her garment again. Bao, exasperated, pulled away, and since Baoyu—already weak from his illness—could not keep his balance, he collapsed, falling onto Sister Bao. In a panic, she blushed and scolded, ‘You’ve lost all respect now!’”
At this, both Jia Mu and Aunt Xue laughed. Fengjie added, “Then Baoyu got up and, still laughing, said, ‘Thanks to that fall, at last your words have come out!’”
Aunt Xue remarked, “That little fellow is so odd. What’s there to it? Since he’s already exchanged two vows and is laughing about it, what harm is there? He never even saw your Second Brother Lian, did he?”
Fengjie, her face flushed with mirth, teased, “What do you mean? I only told a joke to ease our dear aunt’s heart, but now she’s begun to ask me to divine our fortunes!”
Jia Mu also laughed, “It’s best this way. A husband and wife must be harmonious yet know their bounds. I have always valued dear Sister Bao’s modesty. But I still worry about Baoyu—he’s so simple-minded! When he speaks, it’s as though he understands nothing at all. Tell us—are there any more jokes?”
Fengjie grinned, “Tomorrow, when Baoyu’s marriage is consummated and his in-laws come with a grandchild, won’t that be a joke in itself?”
Jia Mu laughed, “You impish child! Here I am, still thinking of dear Lin, and you come along with your jokes—and then you act all coy. Aren’t you worried that Lin will despise you? Don’t be too merry; if Lin holds a grudge, you’d best not wander alone in the garden for fear she’ll drag you away!”
Fengjie laughed, “She wouldn’t blame me; at the moment, on her deathbed she raged bitterly against Baoyu.!”
Both Jia Mu and Aunt Xue took her banter in stride, and Jia Mu said, “Stop rambling. Go and arrange for a most propitious day to complete Brother Baoyu’s marriage.”
Fengjie agreed and, after a few more words of wit, went out to order the preparations. Soon a lucky day was chosen, and once more the household arranged a banquet with singing and dancing.

Meanwhile, although Baoyu’s illness had gradually improved and Baochai sometimes smiled while leafing through books, discussing matters, Baoyu’s once-keen wit no longer shone as it once had. Even to himself, his former flashes of inspiration now seemed distant and mysterious. Baochai, knowing well that his “spiritual connection” had been lost, explained to Xiren on more than one occasion, “Why is it that you seem to have lost your old cleverness? Perhaps forgetting your old faults isn’t so bad, but your temper remains just as unruly, while your reason grows even muddier!”
Baoyu merely laughed in his silly way at such remarks. Occasionally his nature would run wild, but Baochai’s gentle counsel soon brought him back to order. Xiren, too, was able to offer some tender words, and all the other maids admired Baochai for her grace and quiet dignity.
Yet Baoyu was, by nature, ever restless—he longed to roam the garden. Jia Mu and the others, partly fearing that the chill or the sights might revive old sorrows (even though Daiyu’s coffin now lay outside the city in a secluded temple, and yet the Xiaoxiang Pavilion still stood in mournful silence), forbade him from wandering. Moreover, his cousins and sisters had gone away—Baoqin had returned to Aunt Xue’s home, Shi Xiangyun had accompanied her uncle back to the capital, and others had gone off to settle elsewhere. Thus, in the garden there remained only Li Wan, Tan Chun, and Xi Chun. Jia Mu still planned to transfer Li Wan and the others into the mansion to handle the endless tasks following Consort Yuan’s passing, leaving little time for Baoyu’s wandering. And although the weather grew ever warmer, the garden was still livable for now; plans were made to move him again in autumn. (We shall leave those matters for later.)

Meanwhile, in another part of the narrative, Jia Zheng, accompanied by several friends he had invited from the capital, had traveled overnight and reached his home province. There he met with his superiors, formally took up his post, and began inspecting the granaries in various counties.
Jia Zheng had always been a diligent official in the capital, concerned only with the routine affairs of the bureaucracy—even when posted away, he was a poor scholar uninterested in political intrigue. Thus, although he had heard rumors of malpractices in county granaries and extortion from the local peasants, he had never experienced it firsthand. His sole concern was to be a good, upright officer. In consultation with his subordinates, he issued strict orders forbidding any such misconduct, warning that any discovered would be reported in detail.
When he first arrived, local clerks trembled before his stern notices and did everything they could to cover their tracks. Many local families, having struggled in the capital under his predecessor, now eagerly anticipated his arrival, borrowing money to dress well and appear respectable, hoping that once Jia Zheng assumed office, wealth would flow in. But Jia Zheng, with his rigid adherence to principle, insisted on a thorough investigation.
His household servants grumbled among themselves, “We’ve endured months of hardship—how can we ever recoup our money? We see silver everywhere yet it never comes to us!” The senior attendants lamented, “We’ve barely spent any money ourselves, and now if we do not get paid, we’ll be ruined! Perhaps tomorrow we should all take leave together.” And indeed, the next day they all filed a leave application. Jia Zheng, unaware of their plotting, remarked, “If you all wish to leave, then leave!”
The remaining household members then debated, “They’ve gone if they wish; for those of us who must stay, we must figure something out.”
One of the gatekeepers, a man named Li Shier, said, “What are you all in such a hurry for? Look at these ‘chiefs’ here—they won’t dare oppose me. If we pool our funds, we can at least bring home some money. But if you won’t join me, I won’t care—either way, I’ll handle it.”
All agreed, “Excellent, Li Shier, we know we can count on you; without you, we are doomed.”
Li Shier replied, “Don’t worry; if I manage even a little profit, I won’t let it all go to my head.”
At that moment, a clerk from the granary office arrived seeking Zhou Erye. Li Shier, seated and propping one leg up, asked, “What do you want?”
The clerk, with a courteous smile, explained, “I’ve been here for over a month now, and since our notices have proven so forceful, the county chiefs have been too afraid to open their granaries. If this continues until the next remittance, what hope is there for our officials?”
Li Shier retorted, “Don’t be absurd—our master is resolute; when he says something must be done, it will be done. Just now I mentioned a slight delay in urging remittances—so tell me, what do you want from Zhou Erye?”
The clerk insisted, “I only inquired about the remittance issue—nothing more.”
Li Shier snapped, “Stop your foolish talk! Don’t come here whispering about accounts, or I’ll have you beaten and sent away!”
The clerk replied, “I’ve served in this office for three generations and am well known both here and outside. I always conduct myself with dignity; unlike those ragged fellows, I do not intend to profit off this.” After a brief exchange, he excused himself, “Erye, I must take my leave.”
Li Shier then stood, grinning, “So easy to anger—just a few words and your face flushes!”
The clerk said, “I’m not angry—if I continue, wouldn’t it tarnish your master’s reputation?”
Li Shier stepped closer and asked, “And what is your name, pray?”
The clerk hesitated, “I’m Mr. Zhan, with the single given name Huì.”
Li Shier exclaimed, “Mr. Zhan! I’ve long heard of you. We are of like minds—let us talk more tonight.”
Mr. Zhan replied, “Who doesn’t know that our dear Li Shier is remarkable? Your words truly frightened me!”
They laughed together and parted, spending much of the evening discussing accounts in hushed tones.

The next day, when word of these matters reached Jia Zheng, he was severely rebuked. The following day, while receiving guests, orders were given both inside and outside. After a while, with arrangements made and the drum beat three times in the great hall (though initially no one came to play the drum), Jia Zheng stepped out from his warm chamber. Standing in the courtyard, he bellowed at the constable—only one guard was present.
Jia Zheng, not questioning further, ascended the stone steps and waited for the sedan chair; after a long wait, the carriage finally arrived and was taken out of the government office. However, the drum played only one sharp beat. At the drum pavilion, there was just one drummer and one horn blower. Jia Zheng grew angry, “In former days there would be a full complement—why today are we so few?” Looking up at the officials, he saw disorder and delay. After guests returned with difficulty, orders were given for the official drum to be struck. Some said it was because there were no hats, others that the uniform was ill-suited, still others that after three days without a proper meal the men were too weak. Jia Zheng struck a few, then relented.
The next day, the kitchen staff came to demand money, and Jia Zheng paid them with the silver he had on hand. After that, everything seemed less favorable than in the capital. In exasperation, he called Li Shier, “Look at these people—everything has changed! See here, our silver is nearly gone; the pay from the provincial office should be sent from the capital soon.”
Li Shier reported, “I did mention it that day, but I wasn’t sure. These folks are all dispirited—they leave me with nothing. Master, how much silver do you want taken? I’ve heard that many provincial officials receive thousands upon thousands as gifts on their birthdays. How much should we offer?”
Jia Zheng replied, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”
Li Shier answered, “Master, you are most wise. We are new here and do not have close relations with the other masters—no one wishes to send gifts. They wish that you would not leave so much behind, for they covet every bit of your splendor.”
Jia Zheng retorted, “Nonsense! I am an official appointed by the emperor himself—if the local authorities don’t send me birthday gifts, then I cannot do my duty!”
Li Shier laughed, “Master speaks truly. The capital is far away, and every matter here is handled by the provincial office. They say well of you—but if not, it’s hard to maintain your reputation. By the time we fully understand, it will be too late. Even our own elders—who do not wish to see you in the limelight—are troubled by it!”
Jia Zheng, realizing the truth in his subordinate’s words, said, “I was just about to ask why none of you mentioned it!”
Li Shier replied, “I dared not speak until you asked; if I remain silent, I’d be unfaithful—but if I speak, you might be angry.”
Jia Zheng insisted, “Just speak as long as it is reasonable.”
Li Shier explained, “Those clerks and constables are paid to run this office—they all want to profit. Ever since you took office, you haven’t truly labored for the country, yet you have already built a reputation.”
Jia Zheng inquired, “What do the common people say?”
Li Shier said, “They say that every newly appointed master issues such strict notices, and the more fearsome your decree, the more the counties, trembling, send over silver. When collecting grain, your office proclaims your new methods; if you dare not ask for money, the delay causes complaints. The locals, eager to settle matters, are willing to pay a few coins to get it done quickly. So rather than hearing praises of you, they say you are nothing but money-minded. Even if some of your own kin are fond of you, in a few years you will be in high favor—simply for knowing how to please both the upper and lower classes.”
Jia Zheng, now understanding, said, “So you mean I am to be a corrupt official? If I die because of this, my grandfather’s merits will all be lost!”
Li Shier replied, “Master, you are supremely wise. Remember the officials who were punished in previous years? They were all close to you—yet even so, your name remains. As for your relatives who once criticized you, now they rise and prosper. All we need is to do well. You must remember: the people must be cared for, as must the officials. If you insist on not allowing any county to receive a large sum, then who will handle the assignments? As long as you maintain your sterling reputation outside, the grievances within can be managed by me—it will not trouble you.”
Jia Zheng, swayed by Li Shier’s words, murmured, “I only want to preserve my life; if you all make a fuss, it won’t be my problem.” And he stepped back inside.
Thus, Li Shier assumed authority, rallying both inside and outside to help Jia Zheng with his duties, ensuring that every matter was attended to and done according to his wishes. Jia Zheng, trusting him completely, accepted his leadership. A few reports were even sent upward. His superiors, finding Jia Zheng honest and unpretentious, did not inspect further. Only his close attendants, who had seen everything, attempted to offer honest advice; some even offered to resign, while others who favored him maintained their positions. In the end, all routine tasks were completed without incident.

One day, while Jia Zheng sat in his study reading, a letter arrived from an external government office. The official seal on the envelope bore the title “From the Office of the Commander of the Haimen Region, Forwarded to the Jiangxi Grain Office.”
Jia Zheng opened it and read the contents:

  In deep friendship with Jinling, with profound feelings for one’s hometown. Last year, while serving in the capital, I secretly rejoiced by the side of my seat; I was honored by your favor and promised a union in red and jade—my virtue will not be forgotten. But due to my reassignment to the frontier, I dared not act rashly, and my heart is filled with regret and sorrow for the lost connection. Now, fortune smiles upon me from afar, soothing a lifelong longing. I extend my heartfelt congratulations, and, though separated by vast oceans, humbly ask that you not spurn this humble request. I have long awaited your promise, dear lady; if you would but confirm it, I would be forever in your debt. Though the journey is long, one river can be bridged; I do not dare to boast of a hundred sedan chairs—only a humble boat is prepared. I respectfully convey these few lines and pray for your prosperous ascent.
  In anticipation,
  Your devoted younger brother, Zhou Qiongdun.

Jia Zheng read these lines and thought, “Indeed, fate in marriage is determined by the stars. Last year, I saw him obtain a post in the capital; he is of my hometown, and we have long been on friendly terms. I even recall mentioning it at a banquet. But then he was reassigned to the frontier, and we never spoke of it again. Now that I have been promoted to this rank, he writes to inquire. I see that his household seems appropriate—matching even with Tan Chun. Yet I have no family accompanying me, so I must write back to him.”
As he hesitated, another document arrived concerning a provincial meeting. Jia Zheng reluctantly packed his things for the journey to the province, awaiting instructions from the commander.

One day, while lounging at his official residence, Jia Zheng noticed a stack of official bulletins on his desk. As he perused them, he saw one from the Ministry of Justice titled, “Report Concerning the Business of a Jinling Merchant, Xue Pan.”
Jia Zheng was startled, “Incredible—they have already filed a case!” He continued reading. It detailed:
  According to the report from the military office: Xue Pan, of Jinling origin and formerly a subordinate, while passing through Taiping County, stayed at a tavern in Li’s Shop. There, by chance, he encountered a man named Zhang San, whom he did not previously know. On a certain day, Xue Pan invited a local man, Wu Liang, for a drink using the tavern owner’s prepared wine. When the wine proved unsatisfactory, Xue Pan demanded a change. Zhang San said that the wine was already sold out and difficult to exchange. In a fit of obstinacy, Xue Pan hurled a jug of wine at Zhang San’s face. At that moment, as Zhang San stooped to pick up his chopsticks, he lost his grip and the wine bowl struck him on the head, rupturing his scalp and causing fatal injury. Li, the shop owner, rushed to help but was too late. Zhang San’s mother, upon seeing her son’s death, cried out and reported it to the county office. An autopsy revealed that the skull was fractured to a depth of one and a half inches with an injury to the temple. Although Xue Pan was found to have acted carelessly under the influence of alcohol, causing Zhang San’s death, he is to be charged with involuntary manslaughter and sentenced according to the law. Wu Liang is to be punished with caning. The officials who mishandled the matter at the county level should also be investigated…
  [This draft remains unfinished.]

Jia Zheng, recalling Aunt Xue’s request, had once sought a county magistrate’s review; but if the central government were to reopen the case, it would implicate him—and that filled him with dread. He turned the document over and over, ultimately deciding not to pursue this case further. His heart filled with uncertainty and fear.
While he was musing, Li Shier entered, “Master, please report to the official hall—the government office has already struck two drumbeats.”
Jia Zheng stared blankly, not hearing. Li Shier repeated the request.
Jia Zheng asked, “What is the meaning of this?”
Li Shier inquired, “What troubles you, Master?”
Jia Zheng explained about the letter he had been reading.
Li Shier reassured him, “Master, do not worry. If the department handles it this way, it is actually favorable to Mr. Xue. When I was in the capital, I heard that Mr. Xue, while at his shop, had drunkenly caused several mishaps—one tavern worker was even beaten to death. I heard that not only was a magistrate involved, but that Second Master Lian even spent a good deal of money to settle it, and many offices were involved before it was finally reported. I wonder why the department still hasn’t clarified the matter. Even if it breaks out, the officials will cover for one another. They might merely record it as “inaccurate reporting” and impose a demotion—who would then really claim that it cost them their silver? Master, do not worry; let me inquire further so as not to hinder our superior’s work.”
Jia Zheng replied, “Do you really know?”
Li Shier said, “Alas, that magistrate took a request so poorly that he nearly lost his office—nobody knows if he is guilty or not.”
Li Shier continued, “Now, even if it turns out that matters are as such, those on the outside have already labored for hours. Master, please come—let us go, for your sake.”
Jia Zheng, unsure of the provincial office’s actions, resolved to wait for further news.
(To be continued…)

Fortunate Affairs Ruined—Xiangling’s Deep-Set Resentment;
A Far-Off Marriage of Baoyu Evokes Bittersweet Parting Sentiments

It happened that after Jia Zheng left to meet with the regional commander, he spent several hours inside without emerging, leaving murmurs and speculations outside. Li Shier, waiting out in the corridor, could not learn of any serious matter and, recalling the reports of famine, grew anxious. At long last, when Jia Zheng finally emerged, Li Shier hurried to intercept him in a secluded spot and asked, “Master, during your long stay inside, was there any urgent matter?”
Jia Zheng smiled and replied, “Nothing dire at all. It turns out that the Commander-in-Chief happens to be a relative of a certain dignitary, who sent me a letter with kind instructions. In fact, he even remarked, ‘We are now as if kin.’”
Li Shier’s heart leaped with delight. Encouraged by this, he began urging Jia Zheng to arrange a marriage alliance on that basis.

In Jia Zheng’s mind, however, the matter of Xue Pan’s incident still weighed on him. Out in the provinces, information was scarce and difficult to verify. Thus, upon returning to his post, he sent his household members to the capital to make inquiries—and to report the Commander’s proposal to Jia Mu. If the old lady were amenable, they would send the “Third Sister” (i.e. their daughter) to join his service. His attendants hastily journeyed to the capital and reported to Madam Wang that Jia Zheng had not been punished, but that the local magistrate of Taiping County had been dismissed. A memorial was drafted to this effect, which served to console Jia Zheng, and they now awaited further news.

Meanwhile, Aunt Xue was in a state of constant distress over the legal case concerning Xue Pan’s inadvertent manslaughter. Countless silver taels had been spent in various offices to settle the matter. Originally it had been planned that the pawnshop’s collateral might be used for a ransom payment to atone for the crime—but the Ministry of Justice, after much expense, still condemned Xue Pan to death, sentencing him to life in prison pending a major trial in the autumn. Aunt Xue wept day and night over the injustice. Baochai, though frequently visiting to console her, remarked, “Our dear brother was never blessed by fate—he inherited our grandfather’s burdens and should be able to live in peace. Yet in the South things have become a mess, and the matter with Xiangling is especially grievous. Relying on our relatives’ influence, they spent silver money for nothing, effectively killing a young master in vain. Brother should reform and become a proper man, and honor our mother by caring for her. Instead, even after coming to the capital he behaves this way. Mother has borne so much, shedding countless tears. When he married, we hoped for a peaceful life, yet fate has decreed that his wife is anything but serene—so much so that he now hides away. As the saying goes, ‘Enemies meet on narrow roads’—in just a few days, trouble will surely break out. Mother and our second brother have done all they can, spending silver and even resorting to triple bows and endless schemes. But if it is meant to be, it is self-inflicted. After all, raising children is meant to secure support in old age—how could a humble family afford to squander what little we have, leaving our elders to cry their eyes out? I say, our brother’s behavior is not that of a son but of a sworn adversary. If Mother never understands, she will cry day and night until she’s inconsolable, and I too cannot forever remain here to mediate. I only hope, if I follow my own counsel, that when the time comes for him to depart, we can settle accounts properly.”
Aunt Xue, weeping, added, “Good child, do not tell him! He nearly lost his life over a Lin Guniang; now that he has recovered slightly, if he were to become agitated again, I would be utterly without support.”
Baochai interjected, “I think the same, and so I have not mentioned it to him.”

At that very moment, a commotion arose. Jin Gui rushed into an outer room, crying, “I can’t go on living! Men, there’s no hope left! Let’s stir up such a fuss that we all take our grievances to the execution ground and settle accounts once and for all!” She began wildly banging her head against a partition, disheveled and frantic. The sight left Aunt Xue staring in disbelief, rendered speechless. Fortunately, Baochai, along with the elder and younger sisters, managed to calm her down with gentle words.
Jin Gui declared, “Aunt, you are nothing compared to those high-born. You and your husband live well, but as for me—a single woman—what pride have I left?” With that, she nearly bolted off to return to her maternal home. The crowd, being many in number, managed to restrain her and coax her to calm down. Her behavior so frightened even Baoqin that she no longer dared to see Jin Gui. Had Xue Ke been around, Jin Gui might have adorned herself extravagantly and paraded about, even deliberately coughing to catch Xue Ke’s attention; sometimes, if she met him, she would flirt outrageously, in a display of alternating joy and anger. The other maids, who had long admired Baochai for her quiet, dignified manner, were in full agreement. Only Baoyu, who had always been restless rather than tranquil, continued to roam the garden. Jia Mu and the others, partly fearing that he might catch a chill or see something that would rekindle his sorrow—especially since Daiyu’s coffin had been sent to a temple outside the city, yet the Xiaoxiang Pavilion still stood in somber solitude—prohibited his wandering. Moreover, his cousins and sisters had long departed: Baoqin had returned to Aunt Xue’s, Shi Xiangyun had followed her uncle back to the capital, and those who were married had all left. Thus, only Li Wan, Tan Chun, and Xi Chun remained in the garden. Jia Mu intended to transfer Li Wan and the others into the mansion to handle the unending affairs following Consort Yuan’s passing, leaving little room for Baoyu to wander. And though the days grew hotter, the garden was still habitable; plans were made to relocate him in the autumn. (We shall leave those matters for another time.)

Meanwhile, Jia Zheng had traveled with several fellow officials invited from the capital, journeying by day and night until he reached his home province. There he met his superiors, formally took office, and began inspecting the granaries of various counties.
Jia Zheng, accustomed to his post in the capital, knew only the routine of bureaucratic affairs—and even as an official on assignment he was a poor scholar, with little interest in political maneuvering. Thus, while he had heard of abuses in county granaries and of extortion from local peasants, he had never experienced it firsthand; his sole aim was to be an honest, diligent officer. In consultation with his aides, he issued strict orders forbidding such malpractices, warning that any discovered would be meticulously reported.
At first, local clerks trembled before his edicts and did everything they could to cover up, while families who had suffered under his predecessor in the capital eagerly awaited his arrival—borrowing money to dress well and appear respectable, believing that once Jia Zheng assumed office, wealth would naturally flow. But Jia Zheng, steadfast and incorruptible, insisted on thorough investigations.
The servants grumbled among themselves, “We’ve endured so much—and yet if we don’t receive our pay soon, what shall we do? Silver is everywhere, but it never reaches our hands.” The senior attendants lamented, “We’ve hardly spent a penny ourselves, and now if we aren’t paid, we’re doomed! Perhaps tomorrow we should all resign together.” And sure enough, the next day they all filed for leave.
Jia Zheng, unaware of their plotting, said, “If you all wish to leave, then leave!”
The remaining household members then debated, “Those who can leave may go, but for those of us who must stay, we must devise some plan.”
One of the gatekeepers, a man called Li Shier, declared, “What’s all this rush about? Look at these ‘chiefs’ here—they won’t dare speak out. If we pool our money, we might salvage something; if you won’t join me, then I shall act on my own. Either way, I will prevail.”
Everyone agreed, “Excellent, Li Shier, we trust you; without you, we’re lost.”
Li Shier replied, “Don’t worry; even if it’s only a small sum, it’s better than nothing.”
At that moment, a clerk from the granary office arrived, seeking Zhou Erye. Seated with one leg propped up, Li Shier asked, “What do you need?”
The clerk replied with a courteous smile, “I’ve been here for over a month now, and because your notices are so fearsome, the county chiefs have not opened their granaries. If this continues until the next remittance, what shall become of us?”
Li Shier retorted, “Don’t spout nonsense—our master is resolute. I mentioned a slight delay in urging the remittance, but tell me, what do you want from Zhou Erye?”
The clerk insisted, “I only ask about the remittance—nothing more.”
Li Shier snapped, “Stop your foolish prattle! Don’t come here whispering about accounts, or I’ll have you beaten and sent away!”
The clerk replied, “I’ve served in this office for three generations and am known both here and outside; I always conduct myself properly. Since you took office, you haven’t truly labored for the country, yet you already have a reputation.”
Jia Zheng, now understanding the gravity of his subordinate’s words, said, “I was about to ask why no one mentioned this earlier!”
Li Shier replied, “I dared not speak until you asked; if I remain silent, I’d be remiss—but if I speak, you might become angry.”
Jia Zheng insisted, “Just speak as long as it is reasonable.”
Li Shier explained, “Those clerks and constables are paid to run this office—they all seek profit. Since you assumed office, you have hardly contributed to the state, yet you have built up a name for yourself.”
Jia Zheng then asked, “What do the common folk say?”
Li Shier said, “They say that every new master issues such fearsome edicts—indeed, the harsher your decree, the more silver the counties send over. When collecting grain, your office proclaims your new methods; if you do not demand money, the delay breeds complaint. The locals, eager to settle matters, are willing to pay a few coins to get it done quickly. So rather than praising you, they say you are driven solely by money. Even if some of your own relatives love you dearly, in a few years you will rise to great heights—simply for pleasing both superiors and subordinates.”
Jia Zheng, now thoughtful, said, “So you mean I am to be a corrupt official? If that brings about my downfall, then my grandfather’s merits will all be lost!”
Li Shier replied, “Master, you are supremely wise. Haven’t you seen how some officials in past years were punished? They were all close to you—but still, your name remains. As for the relatives who once criticized you, now they prosper. All that matters is to do well. Remember: one must care for both the people and one’s own office. If you insist on depriving the counties of their due, then who will manage the assignments? As long as you maintain your good reputation outside, the internal grievances can be managed by me—it will not trouble you.”
Jia Zheng, swayed by Li Shier’s words, murmured, “I only wish to preserve my life; if you make a fuss, it won’t be my problem.” And he stepped back inside.
Thus, Li Shier assumed authority, rallying everyone—both within the mansion and beyond—to handle Jia Zheng’s affairs, ensuring that every matter was carried out according to his wishes. Jia Zheng, trusting him implicitly, allowed him full control. Several reports were even sent upward. His superiors, noting Jia Zheng’s honesty and simplicity, did not scrutinize further. Only his close aides, whose eyes had seen everything, offered candid advice; some even proposed resigning, while others strove to maintain his position. In the end, all administrative tasks were completed without incident.

One day, while Jia Zheng was leisurely reading in his study, a document arrived from an external office. Its official seal read “From the Office of the Commander of the Haimen Region, Forwarded to the Jiangxi Grain Office.”
Jia Zheng opened the letter and read its contents:

  In sincere friendship with those of Jinling and with deep filial piety for our hometown,
  Last year, while serving in the capital, I secretly rejoiced by your side;
  I have been honored by your grace and promised a union in scarlet and jade,
  And my virtue will never be forgotten.
  But due to my reassignment to the frontier, I dared not act rashly,
  And my heart is filled with regret for our lost bond.
  Now, fortune smiles upon me from afar, alleviating a lifelong longing.
  I extend my heartfelt congratulations and humbly request your approval,
  Though we are separated by vast oceans, I pray you will not reject this humble plea.
  I have long awaited your favorable reply—if you accept, I shall forever be indebted.
  Though the journey is long, a single river can be bridged;
  I dare not demand a grand welcome, but instead have prepared a modest boat.
  I respectfully submit these few lines,
  And pray for your prosperous ascent.
  Your devoted younger brother,
  Zhou Qiongdun

Jia Zheng pondered these words, thinking, “Indeed, the fates of marriage are fixed by destiny. Last year I saw him secure a post in the capital; he is of my own hometown, and we have long been on friendly terms. I recall mentioning this matter at a banquet—but then he was reassigned to the frontier, and we never spoke of it again. Now that I have been promoted, he writes to inquire. I see that his household appears quite proper—even matching well with Tan Chun. Yet I have no family with me; I must write back to discuss it further.” As he hesitated, another document arrived concerning a provincial meeting. Jia Zheng reluctantly packed his things for the journey to the province, awaiting instructions from the commander.

One day, while lounging at his official residence, Jia Zheng noticed a stack of official bulletins on his desk. As he perused them, he came upon one from the Ministry of Justice titled “Report on the Case of Xue Pan, a Merchant of Jinling.”
Jia Zheng was astonished, “Incredible—they have already filed a case!”
He continued reading. The report detailed the following:   According to the military office: Xue Pan, of Jinling origin and previously a subordinate, while passing through Taiping County, stayed at Li’s Tavern. There, by chance, he encountered a local man named Zhang San, previously unknown to him. On a certain day, Xue Pan instructed the tavern owner to provide wine and invited a local, Wu Liang, to drink. When the wine was found unsatisfactory, Xue Pan demanded a change. Zhang San replied that the wine was already sold out and hard to exchange. In his obstinacy, Xue Pan hurled a jug of wine at Zhang San’s face. At that very moment, as Zhang San stooped to pick up his chopsticks, he lost his grip and the wine bowl struck him on the head, fracturing his skull and causing fatal injuries. Li, the tavern owner, rushed to help but it was too late. Zhang San’s mother, upon finding her son dead, immediately reported the matter to the county authorities. An autopsy revealed a skull fracture measuring an inch and a half deep with a serious injury to the temple. Although it was clear that Xue Pan had acted in drunken carelessness, resulting in Zhang San’s death, he is to be charged with involuntary manslaughter and punished according to the law. Wu Liang shall receive corporal punishment. Additionally, the officials in charge at the county level are to be investigated for their errors…
  [The document ends with the note “Draft incomplete.”]

Fearing that, if this case were to be reopened at the central level, it would implicate him—especially at the behest of Aunt Xue—Jia Zheng’s heart filled with dread. He turned the paper over and over, and eventually, uncertain and fearful, decided not to pursue the matter further. His mind was filled with apprehension and doubt.

While he was lost in thought, Li Shier entered and said, “Master, please report to the official hall—the government office has already sounded the drum twice.”
Jia Zheng stared blankly, barely registering the words. Li Shier repeated his summons.
Jia Zheng asked, “What is this about?”
Li Shier inquired, “Master, is something troubling you?”
Jia Zheng explained the contents of the report.
Li Shier then reassured him, “Master, do not worry. If the department handles it as you wish, it will still be favorable to Mr. Xue. When I was in the capital, I heard that Mr. Xue had, while at his shop, drunkenly caused several disturbances—one incident even resulted in a man’s death by being beaten to death. I heard that not only did a magistrate get involved, but Second Master Lian even spent a considerable sum to settle matters, with several offices having to be contacted before it was finally resolved. I wonder why the department has not yet clarified this matter. Even if it does break out, the officials will protect one another; it might simply be recorded as “inaccurate reporting” and result in a demotion—who then would really complain about the silver lost? Master, please do not worry; let me inquire further so as not to hinder our superior’s business.”
Jia Zheng replied, “Do you truly know?”
Li Shier said, “Alas, that magistrate was so taken aback by a single request that he nearly lost his office—no one is sure whether he is guilty or not.”
Li Shier continued, “Even if things turn out this way, the officials outside have already been laboring for hours. Master, please come now.”
Jia Zheng, not knowing the full extent of the departmental procedures, said, “Very well—just let me take my leave.”
And so Li Shier set about enforcing his will. Through his energetic exhortations both within and outside the mansion, everything was arranged precisely to Jia Zheng’s liking. So thoroughly did he manage affairs that Jia Zheng not only grew unguarded but came to trust him implicitly. Several reports were even sent upward, and his superiors, finding Jia Zheng unpretentious and sincere, did not inspect further. Only his closest aides—who had seen everything—attempted to advise him; some even offered to resign, while others strove to maintain his support. In the end, all official business was completed without major incident.
Chapter 101
A Moonlit Warning to Wandering Spirits in the Grand View Garden;
A Divine Lot at Sanhua Temple Foretells Astonishing Omens

Below is the translated text:

Fengjie returned to her room and found that Jia Lian had not yet come back. She then sent for the attendants in charge of handling Tan Chun’s luggage and bridal trappings. Since it was after dusk, and she suddenly recalled that Tan Chun was to be seen, she ordered Feng’s personal maid, Feng, along with two other maids—one of whom was holding a lantern—to go out and check on Tan Chun. Stepping outside, they found that the moon was already high, its light streaming like liquid silver. Fengjie then commanded, “The maid with the lantern, go back inside.”

Soon, she approached the tea room window and overheard voices chattering inside—some words that seemed to be a mixture of crying and laughing, as if people were gossiping. Knowing that it was merely the lower-ranking women of the household spreading idle rumors, Fengjie’s heart sank with irritation. She ordered little Hong, “Go inside and act as if you’re indifferent—but listen carefully and coax out the truth.” Little Hong agreed and went in.

Fengjie then, accompanied only by Feng’er, walked to the garden gate. The gate was not yet closed, hanging open in a half-drawn state. Master and servant pushed the door open and entered. In the garden the moonlight was even brighter than outside, and every shadow of the heavy trees lay clearly on the ground; the space was eerily silent and desolate. As they proceeded along the path toward Qiushuang Zhai, a sudden gust of wind began to howl. It swept through, shaking the branches so that leaves fell, and throughout the garden the sound of rustling, clattering leaves filled the air. The high branches creaked and whistled, startling the roosting crows and other birds into flight.

Having been drinking, Fengjie felt a shiver run through her at the sudden chill. Feng’er, following behind, also shrank and murmured, “So cold!” Fengjie could no longer contain herself and called to Feng’er, “Quick—go back and fetch that silver ‘Mouse-Shoulder’ jacket; I’m waiting with Third Sister.” Feng’er, eager to leave and get dressed, quickly agreed and ran off.

Not long after Fengjie had taken a few steps, she suddenly sensed a faint rustling sound behind her, as if something were sniffing at her. Her hair stood on end. Unable to resist, she turned around to see a dark shape extending its snout toward her; two eyes shone like lanterns in the darkness. Terrified, Fengjie cried out in shock—it turned out to be a large dog. The dog cocked its head, then, dragging a tail that resembled a broom, it bounded up the earthen hill until it came to a halt, then turned its head back and raised its paw as if beckoning.

At that moment Fengjie’s heart pounded in terror. She hurried toward Qiushuang Zhai. By the time she reached the gate and rounded the bend, she caught sight of a vague human figure coming toward her. Still puzzled, she thought it might be one of the maids from that household, so she called out, “Who’s there?” She repeated her call twice, but no one emerged; already her senses were clouded. In her hazy state, she fancied that someone behind her said, “Aunt, you no longer even recognize me?”

Startled, Fengjie quickly turned around. There, before her eyes, was a handsome, elegant figure—one very familiar, though she could not immediately recall from which household he belonged. The figure remarked coolly, “Aunt, you seem to have forgotten me? Once, you cherished my words about ‘building a foundation that lasts a myriad of years,’ but now you’ve cast them away into the Eastern Ocean?” Fengjie, lowering her eyes in thought, could not quite place his meaning. The man sneered, “Back then, you cared for me so deeply—and now you’ve forgotten it all.”

Only then did Fengjie recall: it was the late wife of Jia Rong, Qin, who had once been dear to her. “Ah! You are one of the departed—how have you come here?” she exclaimed. Spitting in disgust, she turned to leave, but in her haste she tripped over a stone and fell, as if abruptly waking from a dream; sweat poured from her all over. Though her hair still bristled in fear and her heart raced, she now understood what had occurred. In a blurry vision, she saw little Hong and Feng’er approaching.

Fengjie, fearing further scandal and criticism, quickly scrambled to her feet and said, “What are you all doing, wasting time out here? Quickly, bring me something to put on.” Fengjie’s servant Feng’er came up and helped her dress, and little Hong, supporting her, tried to lead her onward. But Fengjie, barely coherent, said, “I’ve reached the place; everyone’s asleep—just go back,” and with that, she hurried with the two maids back home.

By then Jia Lian had returned. Fengjie noticed that his countenance had grown even more sullen than usual. Wanting to ask him what was wrong, she recalled his naturally reticent nature and did not dare to press him, so she let him sleep.

Early the next morning at the breaking of dawn, Jia Lian rose to inspect the eunuchs and to review the accounts in the inner court where Qiu Shi’an’s household was to be checked. It was still very early, and upon seeing the reports delivered the previous day on the table, he casually began to read. The first report stated: “The Ministry of Personnel urgently requests the selection of a physician, to be employed as per regulations.” The second report was titled: “The Ministry of Justice’s memorial regarding the newly apprehended case in Yunnan: A relative of the Great Duke, from Jia Hua’s household, named Bao Yin, among eighteen offenders carrying illicit firearms and gunpowder.” Jia Lian frowned and read on. The third report read: “The Inspector of Suzhou, Li Xiao, has submitted a memorial accusing a household slave of being allowed to behave arrogantly, abusing his power to insult soldiers and civilians, and thereby, due to illicit intentions, causing the death of a virtuous woman. The culprit, surnamed Shi and given the name Fu, claims to be of the hereditary third-rank from the Jia Fan household.”

Upon reading this, Jia Lian felt a deep unease in his heart. Just as he was about to continue reading, he feared that delaying might prevent him from meeting Qiu Shi’an, so he quickly donned his clothes. He did not even have time to eat; coincidentally, Ping’er brought him tea, which he sipped in a daze before mounting his horse and riding off. Ping’er then tidied up his discarded clothes.

At that moment, Fengjie had not yet awakened. Ping’er remarked, “Tonight I heard that Grandmother hardly slept—I massaged her to help her doze off.” Fengjie said nothing. Interpreting this as an allusion, Ping’er climbed onto the kang beside Fengjie and gently massaged her. Just as Fengjie was beginning to drift off to sleep, suddenly a cry arose from the direction of the eldest daughter’s room. Fengjie immediately opened her eyes wide. Ping’er called out, “Aunt Li, what on earth is happening? Why is the child crying, and what are you doing?”

Startled from her sleep, Aunt Li woke up, and hearing Ping’er’s words, her temper flared; she patted the child roughly, muttering curses about “a short-lived wretch” and admonishing, “Why must you cry for your mother’s funeral so late at night?” While she spoke, she gritted her teeth and gave the child a harsh twist. The child cried out loudly.

Fengjie exclaimed, “Heavens! Listen—this child is being mistreated! Go, beat that hateful, heartless nanny who abuses him, and bring Niu Niu here!” Ping’er laughed and said, “Aunt, don’t worry—what could she do? If by chance she bumps into him, that’s nothing. A few slaps tonight are no harm; tomorrow, let them gossip in secret and say we beat him in the middle of the night!” Fengjie, after hearing this, fell silent for a moment, then sighed deeply, “Oh dear! If I should die tomorrow leaving behind this wretched brat, what will become of me?” Ping’er laughed and added, “Aunt, what are you saying? Why must you wake up so early? Didn’t you have your proper time to arise? I don’t know what kind of misfortune has befallen you—just think, you’ve already endured enough on behalf of Master; how many times have you spent your silver without knowing it? Now, having arranged a little matter for you, if you keep crying like this, won’t you simply ruin yourself?” Ping’er’s words made Fengjie’s eyes grow red with tears.

Shortly thereafter, Jia Lian, who had been delayed, returned. It turned out that Qiu Shi’an had already gone to the court this morning; not meeting him, Jia Lian entered and asked Ping’er, “Are they still not awake?” Ping’er replied, “No, they are still sleeping.” Jia Lian stormed in, flung open the curtain with a bitter laugh, “Ha! They’re still asleep—what, are they content to waste time on a contest of arms?” He then loudly demanded tea. Ping’er quickly poured him a bowl. The other maids and wives, noticing that Jia Lian had come out after a long absence and had returned to sleep, had not expected his return. Ping’er retrieved some warm tea that had been set aside. Jia Lian, angered, lifted the bowl and, with a loud clatter, smashed it to pieces.

Startled, Fengjie woke up in a cold sweat, exclaiming, “Oh my!” She opened her eyes to see Jia Lian, his face contorted with fury, sitting beside her while Ping’er bent over collecting shards of broken bowl. Fengjie asked, “Why have you come back so soon?” After a moment of silence, she asked again. Jia Lian snapped, “Don’t you want me to come back? Are you so eager to see me die out there?” Fengjie laughed, “What’s the harm in that? Normally I wouldn’t be so bothered by your return, but if I ask you a question, you get angry?” Jia Lian shouted, “I wasn’t even there—why don’t you hurry and return?” Fengjie laughed, “If you don’t encounter anyone, you must be getting impatient; go earlier tomorrow and surely you’ll meet someone.” Jia Lian complained, “I won’t sit idly by and scavenge for scraps! There’s a mountain of work here and not a moment to spare for others’ nonsense! Don’t you know how many things I’ve already had to deal with? And now they’re planning a riotous banquet with gongs and drums to celebrate a birthday—I’m tired of running around!” He spat on the ground and scolded Ping’er.

Fengjie, hearing his words, was so moved that she nearly lost her temper and contemplated rebuking him sharply—but then she held back and, with a strained smile, said, “Why be so big-hearted? It’s early in the morning—what’s with all the shouting? Who told you to agree to their plans? Since you agreed, you must endure; sometimes you have to do things for others, and there’s no harm in that. Isn’t it so that when those matters arise, there’s always a celebration with drums and gongs? I say, ask your brother about it tomorrow.”
Fengjie, startled, asked, “Ask whom?”
Jia Lian replied, “Ask him—ask your own brother!”
Fengjie inquired, “Is it him?”
Jia Lian affirmed, “Isn’t there any other? You know what everyone outside calls him?”
Fengjie asked, “What do they call him?”
Jia Lian replied, “They call him ‘Wang Ren’—but truly, he’s ‘Forgetting Benevolence’!”
Fengjie burst into a laugh, “He isn’t called Wang Ren—what on earth is he called then?”
Jia Lian explained, “Look at that ‘Wang Ren’—he has forgotten the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust!”
Fengjie remarked, “What a biting tongue he has—no wonder it offends others!”
Jia Lian continued, “It’s not that he offends; I’m telling you, you should know your brother’s virtues too—do you know how he celebrated your second uncle’s birthday?”
Fengjie paused thoughtfully, “Oh dear, but tell me—wasn’t my second uncle’s birthday in winter? I recall that it was always Baoyu who handled it. The other day, when Grandfather was promoted, second uncle sent over a performance, and I secretly remarked, ‘Second uncle is the stingiest of them all, unlike our great uncle!’ So that day we arranged a banquet in his honor to avoid any familial debt. Now that it’s so early and a birthday is already being celebrated, what could it mean?”
Jia Lian said, “You’re dreaming. As soon as your brother arrives in the capital, he immediately receives a huge sum from your great uncle’s estate—but he kept it secret, spending several thousand silver taels. Later, second uncle scolded him for being too greedy; he couldn’t bear it and resorted to another scheme—using second uncle’s birthday to squeeze a few extra coins to placate him, so that second uncle wouldn’t get angry. And as for our relatives, whether in winter or summer, if they know, it’s a disgrace! You know, I wonder why I wake up so early. Nowadays, because of matters at the frontier, an imperial inspector has already implicated great uncle’s losses—accusing our household, and demanding compensation from his nephew Wang Zisheng and cousin Wang Ren. My two nephews were so frightened that they called me for help. I saw them in a state of panic, and because of our relationship with Madam Wang and you, I agreed. I went out to handle it, but by the time I returned, they had already gone inside. I ended up running all the way—how many times must I run?!”
Fengjie, hearing all this, finally realized the true state of affairs regarding Wang Ren’s conduct. Yet, knowing that he was naturally protective and stubborn, she said, “Forget it. After all, he is your dear eldest uncle. Moreover, as for this matter, both the deceased great uncle and the living second uncle are grateful to you. Enough; don’t say more. You must let me plead on their behalf, so that no one else bears the burden or ends up cursing me behind my back.” Tears streamed down Fengjie’s face as she removed her covers, sat up, and carefully combed her hair while draping herself in fine garments.
Jia Lian remarked, “You need not be so aggrieved. I didn’t say anything about you. Besides, when I’m out, you’re not in a good state—if I come back, they are still asleep. Have we not always had this custom among our elders? You now act like a gentleman, and if you’re not careful, tomorrow I’ll end up hating all these people. What is the use?”
Fengjie, with a bitter laugh, replied, “Why speak so harshly? It’s early, and what’s the use of shouting? Who told you to agree in the first place? Since you did, you must bear it; after all, when troubles arise, it is not as if others have nothing to do. Ask them tomorrow, and let them speak. Besides, Third Sister is wise—unlike those hypocrites who always have something to admonish, he will eventually change.”
Just then, someone from the other wing called, “Aunt, Second Mistress, please come over!” This message was delivered by Qiu Shi’an. Baochai said, “He’s forgotten something again—he’s sent for her to come back? Has he forgotten something?” Qiu Shi’an explained, “I asked the little maid, and she said, ‘Second Master forgot a word; he told me to return and tell Second Mistress: if you are coming, come quickly; if not, don’t just stand out in the cold!’” This made Jia Mu, Fengjie, and the old matron of the household burst into laughter. Baochai’s face flushed scarlet, and she playfully spat at Qiu Shi’an, “You silly thing—are you really so flustered that you must run off complaining?” Qiu Shi’an laughed and went back to scold the little maid.
Bèimì ran after them, exclaiming, “Second Master called me so insistently to come back and report; if I don’t say something, they’ll scold me again!” The little maid laughed and ran off to report back. Jia Mu then said to Baochai, “Go on, spare him this worry.” With that, Jia Mu and Fengjie exchanged a few words before Li Shian’s attendant was called to see them. Li Shian’s attendant explained that earlier the second mistress and the old lady had discussed matters, and over there they had been using Zizhuan to run errands. Before Li Wan could reply, Zizhuan interjected, “Aunt Lin, please come in first! When someone dies, we naturally go out—but why must we…?” Her words faltered, and she rephrased, “Besides, while we are here caring for the patient, our clothes are not clean. Miss Lin still has some strength; she calls out to me from time to time.”
Li Wan explained softly, “Truly, Miss Lin and this maid are bound by fate from a previous life. It is only that Xueyan was brought from the South; she pays him no heed—but Zizhuan, I fear, is inseparable from him at the moment.”
Li Shian’s attendant, upon hearing this, could only remain silent. Observing Zizhuan crying like a waterfall, he managed a faint smile and said, “Zizhuan, your idle chatter matters little—but how am I to explain this to the old lady? Moreover, did you not inform the second mistress?”
Before he could finish, Ping’er came out and asked, “What did you tell Second Mistress?” Li Shian’s attendant repeated the earlier conversation. Ping’er lowered her head and said, “Very well, then let’s send Sister Xue away.”
Li Wan asked, “Is Xueyan up to it?”
Ping’er whispered a few words into Li Wan’s ear; Li Wan nodded and said, “Then send Xueyan—it matters no more.”
Li Shian’s attendant inquired, “Can Xueyan manage?”
Ping’er replied, “She can—she’s as capable as any.”
Li Shian’s attendant said, “Then, Miss, come quickly with me. I will first return to the old lady and Second Mistress. This was decided by Grand Aunt and Miss Lin; when I return, each of you will report back to Second Mistress.”
Li Wan said, “Very well. Even at your age, you shouldn’t neglect these minor matters.”
Li Shian’s attendant laughed, “It’s not that we neglect it; firstly, this matter between the old lady and Second Mistress is so obscure that we cannot fully grasp it; moreover, there is Grand Aunt and Miss Lin to consider.”
Just then, Ping’er had called Xueyan out. Xueyan, having recently been chided by Daiyu for being “childish,” gathered herself and changed into fresh clothes, then followed Li Shian’s attendant. Soon after, Ping’er and Li Wan exchanged a few more words, and Li Wan urged Ping’er to hasten so that Li Shian’s attendant might have his matter resolved. Ping’er agreed, turned a corner, and saw Li Shian’s attendant leading Xueyan ahead. She called out, “I’ll take her in. You, please inform Uncle Lin to prepare Miss Lin’s things. I’ll return and report to Grand Aunt.” Li Shian’s attendant nodded and departed.

Meanwhile, Xueyan, watching all this, thought of her own lost sweetheart and felt sorrow—but in front of Jia Mu and Fengjie she dared not reveal it. She mused, “Baoyu once lived in a world as sweet as honey, yet now he is never seen—whether he is truly ill or merely feigning madness, I cannot tell. Perhaps he fears that if word of the lost jade spreads and he is forced to play the fool, his heart will harden; therefore, he pretends to be mad. I should watch him closely, see if he continues his foolish antics. Could it be that he still acts like a child today?” Lost in thought, she crept to the door of one of the inner rooms and peered in secret. At that moment, though Baoyu was still in his daze from the loss of his jade, he had heard that Lin Daiyu had become his wife—a notion that, from time immemorial, was the most pleasing of events. Suddenly, his body seemed to regain vigor, though not as keenly as before. Fengjie’s clever plan had worked perfectly. He was eager to see Daiyu, and he longed for the marriage to be consummated that very day—so much so that he danced with joy, uttering a few foolish words that bore little resemblance to the incoherent state he had been in during his illness.

Xueyan, witnessing this, felt both anger and sorrow—she knew nothing of Baoyu’s inner thoughts, and when they parted, each went their separate ways.

At that moment, Baoyu called for Xiren to help him dress anew and sat in Madam Wang’s room. Observing Fengjie and You Shi bustling about and hearing that the auspicious moment had not yet arrived, he asked Xiren, “Why hasn’t Miss Lin come to the garden yet?”
Xiren, barely able to suppress a laugh, replied, “She is waiting for the proper time.” Soon, she overheard Fengjie and Madam Wang discussing, “Even though the bride’s trappings are in order, there is no need for lively music outside—our custom requires a proper wedding ceremony, not a sparse affair. I have called upon the women trained in music and drama to enliven the event.”
Madam Wang nodded, “That will do.”
Before long, a magnificent sedan chair entered through the main gate. Delicate music played, and the family ushered the new couple out with great ceremony. Twelve pairs of imperial lanterns were arranged in perfect order—a display both fresh and refined. The herald invited the newlyweds to exit the sedan; as Baoyu beheld the sight, he saw that Sister Bao was dressed in red and veiled, supported as she disembarked. Who was to support the bride? It turned out to be Xueyan.
Baoyu, upon seeing Xueyan, mused, “Why is it that Zizhuan isn’t here? It is Xueyan after all!” He reasoned, “Yes, Xueyan hails from our southern branch, while Zizhuan is from our own family—naturally, she need not accompany her.” In that moment, seeing Xueyan filled him with a joy reminiscent of when he last saw Daiyu.
The herald continued with the ceremony, bowing to heaven and earth, calling on Jia Mu to receive four formal bows, then inviting Jia Zheng and his wife, and others, to ascend the hall. After all the rites were performed, the couple was escorted into the bridal chamber. All subsequent customs followed the established practices of the household—no further details are necessary. Jia Zheng, acting on behalf of Jia Mu, dared not question the notion of a “restorative marriage,” and he was pleased to see Baoyu appear so dignified.

After the newlyweds settled, it was time for the unveiling. Fengjie, ever cautious, had already arranged for Jia Mu and Madam Wang to be present. At that moment, Baoyu, still somewhat dazed, approached the bride and said, “Sister, are you well? You haven’t been seen for so long—why are you still veiled?” Just as he moved to lift the veil, he startled Madam Wang so much that she broke into a cold sweat.
Baoyu then reconsidered, “Lin is prone to anger; I must not act hastily.” He paused, then could not contain himself any longer and advanced to lift the veil. The attendant quickly intervened, and Xiren stepped aside, while Ying’er came forward to assist. Baoyu opened his eyes and thought he saw Baochai. Doubtful, he took a lamp in one hand and rubbed his eyes with the other—sure enough, wasn’t it Baochai? Her makeup was splendid, her figure graceful, her hair elegantly arranged, and her gaze demure—a vision of refined beauty.
Baoyu was momentarily stunned, then noticed Ying’er standing by, while Xueyan disappeared. In his muddled state, he presumed it was all a dream and stood there dumbfounded. The assembled guests helped him sit down, and all fell silent. Fearing that his illness might relapse, Jia Mu himself approached to comfort him. Fengjie and You Shi then ushered Baochai into the inner room. Baochai, for her part, remained silently demure.
After a while, Baoyu, regaining some composure, saw Jia Mu and Madam Wang seated nearby. He softly asked Xiren, “Where am I? Is this not all a dream?”
Xiren replied, “Today is a joyous day—speak not of dreams! Father is waiting outside.”
Baoyu, in a low voice, pointed to a beautiful lady seated at a distance, “Who is that lovely one?”
Xiren, stifling a laugh, finally said after a long pause, “That is your new Second Mistress.”
Everyone turned and laughed. Baoyu then exclaimed, “How foolish! You say ‘Second Mistress’—but who is she, exactly?”
Xiren replied, “It is Miss Bao.”
Baoyu then asked, “And what of Lin?”
Xiren replied, “Father has decreed that you marry Miss Bao—there is no room for Lin!”
Baoyu protested, “Did I not just see Lin? And what about Xueyan—did I not see her?”
He added in confusion, “What is all this about?”
Fengjie stepped forward and gently admonished, “Baoyu, you must leave now—what are you waiting for? You are no longer a child. While others are busy with their hair and attire, you are still idling about here, as if you never tire of staying indoors. Are you not afraid the maids will laugh at you?” She laughed softly and winked at him.
Though Baoyu felt slightly embarrassed, he said nothing further; his face turned a deep red, and he was at a loss for words.
At that moment, Xiren brought tea, and Baoyu accepted a bag of tobacco. Fengjie laughed and said, “Second Mistress, come and dress quickly.”
Baoyu, meanwhile, continued his banter, fidgeting about. Fengjie chided, “You must go now—there is a man waiting for the ladies to depart with him.”
Baoyu replied, “I simply find my clothes unsatisfactory. Why, just the other year, I wore that piece Grandmother gave me, and it was so splendid!”
Fengjie, irritated, said, “Why don’t you wear it then?”
Baoyu explained, “I mustn’t wear it too early.”
Fengjie suddenly recalled her misstep and regretted her words. Fortunately, Baochai was also from the Wang family and related internally, so even though the maids nearby felt embarrassed, Xiren added, “Second Mistress does not mind if you wear it; she won’t object.”
Fengjie then said, “What is the reason?”
Xiren replied, “I told Second Mistress that our dear Master’s actions are nothing short of miraculous. One year, on second uncle’s birthday, Grandmother gave him this very garment—and who would have thought it was burned that day? My mother was gravely ill, and I wasn’t home. At that time, even Qingwen was there; when I heard that, she sewed it through the night, and it wasn’t discovered until the next day. Last year, on a cold day at school, I had Bèimì fetch it for him to wear—and then our Master, upon seeing it, recalled Qingwen and declared that he would never wear it again, ordering me to keep it for a lifetime.” Fengjie, not able to finish, said, “You mention Qingwen—such a pity for our dear child. She was so lovely and skilled with her hands, yet only her sharp tongue troubled her. Alas, our Master’s wife, upon hearing those rumors, nearly lost her life. And one more thing—on that day I saw a woman from the Liu household, whose daughter, named Wu’er, bore an uncanny resemblance to Qingwen. I intended to call her in, but when I asked her mother, she said very little. I thought that since the little red was with you in Second Master’s room and had not been returned, perhaps we should bring Wu’er in to replace her. Ping’er said, ‘Aunt, on that day, we decided that anyone who looked like that should not be placed in Second Master’s room.’ So I dropped the idea. Now that Second Master is married, what use is it? I wonder if Second Master would be willing…? But if he is still thinking of Qingwen, then Wu’er would simply remind him.”
Baoyu, who had intended to leave, was struck dumb by these words.
Xiren said, “Why wouldn’t he be willing? They planned to bring him in long ago, but because of what the mistress said, they delayed it.”
Fengjie replied, “Then tomorrow I shall have him brought in. The ladies are with me.”
Baoyu, overjoyed, finally went over to see Jia Mu. Meanwhile, Baochai was dressing.
Fengjie, seeing the affectionate exchange between the couple, recalled Jia Lian’s earlier state and was deeply pained. She couldn’t remain seated; she approached Baochai with a smile and said, “Come, let’s go to Madam Wang’s room.” Laughing, they went to see Jia Mu. Baoyu was meanwhile on his way to visit Jia Mu at his uncle’s place. Jia Mu nodded, “Go on—but take care to drink little wine and return quickly so that your health is preserved.”
Baoyu agreed and set off, but soon turned back and whispered something into Baochai’s ear. Baochai smiled, “Yes, now go on.” She hurriedly urged him away.
After Jia Mu, Fengjie, and Baochai had exchanged a few words, Tan Chun entered with a message: “Second Master has sent Bèimì back with a message for Second Mistress.” Baochai said, “He forgot something again—he wants me to come back?”
Tan Chun replied, “I asked the little maid, and she said, ‘Second Master forgot a word; he told me to return and tell Second Mistress: if you are going, come quickly; if not, don’t linger out in the cold.’” This made Jia Mu, Fengjie, and the matron along with the maids burst into laughter. Baochai’s face turned scarlet, and she playfully spat at Tan Chun, “You silly thing—does it take so long for you to run around and deliver a message?”
Tan Chun laughed and went back to send the little maid to scold Bèimì. Bèimì, running after them, called out, “Second Master called me so insistently to come back and report—if I don’t speak, they’ll scold me again. Now that I’ve told them, they’re still cursing me!” The little maid ran back to report this.
Jia Mu then told Baochai, “You go on and take care of him so he need not worry.”
Thus, Jia Mu and Fengjie spoke only a few words before Baochai, not wishing to embarrass Bèimì further, left.

Later that day, in the Sanhua Temple, an elder nun from the temple arrived to pay respects to Jia Mu. She greeted Fengjie and sat down for tea. Jia Mu inquired, “Why haven’t you come here before?”
The nun replied, “I’ve been busy performing good deeds in the temple these days. Several titled noblewomen have been holding court here from time to time, so I haven’t had a moment to come; today I have come to pay respects to the ancestral spirit. Tomorrow, another devotee will be performing good deeds—will the old ancestor be pleased? If so, please join in the joy.”
Jia Mu asked, “What good deed?”
The nun replied, “The other day, in the mansion of Lord Wang, there were strange occurrences—apparitions and ghostly visions—and that very night the mistress even claimed to have seen the departed old master. Consequently, yesterday in my temple, I was told to offer vows and burn incense before the statue of Sanhua Bodhisattva, and to perform a forty-nine-day ritual of both land and water to ensure the family’s peace, the ascension of the departed, and blessings for the living. Thus, I had no time to come and see you.”
Fengjie, who had long despised such matters, had been haunted by last night’s ghostly encounter, and now hearing the nun’s words, her skepticism softened a bit. She asked, “Who is this Sanhua Bodhisattva? How is it that he can ward off evil and exorcise ghosts?”
The nun explained, “Madam, if you wish to know, allow me to tell you. This Sanhua Bodhisattva is of ancient origin, with remarkable cultivation. Born in a great orchard in the Western Paradise, his parents, who made their living by gathering firewood, once raised him. When they saw that a white aura burst from his head, they thought him a demon and abandoned him behind the Ice Mountain. But fate intervened—a wise old monkey once ventured out to forage and saw the white energy surging from the boy’s head, causing even tigers and wolves to retreat. Realizing his extraordinary origins, the monkey brought him into a cave and raised him. Over a thousand years later, the boy ascended and became divine. Even now on that mountain one can see places where scriptures are recited and where heavenly flowers scatter in the breeze. Those who offer prayers there are sure to receive miracles and be saved from suffering.”
Fengjie asked, “And what evidence is there of this?”
The nun replied, “Madam, what proof does any Buddha require? Even if he were to tell lies, it is only to comfort a few hearts. Countless wise men throughout the ages have been moved by his miracles. Madam, consider that the incense of Buddha’s family has never been extinguished; his blessings are believed to ensure national prosperity and to work wonders. People trust in him.”
Fengjie, now convinced by reason, said, “In that case, tomorrow I shall try my luck. Does your temple have divination lots?”
The nun replied, “Our lots are most efficacious; tomorrow, Madam, you shall draw one and know the truth.”
Jia Mu then said, “Very well, let’s wait until the first day of the lunar month, then you go and draw a lot.” The nun finished her tea, went off to greet Madam Wang in the other quarters, and left the matter aside.

Meanwhile, that day Baoyu was asleep at midday. When he awoke, he found Baochai was absent and was about to ask where she had gone when, suddenly, Baochai entered.
Baoyu asked, “Where have you been? I haven’t seen you for so long.”
Baochai smiled and said, “I went to Fengjie to have a divination lot read.”
Hearing this, Baoyu asked, “And what did it say?”
Baochai recited the lot, then added, “Everyone in the household speaks highly of it; from what I see, the phrase ‘return home in splendid attire’ holds a deeper meaning. We shall see further details later.”
Baoyu said, “You are being overly suspicious—don’t try to interpret divine words on your own. ‘Returning home in splendid attire’ has always been understood as a very auspicious sign. What alternative interpretation could there be?”
Before Baochai could explain further, Madam Wang’s attendant came to summon Second Mistress. Baochai immediately went with her.
(What follows will be revealed in the next installment.)

End of Chapter 101
Chapter 102
Calamities in the Ningguo Household; In the Grand View Garden, Talismans and Holy Water Repel Demonic Forces

It happened that Lady Wang sent for Baochai, and Baochai quickly came to pay her respects. Lady Wang said, “Now that your Third Sister is soon to be married, all of you, as her elder sisters-in-law, must counsel him—this is what sisterhood is about. Besides, he is a sensible boy, and I think you two get along well. But I have heard that whenever Baoyu hears that Third Sister is leaving, he breaks down in tears. You must urge him to steady himself. Meanwhile, my own health is failing—suffering from constant ailments—and your Second Sister’s condition oscillates day by day. You, being of a clear mind, must handle all these matters properly. Do not simply keep everything bottled up and refuse to offend anyone. In the future, these family affairs will all fall on your shoulders.”
Baochai readily agreed. Lady Wang added, “There’s one more matter: Yesterday your Second Sister brought a maid from the Liu family, saying she should be placed in your room.”
Baochai replied, “Just today, Ping’er brought word that it was the decision of both the Mistress and Second Mistress.”
Lady Wang nodded, “Yes, indeed; your Second Sister told me, and I see no harm in letting it be. However, I noticed that the child’s eyes and brows do not seem calm. Initially, when the fox-like maid in Baoyu’s room was troublesome, I had driven several away—you know the story, and so they were sent back home. Now, with you here, things are not quite as before. I’m telling you this only so you keep an eye on things. In your room, even Xiren’s child can be managed.”
Baochai promised to do so and exchanged a few more words before going on. After the meal, she visited Tan Chun’s quarters, where heartfelt and earnest words of farewell were exchanged—details of which need not be recounted here.

The next day, as Tan Chun was about to depart, she came to bid farewell to Baoyu. Baoyu found it hard to part. Tan Chun spoke of general family ethics and principles that at first made Baoyu lower his head in silence, but eventually his sorrow turned to a sort of resigned cheer, as if he had come to some awakening. Reassured, Tan Chun confidently took her leave, boarding a sedan chair and departing by water and land.

In earlier times all the sisters had lived in the Grand View Garden; but after the passing of Consort Jia, the garden was no longer maintained. By the time Baoyu was to be married—with Lin Daiyu dead, Shi Xiangyun having returned home, and Baoqin remaining in the house—the garden had become sparsely populated. Moreover, the weather was cold, so Li Wan along with her younger sisters (Tan Chun and Xi Chun) moved back to their old quarters. During festive times, when the blossoms and moonlight graced the evenings, they would still meet and play together. But now, with Tan Chun gone and Baoyu, following his illness, hardly ever leaving his room, there were few joyful souls left in the garden. Thus the garden became lonely, with only a handful of caretakers residing there.

That same day, You Shi came to see Tan Chun off. As it was late and to save the trouble of using a sedan chair, she took the old “Ning Mansion” side door that had been opened in the garden years ago. The sight that met her eyes was one of desolation: the pavilions and terraces still stood, and along the parapet the walls were planted like a garden, evoking a sense of profound loss. On returning home, she began to feel feverish. After a day or two of struggling, she eventually collapsed. Although daytime fevers could be tolerated, the extreme heat at night drove her into delirious rambling.
Jia Zhen hastily summoned a physician who examined her and said it was due to a severe cold that had invaded her Foot-Yangming and Stomach meridians, leading to confused delirium—as if she were seeing visions and her vital energy was blocked by a great impurity. Despite taking two doses, her condition did not improve; indeed, her agitation grew worse.
Alarmed, Jia Zhen called for Jia Rong, saying, “Find out if there is a good doctor out there; bring in a few more to take a look.”
Jia Rong replied, “The doctor we saw a few days ago was quite renowned. I fear Mother’s illness might not be cured by medicine alone.”
Jia Zhen retorted, “Nonsense—if she does not take medicine, then so be it!”
Jia Rong explained, “It is not that she is incurable, but remember, just a few days ago, Mother went to the West Mansion and returned by walking through the garden—immediately upon arriving home, she developed a fever. Perhaps she bumped into something. Outside, there is a soothsayer known as ‘Maoban Xian,’ a man from the South whose divinations are remarkably accurate. Why not have him come to cast an oracle? If his reading is auspicious, we follow his advice; if not, we shall call in another fine doctor.”
Jia Zhen, troubled by this suggestion, immediately had Maoban Xian summoned. In the study, after sipping tea, Jia Zhen announced, “The household has asked me—what is it that you are divining?”
Jia Rong said, “Mother is ill; we need to consult the oracle.”
Maoban Xian replied, “In that case, wash your hands with clean water and set up an incense table; allow me to cast an oracle.”
Soon the servants arranged everything. Maoban Xian produced his divination tube from his bosom, walked to the altar with a respectful bow, and began shaking the tube in his hand, chanting:

  “In humble obeisance to the Taiji and the Two Forms, whose subtle interplay births endless change—may the divine forces of Fuxi, King Wen, Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, the four great sages, witness our plea. I, the humble official Jia, pray for my Mother’s recovery. May misfortune turn to fortune, and may calamity be averted. First, I call upon the inner three lines...”

He poured the coins from the tube into a dish, declaring, “The first three lines read ‘Chiao’ (交, ‘interaction’).” He shook the tube again; this time it read “Dan” (单, ‘single’). The third line again showed “Chiao.” He collected the coins, shook the tube once more, and it read “Dan Chai Dan” (单拆单, ‘split single’).
Maoban Xian then gathered his divination tools and sat down to interpret: “This hexagram is ‘Wei Ji’ (未济). The ‘world’ line is the third line—noon fire signifies a brotherly struggle over wealth, and inherent misfortune is to be expected. Now, as you inquire for your Mother’s condition, the auspicious element lies in the first line, indicating that the parental line is disturbed by an inauspicious official spirit. The fifth line too reveals another layer of that spirit. I observe that your Mother’s illness is not trivial. Yet there is hope: the water of the Zi hour is subdued, and the wood of the Yin period produces fire. The movement in the world line suggests that a descendant may counteract this malevolence. Furthermore, as the sun and moon sustain life, if in two days the Zi water ghost dissipates and the energies harmonize by the Xu day, then all shall be well. However, changes in the parental lines warn that your late father’s influence might also be a factor. Moreover, if the world line is overly burdened, and if water is in excess while earth is deficient, the prognosis will be poor.”
After murmuring a while, he stroked his beard and said, “I see a saving grace: on the Si hour, a noble spirit appears, which I call ‘the return of the soul from the realm of the departed’—this indicates that after initial sorrow, there will be relief, provided you proceed with caution.”
Jia Rong presented the fee for the oracle and hurriedly reported to Jia Zhen, saying, “Mother’s illness, according to the oracle, is due to an unfortunate encounter with a ‘hidden white tiger’ in the old house at dusk.”
Jia Zhen exclaimed, “You say that Mother, on her way back from the garden the other day, collided with something? Do you not recall that your Second Aunt, after visiting the garden, fell ill immediately? Although she did not witness anything overt, the maids and servants later said that on the hillside there was some shaggy, hairy thing, with eyes as large as lanterns that could speak, which drove Second Aunt back in fright, precipitating her illness.”
Jia Rong said, “Do you not remember? I even heard from Bèimì in the house of Second Uncle that Qingwen was said to have become a deity among the hibiscus flowers in the garden; that when Lin Daiyu died, there was music in the air—thus it seems that our Master must have been troubled by some strange flower. Think: with so many apparitions in the garden, what chance is there? When there are many people, the yang energy is strong and constant comings and goings pose no threat; but in these desolate times, Mother is at risk of encountering something dreadful—perhaps even being kicked by some unseen force, or colliding with something. The oracle appears to be accurate.”
Jia Zhen asked, “So does that mean there is indeed an obstacle?”
Jia Rong replied, “He says that by the Xu day everything will gradually improve—if it resolves a couple of days early, or at worst, a couple of days late.”
Jia Zhen asked, “What does that signify exactly?”
Jia Rong said, “The soothsayer fears that if even a slight misfortune remains, it might disturb your late father’s spirit as well.”
Before the conversation could continue, voices were heard from inside: “Grandmother is getting up to go to the garden; the maids can no longer contain themselves!”
Jia Zhen, Fengjie, and the older female servants all laughed. Jia Zhen then ordered that some paper money be purchased and sent to the garden to be burned as an offering. Sure enough, that night Mother perspired profusely, and the eerie atmosphere gradually subsided. By the Xu day, conditions slowly improved.

Thus, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred—soon it was rumored throughout the Grand View Garden that a demon now haunted its grounds. The caretakers, so terrified, ceased their usual tasks of pruning, repairing trees, and irrigating fruit; at first, no one dared walk at night, for fear of being accosted by animals; later, even during the day people began to venture out only in armed groups. In time, Jia Zhen himself fell ill and, instead of seeking a physician, resorted to burning paper offerings and making vows in the garden; the severity of his condition varied, with some merely kneeling to offer paper, while others performed elaborate rites. Consequently, both the Rong and Ning households became increasingly fearful. The caretakers, their hopes dashed, all wished to leave the garden. Many began to spread rumors, attributing various demonic forms to the wild vegetation, and eventually some even proposed moving out and sealing the garden gates so that no one would dare enter. In the end, the splendid pavilions, lofty towers, and resplendent halls became overrun by wild animals.

Meanwhile, Qingwen’s cousin, Wu Gui, was residing at the garden gate. Since Qingwen’s death, his wife had heard that she had become a flower deity, and every night she dared not leave the house. One day, Wu Gui went out to buy provisions and returned late. His wife, already afflicted with a slight cold and having taken the wrong medicine during the day, was found that evening by Wu Gui at home—she had died on the kang. The locals, seeing that his wife’s condition was so dire, claimed that a demon had scaled the wall and sucked the life essence from her, causing her death. In panic, the old lady became extremely anxious and ordered many to encircle Baoyu’s residence, patrolling and keeping watch. The little maids even said they saw a red-faced figure, or a very handsome woman—such raucous claims terrified Baoyu, who was frightened every day. Fortunately, Baochai maintained order; upon hearing the maids’ wild tales, she scolded them, and the rumors subsided somewhat. Yet the general restlessness of the household, with everyone growing suspicious and paranoid, led to more night watches, which in turn disrupted the family’s peace and increased expenses.

Only Jia She remained skeptical, remarking, “What ghost in our garden? There is no demon here.” One fine, breezy day, he gathered several family members, armed with tools, and ventured into the garden to inspect for any unusual activity. Despite admonishments from others, he persisted. In the garden, the atmosphere was indeed eerie and oppressive. Jia She ventured forward, and his entourage all peered cautiously. One young relative, already gripped by fear, suddenly cried out as he turned around—he saw a dazzling object of many colors leap past him. “Oh my!” he exclaimed, his legs buckling and he collapsed. Jia She hurried back to question him. The youth, panting, replied, “I saw a demon—a creature with a yellow face, red beard, and green clothes! It dashed into a hollow behind the trees in the hills.”
Jia She, now fearful himself, asked, “Did everyone see it?”
A few of the servants, careful not to disturb their master, replied, “We did not dare to observe closely because the Master was present. We managed to keep it under control.”
Their words made Jia She even more frightened, and he dared not proceed further. Hastily, he returned and ordered the servants, “Do not mention this; just say you searched and found nothing.” Deep in his heart he believed that they should call upon a true exorcist from a renowned household to drive away the evil. But the family, ever the instigators, continued to spread rumors—so much so that when Jia She admitted his fear, they added their own speculations until everyone was talking. With no alternative, Jia She had no choice but to invite a Taoist priest to the garden to perform a ritual to exorcise the evil.
They chose an auspicious day and set up an altar in the main ancestral hall. They installed statues of the Three Pure Ones, and on either side they displayed the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions along with the four great generals—Ma, Zhao, Wen, and Zhou. Below, images of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Generals were arranged. Incense, flowers, and lanterns filled the hall; gongs and drums and ritual instruments lined the sides, and flags representing the five directions were inserted. The Department of Taoist Rituals assigned forty-nine Taoist attendants, and the altar was cleansed for an entire day. After three judges performed the rites of incense and water-sampling, they beat the ritual drum. All the priests donned seven-star crowns and nine-palace, eight-trigram robes, stepped onto cloud-walkers, and carried ceremonial jade tablets as they respectfully entreated the heavens. They recited the Dongxuan Jing for a whole day, to dispel calamities, drive away evil, and attract blessings, after which a roster was posted proclaiming:

  “Great Master of the Sacred Talismans of the Three Realms—Taiyi, Hunyuan, and Shangqing—exemplifying the divine law; all the deities of our realm are summoned to attend the altar.”

That day, all the men of both households, emboldened by the priests’ exorcism, flocked to the garden. They declared, “What a grand display—when the deities are summoned and the supernatural forces are mobilized, no matter how many demons there are, they will all be driven away!” The crowd pressed forward to the altar.
They saw the young Taoist acolytes raise their banners and stand fixed in the five directions, awaiting the priests’ command. Three principal priests then took their positions before the altar: one holding a treasured sword and a vial of sacred water, one bearing a seven-star black flag, and one wielding a peach-wood demon-beating whip. Suddenly, the ritual instruments fell silent. The head officer struck his token three times, and the priests began reciting incantations; the five directional banners dispersed into a swirling array. The priests descended from the altar and instructed their disciples to proceed to the various pavilions, halls, corridors, and even along the rocky cliffs and streams, sprinkling sacred water and using their swords to trace protective symbols. They returned, struck their tokens again, and raised the seven-star flag in a ceremonial salute. The assembled attendants grouped together and then, wielding demon-beating whips, struck at the empty air three times.
The assembled family members all claimed that they had captured the demons, jostling to see them; yet upon close inspection, no tangible form was found. The priests then ordered the acolytes to fetch jars and containers, into which they collected the demonic qi, sealed them with red talismans, and with calligraphic strokes inscribed magical charms. These were then taken away and placed beneath the temple tower as a ward, and the altar was disassembled and the deities thanked and dismissed.
Jia She respectfully bowed and thanked the priests. Meanwhile, Jia Rong and the younger brothers privately laughed, saying, “With such a grand display, I wonder what kind of demons we might actually capture—if only we could see them clearly. Who knows, maybe the demons have truly been vanquished?”
Hearing this, Jia Zhen scolded, “Foolishness! Demons are but the aggregation of qi; when they disperse, they are no more. They have merely contained the demonic energy. That is all that has been achieved—that is the extent of the magic.”
Though many were skeptical, no one dared to challenge the proceedings further.
The servants, hearing only that the demons had been captured and driven away, were not overly alarmed, and soon the matter was not mentioned again. Jia Zhen and Jia Rong recovered from their illnesses and all praised the miraculous power of the priests.
Only one young servant joked, “I never knew about all those commotions. When I entered the garden with the Master, I distinctly saw a giant wild cock fly by! Our superiors even concocted a little lie on his behalf, so that the Master took it seriously. It was quite a lively altar scene.” Although some heard this, none would believe it, and no one dared to dwell on it.

One day, when Jia She had nothing pressing to do, he resolved to have a few household servants moved into the garden to guard it at night—fearing that malefactors might lurk. Just as he was about to issue orders, Jia Lian entered, greeted everyone, and reported, “Today, when I went to our elder uncle’s house, I heard a bizarre rumor that our Second Uncle has been summoned by the regional commander for negligence in overseeing his subordinates and for reimposing heavy grain taxes, with orders for his dismissal.”
Jia She was startled and said, “Surely it’s just a rumor? Just the other day, your Second Uncle brought a letter stating that on an auspicious day, Tan Chun escorted your sister off to the frontier, the journey was calm and peaceful, and the commander even hosted a banquet in celebration of a new kinship. Who among our relatives would dare to accuse him? Never mind—go to the Ministry of Personnel, verify it, and report back to me.”
Jia Lian immediately went to the ministry and, in less than half a day, returned saying, “I have confirmed that Second Uncle has indeed been summoned. The order states that because of the negligence of his subordinates and his harsh reimposition of grain taxes—which have oppressed the people—though he is a good man at heart, he has been demoted three ranks and ordered to return to the capital immediately.”
Jia She then ordered, “Tell your aunt but do not mention this to the old lady.” Jia Lian went to report this to Lady Wang.

A Poisoning Plot Unfolds—Jin Gui Self-Immolation; In the Muddled Realm of Chan Rain Village, One Encounters Familiar Shadows

Below is the translated text:

When Jia Lian had finished briefing Lady Wang about the various troubles, the next day he went to the ministry, made all the necessary arrangements, and later returned to inform Lady Wang that matters at the Ministry of Personnel had been settled. Lady Wang then said, “Have you confirmed everything? If this is indeed true, then the old master is willing—and the entire family can rest easy. But what sort of outsider would dare meddle like this? If things do not return as planned, I fear those scoundrels might even imperil the old master’s very life.”
Jia Lian replied, “How did you know?”
Lady Wang explained, “Ever since your Second Uncle was sent on external duty, not a single coin has come home; our funds have been nearly exhausted. Just look at those men who went with the old master—while their own men remain away, the concubines have dressed up in gold and silver, surely secretly stashing money from outside? Let your uncle behave as he pleases. But if something goes awry, not only will his office be ruined, even our ancestral positions could be lost.”
Jia Lian murmured, “You speak truly. I only heard a report that frightened me terribly—I waited until I could confirm every detail before feeling relieved. I even hoped that the old master would remain a reputable official in the capital for years, safeguarding our family name. Once Grandmother hears of this, she too will be at ease—as long as you speak with some leniency.”
Lady Wang replied, “I understand. Go and inquire further.”
Jia Lian agreed and was about to leave when suddenly an agitated maid from Aunt Xue’s household rushed in. Without even offering proper salutations, she burst out, “Our mistress has sent me to tell you, dear Second Mistress, that there’s been a terrible uproar in our family again!”
Lady Wang asked, “What sort of matter?”
The maid cried, “It’s dreadful—dreadful indeed!”
Lady Wang huffed, “Foolish woman! If there is something urgent, say it at once!”
The maid continued, “Our Second Master is not home; not a single man is here, and if this matter comes to light, what will we do? Mistress has ordered that several men be sent out to set things in order.”
Lady Wang, puzzled, demanded, “What exactly must our men do?”
The maid replied in a trembling voice, “Our Grand Aunt is dead!”
Lady Wang spat, “Bah! So a woman has died—why make such a fuss?”
The maid insisted, “Not that she died peacefully—the death was chaotic and violent. Mistress urgently demands that someone be sent to settle matters!”
Before the maid could finish, Lady Wang scolded, “You muddle-brained wench! Jia Lian, why don’t you go and check on this matter instead of listening to her babble?”
The maid, overhearing the order “don’t mind her,” sulked and ran off. Meanwhile, Aunt Xue was in a state of panic, and after much delay the maid returned, asking, “Who did the Second Mistress send for?”
The maid sighed, “No one of importance. It seems that, despite the many close ties in our family, she won’t even care for us—she even scolded me for being muddle-headed.”
Aunt Xue, both angry and anxious, retorted, “The Second Mistress is an outsider! I raised my daughter myself—why should she not care?” The maid suddenly realized her error and said, “That’s true; I must go now.”
Just then, Jia Lian appeared and, after greeting Aunt Xue, said irritably, “My aunt already knows of our misfortune, and she’s pressed me here to find out exactly what is going on. She insists that the Second Mistress handle it immediately.”
Aunt Xue, already in tears from anger, quickly said, “Let our Second Master handle it. I’ve always said that our Second Mistress is the kindest to me—if only that old fool wouldn’t muddle things up, we wouldn’t be in such a mess. Please, sit down and let me explain slowly.”
She continued, “It isn’t for some trivial matter—it’s because our daughter-in-law did not have a good death.”
Jia Lian asked, “Do you mean that she died because of some misdeed or ill fortune?”
Aunt Xue replied bitterly, “If that were so, it would be for our brother’s fault—that man used to run about barefoot and disheveled, causing such a ruckus day after day. Then, when word spread that he was accused of a capital offense, he cried for a time but soon began to apply makeup and behave properly. One day, for reasons unknown, he demanded that Xiangling be sent to keep him company. I said, ‘Leave Baoyu alone—what need is there for Xiangling? Besides, Xiangling is not someone you love; why provoke anger?’ But he would not listen. I had no choice but to send Xiangling into his room. To my pity, Xiangling, though ill, dared not defy me and went with him. Strangely, he treated Xiangling well. I even heard our second uncle’s household’s servant, Bèimì, say that when Qingwen passed away, there was music in the air—and so he must also be troubled by some strange flower. With so many strange apparitions in the garden, what chance is there for peace? When there are many people, the yang energy is strong and constant comings and goings are harmless; but in these lean times, when Mother is out and about, who knows what she might encounter? Perhaps she might even be struck by a wild branch. The oracle seems to be accurate.”
Jia Lian then asked, “So does that mean there is indeed an obstacle?”
Aunt Xue replied, “The oracle says that by the Xu day everything will improve—if it clears a couple of days early, or at worst, a couple of days later.”
Jia Lian pressed, “And what exactly does that mean?”
Aunt Xue explained, “It means the soothsayer fears that if even a slight remnant of misfortune remains, it may trouble your late father’s spirit. And frankly, if your brother remains upset, our family reputation will be ruined.”
Before she could finish, voices inside called out, “Grandmother, please come to the garden—the maids cannot contain themselves any longer!”
Jia Lian, Fengjie, and the older matriarchs burst into laughter. Jia Lian then ordered that paper money be bought and sent to the garden to be burned as an offering. Sure enough, that night, as everyone perspired, the eerie atmosphere gradually subsided; by the Xu day, things slowly improved.

Word of these strange happenings spread like wildfire—from one person to ten, and then to a hundred. Soon it was rumored that the Grand View Garden was now haunted by demons, frightening the caretakers into neglecting their duties of tending the flowers and trees, and even irrigating the orchards. At first, no one dared walk at night for fear of being accosted by wild animals; later, even during the day people ventured out only in armed groups. In time, even Jia Zhen fell ill—resorting to burning paper offerings and praying for blessings rather than seeking medical treatment—while Jia Rong and others also succumbed one after the other. For months on end, both the Rong and Ning households lived in constant fear. Rumors flew that every sound was ominous and every blade of grass was possessed by a demon. The usual routine in the garden ceased altogether, and the various pavilions and lofty halls became overgrown and abandoned, eventually falling prey to wild animals.

Meanwhile, Qingwen’s cousin Wu Gui, who resided near the garden gate, had been troubled ever since Qingwen’s death—his wife, having heard that Qingwen had become a flower deity, dared not leave the house after nightfall. One day, Wu Gui went out to buy provisions and returned late. His wife, already suffering from a cold and having taken the wrong medicine during the day, was found dead on the kang when Wu Gui arrived that evening. The locals, noting her unusual condition, claimed that a demon had crawled over the wall and sucked her life force away, causing her death. Alarmed, the old lady ordered a number of people to encircle Baoyu’s residence and set up patrols and night watches. The little maids whispered that they had seen a red-faced figure or even a strikingly beautiful woman—such rumors terrified Baoyu, who was haunted by fear every day. Fortunately, Baochai maintained order, and when the maids’ gossip reached her, she sternly threatened to punish them, which helped to somewhat dispel the rumors. Nonetheless, the general state of paranoia among the households led to even more frequent night watches, further disrupting the peace and straining the household finances.

Only Jia She remained unconvinced, saying, “What ghost is there in this garden? It’s a fine garden indeed—what demon could possibly reside here?” One clear, breezy day, he gathered several family members, armed with tools, and ventured into the garden to inspect for any unusual occurrences. Despite others’ protests, he persisted. In the garden, the atmosphere was indeed oppressive and filled with an eerie gloom. Jia She pushed forward, and his group peered around nervously. One young relative, overcome with fear, suddenly cried out—he had seen a dazzling, multicolored object leap past him. “Oh my!” he exclaimed, his legs giving way, and he collapsed. Jia She hurried back and inquired of the youth, who panted, “I saw a demon—a creature with a yellow face, a red beard, and green garments! It dashed into a cavern behind the trees on the hill.”
Jia She, now himself somewhat frightened, asked, “Did everyone see it?”
A few servants replied, “We did not dare to watch closely while the Master was present; we managed to keep it hidden.”
Their words made Jia She even more fearful, and he dared not continue. Hastily, he returned and ordered the servants, “Don’t mention this—simply say you searched and found nothing.” Deep down, he believed that they should call upon a proper exorcist from a reputable household to drive out the evil.
But the family, ever prone to stirring up trouble, took the news further by adding their own speculations until everyone was talking. Jia She, with no other choice, had to call a Taoist priest to the garden to perform a ritual to drive out the evil.
They selected an auspicious day and set up an altar in the main ancestral hall. Statues of the Three Pure Ones were installed, flanked by representations of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions along with depictions of the four great generals (Ma, Zhao, Wen, and Zhou), and below were images of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Generals. Incense, floral arrangements, and lanterns filled the hall; gongs, drums, and ritual instruments lined the sides, with flags representing the five directions hoisted. The Department of Taoist Rites dispatched forty-nine Taoist attendants, and they purified the altar for an entire day. After three judges performed the rites of incense and water, they beat the ritual drum. The priests all donned seven-star crowns and robes adorned with the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, stepping onto their cloud-walkers, and carrying ceremonial jade tablets, they respectfully entreated the divine. They recited the Dongxuan Jing all day to dispel calamities and drive away evil, and afterwards, a roster was posted proclaiming:

  “Great Master of the Sacred Talismans of the Three Realms—Taiyi, Hunyuan, and Shangqing—exemplifying the divine law; all deities in our realm are hereby summoned to the altar.”

That day, all the men of both households, emboldened by the priests’ display of supernatural might, crowded into the garden to watch. They declared, “What a magnificent spectacle—when the deities are summoned and the spirits are dispatched, no matter how many demons there are, they will all be driven away!” The crowd pressed to the altar.
They saw the young Taoist acolytes raise their banners, arrange themselves in the five directions, and await the priests’ command. Three main priests then took their positions before the altar: one holding a treasured sword and a vial of sacred water, another bearing a seven-star black banner, and a third brandishing a peach-wood whip to strike at demons. Suddenly, as the ritual instruments fell silent, the head priest struck his token three times and began reciting incantations; the five directional flags then scattered in a swirling display. The priests descended from the altar, instructing their disciples to move to the various pavilions, halls, corridors, and even along the rocky cliffs and streams to sprinkle sacred water and trace protective symbols with their swords. They returned, beat their tokens once more, and raised the seven-star flag in a ceremonial salute. The assembled acolytes gathered their flags and then, wielding their demon-beating whips, struck at the air three times.
The assembled family members all claimed that they had captured the demons, jostling to see them; yet upon closer inspection, no tangible forms could be found. The priests then ordered the acolytes to fetch jars and containers; they collected the demonic qi, sealed it with red talismans, and with bold strokes inscribed charms on paper, which were then taken away and placed beneath the temple tower as a ward, and the altar was subsequently dismantled with thanks offered to the deities. Jia She respectfully bowed and thanked the priests. Jia Rong and the younger brothers exchanged secret laughter, remarking, “With such a grand display, I wonder what sort of demons we might actually capture—if only we could see them clearly. Who knows, perhaps the demons have indeed been captured?”
Jia Zhen overheard and scolded, “Nonsense! Demons are but the gathering of qi; when they disperse, they leave only empty energy. They have simply contained the demonic essence—this is what true magic does.”
Though many were skeptical, no one dared to challenge the proceedings further, and eventually, after the commotion subsided, no one mentioned it again. Jia Zhen and Jia Rong recovered from their illnesses and all praised the miraculous power of the priests. Only one lowly servant joked, “I didn’t even know about all those disturbances—when I entered the garden with the Master that day, I clearly saw a giant wild cock fly by! Our superiors even concocted a little white lie on his behalf so that the Master took it seriously. What a lively altar scene it was!” Although some heard this, none would believe it openly.

One day, when Jia She had nothing pressing to do, he resolved to have several servants moved into the garden to guard it at night—fearing that nefarious men might hide there. Just as he was about to issue orders, Jia Lian entered and greeted everyone. He then said, “Today, at our elder uncle’s house, I heard a wild rumor that our Second Uncle has been summoned by the regional commander for negligence in supervising his subordinates, leading to heavy reimposition of grain taxes and an order for his dismissal.”
Jia She was startled and said, “Surely it’s just a rumor? Just the other day, your Second Uncle brought a letter stating that on an auspicious day, Tan Chun escorted your sister off to the frontier, the journey was calm and peaceful, and the commander even held a banquet to celebrate this newfound kinship.

Jia She then said, “Tell your aunt but do not mention this to Grandmother.”
Jia Lian went and reported this to Lady Wang.

Chapter 104

Drunken Golden-Hammer, Little Minnow, Great Waves; Foolish Young Master’s Lingering Pain Rekindles Old Memories

It happened that just as Jia Yucun was about to make his transition, he saw someone running up to him. The runner panted, “Sir, the temple we just passed has caught fire!” Turning to look, Yucun saw flames streaking across the sky and embers darkening the day. He mused, “How strange! I’ve only just set out and haven’t gone far—where could this fire have come from? Could it be that Shi Yin has met with misfortune here?” About to turn back but also worrying about missing his chance to cross the river, he hesitated. Unable to settle his unease, he asked, “Did you see that old Taoist just now?”

The man replied, “I was with you when we left, but my stomach ached so I wandered a bit. When I looked back, I saw a blaze. It was the temple’s fire—I rushed here to report it, but I didn’t see anyone coming out.” Though Yucun was internally dubious, knowing that one so concerned with fame and fortune wouldn’t willingly return to inspect the scene, he ordered, “Wait here until the fire dies down. Then go in and see if that old Taoist is still there, and report back to me.” The man had no choice but to agree and attend to the task. Yucun himself crossed the river to inspect. After checking several locations, he stopped to rest by an official residence.

The next day, he set off again and entered the city gate, where a procession of bailiffs escorted him, calling out and jostling along. Sitting in his sedan chair, Yucun heard the path-clearing men shouting ahead. Curious, he inquired about the matter. One of the men brought over a man who knelt before the sedan and reported, “That man, intoxicated and oblivious, failed to make way and actually collided with us. When I shouted at him, he, emboldened by his drink, threw a tantrum and laid himself down in the middle of the street, claiming that I had struck him.”

Yucun said, “I am the official in charge here, and you all are my subjects. You should know that when my procession passes by, even if you’ve been drinking, you ought to make way—and yet you dare to shift the blame!”

The man retorted, “I paid for my own drink. When I was drunk, I laid myself down on the emperor’s own street. Even you, sir, have no right to interfere.”

Fuming, Yucun demanded, “What is your name?”

The man answered, “I’m called Drunken Golden-Hammer, Ni Er.”

This infuriated Yucun. “Beat this man! Look at him—if he were truly a ‘Golden-Hammer’ he wouldn’t behave like this!” His subordinates subdued Ni Er and flogged him several times. In pain, Ni Er came to his senses and pleaded for mercy. Laughing heartily inside his sedan, Yucun remarked, “So this is your so-called Golden-Hammer. I won’t beat you to death now—I’ll have you taken into the office and interrogated slowly.” The bailiffs obeyed, tying him up and hauling him off, despite Ni Er’s fruitless pleas.

Later, Yucun reported the incident to Cao in his office, and word of the matter spread among those who cared for reputation and status. On the street, curious onlookers whispered in small groups, “Ni Er, who always boasts of his strength and uses his drunken antics to cheat people, has finally run afoul of Lord Jia—he surely won’t be let off easily.” These remarks reached the ears of Ni Er’s wife and daughter. That very night, when Ni Er failed to return home, his daughter went about the gambling dens asking after him. The gamblers all echoed the same words, and soon the girl wept bitterly.

Soon, someone consoled her, “Don’t worry. Lord Jia belongs to the Rong household. A certain Second Young Master in that household is on friendly terms with your father. If you and your mother go speak to him, he’ll surely intercede on your behalf.”

Pondering this, Ni Er’s daughter thought, “My father often mentioned that Jia Second Young Master was fond of him—why haven’t we approached him yet?” Hastily, she and her mother went to see Jia Yun that day. Jia Yun, who happened to be at home, welcomed the two and had tea served. The Ni family explained their predicament, “Please, Second Young Master, intercede so that our Ni Er may be released.”

Jia Yun readily agreed, “It’s nothing serious. I’ll just mention it at the Xifu; Lord Jia, having secured his high position only through the favor of the Xifu, will merely send someone to sort this out.” Elated, the Ni mother and daughter hurried home to tell Ni Er not to worry—Jia Second Young Master had promised that a word would secure his release. Ni Er, upon hearing this, felt relieved.

However, Jia Yun, after having given gifts to Sister Feng the previous day and feeling somewhat embarrassed, rarely visited the Rong household. At the Rong residence, the front gate was managed by a person who acted only on the master’s orders. If Jia Yun happened to come by, the gate would be opened out of decorum; if not, no one would bother, even if the visitors were close relatives. On that day, when Jia Yun arrived at the mansion and announced his greetings for Second Master Lian, the gatekeeper said, “Second Master is not home—wait until he returns, and we’ll pass on your greetings.” Jia Yun almost said “Please convey greetings to Second Madam,” but fearing to trouble the gatekeeper further, he withdrew.

Later, the Ni family pressed him, “Second Young Master always said that no matter what office it is, a word from him ensures obedience. Now, given that you’re part of the household, it shouldn’t be so hard to intercede.” Jia Yun’s face fell; even as he grumbled, “We had a family matter yesterday and couldn’t send someone. But surely if I mention it today, he’ll let him go—nothing grave has happened!” the Ni family had to accept his explanation.

Unbeknownst to them, Jia Yun had recently been kept from entering the main hall and had to circle around to the back garden to look for Baoyù, only to find the garden gate locked. Dejected, he recalled, “That year, when Ni Er borrowed silver to buy incense and sent it as a gift, he was rewarded by letting me plant trees. Now, when I lack the money to make proper offerings, he turns his back on me! And besides, the public funds left by my great-uncle are barely enough for a single coin’s extra interest. We, poor families, cannot even borrow a tael. If he were to do so, wouldn’t he be secure for life? He has no idea how bad his reputation is outside! I’d rather not mention it—if I do, who knows how many lives might be ruined in lawsuits.” With these thoughts, he returned home, only to find the Ni family waiting. Reluctantly, Jia Yun said, “The Xifu has already sent someone to report that Lord Jia refused to intercede. As for our servant Zhou Rui’s relative, Leng Zixing, he turned out to be useless.” The Ni family sneered, “If even a respectable man like Second Young Master is of no help, then a lowly servant is even worse.” Jia Yun, feeling awkward and increasingly anxious, insisted, “You have no idea—these days, servants often outshine their masters.” The Ni family could only laugh coldly, “So much for your needless trip. We’ll wait until our contact comes forward with further word.” Soon after, another messenger was sent out to fetch Ni Er, who was released with only a few light beatings and no real charge.

Ni Er returned home, and his wife and daughter recounted to him how Lord Jia had refused to intercede on his behalf. Now drinking, Ni Er became incensed and vowed to confront Jia Yun, exclaiming, “That little wretch—a heartless scoundrel! When he was in need he had no care for me, yet when I am in trouble he won’t lift a finger. Enough is enough! If I, Ni Er, start a ruckus, not even the two great households will remain unscathed!”

His wife and daughter quickly cautioned him, “Ah, you’ve drunk too much again! Remember the chaos you caused the other day? You haven’t even recovered from that beating, and now you’re stirring up more trouble.”

Ni Er retorted, “Is it not enough to have been beaten? I only worry about finding a reason to act! When I was in prison, I made friends with several loyal fellows. I heard them say that not only are there many Jia’s in the city, but plenty even in the provinces. The jail had taken in several members of the Jia family. I even learned that the younger generation of the Jia family here isn’t as troublesome as the old ones—so how could they have committed any real offense? I’ve heard that if it turns out they are related to the Jia family, and if they are brought in for trial after proper investigation, I might rest easy. As for that ungrateful Jia kid—if he forgets his debt to me, I’ll tell a few friends how his family abuses power, charges exorbitant interest, and forcefully marries women against their will. Once the word gets around and reaches the ears of the capital’s officials, they’ll know who Ni Er Golden-Hammer really is!”

His wife scolded, “You’re just spouting drunken nonsense! Which woman did he even force on anyone? There’s no such thing—stop babbling!”

Ni Er replied, “How can you not know what goes on outside the house? Two years ago, I met Xiao Zhang in the market; he said his wife was taken by the Jia family and even conspired with me about it—I dissuaded him. I haven’t seen Xiao Zhang since. Should I run into him, I’ll let my great-uncle Ni decide, and I’ll have that Jia kid taught a lesson—a proper lesson to honor my great-uncle!” With that, he flopped down and, still mumbling incoherently, soon fell asleep. His wife and daughter assumed his ramblings were merely the effects of drunkenness and paid them no heed. The next morning, Ni Er went off to the gambling den again—his further exploits need not be recounted here.

Meanwhile, Jia Yucun returned home and, after resting one night, recounted his encounter with Zhen Tuyin on the road to his wife. His wife chided him, “Why didn’t you go back to check? If anyone was burned alive, wouldn’t that show our lack of compassion?” Tears welled in her eyes. Yucun replied, “He’s a man of the outer world—he wouldn’t be seen with us.” Just then, someone came in from outside with a report: “Sir, the person you sent to check on the temple fire has returned.”

Yucun stepped out. The bailiff greeted him and explained, “Following your orders, I went back before the fire had fully died down. I braved the flames to inspect the Taoist’s chamber—only to find that the whole area had been burned. I thought the Taoist must have perished in the blaze. The burning wall and roof later collapsed, leaving no trace of the Taoist—not even his shadow. Only a prayer mat and a water gourd remained, intact. I searched everywhere for his body, but not even a bone was found. I was afraid you wouldn’t believe me, so I wanted to bring these items back as proof—but when I picked them up, they all turned to ash.”

Hearing this, Yucun understood at once that Shi Yin had transcended to immortality. He sent the bailiff away without mentioning the matter of cremation for fear that his wife might be overcome with grief. Instead, he only said that there were no traces—that Shi Yin must have left on his own accord.

Afterwards, Yucun sat alone in his study, about to ponder over Shi Yin’s words, when a servant hurried in with a report, “A message has come from the Inner Court. You are to attend a briefing on the incident.” Yucun quickly mounted his sedan and entered the court.

There, voices were heard saying, “Today, Jia Cunzhou from the Jiangxi Grain Bureau has been recalled to the capital to offer his apologies in the court.” Yucun hastened to the cabinet, where he met with several high ministers and examined a memorial criticizing the mishandling of the maritime frontier. Afterwards, he sought out Jia Zheng and first expressed his grievances on Jia Zheng’s behalf, then congratulated him and inquired after his journey. Jia Zheng recounted the events in detail from their recent separation.

Yucun asked, “Has the apology been formally submitted?”

Jia Zheng replied, “Yes, it has. We shall review the emperor’s response after dinner.”

Just then, an edict was called for Jia Zheng, and he quickly went inside. The high ministers gathered inside with anxious concern. After a long while, Jia Zheng emerged, his head drenched in sweat. The others rushed to him, asking, “What does the edict say?”

Jia Zheng burst out, “It’s terrifying—truly frightening! I was fortunate that all the great lords cared, and I’m pleased nothing serious occurred.”

They asked, “What were the questions in the edict?”

Jia Zheng explained, “The inquiry concerned the case of the unauthorized possession of a divine spear in Yunnan. The memorial stated that the person in question was originally a relative of the late Grand Preceptor Jia Hua. The emperor, recalling the name of our ancestors, asked about it. I hurriedly knelt and stated that our ancestor’s name was Dai Hua, to which the emperor laughed and decreed, ‘Whether sent from the Ministry of War or later from the Provincial Governor, isn’t he still called Jia Hua?’ At that moment, Yucun, standing by, nearly jumped out of his skin. I asked Jia Zheng, ‘How did our esteemed elder express this?’ Jia Zheng replied, ‘I slowly stated, “The original Grand Preceptor Jia Hua was from Yunnan; the current Provincial Governor, Jia so-and-so, is from Zhejiang.” The emperor then asked, “Is Jia Fan, as reported by the Suzhou Prefect, from your family?” I again knelt and answered, “Yes.” Then the emperor changed his tone, “Even if a family slave forcefully takes a commoner’s wife and daughter, does that amount to anything?” I dared not continue. The emperor then inquired, “Who is Jia Fan to you?” I hastily replied, “He is a distant relative.” The emperor snorted and summoned him out. Is this not an astonishing matter?”

The assembled officials said, “It is indeed rather coincidental. How is it that two such incidents have occurred in succession?”

Jia Zheng replied, “It’s not so strange, really—problems always arise when one’s surname is Jia. Our extended clan is vast and ancient, spread all over. Though nothing untoward has happened, the mere mention of the name ‘Jia’ does no one any favors.”

One minister remarked, “True enough—whether real or false, what’s there to fear?”

Jia Zheng said, “I would love nothing more than to leave office, but I dare not announce my retirement. With two hereditary offices in our family, we are rather bound.”

Yucun added, “Since our esteemed elder is still with the Ministry of Works, I believe that as a Beijing official there will be no trouble.”

Jia Zheng responded, “Beijing posts may be secure, but I have served twice in outer positions—so it’s hard to say.”

The officials then complimented Jia Zheng’s conduct, “We all admire the way you conduct yourself, Second Master. Even though your elder brother is a good man, your nephews must be kept in line.”

Jia Zheng continued, “Because I spend so little time at home, I haven’t been able to closely supervise my nephews. I’m not entirely reassured. Today, as you mention it, is because you are all good friends—or perhaps you’ve heard that some of the East House’s nephews are not following proper rules?”

The ministers replied, “We have heard nothing else but that a few of the young officials and even some eunuchs in the Inner Palace aren’t on the best of terms. But as long as we remind those young masters to be cautious, there’s nothing to worry about.”

After their discussion, the officials dispersed with raised hands. Jia Zheng then returned home, where his sons and nephews greeted him. He went forth to pay respects to Grandmother Jia, offering his apologies and recounting his recent tribulations. Grandmother Jia inquired about Tan Chun. Jia Zheng fully reported the engagement arrangements for Tan Chun and added, “My son departed hurriedly and barely made it past the Double Ninth Festival. Although he didn’t see her himself, he heard that her relatives spoke most kindly—Grandmother, they even sent greetings to you. They said that by this winter or early spring, she could be transferred to the capital. That would be excellent. Now, with trouble at the maritime frontier, I fear that transfer might not be possible.”

Initially, Grandmother Jia was saddened upon learning that Jia Zheng had been recalled, knowing that Tan Chun was far away and without kin. But when Jia Zheng elaborated on the official matters and reassured her that Tan Chun was well, her sorrow turned to joy, and she laughed, bidding Jia Zheng to leave. Later, his brothers, sons, and nephews met, and arrangements were made to pay respects at the ancestral temple early the next morning.

Returning to his own room, Jia Zheng was met in turn by Madame Wang, Baoyù, and Jia Lian for further audience. Jia Zheng noted that Baoyù’s face seemed fuller and more serene than before—even though he sensed some confusion in his heart, he was pleased and no longer troubled by the matter of the transfer. He also remarked on how mature and steadfast Baochai now appeared compared to earlier, and that Lan’er remained as graceful as ever, though he no longer held her in the highest esteem.

After a while’s rest, Jia Zheng suddenly realized, “Why is there one less person here today?” Madame Wang, knowing he was thinking of Daiyu—whose letter had not yet been reported and who had only just arrived home—preferred not to speak directly, instead saying she was unwell. Unbeknownst to them, Bao’yù’s heart was already in turmoil; when his father arrived home, he had to steady himself. Madame Wang organized a welcome banquet with wine offered by the children and grandchildren. Though Sister Feng, being the daughter-in-law managing the household affairs, helped serve wine alongside Baochai, Jia Zheng soon ordered another round of wine, “Now, everyone rest. There’s no need for further service tonight—tomorrow morning, after paying respects at the ancestral hall, you may come in for the audience.”

Having arranged everything, Jia Zheng and Madame Wang exchanged some parting words—words that none of the others dared to repeat. It was Jia Zheng who first mentioned Wang Zitong’s matter, and even Madame Wang could not express sorrow. Jia Zheng then mentioned Pan’er’s affair, to which Madame Wang only replied that he had only himself to blame; seizing the moment, Jia Zheng disclosed the news of Daiyu’s death. Jia Zheng was so startled that tears sprang to his eyes as he repeatedly sighed. Madame Wang, unable to contain herself, wept as well. Soon, Caiyun and the others rushed to help dress them, and once Madame Wang recovered her composure, she spoke kindly before retiring for the night.

The next morning, all went to the ancestral hall to pay their respects. Jia Zheng, seated in the side room next to the hall, summoned Jia Zhen and Jia Lian and inquired about household matters. Jia Zhen reported what he could. Jia Zheng then said, “Now that I’ve returned home, I must refrain from delving too deeply. I’ve heard that outside, your household is not as well-run as before. All affairs must be handled with care. You are no longer young; your children must be disciplined so that they do not offend others out there. And Lian’er, you too must be attentive. It wasn’t that I mentioned this as soon as I got home, but because I’ve heard reports. You all need to be extra cautious.” Jia Zhen and the others flushed with embarrassment and only murmured “Yes,” without daring to say more. Satisfied, Jia Zheng let the matter drop.

After returning to the West Mansion, once all the family had knelt in respect, they entered the Inner Court; the female servants paid their respects, and nothing further needed mentioning.

Meanwhile, Bao’yù, recalling that yesterday Jia Zheng had inquired about Daiyu, to which Madame Wang replied that she was ill, became secretly distressed. By the time his father sent him away, he had shed several tears along the journey. Back in his room, seeing Baochai and Xiren in conversation, he sat alone in a side room, lost in thought. Baochai sent Xiren with tea, guessing that Bao’yù might be anxious about being questioned over his duties by his father. Xiren came over to console him. Bao’yù then took the opportunity to say to Baochai, “You should go to sleep first—I need to clear my head. Things are not like before; a careless word now might bring disfavor from father. You sleep on, and let Xiren keep me company a while.” Baochai, unwilling to press him, nodded in assent.

Stepping out, Bao’yù quietly urged Xiren, “Please call Zizhuan—I have something to ask him. But you know, whenever Zizhuan sees me he always looks cross. You must coax him to come.”

Xiren teased, “You’re saying you need to clear your head, yet you’re so worked up. Why not wait until tomorrow to ask your question?”

Bao’yù replied, “I’m free tonight; if father calls for me tomorrow, I won’t have a moment. Come now, dear sister—hurry and send him over.”

Xiren said, “He won’t come unless Second Madam personally summons him.”

Bao’yù insisted, “That’s why you must explain things on my behalf.”

Xiren asked, “Explain what exactly?”

Bao’yù said, “Don’t you know our hearts are aligned? It’s all because of Miss Lin. You see, I’m not unfaithful—I’ve turned you into someone unfaithful! Listen, haven’t you heard what Third Sister and the others said? On her deathbed she cursed me bitterly. And Zizhuan, for her sake, harbors an immense grudge against me. Do you think I’m unfeeling? And even Qingwen is just a maid—nothing truly of worth. When she died, I confess I even composed a memorial for her. Miss Lin herself saw it all with her own eyes. Now that Miss Lin is dead, isn’t it worse than Qingwen? I can’t even prepare a proper memorial. Moreover, Miss Lin’s death is accompanied by spiritual rites—if he recalls it, wouldn’t he resent me even more?”

Xiren said, “If you wish to compose a memorial, then go ahead—who can stop you?”

Bao’yù sighed, “Ever since I recovered, I’ve wanted to write a memorial, but now not a single spark of inspiration comes to me. If I hastily write something for someone else, it’ll be rough and careless. That’s why I want Zizhuan to ask Miss Lin about her true feelings—he might be able to discern them. I can still think clearly when I’m well; but now in my state, I can’t recall a thing. Tell me, Baochai, Miss Lin was doing so well—why did she suddenly die? When she was well, I didn’t bother her; what did she say then? And when I was ill, she didn’t come—what did she say then? I’ve deceived everyone, yet Second Madam never makes a fuss—what is she thinking?”

Xiren replied, “Second Madam only worries that you’ll be heartbroken—nothing else.”

Bao’yù insisted, “I don’t believe it. If Miss Lin truly cared for me, why on earth did she burn her manuscript on her deathbed, leaving nothing behind as a memento for me? I’ve even heard that heavenly music resounded—a sign that she may have ascended to immortality or become a celestial being. Although I have seen the coffin, I still don’t know for sure if she’s in there.”

Xiren said, “You’re getting more confused. How can a person be placed in a coffin before they have even died?”

Bao’yù retorted, “No, no! In general, a person who ascends may either do so in their mortal body or transform completely. Come now, dear sister, have you called Zizhuan?”

Xiren replied, “If I must explain your troubled heart, it will take time—if he agrees to talk, that’s fine; if not, I’ll have to talk a great deal. Even if he comes, you know he won’t be inclined to speak freely. My plan is to wait until Second Madam has gone up tomorrow, and then I’ll question him slowly. And if there’s any spare time later, I’ll explain everything to you in detail.”

Bao’yù said, “You’re right—you have no idea how anxious I am inside.”

Just then, Mieyue appeared and said, “Second Madam says it’s already the fourth watch of the night. Please, Second Young Master, go to bed. Sister Xiren must have gotten carried away and forgotten the time.”

Xiren agreed, “It really is time to sleep. We can talk more tomorrow if need be.”

Reluctantly, Bao’yù went inside, whispering in Xiren’s ear, “Don’t let it slip tomorrow.”

Mieyue wiped her face and laughed, “You two are at it again! Why don’t you settle things with Second Madam before retiring to Xiren’s side? Stay up all night if you must—we won’t interfere.”

Bao’yù waved his hand, “No more words.”

Xiren, half-angrily, chided, “You little gossip—if you don’t stop, I’ll tear your mouth apart tomorrow!” Turning to Bao’yù, she added, “This isn’t even your doing, speaking of matters at the fourth watch!” With that, she escorted Bao’yù indoors, and everyone eventually dispersed.

That night, Bao’yù lay awake. The next day, still preoccupied with the matter, he overheard word from outside: “All the relatives and friends, in honor of the elder’s return, are to come for a welcoming performance. The elder has repeatedly declined a theatrical performance, saying, ‘There’s no need for a show—I’ve prepared wine and water at home and invite our friends to gather for a talk.’ And so it has been decided to hold a feast the day after tomorrow.”

Who exactly is to be invited, we shall explain in the next chapter.
Chapter 105
The Jin-Nong Army Raids the Ningguo Mansion; The Courier of Swift Horses Denounces Ping’an Prefecture

At that moment, Jia Zheng was holding a banquet and serving wine when suddenly Lai Da hurried up to the Rongxi Hall. He reported, “Old Master, Officer Zhao from the Jin Yi Mansion has arrived accompanied by several departmental officers. When his servant asked for his official title to report, Zhao replied, ‘We are perfectly fine without it.’ He then dismounted and entered. Please, Old Master, receive him at once.”

Hearing this, Jia Zheng thought, “I have no dealings with old Zhao; why is he here now? But we have a guest—if I don’t receive him it will be impolite, yet if I do, it may prove awkward.” While he was still pondering, Jia Lian said, “Uncle, please go and greet him. Now that everyone has arrived, there is no time to think further.”

Just then, another family servant from the Second Gate announced, “Officer Zhao has entered the Second Gate.” Jia Zheng and the others quickly went out to receive him. Officer Zhao appeared with a broad smile and said nothing more as he walked straight into the main hall. Following him were five or six other departmental officers—some recognized, some not—but none offered any reply. Unsure what to do, Jia Zheng and his company led them upstairs to be seated. Some of the relatives and friends recognized Officer Zhao; noticing that he held his head high and gave little heed to anyone, they clutched Jia Zheng’s hand and exchanged a few polite words. Many, sensing trouble in his appearance, hurried into inner rooms or stood at the side with lowered hands.

Just as Jia Zheng was about to engage in polite conversation with a smile, a servant anxiously announced, “The Prince of Xiping has arrived!” Jia Zheng rushed to greet him and soon saw the Prince enter. Officer Zhao hurried to offer his salutations and then said, “Now that the Prince is here, the accompanying officers should immediately order the mansion’s servants to secure the front and rear gates.” The officers responded and went out. Realizing that things were turning serious, Jia Zheng and his companions knelt in greeting. The Prince of Xiping, using both hands to help him up, smiled and said in a light tone, “I dare not act rashly without cause. I have received an imperial command regarding an investigation—please, Old Master, accept this edict. As the banquet is still underway and many of your relatives are present, I request that all your family and friends disperse, leaving only those residing in the main mansion to await further orders.”

Officer Zhao replied, “Although the Prince shows grace, regarding the affairs in the east, this very conscientious Prince of Xiping has already sealed the doors long ago.” Realizing that the incident involved both households, the assembled guests were desperate to extricate themselves. The Prince laughed and said, “Everyone, please leave at once. Send word out to the Jin Yi Mansion’s officers: these are all family and friends, so do not inspect them—let them leave quickly.” Upon hearing this, the guests fled in a rush. Only Jia She, Jia Zheng, and their close associates remained, their faces ashen and bodies trembling with fear.

Before long, scores of armed palace soldiers appeared at the door, and every entrance was guarded. Officer Zhao turned his expression and said to the Prince, “Please issue your decree, so that we may proceed.” All the soldiers rolled up their sleeves and flexed their arms, awaiting orders. The Prince of Xiping slowly stated, “I, the little Prince, have received the imperial command to bring along Officer Zhao Quan from the Jin Yi Mansion to inspect the property of Jia She.” At these words, Jia She and the others knelt in submission. Standing above them, the Prince announced, “By imperial decree: Jia She, for fraternizing with external officials, bullying the weak, and failing in filial duty—thus disgracing his illustrious ancestry—shall be stripped of all titles and dismissed forthwith. So ordered!”

In unison, Officer Zhao’s retinue roared, “Seize Jia She! And detain everyone else!” At that moment, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Zhen, Jia Rong, Jia Qiang, Jia Zhi, and Jia Lan were all present. Only Baoyù was absent—allegedly ill and lingering at Grandmother’s—while Jia Huan, who rarely appeared in public, was also missing. Thus, for now, only those present were to be detained. Officer Zhao then ordered his aides, “Notify all clerks and, together with the palace soldiers, search every room and examine all account registers.” No sooner had he spoken than the entire household of Jia Zheng exchanged fearful glances, while Officer Zhao’s men, eager for action, began moving throughout the mansion. The Prince of Xiping said, “I have heard that Jia She and Jia Zheng share the same kitchen—accordingly, you must inspect Jia She’s estate. For now, secure the rooms; we shall await further imperial orders.” Officer Zhao then said, “Reporting to your Lordship: Jia She and Jia Zheng have not divided their properties. I have heard that Jia Lian, his nephew, is now serving as the chief steward—there is no choice but to inspect and confiscate everything.” The Prince of Xiping listened silently. Officer Zhao continued, “It would be best if our servants, led by me, inspect Jia Lian’s and Jia She’s holdings.” The Prince replied, “There is no need to hurry. First, send word to the mansion; instruct the inner dependents to withdraw, and only then may you resume your search.” Before he had finished speaking, Zhao’s servants had already begun dragging the family members away, splitting up to search every room. The Prince then barked, “No dilly-dallying! I shall personally inspect the property when they return, and count every item.”

Not long after, a Jin Yi officer knelt to report, “During the search inside, we uncovered several imperial garments and other forbidden articles. We dared not seize them; we have come back to consult your Lordship.” Soon another messenger arrived carrying news from the eastern wing: “They have confiscated two boxes of property deeds, plus one box of loan certificates—all obtained by illegal profiteering.” Officer Zhao said, “What a heavy charge of usurious exploitation—indeed, everything must be confiscated! Please, Lord, sit down while I send my servants to retrieve every last item, and then await your further instructions.” Just then, the mansion’s chief steward arrived with a note: “The guarding troops report that the imperial army has sent the Beijing Prince here with an edict—please receive him.” Hearing this, Officer Zhao inwardly grumbled, “What misfortune—to encounter that sour Prince now! But now that he has arrived, I may as well show my authority.” Lost in thought, he went out to greet the Beijing Prince. The Beijing Prince was already waiting in the hall. He announced, “I have received an edict. Officer Zhao Quan, please attend.” He then declared, “By imperial command: Let the Jin Yi officers treat Jia She as a material to be thoroughly examined; all other matters shall be handled by the Prince of Xiping in accordance with the edict. So ordered.” The Prince of Xiping accepted the edict with evident satisfaction and sat down with the Beijing Prince. He then ordered Officer Zhao to take Jia She back to the office.

Inside, all those engaged in the search, upon hearing that the Beijing Prince had arrived, came out as one. Once they learned that Officer Zhao had departed, they grew silent and stood by in anxious anticipation. The Beijing Prince selected two honest officials and about ten elder soldiers, expelling everyone else. The Prince of Xiping then remarked, “I was about to lose my temper with old Zhao, but thanks to your Lordship’s arrival and the edict, I feel reassured—otherwise, we would have suffered greatly.” The Beijing Prince said, “I have heard in the court that your Lordship received an imperial order to confiscate the Jia estate; I was relieved, thinking the situation here would not degenerate. I did not expect old Zhao to be so unscrupulous. But I wonder—where are Jia Zheng and Baoyù now? What chaos has unfolded inside?” The assembled officials replied, “Jia Zheng and the others are being held in the inner quarters; the search inside has been a complete mess.” The Beijing Prince then ordered his clerks, “Bring Jia Zheng here for questioning immediately.” The soldiers obeyed and brought him forward. Jia Zheng knelt, tears in his eyes as he pleaded for mercy. The Beijing Prince rose and took him by the arm, saying reassuringly, “Rest assured, old Zheng.” He then explained the edict. Overcome with gratitude, Jia Zheng wept and repeatedly thanked him before standing to await further orders.

The Prince then said, “Old Zheng, when old Zhao was here, the soldiers reported finding forbidden items and usurious loan certificates—such things are hard to hide. These forbidden articles were originally prepared for the noble consort; we declare there is no harm done. It is only the loan certificates—we must find some way to resolve them. Now, old Zheng, you must have your officials present Jia She’s entire estate; once that is done, our work is finished. Do not allow any concealment which would only compound your crimes.” Jia Zheng replied, “I shall not dare again. But my ancestral property has never been divided—the items in each person’s dwelling are all considered their own.” Both Princes said, “That is acceptable; simply hand over everything on Jia She’s side.” They then instructed the clerks to carry out the orders exactly, forbidding any unauthorized actions. The clerks departed immediately.

Meanwhile, in the quarters of Grandmother Jia, the female relatives were holding a family feast. Madame Wang remarked, “Baoyù is nowhere to be seen outside—your father is surely angry.” Sister Feng, though ill, cooed in a soft tone, “I think Baoyù is not frightened; he sees many guests outside, so he is here to keep watch. If, however, you think that there are too few attendants inside, the mistress might sacrifice one of Baoyù’s brothers—it wouldn’t be good if that were the case.” Grandmother Jia laughed and said, “Feng, you’re so sickly yet still your tongue is as sharp as ever.” Just as everyone was enjoying themselves, cries suddenly came from near the residence of Madam Xing: “Grandmother! Mistress! Something’s terribly wrong! Armed bandits wearing boots and hats have arrived! They are ransacking the place and seizing valuables!” Grandmother Jia and the others were dumbfounded. Soon, Ping’er appeared disheveled, dragging Qiao Jie, sobbing, “It’s awful! I was dining with my sister when I saw Lai Wang being dragged in, shouting, ‘Quickly inform the mistresses to withdraw—the Prince is here to ransack the house!’ I was nearly frightened to death! I rushed to grab the important items, but a mob of people forcibly pushed me out. All that should be properly stored must be gathered immediately.” Madam Xing and her attendants were so horrified they felt as if their souls were flying away, not knowing what to do. Meanwhile, Sister Feng, who had been attentively listening with wide eyes, suddenly collapsed onto the ground. Before Grandmother Jia could even finish hearing, she was overcome with terror and burst into uncontrollable sobbing, unable to speak.

At that moment the entire house was thrown into chaos—people pulling this and that, making such a clamor as to overturn everything. Soon, shouts rang out, “Order! All female relatives, retreat inside—the Prince has entered!” Baoyù, Baochai, and the others were in a state of disarray; on the ground, amidst the maids and servants scrambling in every direction, Jia Lian burst in, panting, “It’s over—thank goodness the Prince has saved us!” As the others began to question him, Jia Lian saw that Sister Feng lay dead on the floor, her cries turning to frantic sobs; Grandmother Jia, terrified beyond measure, could barely catch her breath. It was only thanks to Ping’er’s quick call that Sister Feng was revived and comforted by someone. Grandmother Jia gradually recovered, though still weeping uncontrollably, and lay on the kang while Li Wan consoled her repeatedly. Jia Lian then composed himself and explained, with all due deference, that although the two Princes had shown mercy, he dared not mention that Jia She had been seized, fearing it would frighten Grandmother Jia to death. Thus, he hurried to attend to his own room. As soon as he stepped inside, he saw that trunks and cabinets had been broken into, and many valuables lay scattered in disarray. His eyes bulged in panic, tears streaming down as he stood in dumb shock. Hearing cries from outside, he rushed out and saw Jia Zheng with his clerks registering the items. One official reported:

“A bronze Buddha of Jiā Nán, a statue of Guanyin; one Buddha seat; two strings of pearls for Jiā Nán; one hall of a golden Buddha; nine gilt mirrors; three jade Buddhas; one set of eight immortals in jade; two Jiā Nán gold and jade ruyi scepters; seventeen ancient porcelain vases and burners; fourteen boxes of assorted antiquities; one jade vat; two small jade vats; two pairs of jade plates; two large glass screens; two kang screens; four glass plates; four jade plates; two agate plates; four plates of faded hues; six pairs of gold bowls; eight gold-rimmed bowls; forty gold spoons; sixty large silver bowls and sixty silver plates; four sets of three-gold inlaid chopsticks; twelve gilt water kettles; three pairs of folding bowls; two tea trays; one hundred and sixty silver dishes and cups; eighteen pieces of black fox skin; fifty-six pieces of raccoon dog skin; forty-four pieces each of yellow and white fox skin; twelve pieces of lynx skin; twenty-five pieces of clouded leopard fur tubes; twenty-six pieces of sea dragon skin; three pieces of seal skin; six tiger skins; three pieces of hemp-leaf skin; twenty-eight otter skins; forty pieces of dark-red sheepskin; sixty-three pieces of black sheepskin; twenty pieces of fragrant rat fur tubes; twenty-four pieces of bean rat skin; four rolls of velvet; two hundred and sixty-three pieces of gray rat skin; thirty-two bolts of Japanese satin; thirty bolts of foreign woolen cloth; thirty-three bolts of Huaji fabric; forty bolts of coarse silk; one hundred and thirty rolls of brocade; one hundred and eighty rolls of gauze; thirty-two rolls of crepe de Chine; twenty-two rolls each of feathered satin and feathered gauze; thirty rolls of thick woolen cloth; eighteen rolls of painted python brocade; thirty bundles of assorted cloth; one hundred and thirty-two leather garments; three hundred and forty pieces of cotton and silk mixed garments; nine sets of caps; over five hundred items of copper, tin, and other metals; eighteen types of timepieces; nine strings of court beads; thirteen strings of pearls; one hundred and twenty-three pieces of red-gold jewelry—all the precious items accounted for; plus, for ceremonial use, three parts of yellow satin for armrests and back cushions; eight sets of court attire; two jade belts; twelve rolls of yellow satin; seven thousand taels of Chao silver; one hundred and fifty-two taels of light gold; and seven thousand five hundred strings of coins.”

All movable household items and those ranked first by the state of Rongguo were itemized one by one. The property deeds, family documents, and account books were also sealed and bundled.

Jia Lian, standing aside, secretly listened. Not finding any mention of his own belongings, he grew suspicious. Then the two Princes inquired, “In the confiscated property, there are loan certificates—this is clear exploitation. Tell us, who is responsible? Old Zheng, you must report the truth.” Jia Zheng, still kneeling, pounded his head and tearfully said, “I, a low-ranking official, am utterly ignorant of these household matters. You must ask my nephew, Jia Lian, who knows.” Jia Lian immediately rushed forward, knelt, and reported, “This box of documents was seized from our servant’s quarters. How could I not know? I beg your Lordship’s clemency—I, your humble servant, was unaware.” The two Princes said, “Your father has already been found guilty; his case must be handled together with yours. If you now admit it, it will be proper. Now, order that Jia Lian be detained while the rest of the household is rounded up. Old Zheng, you must await further orders carefully. We will now return to the court with the edict. Here, the officers shall remain on guard.” With that, they mounted their sedan and departed. Jia Zheng and his group were forced to kneel by the Second Gate as they were seen off. The Beijing Prince extended his hand and said, “Rest assured.” His face bore unmistakable pity. At that moment, Jia Zheng’s soul was in turmoil—he was still in a daze. Jia Lan then said, “Please, Grandfather, go inside and check on Grandmother.” Hearing this, Jia Zheng hastily rose and entered. He found that in every room the women were in utter disarray, with no one knowing what to do. With no heart for inquiry, Jia Zheng pressed on until he reached Grandmother Jia’s room. There he saw everyone with tear-streaked faces—Madame Wang, Baoyù, and others surrounded Grandmother Jia in silent sorrow, each shedding tears, while only Madam Xing wailed uncontrollably. When they saw Jia Zheng enter, they exclaimed, “It’s over, it’s over!” and informed the old lady, “The master has safely arrived; please, Grandmother, try to remain calm.” Weak and barely alive, Grandmother Jia opened her eyes slightly and whispered, “My son… I never thought I’d see you again!” Before she could finish, she broke into heart-rending sobs. Soon the entire room was filled with weeping. Fearing that his mother's crying might further harm her fragile health, Jia Zheng hurriedly urged, “Grandmother, please, do not cry. Although these matters are serious, by the grace of the Emperor and the mercy of both Princes, even if our elder brother is temporarily detained, once the matter is fully investigated the Emperor’s favor shall prevail. For now, nothing in the household is to be touched.” Grandmother Jia, upon learning that Jia She was absent, sank further into grief, and only after repeated consolations from Jia Zheng did she finally quiet down. No one dared to separate. Only Madam Xing, upon returning to her own quarters and finding the door barred—with her maids locked away in several rooms and nowhere to go—broke into loud wails. She had no choice but to go toward Sister Feng’s quarters. There she found that near the Second Gate a seal had been affixed, though one door remained open from which incessant weeping could be heard. Madam Xing entered and, upon seeing Sister Feng’s ashen face with closed eyes lying on the ground and Ping’er silently crying beside her, she burst into further wails, convinced that Sister Feng had died. Ping’er rushed to say, “Mistress, please, do not cry. Grandmother has just been retrieved—she appears as if dead. After a while, she recovered somewhat and cried a little; now she is calmed. Please, Mistress, steady yourself. But I wonder—what of Grandmother?” Madam Xing could only offer no answer and went to Grandmother Jia’s side. There, seeing Jia Zheng’s men everywhere, with her own husband detained, her daughter-in-law critically ill, her daughter suffering, and now with no place to call home, she was inconsolable in her grief. Others tried to comfort her; Li Wan and the like sent servants to tidy the room and invited Madam Xing to stay temporarily, while Madame Wang dispatched attendants to serve her.

Outside, Jia Zheng was trembling with fear, nervously twirling his mustache and rubbing his hands as he awaited further edicts. Suddenly, he heard the palace guards outside shouting in a disorderly manner, “Which side do you belong to? Since you have come into our custody, record you in the register—bind him and deliver him to the Jin Yi Mansion’s officers inside!” Jia Zheng went out to inspect and saw that it was Jiao Da. “What are you doing here?” he demanded. Jiao Da, upon being asked, began to wail and stamp his feet, “I have spent every day advising these ungrateful men, yet they treat me as an enemy! Do you not know what hardships I have endured with Grandmaster? Today, in this field, dear Zhen and Brother Rong have been taken away by some Prince; inside, the ladies have been roughed up by the palace officers until their hair is disheveled and gathered in an empty room, while the unworthy scoundrels are herded together like pigs and dogs. All their belongings have been confiscated and scattered—wooden utensils nailed to shambles, porcelain smashed to powder. They even plan to bind me! I have lived eighty or ninety years and have only ever been employed to tie up miscreants—now they wish to bind me? I claimed to be from the Western Mansion and ran out; when they refused, they hauled me here. Now, I no longer care for my life—I might as well fight them!” He banged his head in despair. The palace guards, seeing that he was old and acting on the orders of the two Princes, dared not act harshly. “Please, old man, calm yourself,” they said. “This is all done by imperial command—rest and listen.” Though Jia Zheng did not respond to Jiao Da’s words, his heart felt as if cut by a thousand knives. He muttered, “It’s all over… we have suffered a crushing defeat!”

In the midst of his anxious waiting for further orders, Xue Ke burst in, breathless, “It’s at last possible to come in! Where is my uncle?” Jia Zheng replied, “Good, come in. But how did you manage to get in?” Xue Ke answered, “I pleaded repeatedly and even offered them money, so they allowed me to enter.” Jia Zheng then informed him of the confiscation and implored him, “Please, try to find out more—other relatives, caught up in the commotion, are unable to send word, but you are able to communicate.” Xue Ke said, “I hadn’t thought of the details here, but I have heard rumors regarding the Eastern Mansion’s matters.” Jia Zheng pressed, “What exactly happened?” Xue Ke replied, “Earlier today, while in the office inquiring about a case involving my brother’s trial, I heard that two Censors reported that our dear Zhen had been accused of enticing scions of prominent families to gamble—a relatively minor offense; yet there was also a major case involving the forcible seizure of a commoner’s wife to make a concubine. When she resisted, she was battered to death. The Censors, fearing repercussions, even dragged our servant Bao Er away—and they mentioned someone surnamed Zhang. I fear that the Metropolitan Surveillance Office may also come after us, for it appears that the man surnamed Zhang had previously lodged a complaint.” Before Jia Zheng could finish listening, he stamped his foot and exclaimed, “Unthinkable! Enough!” With a heavy sigh, he burst into tears. Xue Ke tried to console him and then departed to gather more news. After a long while, he returned and said, “The situation is dire. I inquired in the Criminal Division and heard nothing about a further edict from the two Princes. Instead, I only heard that this morning, Censor Li visited Ping’an Prefecture, appealing to his superiors in the capital, and that several major sums were extorted from the people.” Jia Zheng, alarmed, exclaimed, “That is none of their concern! But what of our own case?” Xue Ke replied, “It is said that in Ping’an Prefecture, our names appear—the official sent there is none other than our own elder brother, who monopolizes legal disputes and fans the flames. Even among the court officials these days, everyone is hiding; who is willing to send word? Even our scattered relatives have either returned home or are waiting far away for news. Curse those noble families—they are already gossiping along the roads, saying, ‘What will become of the ancestral legacy now that it is in turmoil? Let’s see who will benefit.’” Jia Zheng could not hear further; he stamped his feet again and said, “It is all because our elder brother is too foolish! And the Eastern Mansion is utterly inept! At present, we still do not know if Grandmother and Jia Lian’s daughter-in-law are alive or dead. Go and inquire further. I must check on Grandmother immediately—if there is any word, it would have been better if we had known sooner.” Just then, shouts arose from inside, “Grandmother is in dire straits!” In a panic, Jia Zheng immediately rushed back inside.

What fate awaits them all—alive or dead—remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
Chapter 106
Wang Xifeng’s Calamity Brings Deep Shame, While Madam Jia Prays to Heaven to Dissipate Disaster

When Jia Zheng learned that Grandmother was in critical condition, he immediately rushed in to see her. He found her greatly shaken and frightened, her spirit nearly broken. Madame Wang, Yuanyang, and others had roused her, and after she took some herbal pills to soothe her agitation and calm her spirit, she gradually began to recover—though she continued to weep from sorrow. Standing by her side, Jia Zheng consoled her, saying, “It is the fault of my unfilial sons that this calamity has come upon us, and it is you, dear Grandmother, who has been unnecessarily frightened. If you can find some comfort, your sons may yet manage affairs outside; but if you remain so distraught, our sins only grow heavier.”

Grandmother Jia replied, “I have lived past eighty years. Since I was a little girl, I have been under your father’s care—always protected by the blessings of our ancestors. I have never before heard of such matters. Now, in my old age, if you should suffer because of these misfortunes, how could I ever have peace of mind? Perhaps it would be better if I simply close my eyes and follow you all into fate.” And with that, she burst into tears once more.

At that very moment, Jia Zheng, anxious as ever, heard word from outside: “Please, sir—there is a message from the Inner Court.” Hastily, he went out and met the Chief Steward of the Beijing Prince’s household. At their first meeting, Jia Zheng exclaimed, “What wonderful news!” After expressing his thanks, he invited the steward to sit and inquired, “What is the Prince’s command?”

The steward explained, “Our Prince, together with the Prince of Xiping, has returned inside to submit a memorial. They have, on our behalf, conveyed all our apprehensions and our grateful thanks for the heavenly mercy. The Emperor, moved by compassion—and remembering that the noble consort passed away not long ago—could not bring himself to impose further punishment. Instead, by his grace, he has allowed her household to remain on duty as a lower-ranking officer within the Ministry of Works. As for the confiscated property, only that which belonged to Jia She shall be taken into official custody; everything else is to be returned. An imperial edict has been issued directing that you discharge your official duties with utmost sincerity. However, all loan certificates must be examined by our Prince. Should any excessive usury or forbidden profiteering be discovered, then as prescribed by law, it shall be confiscated. As for the ordinary documents on family land and account registers, they are to be returned intact. Finally, Jia Lian is to be dismissed from his post, his crimes pardoned.”

Upon hearing these words, Jia Zheng immediately rose, repeatedly offering thanks to Heaven and the Prince for such mercy. He then said, “Please, convey my thanks to the Chief Steward, and tomorrow at the court I shall personally express my gratitude, and also come to our mansion to prostrate myself.” With that, the steward departed. After a short pause, word came that the officials in charge had carried out the edict—those eligible to be reinstated had been reinstated, and those whose property was to be returned had it restored. Jia Lian was released, and every male and female household member listed under Jia She’s name was officially recorded as being under state custody.

Alas, within Jia Lian’s own residence, aside from the official documents that were returned as required by regulation, all other valuables—though not officially seized—had already been plundered by those who carried out the search. What remained were only the basic household implements. Initially, Jia Lian was terrified of the punishment; later, when he was set free, he considered himself exceedingly fortunate. Yet, when he recalled that the treasures accumulated over many years—and not to mention Wang Xifeng’s personal belongings, amounting to no less than fifty or seventy thousand in value—had all vanished in one fell swoop, how could he not feel deep pain? Furthermore, his father was now confined in the Jin Yi Mansion, and Wang Xifeng lay gravely ill. The sorrow was overwhelming.

Jia Zheng, with tears in his eyes, called after him, “Because I have been occupied with official matters and neglected our household, I appointed you and your wife to manage our family affairs. What your father has done is beyond admonition—and who, pray tell, is behind this heavy usury and exploitation? It is surely not done by men of our standing. Now that our case has been made public, the loss of silver and money is of little consequence; but what will our reputation be when it is known?”

Kneeling, Jia Lian replied, “I, in handling family affairs, have not dared to harbor any private interest. All accounts of our income and expenditure have been duly recorded by Lai Da, Wu Xindeng, Dai Liang, and others. You need only call upon them for clarification. In these past few years, the treasury’s receipts have far exceeded its expenditures; although there has been no subsidy on the books, many funds have been misappropriated. If you ask Madam and Madame, they will tell you all. Even I am unaware where some of the silver has gone—only Zhou Rui and Wang’er might know.”

Jia Zheng said bitterly, “By your own admission you do not know what is happening even in your own room! How can you expect to know the business of every servant in this household? I shall not press you now; but you, who are free of duty, must urgently inquire about your father’s situation and that of our dear brother Jia Zhen. Hurry along!”

In his heart, Jia Lian felt deep grievance as he struggled back out, tears streaming down his face.

Jia Zheng sighed repeatedly and thought, “My grandfather, who toiled so diligently and achieved great merits by establishing our ancestral offices, now sees both branches of our family implicated in misdeeds, and both have been stripped of their titles. I see not a single one of my nephews showing any progress. Oh Heaven—why has the Jia family fallen so low? Although I have been blessed by divine mercy, with some of our property returned, the two branches should be consolidated into one so that at least one of us can support the household! And now, what Jia Lian has said is even more startling: not only is there no silver in the treasury, but there is even a deficit. In these recent years, our reputation has become nothing but an empty name. How could I have been so foolish? If only my Zhuer were still alive, he would have been a mighty support; though Baoyù is my eldest, he is utterly useless.”

Lost in thought, Jia Zheng’s eyes filled with tears. He further lamented, “If my dear Grandmother—so old now—has not been cared for even for a single day by her sons, and instead has been tormented with fright, what can be said of our sins? To whom shall I entrust our misfortune?” As he sat alone, grieving bitterly, a servant reported, “All our relatives have come to pay their respects.”

Jia Zheng thanked each one in turn, remarking, “It is our misfortune—my failure to discipline my nephews has brought us to this point.” Some remarked, “I have long known that dear Jia She was acting improperly, and now even Jia Zhen has grown haughty. If your misfortune had arisen solely from official mistakes, you might not feel so guilty; but now your own doings have dragged down our two elders.” Others said, “There has been chaos all around, and we have not seen the Censors’ memorial. It seems that dear Jia Zhen has offended his friends, and so things have come to this.” Still others argued, “It is not even the fault of the Censors; we have heard that some of our household servants, along with a few local peasants, have been clamoring outside. The Censors, fearing that their memorial might prove untrue, deceived the people here into making a fuss. I always thought that the servants in our household were the most lenient—why, then, does this matter persist?” One remarked, “It is generally true that servants cannot be properly supported. Today, as we are all gathered here as dear relatives, I dare say even if you, sir, serve in the Outer Court, you must love money, and the rumors among the outsiders are dire—this is all stirred up by the servants; you must be more cautious. Although our mansion has not been touched, if the Emperor grows suspicious, many inconveniences may follow.”

Hearing all this, Jia Zheng’s heart raced. “Have you all heard what I am hearing?” he asked. The assembled replied, “Though we have no direct evidence, we have heard that while you are serving at the Grain Depot, some of the household servants have been extorting money.”

Jia Zheng responded, “I have always conducted myself in accordance with Heaven’s will—I have never entertained such notions. It is only that these servants, out in the world boasting and scheming, have stirred up trouble; I cannot afford to let that continue.” They then murmured, “It would be best now to rigorously inspect all the managers of the household; if any disloyal servant is found, let them be dealt with severely.”

Jia Zheng nodded gravely. Just then, a servant from the gate arrived with news: “Young Master Sun has sent word that he, having pressing matters of his own, cannot come, but has dispatched someone to inspect things. He says that the elder should receive a sum of silver from the second elder’s share.” Jia Zheng’s heart grew heavy, and he muttered, “I understand.” The assembled sneered, “They say that dear Sun Shaozu is indeed a scoundrel. Now, while our mansion is being ransacked, he does not come to offer assistance but instead hurries off to demand silver—it makes no sense at all.” Jia Zheng replied, “Let us not talk of him now—the marriage on that side was always a mistake. My niece has already borne enough punishment; now they come after me.”

Just then, Xue Ke entered and said, “I have heard that Officer Zhao of the Jin Yi Mansion must follow the procedure required by the Censors; I fear that our elder and dear Jia Zhen will not be able to withstand it.” Everyone agreed, “Second Elder, you must go out and appeal to the Prince—only then might we salvage the situation. Otherwise, both these branches of the family are finished.” Jia Zheng thanked them and dispersed the group.

That evening, as night fell and lamps were lit, Jia Zheng went in to check on Grandmother. Finding that she was somewhat better, he returned to his own room and grumbled about Jia Lian and his wife, who had been ungrateful—now that the accounts have been “released,” it seems nothing remains, and all our valuables have been plundered. Moreover, with Wang Xifeng gravely ill and all our treasures seized, his heart was sore—but he dared not mention Wang Xifeng’s name, choosing instead to suffer in silence. The night passed without further word.

The next morning, Jia Zheng went to the Inner Court to express his thanks and proceeded to both the Beijing Prince’s and the Xiping Prince’s mansions to beg for their assistance regarding his elder brother and nephew. Both Princes assented, and Jia Zheng also made entreaties with his close acquaintances.

Meanwhile, Jia Lian, having found that his father’s and elder brothers’ affairs were in dire straits with no recourse, had no alternative but to return home. In his quarters, Ping’er sat weeping over Wang Xifeng, while Qiutong complained in the adjoining room about her mistress’s condition. As Jia Lian passed by, he saw Wang Xifeng lying on the verge of death; a flood of grievances welled up in him, leaving him speechless. Ping’er sobbed, “Now that everything is like this, what is gone cannot be recovered; and with Grandmother in this state, we must call for a doctor immediately.” Jia Lian spat, “Bah! If I cannot even preserve my own life, why should I care about her?”

Wang Xifeng, hearing this, opened her eyes and, though she spoke not a word, tears streamed down her face. Seeing Jia Lian leave, she said softly to Ping’er, “Do not be so headstrong. At a time like this, what use is it to care for me? I would rather die tonight. As long as you keep me in your heart, even after I am gone, you will raise Qiaojie well—and I, from beyond, shall be grateful for your affection.” Ping’er’s sobs deepened as she realized the gravity of their situation.

Wang Xifeng continued, “You must understand—though they have not come to express it, they are surely blaming me. Though these troubles were stirred up by events outside, I bear no guilt for not releasing the accounts. Alas, all my cunning efforts have been in vain; I have struggled my whole life only to fall behind others! I even faintly heard that dear Jia Zhen was involved in forcibly seizing a commoner’s wife to make a concubine—and when she resisted, she was beaten to death. There is even talk of someone surnamed Zhang being implicated. Just imagine—if that matter is fully investigated, our second elder will not escape blame. How can I face people then? I wish to die immediately rather than endure this disgrace; but if you summon a doctor now, it will not be for your sake but will only further harm me.”

Hearing her, Ping’er wept all the more, fearful that Wang Xifeng might take her own life, so she clutched her tightly.

Fortunately, Grandmother Jia, unaware of all the details, had begun to feel a little better these past few days—especially as Jia Zheng’s affairs seemed stable, and with Baoyù and Baochai by her side, she felt a measure of relief. Having always been most fond of Wang Xifeng, Grandmother Jia called for Yuanyang, saying, “Please bring some of my personal belongings for dear Wang Xifeng, and also some silver money for Ping’er so that they may serve her properly. I will see to the rest in due time.” She also ordered Madame Wang to attend to Madam Xing. At this point the Ningguo Mansion had been fully placed under official custody—all its property, land deeds, and even its household servants had been listed and collected. Grandmother Jia then sent a carriage to fetch You Shi—mother and daughter—from that household. Alas, the illustrious Ning Mansion now contained only these two women, along with Feng Xie and Luan, and not a single servant remained.

Grandmother Jia designated one of the houses for their residence—the very room adjacent to the one where Xi Chun lived—and assigned four matrons and two maids to serve them. All daily meals were prepared in the large kitchen and distributed accordingly; their clothes and other necessities were provided by Grandmother Jia herself, with even minor expenses accounted for in the treasury records according to the monthly allowances of the Rong household. As for Jia She, Jia Zhen, and Jia Rong, who were employed in the Jin Yi Mansion, the treasury had no further funds to support them. Now, dear Wang Xifeng has nothing left, and Jia Lian is burdened with debts. Jia Zheng, unaware of the detailed household accounts, simply said, “I have already entrusted someone to see that the arrangements are made.”

Jia Lian, with no alternative, thought of his relatives—Xue Yima’s household has already fallen, and Wang Zitong is dead. As for the rest of our relatives, though they exist, none can offer assistance. Thus, he secretly sent someone to the estate to sell off several acres for a few thousand in silver to serve as funds for his office expenses. In the meantime, some of the household servants, seeing that the family’s power had collapsed, began to stir up mischief—and even managed to seize the taxes for the Eastern Village for their own use. (These are later matters, which need not be recounted now.)

Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia, witnessing our ancestral offices stripped away and now our descendants detained and under investigation, and with Madam Xing, You Shi, and others weeping day and night—and with Wang Xifeng gravely ill despite the constant presence of Baoyù and Baochai, who could only try to console her but not relieve her sorrow—remained restless. Day and night, she brooded over the past, and her tears never dried. One evening, she called Baoyù to return, then, gathering herself, she sat up determinedly. She ordered Yuanyang and the others to go to every Buddhist altar in the house to offer incense. Then, she commanded that the inner courtyard be set ablaze with incense burners. Leaning on her cane, she stepped outside into the courtyard. Noticing that the amber lights recognized that the old lady was in prayer, a large red scarlet rug was spread out for her to kneel on.

Grandmother Jia knelt and bowed her head repeatedly, reciting prayers to the Buddha. With tears streaming down her face, she entreated Heaven and Earth, “O Imperial Heaven and all the Bodhisattvas above, we, the descendants of the Shi of the Jia family, humbly pray—grant us mercy. For generations, we in the Jia family have never dared to commit acts of cruelty or tyranny. Though we have sometimes aided our sons, if we cannot do good, we at least refrain from doing evil. It is only the wayward behavior of our descendants—engaging in extravagance, debauchery, and wasteful dissipation—that has brought about this ruin and the search of our mansion. Now, with our descendants detained, misfortune abounds; it is solely my sin for not restraining them that has led us thus. I now beg Heaven to protect us, to turn our misfortune to fortune, and for the ailing to find swift recovery. If, in His mercy, Heaven deems it fit to grant me death at once, so be it—let my sins be forgiven and my descendants spared!”

Her words trailed off in a pained whisper as she broke down into sorrowful wails. Yuanyang and Zhenzhu tried to console her and gently helped her back inside.

Soon, Madame Wang arrived accompanied by Baoyù and Baochai to bid the old lady good evening. Seeing Grandmother Jia in such anguish, the three of them also wept bitterly. Baochai’s sorrow was even deeper: she thought of her brother, now in detention and perhaps facing execution in the future, uncertain if any clemency might be granted; though her in-laws were unharmed, their family fortune was in ruins; and Baoyù remained as foolish as ever, devoid of any resolve. The prospect of spending a lifetime in such misery weighed heavily on her. Seeing Baochai so distressed, Baoyù himself became sorrowful, thinking, “How can our dear old Grandmother not be at peace? With our parents so desolate at this hour, and with our sisters’ charm dwindling day by day—what will become of the joyful gatherings of poetry and society in our gardens? Since the passing of Lin, I have been steeped in sorrow, and now with Sister Bao ever by my side, there is no time to weep properly. Moreover, he laments his longing for his brother and mother, and his days are void of laughter. Seeing him so heartbroken today, my heart cannot bear it,” and he broke into loud, anguished cries. Yuanyang, Caiyun, Ying’er, and Xiren, witnessing this, were moved and too began to cry quietly. The other maids, seeing such sorrow, could not help but weep as well. No one came forward to console them. The sounds of weeping within the house grew deafening, even frightening the night watchwomen outside, who hurried to report the matter to Jia Zheng.

At that moment, Jia Zheng was in his study, lost in troubled thoughts, when he heard a report from Grandmother’s attendants. His heart pounded, and he rushed inside. From afar he could hear a great clamor of crying; noticing that Grandmother’s condition seemed dire, he was stricken with dread. Rushing in, he found her sitting and wailing bitterly. Only then did his heart ease, and he said, “Grandmother, your sorrow must be assuaged. Why have you all begun to weep together so uncontrollably?” At these words, everyone hastily stilled their tears, and a heavy silence fell over the assembled. Jia Zheng stepped forward to comfort Grandmother, and addressed the others with several words. All were left to ponder, “We came here to console her and prevent her from sorrow, yet we have ourselves been overcome with grief.”

As they were still confused, an elderly woman entered accompanied by two ladies from the Shi family. After offering her respects to Grandmother, she addressed the gathering, “Our master, mistress, and young miss have sent me with a message: they have heard of the disturbances in the mansion, but there is nothing gravely wrong—only that we have been frightened for a time. Fearing that our master and mistress might be troubled, they have sent me to assure you that the second elder is not to be feared. Our young miss intended to come herself, but as her marriage is imminent, she could not spare the time.”

Grandmother Jia, unable to express her thanks properly, said, “Please return with my regards. This is the fate of our family. I am grateful that your master and mistress think of us; we shall visit again another day to express our thanks. As for your young miss’s marriage, I imagine your father-in-law need not be mentioned—how fares his household?”

The two women replied, “His affairs are not too bad. The young master is a fine fellow—gentle in manner. We have met him several times; he seems rather like your dear Baoyù. We have even heard that he is literate.”

Grandmother Jia beamed, “That is most pleasing. It is indeed your young miss’s good fortune. However, our family customs follow southern propriety, and thus we have never met our new father-in-law. Just the other day, I recalled my maternal relatives—I have always cherished you young ladies. In the 360 days of a year, you spent over 200 days with me. Now that you have grown so far, I had planned to find you a worthy husband. But with your uncle absent from home, it is not my place to decide. Since fortune has paired you with a good match, I am reassured. I had hoped to attend your wedding banquet this month, but now that our household is in such turmoil, my heart feels as if it were boiling in a hot cauldron—how can I possibly go to your home? Please return with my greetings and tell your young miss not to burden her heart with me. I am over eighty years old now; even in death I must consider myself fortunate. Only if she and her husband may live in harmony for a hundred years will I find peace.”

Tears welled in Grandmother Jia’s eyes as she spoke. The woman said, “Grandmother, please do not be so sorrowful. When your young miss is married, she will, after returning, surely come with her husband to pay you respects. Then you will be delighted.” Grandmother Jia nodded, and the woman departed. None of the others offered any further comment—except that Baoyù, who listened silently, was struck with thought. In his heart he wondered, “Why is it that a daughter, once grown, must marry off and then seem like a different person altogether? Once she is married, it is as though she is no longer my own. Even if Sister Shi is such a fine person, she has been forcibly matched by her uncle! When she meets me in the future, will she not treat me as a stranger? I wonder, what is the use of living if one must be shunned by those who once cared for you?” The thought brought him great sorrow; though he saw that Grandmother Jia was now somewhat comforted, he dared not weep and sat in quiet gloom.

After a time, Jia Zheng, still uneasy, went in to check on Grandmother again. Seeing that she was in a somewhat improved state, he went out and called for Lai Da, ordering him to bring out the household register of all those who managed the mansion. They painstakingly counted the names: aside from the persons under Jia She who had been taken into custody, there remained more than thirty households, totaling 222 men and women. Jia Zheng then summoned the 41 male servants currently on duty and inquired into the household’s expenses over the years—how much had come in and how much had been spent. The chief household manager presented the accounts. Upon reviewing them, Jia Zheng discovered that the income was insufficient to cover the expenditures. Moreover, the palace expenses over the years had forced many funds to be borrowed externally. Further investigation into the rents of the Eastern Province revealed that in recent years the payments had been less than half of what our ancestors had provided, while current expenses had soared to ten times the rent. Jia Zheng, unable to ignore these figures, stamped his foot in anger, “This is intolerable! I always thought that Jia Lian, who managed the household, would have things under control. Yet for years now, we have been ‘spending next year’s money in the current year,’ all while pretending everything is in order. They treat our official stipends as if they are insignificant—how can we possibly avoid ruin? I now must adopt frugality, but it is too late.”

As he paced back and forth with his hands behind his back, he found himself at a loss for remedy. The assembled servants, seeing that Jia Zheng was at a loss with managing household affairs, consoled him: “Sir, there is no need for you to be so anxious. Every household faces such hardships. When everything is tallied, even the Prince’s household barely gets by; our possessions are merely for show. Now that you have received the Emperor’s favor, isn’t it true that our household’s fortunes, once merged under official custody, would in time be restored?” Jia Zheng snapped, “Nonsense! You wretched lackeys! You shameless braggarts—taking advantage of our good fortune in better times to squander everything, leaving nothing behind when people come and go—do you not care at all for the fate of your master? Do you honestly think that if trouble erupts, you can simply push it off onto him? And now, regarding the matter of Jia She and Jia Zhen—as they say, it was our servant Bao Er who made the most noise. I see no mention of Bao Er in these registers! What is this all about?” The servants replied, “That Bao Er is not listed in our official records. He was recorded in the Ning Mansion’s register earlier, when Second Elder thought him trustworthy and called him over along with two others. Later, when his wife died, he returned to Ning Mansion. Ever since our master’s office was troubled, with Grandmother, the mistresses, and the men all having gone to the mausoleum, dear Jia Zhen was appointed to manage the household affairs, and those who were brought over have since left. Our master has not been in charge of the household for years—how should he know these details? He only sees the names in the register, and there is only one Bao Er there, though in reality, several relatives and servants bear that name.” Jia Zheng exclaimed, “This is outrageous!” Realizing that he could not resolve the matter immediately, he dismissed everyone with a wave. In his heart, he had resolved to wait until the official investigation into Jia She and the others was completed before making further decisions.

One day, while Jia Zheng was in his study making plans, a messenger burst in and said, “Please, sir—hurry into the Inner Court for questioning.” Alarmed, Jia Zheng quickly gathered himself and went inside.

What fate awaits them all—whether fortune or misfortune—remains to be revealed in the next chapter.
Chapter 107
Dispensing the Remaining Wealth in Accordance with Grandmother’s High Principles; Restoring Official Offices, and the Minister Being Bathed in Heavenly Grace

When Jia Zheng entered the Inner Court, he was greeted by the ministers of the Privy Council as well as the various Princes. The Beijing Prince (North Quiet Prince) announced, “Today we have summoned you in order to inquire about matters in accordance with the imperial edict.” Jia Zheng immediately knelt. One after another the ministers asked, “Are you aware of the charges against your elder brother – that he fraternized with external officials, bullied the weak, encouraged gambling among his cronies, and even forcibly seized the wives and daughters of commoners, driving one to death?”

Jia Zheng replied, “Ever since I was specially appointed by the Emperor to study governance and complete my term, I have been busy with relief work. Last winter I returned home, then was assigned to oversee an engineering project; afterwards I was dispatched to the Jiangxi Grain Bureau and sent back to the capital – all while continuing my duties at the Ministry of Works. I have worked day and night without negligence. In all these, I have not taken proper care of our household matters. I was utterly ignorant and failed to discipline my nephews. This, I fear, is indeed a grave dereliction of duty in light of the Emperor’s gracious favor. I fully accept any severe punishment the Emperor sees fit.”

The Beijing Prince conveyed these words upward. Soon an edict was received, and the Beijing Prince explained: “The Emperor, after hearing the Censors’ memorial regarding Jia She’s misconduct – that he fraternized with external officials, bullied the weak, and that the Censors, having noted his monopolization of legal disputes, subjected him to strict questioning – also examined the communications from Ping’an Prefecture concerning his relatives’ exchanges. It turned out that nothing improper had been done regarding official business. The Censors could not substantiate their charges except for one matter: Jia She’s coercive demands for a certain ornamental fan from the mad Stone-Dumb, which, though excessive, was merely a trifle, a mere toy hardly comparable to forcibly seizing the wives of commoners. Even if Stone-Dumb’s subsequent suicide was the result of lunacy, it did not bear any necessary connection with the death by coercion.

“Furthermore, by examining the original documents from the Metropolitan Surveillance Office, it appears that the charge against Jia Zhen – that he forcibly seized the wife and daughter of a commoner, leading to death – does not hold: it turns out that Young Lady You Er was betrothed by an arranged engagement with Zhang Hua, but, due to her poverty, she voluntarily cancelled the match; her mother then wished to marry Jia Zhen’s younger brother. This was not an act of coercion. As for You San, who committed suicide and was interred without filing a report, it is clear that she was originally Jia Zhen’s wife’s younger sister; her intended match was thwarted when a fixed dowry was demanded, and the resulting scandal and public outrage drove her to take her own life. This, too, was not an act of coercion on Jia Zhen’s part.

“However, because they were hereditary officials—oblivious to proper regulations—and had secretly interred a body, they should have been severely punished. Yet, in view of their status as descendants of meritorious subjects, the Emperor could not bring himself to impose the full penalty. Thus, by His grace, Jia She is to be sent to serve at a regional post to atone for his sins, while Jia Zhen is dispatched to the distant seas for the same purpose. As for Jia Rong, being young and uninvolved, he is to be excused. Finally, since you, Jia Zheng, have served diligently for many years in external posts and have conducted your official duties with care, you are not to be blamed for the mismanagement of household affairs.”

Hearing this, Jia Zheng was overcome with gratitude and tears; he knelt repeatedly in thanks and then entreated the Prince to convey his heartfelt remorse and thanks in his report. The Beijing Prince said, “You should, above all, give thanks to Heaven. Is there anything more you wish to add?”

Jia Zheng answered, “I have been blessed with the Emperor’s mercy and have not received the harshest punishment. Moreover, the family property is to be restored. I feel so deeply remorseful that I wish to submit the remaining ancestral wealth – the accumulated surplus – for official appraisal as well.”

The Beijing Prince replied, “The Emperor is benevolent and prudent in his use of punishments and rewards. Now that you have been so richly favored and have had your family assets returned, there is no need for further petition.” Other officials concurred. Jia Zheng then expressed his gratitude and departed to report the news to Grandmother. He hurried back home so as not to worry her; meanwhile, all the family members outside anxiously speculated about whether the news concerning Jia Zheng was favorable or otherwise. But when they saw him return, they felt slightly relieved and did not dare to ask further.

Jia Zheng quickly went to Grandmother’s side and explained in detail the news of the Emperor’s clemency. Although Grandmother was relieved, she could not help but feel sorrow over the fact that two hereditary offices had been stripped – with Jia She being sent to a regional post and Jia Zhen dispatched to the distant seas. This inevitably grieved her further. Madam Xing and Lady You, upon hearing the news, began to cry even more.

Jia Zheng reassured, “Grandmother, please be at ease. Although our elder brother has been assigned to the regional post, he is still in the service of the nation and will not suffer unduly; if he performs his duties properly, he may eventually be restored. And Jia Zhen, though young, is expected to prove himself. If things had not turned out thus, even the leftover merits of our forefathers would not last.”

His words provided some consolation. Grandmother Jia had never been particularly fond of Jia She, and the Eastern Branch headed by Jia Zhen was even more remote. Only Madam Xing and Lady You wept uncontrollably. Madam Xing, deep in thought, lamented, “Our entire fortune has been swept away; our husband is old and sent far afield; although Jia Lian remains, he has always sided with our second uncle – and now everything depends on him. How am I to endure being left all alone?” Lady You, who had long managed the affairs of the Ning Mansion almost single-handedly – with Jia Zhen regarded as paramount – now found that with his transgression and exile, and with the family wealth confiscated and merged into the Rong Mansion, even though Grandmother still dotes on us, we remain at the mercy of others. Moreover, carrying the burdens of Feng Xifeng and Luan, Jia Rong and his wife are unable to establish their own household. And then I think of my second and third daughters – all troubles stirred up by Jia Lian – and now they remain unscathed while only we suffer. How are we ever to live?” With these thoughts, she burst into tears.

Grandmother Jia then asked Jia Zheng, “Will our elder brother and Jia Zhen be allowed to return home?”

Jia Zheng replied, “Under the current regulations, our elder brother cannot return home immediately. I have already interceded privately so that he may return together with his nephew to prepare for his departure – the authorities at the office have already agreed. I expect that Jia Rong will also be allowed to come out together with his father. Please, Grandmother, rest assured – I am handling it.”

Grandmother Jia went on, “I have not been able to follow our family affairs these past few years because of my age. Now, the Eastern Branch has been confiscated – the houses are in official custody; and on your elder brother’s side and Jia Lian’s side, everything has been seized. Tell me, how much silver remains in the Western Mansion and the Eastern Province’s lands? They should at least receive a few thousand taels.”

Jia Zheng, at a loss for words, thought to himself, “If I explain everything, Grandmother will only be further distressed; but if I say nothing, what remedy do we have now?” After much thought, he replied, “Grandmother, if you do not press me, I dare not say more. I have already checked with Jia Lian: the silver in the old treasury has long since been exhausted—not only completely spent, but there is even a deficit. As for our elder brother’s case, unless we spend silver to arrange a private appeal, even with the Emperor’s generous clemency, I fear that neither he nor Jia Zhen will be in good shape. Moreover, that sum of silver has no designated plan. And the lands of the Eastern Province have already been “eaten up” by next year’s rents; there is nothing we can do at the moment. We must resort to converting whatever household jewelry and ornaments remain – those assets that the Emperor’s favor has left untouched – into funds for our elder brother and Jia Zhen’s expenses. The rest of our future plans will have to be devised later.”

Grandmother Jia, upon hearing this, burst into tears again and cried, “What is to be done? Has our family reached such a low point? I recall that in better times our fortunes were ten times as abundant as they are now – and we only maintained a façade for years without such calamities. Now, it appears that in one or two years we cannot even sustain ourselves!”

Jia Zheng replied, “If only these two hereditary stipends remained intact, we might still be able to shift funds. But now, there is no one willing to come to our aid.” With that, he wept bitterly, “When I think of our relatives – those who have used our resources are now impoverished, and those who have never benefited from us refuse to help. Yesterday I merely glanced at our household register – not only is there not a single coin coming in from above, but even the men below cannot be properly maintained.”

Just then, Jia She, Jia Zhen, and Jia Rong entered to pay their respects to Grandmother. Seeing this dismal scene, Grandmother grasped Jia She by one hand and Jia Zhen by the other and began to weep bitterly. Both of them, ashamed, knelt and wept, saying, “Our descendants have not improved; they have squandered the achievements of our ancestors and brought endless sorrow upon you, Grandmother. Soon, we will all be left with no place to call home!” At this, everyone in the room began crying uncontrollably. Jia Zheng could only try to console them, “First we must consider their future assignments. It appears that they may only stay at home for a day or two; if we delay too long, no one will support them.”

With a heavy heart, Grandmother Jia said, “You both should speak with your wives for a while.” Then she instructed Jia Zheng, “This matter cannot be delayed any further. If we try to shift everything externally, it may not work – we might even run afoul of the imperial mandate. I must plan for you. Even though the household is in disarray, this is not a normal state.” With that, she sent Yuanyang away with orders.

Later, Jia She and the others emerged and wept with Jia Zheng for a while, recalling past misbehaviors, later regrets, and the sorrow of parting. Each of their wives was also inconsolable. Although Jia She, being elderly, could somewhat bear it, Jia Zhen and Lady You found it unbearable to part, and Jia Lian and Jia Rong clung to their father, crying. Though it was a lesser penalty in the eyes of the authorities, it amounted in the end to a separation that felt like life or death. Such were the circumstances; all that could be done was for everyone to steel their hearts and carry on.

Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia ordered Madam Xing, Lady Wang, and others to open every chest and cabinet and bring out all the possessions accumulated by her future daughter-in-law over the years. Then she instructed Jia She, Jia Zheng, and Jia Zhen to divide them accordingly. She gave Jia She 3,000 taels of silver, saying, “Take 2,000 taels for your personal expenses, and leave 1,000 taels for the use of the eldest lady.” For Jia Zhen she allocated 3,000 taels as well, instructing, “You may use only 1,000 taels for yourself, leaving 2,000 taels for your wife to keep safe. Continue to live separately – you shall live in one house and share meals, while the arrangements for the four maidservants’ future marriages shall remain my responsibility. Poor Feng, who has labored all her life, is given only 3,000 taels for her own use – and she is not to ask Jia Lian for any of it. As for her, who is still so ill and barely conscious, let Ping’er take it. These are the garments left by your grandfather, along with the clothes and jewelry I wore in my youth – which I no longer need. The men’s belongings shall be divided among the eldest master, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong. The women’s items shall go to the eldest lady, Jia Zhen’s wife, and Feng. As for the 500 taels of silver, they shall be given to Jia Lian; next year, when Lin’s coffin is sent back to the South, it will be used for that purpose.”

Having finalized the division, she then told Jia Zheng, “You must also see to the outstanding debts. Have the gold converted and sold to settle them. They have wronged me greatly. You, as my son, have never shown partiality.”

She continued, “All the remaining gold and silver that I have – amounting to perhaps a few thousand taels – is to go to Baoyù. And Pearl’s wife, who has always been filial, and Lan’er as well – I shall allot some for them. With this, my affairs will be settled.”

Jia Zheng and the others, moved by their mother’s decisive and clear judgment, knelt and wept, saying, “Grandmother, at your age, our lack of filial piety in repaying the great blessings of our ancestors leaves us utterly shameful.”

Grandmother Jia replied, “Nonsense. Had it not been for this very turmoil, I might have kept it all. But now, with so many household members, only the second elder is left to attend to affairs – and a few men are enough. You must instruct the managers to gather everyone and properly allocate the property. Those people, if they were seized earlier, would have been distributed accordingly – each receiving what they are due, and those who deserve a reward shall be compensated. Although the houses have not been officially confiscated, you must eventually surrender the gardens. The lands must be cleared by Jia Lian – sell those that must be sold and keep what remains; no more pretensions, no more empty claims. I will say this plainly: the Zhen family in Jiangnan still holds a few taels of silver; the eldest lady has them – see that they are sent over. If any further issues arise, they will be said to have “escaped the storm only to be hit by the rain” again.”

Jia Zheng, who was not one to manage household affairs, listened to his mother and followed her orders, thinking, “Grandmother is truly a master at managing the household. It is we, the unworthy, who have ruined everything.”

Seeing that Grandmother was worn out, Jia Zheng pleaded that she rest and recover. Grandmother Jia added, “I have little left now; when I pass on, what remains shall serve as my legacy. All that is left shall be given to the servants who have long served me.”

Hearing this, Jia Zheng and the others became even more sorrowful and knelt, “Please, Grandmother, have a generous heart. May our sons, by your blessing, soon receive imperial favor so that, with utmost diligence, they can restore our fortunes, atone for their past wrongs, and ensure that you, dear Grandmother, live to one hundred.”

Grandmother Jia replied, “So may it be. I would rather meet our ancestors in death than live in disgrace. Do not imagine that I have only ever enjoyed riches – these recent years I watched you all make such a ruckus, and I was happy enough to chat and enjoy my days. Who would have thought that our family fortune would collapse so utterly? Had I known that the outward appearances were so splendid while the inner core was so hollow, I would have been worried long ago. But ‘as your dwelling changes, so your spirit must adapt’ – I could not keep up with the change, and now I am forced off the stage. Now, by consolidating our resources and holding on to our façade, perhaps some might still laugh at us, but at least we will be recognized. You do not know that when I have no money left, I become so anxious that I nearly die. My heart is always with our ancestors’ tremendous merits; every day I hope that you will be even stronger than our forefathers and be able to hold on. Who would have thought that our eldest son and Jia Zhen would get involved in such nefarious deeds!”

While Grandmother Jia was lost in her long lament, Feng Xifeng’s attendant, Feng’er, rushed in breathlessly to inform Madame Wang, “This morning our Grandmother heard of the troubles outside and wept a great deal; now her strength has almost failed. Ping’er has sent me to inform the mistress.” Before Feng’er could finish, Grandmother Jia asked, “What is it? How is it?” Madame Wang answered on Feng’er’s behalf, “It is said to be not very good.” Grandmother Jia rose and said, “Ah! These ungrateful people – they seem determined to wear me down to death.” She called for someone to support her as she insisted on going to see for herself, but Jia Zheng quickly intervened, “Grandmother, you have been so troubled and have already seen to many matters today. Perhaps you should rest a while. If your grandson’s wife has any issue, let her go and see it – there is no need for you to expose yourself further. If you become even more distraught, how will we, your children, manage your care?”

Grandmother Jia replied, “You all go out for a while; come back in a bit – I still have more to say.”

Jia Zheng dared not argue further and went out to see to the arrangements for his brothers and nephews. He then ordered Jia Lian to select some men to follow him. At that moment, Grandmother Jia sent Yuanyang and others to fetch the items meant for Feng Xifeng, and they accompanied her.

Feng Xifeng, who was faint with anger, while Ping’er wept until her eyes were swollen and her cheeks flushed, heard Grandmother Jia accompanied by Madame Wang coming. She hurried out to greet them. Grandmother Jia asked, “How are things now?”

Frightened lest Grandmother Jia be shocked, Ping’er replied, “They are somewhat better now.” Then she led Grandmother Jia inside and gently lifted the curtain aside. When Feng Xifeng opened her eyes, she saw Grandmother Jia enter with a look of deep shame and sorrow. Earlier, she had been so determined to scold and blame Grandmother Jia that she thought no one cared for her anymore; but now that Grandmother herself had come to see her, Feng Xifeng’s heart softened—the oppressive atmosphere in the room seemed to ease slightly, and she almost tried to sit up.

Grandmother Jia asked Ping’er, “Are you feeling better?”

Feng Xifeng, with tears streaming, replied, “I am somewhat better; but ever since I was young, how they cared for me – the Grandmother and the mistresses – I never expected that my fate would be so wretched. Now, having been reduced to nothing, with the gods and ghosts controlling my every move, I cannot show even a trace of filial piety in front of Grandmother and the mistresses. How can I face them, having turned my household upside down? Today, with Grandmother and the mistresses coming personally, I feel even less able to face them – I fear that my already shortened life may be further cut short.” She choked on her words in sorrow.

Grandmother Jia consoled, “All those troubles were stirred up by matters outside and have nothing to do with you. Even if your belongings were taken away, it matters little. I have brought many things for you to see.” She then ordered that several items be brought forward for Feng Xifeng.

Feng Xifeng, who had once been insatiable in her greed, now having been stripped of all her possessions, was filled with grief and feared being further blamed. In that moment she felt she had little reason to live. But seeing that Grandmother Jia still cared for her, and that Madame Wang did not chide her but came to comfort her, and noticing that Jia Lian was untroubled, her heart eased somewhat. She then prostrated herself on a pillow before Grandmother Jia, saying, “Please, Grandmother, do not worry. If my illness recovers by your grace, I would even willingly be nothing more than a lowly servant, devoting my every effort to serving you, dear Grandmother and mistress!”

Hearing her sorrowful words, Grandmother Jia could not help but shed tears.

Baoyù, who had never before experienced such calamities and knew only pleasure and ease, now found that everything around him was filled with tears and sorrow. In his simple-mindedness he began to cry as well whenever he saw others weep. Feng Xifeng, noticing the sorrow around her, mustered her strength to speak a few consoling words to Grandmother Jia, pleading, “Please, Grandmother and Mistress, return to your room; I will come and prostrate myself once I feel a little better.” Lifting her head high, she looked up. Grandmother Jia then ordered Ping’er, “See that you attend to her properly. Do not delay – if she needs to come to me, send her at once.” As Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang began to withdraw to their room, a few cries could still be heard. Hearing these, Grandmother Jia, unable to bear the sound of wailing, ordered Madame Wang to disperse the gathering and said to Baoyù, “Go and see your elder brother and your uncle; see them off and then return.” She herself lay on her couch, weeping softly. Fortunately, Yuanyang and the others managed to use every gentle word to console her so that she could at least rest for a while.

Meanwhile, outside, those sycophantic relatives and friends – who had previously avoided the Jia residence during its troubles – now came forward to congratulate Jia Zheng on inheriting the hereditary office of the Duke of Rongguo. At the gate, people clamored, “Today’s edict decrees that the hereditary office of the Duke of Rongguo shall be assumed by Jia Zheng!” Those present expected to receive congratulatory gifts; however, some of the gatekeepers argued, “This is our family’s traditional hereditary office – what is there to celebrate?” The crowd retorted, “The honor of that office is rarer than any other assignment. Now that our eldest has been deposed and this office granted to the second elder, it is a once-in-a-thousand-years blessing – how can we not celebrate?”

Amidst the jubilation, Jia Zheng returned home. Though pleased, he was overcome with grief for it was all caused by his elder brother’s transgressions, and he could not help but weep as he hurried inside to report the news to Grandmother. Grandmother, naturally delighted, spoke words of thanks and gratitude. Madame Wang, fearful that Grandmother might be too sorrowful, came to console her upon hearing that the hereditary office had been restored, and she too rejoiced. Only Madam Xing and Lady You, deep in their hearts, felt profound grief but did not dare to show it openly.

Meanwhile, among the relatives and friends who had once bowed to the Jia family’s misfortune, news of Jia Zheng’s inheritance of the office spread quickly—and now, knowing that the imperial favor was still with the family, everyone came to offer their congratulations. Yet Jia Zheng, by nature simple and pure, felt only gratitude for the divine mercy even as he inherited his brother’s office; inwardly, he was troubled, for he knew the cause of this restoration was his brother’s offense, and his heart was heavy with tears.

The next day, Jia Zheng went into the Inner Court to express thanks and proceeded to both the Beijing Prince’s and the Xiping Prince’s mansions to beg for further assistance regarding his elder brother and nephew. Both Princes assented. Jia Zheng also made entreaties with his close associates.

But the family’s finances were in dire straits, with expenses far outstripping income. Jia Zheng, unable to mingle much in external affairs, saw that the household was in chaos. With Feng Xifeng bedridden and unable to manage the family, and Jia Lian’s debts mounting day by day, it became inevitable that some of the family properties would be mortgaged or sold. Many of the relatively affluent household members, fearful of Jia Lian’s interference, pretended to be impoverished to avoid drawing attention; some even took leave and sought other opportunities. Only one man – Bao Yong – though newly employed at the mansion, showed genuine commitment. Witnessing how others deceived their master, he often grew indignant. Alas, being new, he had little chance to speak up and eventually became frustrated; after drinking a few cups he wandered the streets of the Rong Mansion and overheard two men talking. One said, “Look at this grand mansion – it was ransacked the other day. I wonder what has become of it now?” The other replied, “How can their fortunes collapse? I heard that one of the mistresses is from the Jia family – even though she is dead, she still has a foundation. Besides, those who frequent the mansion are nobles – where else can one find such patronage? Even the current Prefect, as well as the former Minister of War, are from their clan. Do these people not protect them?” The first man said, “You’re wasting your time here! Others might be forgiven, but that ‘Lord Jia’ is truly something else. I often see him going back and forth between the two mansions. Even though the Censors have filed a memorial, the master ordered the Prefect to reexamine the facts. What do you think of him? He once enjoyed the favors of both mansions, but when people accused him of nepotism, he kicked hard – and that is why both mansions were ransacked. What do you think of the state of affairs nowadays?”

Unbeknownst to them, someone nearby overheard every word. Bao Yong, fuming in his drunken state, thought, “There are indeed such men in this world! But I wonder what relation he has with our master. If I should meet him, I’d beat him to death – and if trouble were to arise, I would bear the consequences myself.” As Bao Yong ruminated in his drunken reverie, he suddenly heard someone shout. From afar he saw two men whispering, “Here he comes – that Lord Jia has arrived.” Enraged, Bao Yong, in his inebriation, loudly cried out, “Ungrateful wretches! How can you forget the kindness of the Jia family?”

Yuyun, riding in the sedan, caught the sound of the name “Jia” and looked about. Seeing only a drunken man, he paid it no heed and moved on.

Drunken Bao Yong, not knowing when to stop, returned to the mansion feeling self-satisfied. He later boasted to his companions that the man he had just seen was a promoted official of the mansion – who, having forgotten old favors, now dared to trifle with the Jia family. He claimed that when he had scolded this official, the man dared not reply. The people of the Rong Mansion, who had long disliked Bao Yong, now took advantage of Jia Zheng’s calm moment to report Bao Yong’s drunken antics to him.

At that moment, Jia Zheng, fearing further disturbances, upon hearing the report from his household, became angry and summoned Bao Yong to his presence. He castigated him harshly, though he did not wish to impose severe punishment. Instead, he ordered Bao Yong to keep watch in the garden and forbade him from wandering outside. Bao Yong, a straightforward fellow who had once been loyal to his master, was now dismayed to be verbally chastised by Jia Zheng. With no choice, he gathered his belongings and went to the garden to oversee the watering of the plants.

What will happen next? We shall learn in the next chapter.
Chapter 108
Forced Merriment Amid the Withering of the Garden; Heartbreaking Wails Resound in the Misty Xiang River

It happened that Jia Zheng had previously submitted a memorial requesting that the family estates—including the Grand View Garden—be taken into official custody. The Inner Court, however, declined to accept them since no one was living there, and so they were sealed off. In time, as the garden adjoined the residences of Lady You and Xi Chun, and its vast grounds lay empty, the authorities punished Bao Yong by assigning him to guard the desolate garden. Meanwhile, as Jia Zheng struggled to manage the household in accordance with Grandmother’s orders, the number of family members was steadily being reduced, and despite their attempts at thrift, there were simply not enough resources to sustain everyone. Fortuitously, Feng Xifeng, being Grandmother’s favored one, continued to manage the inner affairs—even though Madame Wang and others did not care much for her personally, they acknowledged that she was capable of running the household. Yet ever since the confiscations, the use of funds had become so constrained that every expenditure was painfully tight. The servants, who were once accustomed to ample provisions, now found themselves reduced to barely one-third of their former share, and complaints abounded. Even Feng Xifeng dared not refuse her tasks in Grandmother’s presence, and she labored on despite her failing health.

After a time, Jia She and Jia Zhen, having been assigned to official posts, enjoyed some temporary relief with a modest allowance, and when they later wrote home, they all declared that life was becoming more comfortable—so that Grandmother could finally rest easy, and Lady Xing and Lady You also felt, if only slightly, relieved.

One day, Shi Xiangyun, freshly returned from her wedding journey, came to pay respects to Grandmother. Grandmother spoke fondly of her son-in-law, and Xiangyun reported on the peace prevailing at her own family home, urging Grandmother not to worry. Yet when the subject turned to the passing of Daiyu, tears inevitably flowed from everyone. Grandmother then recalled the sufferings of Yingchun and became even more sorrowful. Xiangyun tried to console her before proceeding on to visit other branches of the family. Finally, she returned to Grandmother’s room to rest. While speaking of the state of the Xue family—“They say that Brother Xue’s uproar has left his household in ruins; though this year the penalties have been softened, who knows if next year the sentence will be reduced further?”—Grandmother replied, “You do not know all yet. Just yesterday, Pan’er’s wife died in a most confusing manner, nearly causing another uproar. Fortunately, the old imperial edict was discerning enough to have the maid brought out on her own so that Madam Xia could no longer stir trouble. Your Aunt’s household managed to contain the scandal by verifying matters, and they only dismissed those ‘skin and meat’ cases. Now we must carry on with life with little but the child’s meager presence.” She continued in a low, troubled tone. “This child, however, has some sense; he says that his elder brother is still entangled in official matters and refuses to marry. And your sister Xing, who stays with the eldest mistress, is in such misery. Miss Qin’s mourning for her father has not yet been fully observed, and the Mei family’s match is still pending. Truly, it seems that ‘all six relatives share in this misfortune.’ The Xue family is no different; with the death of the eldest maternal uncle, even Feng’s own brother has lost his bearings. That second maternal uncle was a miser and, compounded by unclear official accounts and even famine, the Zhen family has been left with no further news since the confiscation.”

Xiangyun interjected, “Has your third sister sent any letters?”

Grandmother sighed, “Ever since she married, your third sister has been well in the distant seas—though she has not written, I think of her day and night. Our family has been plagued by misfortune time and again, so I can do little about it. And now even the fourth sister has not been given a match. What of Huan? Who has the time to think of him? Our family life is even harsher now than it was when you all lived here. And poor Baoyù—ever since he married, not a single day has been peaceful. And your second brother remains as erratic as ever—what is to be done?”

Xiangyun replied, “I have grown up here and know well the temperaments of our people. This time, when I returned, I found that everyone seemed different. I expected them to greet me as heartily as before—but somehow, after some exchange of words, the mood turned mournful. So I sat for a while and then came straight to Grandmother’s room.”

Grandmother said, “Perhaps I should devise a plan to lift their spirits for just one more day of merriment—but I cannot muster the energy.”

Xiangyun’s face brightened suddenly. “Is it not tomorrow that is our dear Baoyù’s birthday? I will stay one more day and arrange a celebration in his honor—so that everyone may enjoy one day of rejoicing. How do you feel about that, Grandmother?”

Grandmother’s eyes widened in sudden realization. “Goodness! I nearly forgot—it is indeed his birthday the day after tomorrow! I shall bring out some money tomorrow and arrange a proper birthday celebration for him. In his youth he had several such celebrations before he was betrothed, but now that he is married, none have been held. That child Baoyù is clever and mischievous; yet with the family’s misfortunes, he seems to have lost his lively spark. Only Pearl’s wife seems to be faring well. Sometimes he is cheerful, and sometimes not, living quietly with Lan’er—it is hard for him.”

Xiangyun added, “Others remain unchanged, but even Second Sister-in-law has altered her looks and no longer speaks as sharply. Tomorrow, let me go and tease them a little and see what comes of it. But if they only mutter under their breath, they might then accuse me of having changed….” At these words her face flushed scarlet. Grandmother, understanding her meaning, said, “What does it matter? In the old days, all the sisters lived together in merriment, laughing and chatting without a care. One must be able to endure both prosperity and poverty. Our dear Baoyù was born a generous soul—when his family was prosperous, he was never conceited; and when misfortune befell, he accepted it without complaint. Now, while he is well treated at our home, he is as comfortable as ever. And if for a time he is not, he does not seem to worry. I believe he is truly blessed. As for our Lin sister, being the youngest and overly sensitive, she never lives long. And Feng, having seen too much in life, should not change at the first sign of trouble. Tomorrow, I shall set aside some extra silver and throw a lively birthday party for him, so that he may have one day of true joy.”

Xiangyun agreed, “Grandmother speaks truly. Let us invite all the sisters so we may all gather and celebrate together.”

Grandmother replied, “Of course we shall invite them.” In high spirits she then ordered Yuanyang to fetch one hundred taels of silver from outside, instructing, “Prepare a feast for two days’ worth of food and wine beginning tomorrow.” Yuanyang accepted the order, and the money was delivered. That night, no further word was exchanged.

The next day, messages were sent out. Yingchun was summoned, and invitations were extended to Aunt Xue, to Baoqin, and to Xianghang; even Aunt Li arrived shortly afterward, accompanied by Li Wen and Li Qi. Baochai, who had not known about the plan, heard that Grandmother’s maid had come calling, saying, “Aunt Xue is here—she is inviting Second Madam to come over.” Pleased in her heart, Baochai immediately donned her best clothes and went to see her mother. There she encountered her younger sister Baoqin and Xianghang, and also Aunt Li and the others. Thinking, “They must have heard that our affairs are finally over and have come to offer their respects,” she greeted Aunt Li warmly, then exchanged a few words with her mother and the Li sisters.

Xiangyun then said to those gathered, “Ladies, please sit down so that we, as sisters, may offer our respects to our dear sister on her birthday.” Baochai was taken aback, and then thought, “Isn’t tomorrow my birthday?” She quickly added, “But if we celebrate my birthday, that wouldn’t be proper!” As the women began to defer to one another, Baoyù himself came to greet Aunt Xue and Aunt Li. Hearing that Baochai herself was pushing aside the idea of celebrating her birthday, he inwardly planned to have Grandmother host a birthday celebration for Baochai—but the family’s recent chaos had rendered him too timid to mention it at Grandmother’s house. Now, with Xiangyun and the others insisting on a birthday celebration, Baoyù declared, “Tomorrow is his birthday—I must tell Grandmother.”

Xiangyun teased, “How embarrassing! Does Grandmother really need you to tell her? Look around—why have all these people come? It is Grandmother who summoned them.” Baochai, however, was unconvinced; when she heard Grandmother say to her mother, “Poor Baoyù, who has been a new son-in-law for a year now, and with household troubles coming one after another, has never had a proper birthday celebration—today I shall arrange one for him. Please, Aunt Xue and all the mistresses, let’s chat,” Aunt Xue remarked, “Our affairs are not too dire; but the young master has already neglected to show proper filial respect to Grandmother, and yet Grandmother is still burdened.” Xiangyun observed, “Grandmother loves her second elder the most—surely she must also care for Baochai? Moreover, our dear sister Baochai deserves a birthday celebration from Grandmother.” Baochai lowered her head in silence. Baoyù, in his heart, mused, “I always thought that once Xiangyun married, she would change completely—this is why I dared not get too close to her, and now she ignores me; but why is it that our own, even after marriage, seem so bashful that they cannot speak their minds?” Lost in thought, he began to weep, exclaiming, “Lin, oh Lin! It is all my fault! Do not blame me—for our parents have decided, and it was not my betrayal!” His sorrow grew until he burst into tears. At that moment, Xiangyun’s attendant, Qiuwen, arrived with a small group and said to Xiangyun, “How dare you! What are you doing here with Second Master? The mistresses have sent word all over that you and Second Master have come here, frightening them so much that they have sent word for me to come and fetch you. Hurry back—there is no time to linger.”

Baoyù, still weeping bitterly, was gently urged by Xiangyun to leave, as she explained that Grandmother and the mistresses were anxiously awaiting news. Reluctantly, Baoyù allowed himself to be led away.

Xiangyun then took Baoyù back to Grandmother’s room, where everyone was still assembled. Grandmother said sternly, “Xiangyun! I have always trusted you with Baoyù, so why did you take him into the garden today? His health is fragile; if he were to get into any trouble out there, it would only cause more distress. You must not let him wander off.” Xiangyun could not find the words to protest and only lowered her head in silence. Baochai, seeing that Baoyù looked pale, was truly alarmed. Still, Baoyù insisted, “Good heavens, what is there to fear? I simply missed visiting the garden for a while, and now, with a bit of wine, I went for a stroll—what harm can that do?”

Feng Xifeng, having suffered much in the garden before, shuddered at the sound and said, “My dear Baoyù, your nerve is exceedingly bold.” Xiangyun remarked, “It isn’t mere boldness—it is a steadfast heart. I wonder if he has set out in search of the Goddess of Hibiscus, or perhaps some immortal?” Baoyù said nothing further, and only Madame Wang remained silently anxious.

Grandmother asked, “Did you encounter any alarming sights in the garden?” “No, nothing of the sort,” Xiangyun replied. “But do not speak too much of it. In the future, when you wander, be sure to take several companions along. It wasn’t you who stirred up trouble; everyone had already dispersed long ago. Go now, get some proper rest, and tomorrow morning we shall meet again. I want to see that everyone is cheerful for a day—let no further incidents occur.”

Upon hearing this, everyone took their leave. Aunt Xue then went to stay with the earth’s steward, while Shi Xiangyun remained in Grandmother’s room, and Yingchun went to see Xi Chun. The others returned to their homes without further word. Only Baoyù remained behind, dejected, sighing bitterly. Baochai, well aware of the situation, paid him little heed. Still, fearful that his sorrow might trigger an old ailment, she took him into a private room and called for Xiangyun to come and gently inquire about his experience in the garden.

How would Xiangyun answer?
(To be continued in the next chapter.)
Chapter 109
When the Soul of Fang Is Awaited, Wu’er Must Bear a Misplaced Love; Repaying Sinful Debts, a Daughter Returns to Her True Essence

Baochai, fearful that Baoyù might fall gravely ill from sorrow, sends Xiren to inquire about the matter. In private conversation, Baochai recounts the dying words of Daiyu as if in idle chat, saying, “When one is in this world, feelings and affections abound. Yet when death comes, each soul goes its own way – it is not as though the person remains unchanged after death. Although the living may harbor foolish attachments, the dead do not even know; and since Miss Lin declared she had become an immortal, how could she deign to mingle with us mere mortals? It is only our own doubts that summon such mischievous, otherworldly presences to harass us.”

Baochai originally meant these words for Baoyù’s ears. Xiren, understanding Baochai’s intention, replies lightly, “Nonsense. If Miss Lin’s spirit were still lingering in the garden, wouldn’t we have seen her in our dreams at least once?”

Hearing this from outside, Baoyù ponders quietly, “Strange indeed. I know Miss Lin is dead, yet that day passed without so much as a single dream. It must be that she has ascended to heaven—seeing as I am but a common man, unworthy of communion with the divine, no dream comes to me. Perhaps if I sleep outdoors, when I return from the garden her spirit might sense my heart and appear in a dream. I must find out exactly where she has gone, for I have long been offering my remembrances. But if she indeed refuses to acknowledge me—if not even one dream occurs—then I shall cease to pine for her.”

Having made up his mind, Baoyù declares, “I’ll sleep outdoors tonight; you need not trouble yourselves about me.” Baochai, not wishing to press him, says, “There’s no need for wild thoughts. Didn’t you see how Madame worried when you went off to the garden? You must take care of yourself—if Grandmother hears, she’ll say we are not devoted enough.”

Baoyù responds, “I’ll be in and out in a while.”

Later that night, after Baochai pretends to sleep, Baoyù calls Xiren and also summons Meiyue to prepare another set of blankets. He frequently sends someone to check whether Second Madam (Baochai) has fallen asleep. Baochai herself feigns sleep and, restless throughout the night, plays her part. Baoyù, believing Baochai to be sound asleep, tells Xiren, “You all go sleep; I won’t be sorrowful. If you don’t believe me, you may serve me until I fall asleep—provided I’m not disturbed.”

Xiren obliges and stays with him, setting down some tea and carefully closing the door before retiring to watch over him in feigned slumber. Believing that Xiren has left, Baoyù quietly arranges for two maids to stand guard outside his room. He then sits up for a while, offering silent thanks and, after a short time, drifts off. At first he lies awake a little; but once his mind quiets he surprisingly finds himself sleeping soundly through the night.

When morning finally comes, he awakens, wipes his eyes, and reflects that he has had no dream at all. Sighing, he murmurs, “It is truly as they say: ‘Years pass in parting of life and death, yet my soul has not visited me in a dream!’”

At that very moment, Baochai—who, unlike Baoyù, did not sleep a wink—hears him recite these lines and teases, “You speak too rashly. Had Miss Daiyu still been with us, she surely would have been indignant.” Baoyù, suddenly self-conscious, rises and shuffles into the inner room, offering a weak explanation, “I meant to come in earlier but somehow dozed off.”

Baochai chides, “Whether you come in or not is of no concern to me!”

Xiren, who never truly slept, hears their exchange and hurries in to bring more tea. At that moment, a little maid from Grandmother’s side enters asking, “Is Second Madam’s sleep peaceful? If she is well, then she should soon have time to wash and come.” Xiren replies, “Tell her, ‘Baoyù slept very soundly last night and will join you shortly.’” The maid departs.

Baochai quickly freshens herself, and along with Ying’er and Xiren, she goes first to Grandmother’s side to pay respects. They then visit Madame Wang’s and Feng Xifeng’s quarters. Later they return to Grandmother’s room where they find her already present. Everyone inquires, “Was Baoyù well last night?” Baochai dismisses, “He simply went to sleep and nothing more.” Relieved, the assembled group exchanges some idle chatter.

Soon a little maid enters with news: “Second Aunt is about to leave. I’ve heard that someone from Master Sun’s household came by and spoke to the eldest mistress; she then sent word to Fourth Sister not to detain Second Aunt any longer—now Second Aunt is weeping with the eldest mistress and will shortly come to bid farewell to Grandmother.”

The family, upon hearing this, feels uneasy and murmurs, “How unfortunate that such a gentle soul must suffer so! One can scarcely understand why fate has burdened her so that she will never rise in life!”

Just then, Yingchun appears with tear-stained cheeks. Because it is a day of supposed celebration for Baochai, she forces back her tears and announces that she must return. Grandmother, knowing her hardships, does not insist on her staying, saying, “You may go, but do not be disheartened. Such people are inevitable; in a few days I shall send someone to fetch you again.”

Yingchun replies sorrowfully, “Grandmother has always cared for me, but now I fear I shall never be able to return.” Tears stream down her face as everyone tries to console her. They remark, “What is there to stop you from returning? It is far more difficult for your third sister, who lives far away, to meet; your case is nothing compared to that.”

Grandmother and the others, recalling the fate of Tan Chun, cannot help but weep. Yet, for Baochai’s birthday, Grandmother, switching from grief to cheer, exclaims, “That need not be so! Provided that the distant lands remain at peace, if our in-laws can be transferred to the capital, we shall see them again.” Everyone agrees. With a heavy heart, Yingchun takes her leave, and the group disperses, returning to Grandmother’s quarters.

From dawn until dusk the household is in tumult. Finally, the family gathers again around Grandmother. Meanwhile, Aunt Xue departs to Baochai’s quarters, saying, “Your elder brother is delayed until the imperial amnesty arrives and his sentence is reduced; these past years have left me lonely—perhaps I should help arrange your second brother’s marriage. What do you think?”

Baochai replies, “Mother, you’re worried because our eldest brother’s marriage caused such shock that even your mind has been troubled about our second brother’s affair. I believe it is time to arrange it. Miss Xing, as you know, is in deep hardship here. Marrying her off—although we are poor—would be far better than clinging to another’s household.”

Aunt Xue adds, “When the time is right, go and inform the venerable Grandmother that our family has no one at home and that a wedding date must be set.”

Baochai says, “Mother, simply discuss a proper date with our second brother and then tell Grandmother and the eldest mistress. Once the match is set, all will be well.”

Aunt Xue concurs, “I hear even that Miss Shi has just returned; perhaps Grandmother wishes for your sister to remain a few days longer. I suspect she won’t be staying for long anyway. You sisters may spend a few more days in close company.”

Baochai nods, “Indeed.” After a while, Aunt Xue takes her leave, and the others also depart.

That evening, Baoyù returns to his room, his mind troubled. He thinks, “Why did I not dream of Daiyu last night? Perhaps it is because she has ascended and no longer visits a commoner like me; or maybe it is my own impatient nature.” He resolves to ask her in spirit someday, and continues to reminisce about his ritual offerings to her. If she truly ignores me in dreams, then I shall cease longing for her.”

Later that night, Baoyù, still preoccupied with these thoughts, ventures out as Baochai pretends to sleep. Meanwhile, Xiren and the moonlit Meiyue are sent to arrange extra bedding outside; Baochai feigns sleep. Believing Baochai to be asleep, Baoyù quietly converses with Xiren: “You all can sleep; I shall not be disturbed. If you do not believe me, you may serve me until I fall asleep—so long as I am not awakened.”

Xiren faithfully obliges, preparing tea and ensuring the door is closed before retiring. Baoyù, thinking himself secure, arranges for two maids to stand guard outside. He then sits quietly and prays silently before drifting off. In the beginning he struggles to sleep, but soon finds his mind calm, and before he knows it, he sleeps soundly through the entire night.

At dawn, Baoyù awakens, wipes his eyes, and reflects over his night. “Not one dream came to me,” he sighs, “just as the saying goes: ‘Though life and death may part us for endless years, my soul has not visited me in a single dream.’”

At that moment, Baochai—who, unlike him, had not slept at all—hears his recitation and teasingly remarks, “You speak so rashly! Had Miss Lin been alive, she surely would have been angered.” Baoyù feels embarrassed and, rising, shuffles into the inner room, explaining in a halting tone, “I meant to come in; somehow I dozed off for a moment.”

Baochai retorts lightly, “Whether you come in or not is of no concern to me.”

Xiren, still awake, hurries in with tea. At that moment, a little maid arrives from Grandmother’s side asking, “Did Second Master sleep well last night? If so, he should be up and ready soon.” Xiren answers, “Go tell Grandmother that Baoyù slept very soundly and will join shortly.” The maid departs.

Soon, Baochai, having quickly washed and dressed, along with Ying’er and Xiren, goes first to Grandmother’s side to pay her respects. They then proceed to Madame Wang’s and Feng Xifeng’s quarters. Finally, they return to Grandmother’s room where Grandmother herself is present. All ask, “Was Baoyù well last night?” Baochai says, “He simply went to sleep without incident.” The group is relieved and exchanges some idle chatter.

Not long after, a little maid enters with news, “Second Aunt is about to leave. I heard that someone from Master Sun’s household went to the eldest mistress and said a few things—she then sent word to Fourth Sister that there’s no need to detain her; now Second Aunt is weeping at the eldest mistress’s side and will soon come to bid farewell to Grandmother.”

Upon hearing this, the assembled family feels deeply uneasy. “How unfortunate,” they murmur, “that a gentle soul like her must endure such treatment! How can one live a life destined never to rise?”

At that moment, Yingchun appears, her face streaked with tears. Because it is a day meant for celebration in honor of Baochai’s birthday, she must, with tears in her eyes, bid the group farewell. Grandmother, understanding her plight, does not insist on her staying and says, “You may go, but do not grieve. With people like these, there is nothing we can do. In a few days, I will send someone to fetch you again.”

Yingchun replies, “Grandmother has always cared for me, yet now I fear I shall never return.” Tears continue to stream down her cheeks. Others try to console her, saying, “There is nothing preventing you from coming back; it is far more difficult for your third sister, who lives far away, to meet than it is for you.”

Recalling Tan Chun, everyone is moved to tears. And because it is Baochai’s birthday, Grandmother, shifting from sorrow to joy, proclaims, “That is not difficult at all! Provided the distant lands remain at peace, our in-laws shall soon be transferred to the capital, and we shall see them again.” Everyone concurs. With that, Yingchun, heavy with sorrow, bids farewell. The group departs and then reconvenes at Grandmother’s. From morning until evening the household is abuzz; yet, when Grandmother sees how weary everyone has become, she quietly disperses them.

Later that evening, Aunt Xue, having taken her leave from Grandmother, goes to Baochai’s quarters and says, “Your elder brother will not be released until the Emperor’s great amnesty is declared and his sentence reduced. These past years have left me so lonely—what am I to do? I intend to see to your second brother’s marriage. What do you say?”

Baochai replies, “Mother, you worry because our eldest brother’s wedding frightened you, and now you question our second brother’s prospects. I believe it is high time it be arranged. Miss Xing, as you well know, is in dire straits here. Marrying her off, though we are poor, is far better than clinging to another’s household.”

Aunt Xue says, “When the time is right, go and tell the venerable Grandmother that our family has no one at home and that a wedding date must be fixed.”

Baochai adds, “Mother, simply discuss a proper date with our second brother, and then inform Grandmother and the eldest mistress. Once it is set, all will be well.”

Aunt Xue replies, “Today I heard that Miss Shi has just returned; perhaps Grandmother wishes for your sister to stay a few days longer. I suspect she won’t be staying long anyway. You sisters may spend a few extra days in close company.”

Baochai agrees, “Indeed.” Soon Aunt Xue sits with them a while before bidding everyone farewell and departing.

That evening, Baoyù—lost in sorrow—returns to his room and laments, “Why did I not dream of Daiyu last night? Perhaps it is because she has ascended to immortality and does not wish to meet a wretched soul like mine; or maybe it is simply that my own nature is too restless.”

He then hatches a plan and tells Baochai, “Last night I happened to sleep outdoors and found it far more refreshing than indoors. I feel clearer this morning, and I intend to sleep outside for two more nights. I only fear that you may come and stop me.”

Baochai, knowing full well that his morning verses would naturally refer to Daiyu, thinks that his foolish nature cannot be reformed and resolves that it is best for him to sleep out; that way, he might finally give up his longing. “Very well,” she says, “sleep on as you please. I won’t bar you; just do not let your thoughts run wild and summon those mischievous demons.”

Baoyù laughs, “Who would think so?”

Xiren interjects, “I advise you, Second Master, to sleep indoors. Outside, no one can keep watch, and you might catch a chill.”

Before Baoyù can answer, Baochai gives Xiren a knowing look. Xiren, understanding, says, “Very well, I’ll have someone accompany you so that you may have tea and water if needed throughout the night.”

Baoyù smiles and replies, “In that case, you shall come with me.”

Xiren blushes and, unable to find a proper reply, remains silent. Baochai, well aware of Xiren’s steadiness, adds, “He is accustomed to following me; let him do so. Let Meiyue and Wuer help to attend him. Besides, you have been with me all day and must be tired.”

Baoyù can only laugh and eventually comes out. Later, Baochai orders Meiyue and Wuer to prepare his bedding outside, instructing them, “Stay alert. Leave some tea and water at hand.” They agree. Stepping out, they see Baoyù sitting upright on his bed, eyes closed, hands clasped, resembling a meditating monk. Neither dares disturb him, and they watch him with gentle smiles. Baochai then calls Xiren to come back and assist him.

Xiren, seeing this scene, laughs softly and says, “It’s time to sleep. Why are you still sitting?”

Baoyù opens his eyes upon seeing Xiren and replies, “You all just sleep; I shall sit a while longer and then sleep.”

Xiren chides, “After that commotion last night—when Second Madam barely slept—if you continue thus, what will become of you?”

Knowing that he would not sleep if he persisted, Baoyù finally settles down. Xiren gives further instructions to Meiyue and the others before leaving and closing the door for the night. Meiyue and Wuer then tidy the bedding and keep watch until Baoyù falls asleep.

Yet Baoyù finds that the more he tries to sleep the less he can. Watching the two maids diligently at their posts, he suddenly recalls a past night when, in Xiren’s absence, Qingwen and Meiyue served him. That night, Meiyue had gone out while Qingwen—unclothed and chilled—fell ill and eventually died from that fever. Thinking of Qingwen, his thoughts shift entirely to her; then he remembers Feng Xifeng’s remark that Wuer had “borrowed a shadow” of Qingwen. Pretending to be asleep, he secretly watches Wuer; the more he looks, the more Wuer seems to resemble Qingwen. Lost in reverie, he grows dazed. After a while he calls out softly a couple of times, but receives no reply.

Wuer, startled by Baoyù’s calls, asks in a timid tone, “Second Master, what do you need?”

Baoyù says, “I’d like to rinse my mouth.”

Noticing that Meiyue is sound asleep, Wuer gets up, hurries to prepare a cup of tea, and brings a basin for rinsing. In his haste, dressed only in a peach-red short jacket with its sleeves loosely rolled, Wuer appears to Baoyù like the long-lost Qingwen come back to life. Suddenly, Baoyù recalls Qingwen’s words: “Had I known I’d bear a false reputation, I would have made proper plans,” and stares blankly, not even accepting the tea.

Since the departure of the fragrant officer, Wuer has not been in the mood to come in. Later, when Feng Xifeng summons him to serve Baoyù, he finds himself more anxious than Baoyù himself to be of use. Yet once inside, seeing the dignified presence of Baochai and Xiren, he feels deep admiration; and noticing that Baoyù now appears more foolish than before, and hearing that Madame Wang has driven away all the female attendants who used to tease Baoyù with tender affections, he is treated as if he were the very embodiment of Qingwen. Wuer, already flushed with shame, timidly says, “Second Master, please rinse your mouth.”

Baoyù takes the tea with a smile, oblivious as to whether he rinses or not, and then inquires in a teasing tone, “Aren’t you and Qingwen sister quite close?”

Wuer, puzzled, answers, “We are all sisters—there’s nothing improper about that.”

Baoyù, lowering his voice, asks, “Did you hear what she said about Qingwen falling gravely ill? I believe you were there too, weren’t you?”

Wuer shakes his head and replies, “No, I heard nothing.”

Overcome with absentmindedness, Baoyù grabs Wuer’s hand; Wuer, alarmed and blushing, whispers, “Second Master, if there is something you wish to say, please speak plainly—don’t pull and tug like that.”

Baoyù then releases his grip and says, “She once told me, ‘Had I known I’d bear a false reputation, I would have taken proper action,’” teasing him. Wuer, realizing the jest is clearly aimed at him, can only mumble, “That is something only one of us girls would say!”

At that moment, Wuer, uncertain whether to continue or stand aside, hesitates. Casting a furtive glance, she smiles mischievously and murmurs, “Stop with your prattle. Listen—what do you think they mean when they hear our talk? No wonder they say you spend all your efforts on the maidens. Put aside Second Madam and Xiren, who are as ethereal as celestial beings, and always mingle with others. If you continue like this tomorrow, I fear I shall have to return to Second Madam’s side—what will your face be then?”

Just then, a sudden “thud” from outside startles them both. Inside, Baochai coughs once; Baoyù quickly purses his lips, and Wuer hastily extinguishes the lamp and lies down. It turns out that because Baochai and Xiren had not slept last night and were exhausted from the day’s labors, they had not heard their conversation. In the silent courtyard, an unexpected noise wakes them, but no further commotion follows. Baoyù lies in bed, wondering, “Could it be that Miss Lin has returned, intentionally scaring us by overhearing our words?” Tossing and turning in his muddled thoughts, he does not fall asleep until well past the dawn.

Meanwhile, Wuer—tormented by Baoyù’s late-night antics and disturbed by Baochai’s cough—finds herself agitated and sleepless all night. The next morning, rising early, she notices that Baoyù is still in a daze and quietly tidies the room. Meiyue, already awake, asks, “Why did you get up so early? Did you not sleep at all?”

Wuer, feeling that Meiyue might have understood the situation, can only offer a sheepish smile and remains silent. Soon Baochai and Xiren also awaken and open the door. They are surprised to see that Baoyù has, after two nights sleeping outside, slept so soundly. When Baoyù finally wakes, he sees everyone already up and quickly climbs out of bed. Rubbing his eyes and reflecting that he had no dreams last night, he muses that perhaps the “path between mortals and immortals” has grown too distant. Slowly, he descends from the bed, and remembering Wuer’s earlier comment that “Baochai and Xiren are like celestial maidens,” he stares at Baochai in a dazed manner.

Baochai, noticing his vacant look—and knowing his heart is heavy with thoughts of Daiyu—asks gently, “Did you encounter a celestial being in your sleep last night?”

Baoyù, embarrassed that Baochai has heard his earlier words, smiles wryly and says, “What do you mean by that?”

Wuer, meanwhile, tries to recall, “Did you hear Second Master speaking in his sleep?”

Baoyù, unable to contain himself, excuses himself and steps away. Wuer’s face turns bright red as she mumbles, “I heard a few words in the early part of the night—I didn’t catch much. Something about ‘bearing a false name’ and ‘not acting properly’—I tried to urge Second Master to sleep, and then I too fell asleep. I can’t say whether he said anything more.”

Baochai ponders for a moment, realizing that his words were clearly about Daiyu. Yet, fearing that letting him remain outdoors might corrupt his heart and summon spectral mischief (not to mention triggering old ailments), she discreetly goes to his room and calls Xiren to gently ask him how his time in the garden was.

How will Xiren reply?

(To be continued in the next chapter.)

Later that evening…

Baochai has arranged a celebration for the birthday of our beloved Baoyù. That day, the garden—once part of the Grand View Garden now sealed by the authorities—had long been left empty. With few inhabitants remaining and no one using the spacious grounds, the authorities had punished Bao Yong by ordering him to guard the neglected garden. Meanwhile, as Jia Zheng struggles to manage the household per Grandmother’s orders, the family headcount is steadily reduced; even with frugality, the resources barely suffice. Fortuitously, Feng Xifeng, dearly loved by Grandmother, remains to handle the inner affairs—even though Madame Wang and others are less fond of her, they acknowledge her efficiency. Yet ever since the confiscations, funds have been so limited that every expense is painfully tight. The servants—once accustomed to ample provisions—now receive barely a third of what they used to, and grumblings abound. Feng Xifeng, however, dares not refuse her duties before Grandmother and labors on despite her failing health. In time, Jia She and Jia Zhen, now in their official posts, have enough allowance to be temporarily at ease; when they write home, they say life is comfortable, so that Grandmother’s heart is eased and Lady Xing and Lady You, too, find a small measure of relief.

One day, Shi Xiangyun—recently returned from her wedding journey—comes to pay respects to Grandmother. Grandmother recalls fondly her son-in-law, and Xiangyun speaks of peace in her family home, urging Grandmother not to worry. Yet when the conversation turns to the passing of Daiyu, tears fall from all. Grandmother then recalls Yingchun’s hardships, and sorrow deepens. Xiangyun consoles her and, after greeting others, returns to Grandmother’s room to rest. In conversation she mentions the fate of the Xue family: “They say Brother Xue’s outburst has ruined his household. Although this year the penalties have been lightened, who knows if next year the sentence might be reduced further?”

Grandmother replies, “You do not yet know everything. Just yesterday, Pan’er’s wife died in a most confusing manner—nearly causing an uproar. Fortunately, the Lord of the Buddha saw to it that the maid brought out the case herself, so that Madam Xia could no longer stir trouble; and your Aunt’s household managed to settle matters by verifying the evidence, sending off those cases of ‘skin and flesh.’ Now, we simply must live on with what little we have.”

Xiangyun asks, “Did your third sister ever send word?”

Grandmother sighs, “Ever since she married, your third sister has been well out at sea; though she has not written, I think of her day and night. Our family has suffered so many misfortunes that I barely have time to care. And now the fourth sister has not even been properly betrothed. And what of Huan? Who has the time to remember him? Life here is even harsher now than when you all lived under one roof. And poor Baoyù – since his marriage, not a day of peace passes; and your second brother remains as erratic as ever—what are we to do?”

Xiangyun adds, “I have grown up here and know the temperaments of our folk well. This time, when I returned, I found that everyone seemed changed. I expected them to greet me as warmly as before, but instead, their words turned sorrowful, and I soon came straight to Grandmother’s room.”

Grandmother replies, “These days are dire for me, yet I long to see a day of merriment—a day when all will be lively—but alas, I lack the spirit.”

Xiangyun suddenly brightens, “Isn’t it tomorrow his birthday? I shall stay one more day and arrange a proper celebration for him—so that everyone may enjoy a day of joy. How does that sound, Grandmother?”

Grandmother exclaims, “Goodness! I nearly forgot—tomorrow is indeed his birthday! I will have money set aside tomorrow to throw him a proper birthday celebration. In his younger days he had several such feasts before he was betrothed; now, after his marriage, none have been held. That clever Baoyù, though once so lively, seems diminished by these family troubles. Only Pearl’s wife fares better. Sometimes he is cheerful, sometimes not; living quietly with Lan’er—it is truly hard for him.”

Xiangyun continues, “Others remain unchanged, but even Second Sister-in-law has altered her looks and no longer speaks as lively as before. Tomorrow, I’ll tease them a little and see what happens. But if they only murmur under their breath, they might later accuse me of having changed…”

At these words, Xiangyun’s face flushes scarlet. Grandmother, understanding, says, “What does it matter? In the old days, all the sisters lived together in mirth and laughter without a care. One must be able to endure both prosperity and poverty. Our dear Baoyù was born generous; in good times he was never conceited, and when misfortune struck he accepted it gracefully. Now, even though he is well treated here, if only for a day he is joyful, then that is enough for me. I believe he is truly blessed. And as for our Lin sister, being so young and sensitive, she never lives long; and Feng, having seen too much hardship, should not change at the first sign of trouble. Tomorrow, I will set aside extra silver to throw a lively birthday party for him—one day of merriment to please him.”

Xiangyun agrees, “Grandmother speaks truly. Let us invite all the sisters so that we might all gather in celebration.”

Grandmother replies, “Of course we shall invite them.” In high spirits, she calls Yuanyang to fetch one hundred taels of silver and instructs, “Starting tomorrow, prepare enough food and wine for two days.” Yuanyang accepts, and the money is dispatched; that night passes quietly.

The next day, messages are sent out. Yingchun is summoned, and invitations are extended to Aunt Xue, Baoqin, and even Xianghang; soon Aunt Li and the Li sisters arrive. Baochai, unaware of the plan until her maid calls, remarks, “Aunt Xue is here—she’s inviting Second Madam.” Pleased, Baochai dresses and goes to see her mother. There she meets her younger sister Baoqin and Xianghang, and also Aunt Li and the others. Thinking, “They must know that our troubles are over and have come to offer their greetings,” she exchanges pleasantries.

Xiangyun, standing by, says, “Ladies, please sit down; let us, as sisters, offer our respects to our dear sister on her birthday.” Baochai is momentarily taken aback, then realizes, “Isn’t it my birthday tomorrow?” She hastily adds, “But if we celebrate my birthday, that wouldn’t be proper!” As the ladies gently defer to one another, Baoyù himself comes to greet Aunt Xue and Aunt Li. Hearing Baochai dismiss the idea of celebrating her birthday, he internally resolves that perhaps Grandmother should celebrate his birthday instead.

Xiangyun teases, “How embarrassing! Must Grandmother really wait for you to remind her? Look around—why have all these people come? It is Grandmother who summoned them.” Baochai, unconvinced, listens as Grandmother says to her own mother, “Poor little Baoyù—having been a new son-in-law for a year now, and with our household in constant strife, he has never had a proper birthday celebration. Today I shall arrange one for him. Please, Aunt Xue and all the mistresses, let us talk and laugh.” Aunt Xue remarks, “Our circumstances are not so dire; yet the young master has never shown proper filial respect, and now our Grandmother must bear the burden.” Xiangyun adds, “Grandmother loves her second elder the most—surely she must care for Baochai as well? Moreover, dear sister Baochai deserves a celebration from Grandmother.” Baochai lowers her head in silence.

Baoyù, in his heart, muses, “I always thought that once Xiangyun married she would change completely—this is why I dared not get too close, and now she seems so shy that she cannot speak her mind!” Overcome with sorrow, he bursts into tears, exclaiming, “Lin, dear Lin! It is all my fault! Do not blame me; it was not I who betrayed you but our parents’ design!” His anguish grows, and soon he weeps bitterly.

At that moment, Xiangyun’s attendant, Qiuwen, arrives with a few others and admonishes, “How dare you come here with Second Master! Why are you in this place? The mistresses have sent word far and wide that you and Second Master have arrived, frightening them so much that they summoned me. Hurry back; there is no time to linger!”

Still sobbing, Baoyù is reluctantly led away. Xiren then escorts him back to Grandmother’s room, where the assembled family awaits. Grandmother calls out, “Xiren! I have always trusted you with Baoyù—why did you take him to the garden tonight? His health is fragile; if he encounters any mishap out there, it would only bring more sorrow. You must not let him wander.” Xiren, too timid to argue, bows her head in silence.

Baochai, alarmed by Baoyù’s pallor, is greatly troubled. Yet Baoyù insists, “What is there to fear? I merely missed visiting the garden for a while, and tonight, in a little wine, I took a stroll. What harm could come of it?”

Feng Xifeng, who has suffered greatly in the garden before, shudders at his words, “My dear brother, you are too bold!” Xiangyun remarks, “It is not boldness but a sincere heart. I wonder if he is off in search of the Hibiscus Goddess or some immortal.” Baoyù remains silent, while Madame Wang watches anxiously.

Grandmother asks, “Did you see anything alarming in the garden?”

Xiangyun replies, “No, nothing at all.”

Grandmother says, “Then no matter. In future outings, you must take several companions with you. It was not you who stirred trouble; everyone had long dispersed. Now, go and have a proper rest. Tomorrow morning, come back and let me see that everyone is cheerful for a day—so that no more mishaps occur.”

Hearing this, the assembled group takes their leave. Aunt Xue goes to stay with the earth steward, while Shi Xiangyun remains with Grandmother, and Yingchun heads off to see Xi Chun. The others return to their homes without further word. Only Baoyù lingers, dejected and sighing. Baochai, aware of his state, pays him little heed. Still, worried that his sorrow might rekindle old ailments, she withdraws him into a private room and calls Xiren to gently ask how his time in the garden was.

How will Xiren answer?

(Continuation to be revealed in the next chapter.)

—

Later that evening, Baoyù and Baochai arise together. Baoyù washes and then first visits Grandmother. In her fondness for him and appreciation for Baochai’s filial devotion, Grandmother suddenly remembers an heirloom. She orders Yuanyang to open a chest and produce a piece of Han jade—a treasure not as magnificent as Baoyù’s own prized stone, yet rare in its own right.

Yuanyang presents the jade to Grandmother, saying, “I don’t recall having seen this piece before. You once said that it was kept in a small box, and following your instructions I have retrieved it. For what purpose do you wish it now?”

Grandmother replies, “Do you not know? This jade was given to me by my grandfather when I was about to be married. He said, ‘This jade was worn in the Han dynasty—it is very precious. Keep it close as though you were with me.’ I was young then and simply stowed it away in the box. Now, seeing that our family has lost so much, I wish to present it to you, as a token of the blessing our ancestors bestowed upon me.”

At that moment, Baoyù is ushered forward, and Grandmother hands him the jade. Baoyù inspects it—it measures three inches square, resembling a small sweet melon with a delicate reddish hue and exquisite craftsmanship. He exclaims his admiration. Grandmother says, “Do you cherish it? This was given to me by my grandfather. I now pass it on to you.”

Baoyù, smiling, offers his respectful thanks and then takes it to show his mother. Grandmother remarks, “Let your wife see it too, and tell your father that they say a son is loved no more than a grandson. They have never seen such a treasure.” Baoyù smiles and departs. Baochai and the others exchange a few more words before taking their leave.

From that time, for two days Grandmother overindulges and eats too much; by the next day she feels a heavy, oppressive fullness in her chest. When Yuanyang and the others come to report to Jia Zheng, Grandmother, without further comment, says, “I have overindulged these past days—I shall fast for one meal to feel better. Please, let us cease this clamor.” And so Yuanyang keeps the matter secret.

That evening, Baoyù returns to his own room and finds that Baochai has just come back from Grandmother and Madame Wang’s. Thinking of the morning, he feels a tinge of shame and guilt. Baochai, aware of his state, knows it is a discomfited scene. Believing that his infatuation might be the root of his ailment and that the only remedy is to cure it with tender affection, Baochai hesitantly asks, “Will you sleep outside again tonight?”

Baoyù, feeling self-conscious, replies, “Inside or outside—it matters not.”

Baochai, wanting to speak further but finding it difficult, is interrupted by Xiren, “Nonsense! I don’t believe you can sleep that soundly.”

Wuer quickly chimes in, “Second Master may sleep outdoors; after all, he is fond of talking in his sleep, leaving us all perplexed—but no one dares contradict him.”

Xiren continues, “I shall move my bed to the inner room so we can watch his sleep talk.”

Baochai, hearing this, remains silent. Embarrassed, Baoyù, wishing to assuage Baochai, shifts indoors.

Baochai, fearing that his beloved might be troubled by melancholy, summons Xiren to learn of his experience in the garden.

(How Xiren will respond will be told in the next chapter.)

A few days later, Grandmother—who had been unwell—begins to feel increasingly heavy-hearted. Many female relatives come to offer their respects. One day, while the family is assembled, an old maid from the garden returns saying, “The venerable Master of the Luocui An in the garden has learned of Grandmother’s illness and has come to send his regards.”

The family urges, “He seldom visits; please invite him in at once!” Feng Xifeng goes to meet him. Xiuyan, an old acquaintance of Miaoyu, goes out to fetch him. Soon Miaoyu, wearing his customary cap and a simple white silk jacket with a water-green trimmed vest, with autumn-hued silk sashes and a white belt-painted skirt, holding a tasselled prayer bead, and followed by a servant, drifts gracefully into view. Xiuyan greets him warmly, “When you were staying in the garden, you might have visited often; but since the garden has few visitors these days—with the gate often locked—we hardly ever see you. Today, what a pleasure!”

Miaoyu replies, “You see, even though you all enjoy lively gatherings, I find it improper to come too often. Now that I hear the news here is grim and that Grandmother is unwell—and yet you still long to see Baochai—what can I do? If I choose not to come, you may insist that I do; but if I come, you cannot stop me.”

Xiuyan laughs, “You remain the same as always.”

After exchanging polite words, Miaoyu enters Grandmother’s room. Everyone greets him warmly. Miaoyu comes to Grandmother’s bedside and offers a few conventional pleasantries. Grandmother remarks, “You are like a goddess of compassion—look at how my illness has not entirely overcome me?”

Miaoyu answers, “Dear Grandmother, a woman as kind as you is destined for long life. It is merely a chill and a few doses of medicine will see you well soon. For someone of your years, a little care is all that is needed.”

Grandmother replies, “It is not the illness that troubles me—it is that my heart longs for joy. I feel as though my chest is heavy and constricted. Just now, the doctor said that my trouble is due to pent-up emotions. You know well that no one would dare give me cause to be angry! My doctor’s diagnosis was as ordinary as could be. I told Jia Lian that the first doctor said it was due to overindulgence in food and drink—and tomorrow I shall call him again.”

She then calls for Yuanyang: “Tell the kitchen to prepare a table of plain vegetarian fare for a light meal for me and Miaoyu.”

Miaoyu protests, “I have already had lunch; I do not require any more.”

Madame Wang interjects, “If you do not eat, that is fine. Let us sit a while and talk.”

Miaoyu says, “I have not seen you all for so long; today I have come simply to see you.” After a brief exchange, he prepares to leave. On his way out, he sees Xiangyun standing and inquires, “Why do you look so thin, Fourth Sister? Do not let your heart be troubled with constant painting and worries.”

Xiuchun replies, “I have not painted for a long while. Now that the house is no longer as resplendent as the garden, I have lost my inspiration.”

Miaoyu asks, “Which house are you living in now?”

Xiuchun says, “It is the one on the east side of the gate you just passed; it is very near if you wish to visit.”

Miaoyu responds, “I shall come when I am in a happy mood.”

After exchanging farewells, Miaoyu departs. Soon after, word comes that the doctor is with Grandmother, so everyone slowly disperses.

Meanwhile, Grandmother’s condition worsens day by day. Her physicians’ treatments seem ineffective, and soon she develops diarrhea. Jia Zheng grows anxious at her incurable state and instructs someone to notify the authorities. Day and night, Madame Wang herself assists with preparing the medicinal decoctions. One day, when Grandmother is able to eat a little and her spirit seems slightly lifted, an old maid peers in at the door. Madame Wang sends Caiyun to see who it is. Caiyun discovers it is one of the women who accompanied Yingchun to the Sun household and asks, “What do you want?”

The old maid replies, “I have been here for a while and cannot find any of the sisters. I dare not barge in, for I am anxious.”

Caiyun asks, “Why are you anxious? Is it that the master has once again mistreated the young ladies?”

The old maid says, “The young lady is unwell; just the other day there was a great commotion, and she wept all night. Yesterday her phlegm was so blocked—and they did not call a doctor—today it seems even worse.”

Caiyun replies, “Grandmother is ill; do not make such a fuss.”

Inside, Madame Wang has already heard the commotion and fears that Grandmother might overhear and be further distressed. She quickly orders Caiyun to send the old maid away. But Grandmother, hearing the noise, remarks, “Is little Ying about to die?”

Madame Wang hastily replies, “No, no. The maid is unaware of her place; she said that for the past couple of days, some have been ill and she came to ask the doctor.”

Grandmother says, “See how good my doctor is—hurry, bring him in!”

Madame Wang then instructs Caiyun, “Send that maid back to the eldest mistress.”

The old maid departs. Grandmother sinks deeper into sorrow, lamenting, “My three granddaughters—one has enjoyed all the blessings and passed away; the other two married far away and never see each other; and little Ying, though she suffers, may barely endure. What is the use of a person of my age living on?”

Madame Wang, Yuanyang, and the others try to console her for a long time. At that moment, Baochai’s attendant is sent in with a message from the garden: “They say that Second Aunt has passed away.”

Lady Xing, upon hearing this, breaks into tears. With her father absent, they call on Jia Lian to go and check. Learning that Grandmother is gravely ill, no one dares to leave. Alas, a beauty once like a blossom has, through the rough treatment by the Sun household, perished. And with Grandmother near death, the family hastily wraps things up with the Sun household.

Grandmother’s condition worsens by the day; she thinks only of her granddaughters. In her sorrow she sends someone to inquire after Xiangyun. The messenger later discreetly finds Yuanyang and, unable to approach Grandmother’s side because Madame Wang and the others are present, goes to the rear and finds Huopa, telling him, “Grandmother wishes to know after Miss Shi—she said that her tears were dreadful. She heard that our uncle has contracted a violent illness; the doctors say that this illness may be incurable, and if it turns into a form of tuberculosis, he may live only four or five more years. Thus Miss Shi is very anxious. And I understand Grandmother is too ill to come herself. Please, devise some way to answer Grandmother if she asks.”

Huopa, after a moment of silence, says, “You go ahead.” Not willing to speak openly, he decides to lie to Grandmother. He approaches Grandmother’s bedside, where the atmosphere has turned grim; the room is filled with hushed voices whispering, “This is not good…” No one dares speak. Jia Zheng quietly calls Jia Lian to his side and whispers a few words. Jia Lian nods and departs, then gathers everyone present and orders, “Once Grandmother recovers, split up and arrange the household matters immediately. First, have someone come and inspect the ledgers to determine what is due. Measure everyone’s clothing, and once accounted for, instruct the tailors to sew appropriate mourning garments. The overseers and the kitchen staff must also be reassigned.”

Lai Da and the others reply, “Second Master, do not worry—we have long planned these things. But where is the silver to settle these accounts?”

Jia Lian replies, “The silver that Grandmother set aside long ago remains right here. The master’s idea was that if we handle these matters well, even the outside world will look kindly upon us.”

Lai Da agrees and dispatches people to handle the tasks.

Jia Lian then returns to his room and asks Ping’er, “How is Grandmother today?”

Ping’er presses her lips together and says, “Just look and see.”

Jia Lian goes inside and finds Feng Xifeng about to dress, her movements sluggish as she leans against the table. Jia Lian says, “Aren’t you afraid you won’t be able to keep her well? Grandmother’s matters will soon come to light—if trouble arises, can we even come back?”

Feng Xifeng replies, “What is there to tidy up? It is only these few belongings—what is there to fear? You go first; see what the master instructs. I shall change and then come.”

Jia Lian hurries back to Grandmother’s room and quietly informs Jia Zheng, “All matters have been assigned.”

Jia Zheng nods. Soon a report comes: “The imperial physician has arrived.”

Jia Lian escorts the doctor in; after examining Grandmother, the doctor quietly tells Jia Lian, “Her pulse is weak. We must be cautious.”

Jia Lian nods and informs Madame Wang and the others. Madame Wang quickly signals Yuanyang to bring out Grandmother’s garments and bedding. Yuanyang hurries off to make preparations.

Grandmother opens her eyes and asks for tea. Lady Xing enters with a cup of ginseng soup. As Grandmother takes a sip, she exclaims, “Not that—I want a full cup of tea!” The attendants, fearful of defying her, quickly bring one. After a hearty sip, she drinks again and then says, “I want to sit up.”

Jia Zheng and the others protest, “Grandmother, if you need anything, just speak—it is best that you remain lying down.”

Grandmother replies, “I’ve had some water, and my heart feels lighter; now I shall sit a bit and chat with you.”

Zhenzhu and the others gently help her to sit. Seeing that Grandmother’s spirits have somewhat lifted, her family’s fate hangs in a delicate balance.

What her future holds—life or death—will be revealed in the next chapter.
Chapter 110
Lord Shi’s Life Ends and He Returns to the Netherworld; Wang Xifeng’s Overbearing Ways Lose Her the Affection of Others

Grandmother Jia, sitting up in bed, began, “I have lived in this household for more than sixty years—from my youth to my old age I have enjoyed every blessing. Ever since your father’s time, my sons and grandsons have all been satisfactory. And even dear Baoyù—I have doted on him…” As she reached the part about Baoyù, her eyes roamed over the room. At that moment, Madame Wang gently guided Baoyù forward to the bed. Grandmother Jia extended her hand from beneath the covers and took hold of Baoyù’s hand, saying, “My son, you must live up to your promise!”

Baoyù, answering softly with his lips but feeling a sting in his heart, fought back tears; he dared not cry aloud and stood silently instead. Grandmother Jia continued, “I long to see a great-grandson before I am at peace. And what of my Lan’er?” At once, Li Wan helped push young Jia Lan forward. Grandmother Jia, releasing Baoyù’s hand, then took hold of Jia Lan’s and said, “Your mother is a model of filial piety. When you grow up, you must make your mother proud. And what of Feng—my dear Feng?”

Wang Xifeng, who had been standing near Grandmother Jia, hurried forward and said, “I am here, madam.”

Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “My son, you are exceedingly clever—one day your merits will be enough to restore our family’s fortunes. I have not amassed much, though my heart has suffered many losses. I never much bothered with those rituals of fasting and reciting sutras; only in former years did I have some copies of the Diamond Sutra made and distribute them as gifts—tell me, have they all been given away?”

Wang Xifeng replied, “Not yet, madam.”

Grandmother Jia sighed, “They should have been all dispersed long ago. Our eldest brother and Jia Zhen are out enjoying themselves; what is most detestable is that Miss Shi, lacking any heart, never comes to see me!”

Yuanyang and the others—who understood the true reasons behind these words—remained silent.

Grandmother Jia then cast a glance at Baochai and sighed; her face flushed red. Recognizing that she was in her final moments, Jia Zheng hurried in with a bowl of medicinal soup. Grandmother Jia’s jaw had clenched tight; after closing her eyes for a moment, she then opened them wide to look around the room one last time. Madame Wang and Baochai approached gently to help her dress, while Lady Xing and Wang Xifeng quickly assisted as well. The old maids had already arranged the bed and spread fresh bedding. Hearing a slight sound from Grandmother Jia’s throat, a smile appeared on her face—and then she passed away. She was eighty‐three years old. In a flurry, the maids quickly finished making the bed.

Thus, Jia Zheng and others knelt outside in mourning while Lady Xing and the rest knelt inside. At once, all the household servants prepared to observe the mourning rituals: from the main gate of the Rong Mansion to the inner courtyard, large white mourning banners were hung; a mourning pavilion was erected, and the ancestral tablet was promptly set up at the gate. In an instant, everyone donned mourning clothes. Jia Zheng reported the death, and the Ministry of Rites was informed. The Emperor, in His deep benevolence and remembering the generations of merits—and considering that the late Grandmother was the mother of the former Empress—granted a reward of one thousand taels of silver and instructed the Ministry to conduct a memorial service. Family members reported the death throughout the branches. Though many relatives knew that the Jia family’s fortunes were in decline, the magnificent imperial favor stirred them, and they all came to pay their respects. At an auspicious time the body was properly prepared, and the wake was observed.

Jia She was not at home; with Jia Zheng as the eldest surviving son, and with young Baoyù and Jia Lan being his only grandsons, they were to keep vigil. Although Jia Lian was also a grandson—accompanied by Jia Rong—household affairs were divided among the remaining relatives. Some distant kin were invited to assist; inside, only Lady Xing, Madame Wang, Li Wan, Wang Xifeng, and Baochai gathered to weep by the body. Lady You, though she could help, had already left with Jia Zhen and stayed at the Rong Mansion and thus did not come forward; similarly, Jia Rong’s wife, and the young Xi Chun (who despite growing up in the household knew little of its affairs) did not appear. In truth, none in the inner circle could manage the matters except Wang Xifeng; and since Jia Lian was away handling external affairs, the two of them would have to manage as best they could.

Wang Xifeng had once relied on her own abilities and had calculated that with Grandmother’s passing, she would play a significant role. Lady Xing and Madame Wang recalled that she had previously handled the affairs of the Qin clan successfully—and so they still appointed Wang Xifeng to manage the inner matters. Although Wang Xifeng did not feel inclined to refuse, she naturally accepted. In her heart she thought, “These matters have always been under my supervision, and the other servants are my subordinates. The eldest mistress and Jia Zhen’s wife were always difficult to manage, but now they are gone. Even though the silver ornaments remain, that kind of silver is readily available. And matters outside can be handled by those appointed there. Although my health is poor now, it should not prevent things from proceeding as they did at Ning Mansion.” With her mind made up, she resolved to receive the official directives tomorrow and then, early the next morning, to assign tasks. She called for the household register from Zhou Rui’s office to review the names. Wang Xifeng counted one by one: among the male servants there were only twenty-one, and among the female servants only nineteen; the rest were merely maids, and even including those in various quarters, there were barely over thirty—hardly enough to assign tasks. She thought, “Now Grandmother’s affairs are fewer than those in the Eastern Mansion.” She then gathered a few of the estate’s workers, but even they proved insufficient.

While she was pondering this, a small maid hurried in and said, “Yuanyang says that Second Madam has come to see Grandmother.” Wang Xifeng went over. There she found Yuanyang in tears—crying so bitterly that she looked as if she were a weeping statue—and she grabbed Wang Xifeng’s arm and said, “Second Madam, please sit down; let me kowtow to you. Though it is improper for one in service to offer such a kowtow, this head must be bowed.” Yuanyang knelt and, in her distress, hurriedly repeated her words. Wang Xifeng tried to help her up and asked, “What is this all about? If there is something to say, speak properly.”

Yuanyang, still kneeling, said, “Regarding Grandmother’s affairs—both within and outside—the matters have always been handled by Second Master and Second Madam. The silver in question is what Grandmother left behind. Throughout her life Grandmother never squandered her silver; now, facing this great matter, it is only proper that Second Madam manage it in a dignified manner. I heard our master uttering phrases like ‘as the poem says’ and ‘Confucius once said’—which I do not understand; and also something about ‘mourning being easier than letting go’—which I do not comprehend at all. I asked Second Madam, who said it was our master’s intention that Grandmother’s funeral be conducted with true mourning rather than a lavish display. I feel that a lady like Grandmother should be treated with dignity in death. I am but a humble maid, yet I believe that since I have served Grandmother faithfully, even in her final moments she should not be deprived of honor. I am here, for I belong to Grandmother’s household; if I cannot witness Grandmother’s affairs, then how shall I ever see her again?”

Wang Xifeng, struck by the earnestness of Yuanyang’s words, said, “Do not worry—everything shall be handled with dignity. Even if our master once counseled frugality, such orders cannot be taken lightly. Let all this silver be spent on Grandmother’s affairs; it is only fitting.”

Yuanyang continued, “Grandmother’s dying wish was that all that remains be given to us. If Second Madam’s resources prove insufficient, please use the surplus silver to convert into funds. Even if our master says otherwise, we must not violate Grandmother’s last wishes. After all, Grandmother’s assignments were heard directly by our master, were they not?”

Wang Xifeng asked, “You have always been the most perceptive—why are you suddenly so anxious?”

Yuanyang replied, “It is not my anxiety but that our eldest mistress does not manage things properly; our master fears ostentation. If Second Madam’s heart aligns solely with our master’s wishes, and if we insist on a lavish funeral for those whose estates were confiscated, then Grandmother’s honor might be compromised—what then?”

Wang Xifeng said, “I know. Do not worry; follow our family’s old ways.” She then called for the household servant from the Wang household to summon Second Master inside. Before long, Jia Lian entered and said, “What is it you require of me? You need only take care of the internal matters. In any event, our master and the mistresses have decreed that whatever we decide, we shall abide by it.”

Wang Xifeng said, “You are now mentioning these things—doesn’t it seem that Yuanyang’s words have come true?”

Jia Lian asked, “What did Yuanyang say?”

Wang Xifeng then recounted Yuanyang’s earnest plea. Jia Lian replied, “What are those words but mere words? Just now, Second Master called me and said, ‘Grandmother’s matters must be handled with care. Those who know, know that Grandmother wished to manage her own affairs quietly—if we publicize them, it is as if she is doing it all herself. The silver set aside for Grandmother is not meant for lavish spending; it is meant to be used for her final rites. Grandmother is in the South—though she has a burial plot, she has no proper ancestral shrine. Her spirit is destined for the South. Retain this silver and use it to construct some edifices over her ancestral grave; with what remains, purchase a few acres for the sacrificial fields. Whether we return or not, let our impoverished kinsfolk have a place to offer incense day and night according to the proper rites.’ Do you see? These words are hardly frivolous, are they? And according to your account, has any silver been spent?”

Wang Xifeng asked, “Has the silver been released?”

Jia Lian replied, “Who has seen any silver? I heard our mistress urging both Second Madam and Second Master, saying ‘This is an excellent idea.’ What can I do? Outside, in the pavilion, they demand several hundred taels—but none have been released. I must go; they say there is silver, but then they send our servants off claiming illness or going to the estate. The only ones remaining are those who can still earn money—what hope is there for those who lose money?”

Wang Xifeng, stunned, said, “What is to be done then?”

At that moment a little maid came in and announced, “The eldest mistress has sent word that, on this third day, the affairs inside are still in disarray. Though they have prepared food, our relatives have been kept waiting. They have been served dishes, yet the meal portion is short—what manner of business is this?”

Wang Xifeng hurriedly went inside, calling out for help to see to the situation. They managed, in a haphazard fashion, to serve a meager breakfast. However, that day many people arrived, and everyone inside wore faces of shock and dismay. Wang Xifeng had no choice but to see to the guests for a while before hastily sending them away with instructions to distribute the household women among the tasks. All agreed reluctantly.

Wang Xifeng then cried out, “When will they serve the meal?”

They replied, “Serving the meal is easy enough—once we distribute the household’s belongings, we can manage.”

Wang Xifeng exclaimed, “Foolish ones! Even if you are assigned, there must be enough.”

The group replied only in hesitant assent. Then Wang Xifeng went upstairs to fetch the necessary items to consult with Lady Xing and Madame Wang. When she saw that there were so many people—and it was already late in the day—she turned to Yuanyang and said, “Tell me, what portion of Grandmother’s assets is left?”

Yuanyang said, “Did Second Master manage to redeem them when he was in charge?”

Wang Xifeng said, “Not the expensive silver or gold—but only what is needed for ordinary use.”

Yuanyang replied, “Are you asking where the eldest mistress and Miss Zhen’s household obtains theirs?”

Wang Xifeng, after a moment’s thought, turned and left, only to find her way to Madame Wang’s quarters where she gathered some jade hairpins and Caiyun; finally she managed to secure a small portion and hurriedly had Cai Ming record it, so that it could be distributed among those in charge.

Observing Wang Xifeng’s anxious flurry—and unwilling to call her back—Yuanyang thought, “How swiftly she once managed affairs; now she is so hindered. I suspect that for the next two or three days she will have no head to think, and Grandmother’s favor will be wasted on her!”

Unbeknownst to them, Lady Xing, upon hearing Jia Zheng’s words and recalling the impending hardships of the household finances, wished to reserve a little as a final reserve. Moreover, Grandmother’s matters had traditionally been managed by the eldest branch. Although Jia She was absent and Jia Zheng was a stickler for rules, when he spoke he said, “Please consult with the eldest mistress,”

and Lady Xing, who knew well Wang Xifeng’s ambitious nature and Jia Lian’s capricious ways, was determined not to let her off easily. Yuanyang remarked that the silver had already been disbursed, and when she saw Wang Xifeng so hindered, she suspected it was due to her reluctance to spend. Then Lady Xing said, “Feng, you indeed have not been diligent.”

Madame Wang, later that evening, summoned Wang Xifeng and said, “Although our household is not wealthy, appearances must be maintained. In these past few days with so many visitors, I fear you have not given proper orders—now you must shoulder some responsibility.”

Wang Xifeng, stunned, wanted to retort about the silver being short, but since the silver outside was under another’s control—and Madame Wang’s words were about being unable to attend to matters—Wang Xifeng dared not dispute and remained silent.

Lady Xing added, “In truth, this is our burden as wives—it is not really the concern of our granddaughters. But we cannot affect matters ourselves, so we rely on you. You simply cannot let go.”

Wang Xifeng’s face flushed purple as she prepared to speak when suddenly the sounds of drums and gongs from outside signaled the time for burning “yellow dusk paper.” Everyone raised their mourning together and could say nothing further. Wang Xifeng had intended to speak again later, but Madame Wang urged her to go out and attend to tomorrow’s affairs, saying, “We are here—now hurry and see to tomorrow’s preparations.”

Unable to say more, Wang Xifeng, with tears in her eyes, left sorrowfully. She then sent word among the family, instructing them further, “Oh, dear ladies, pity me! I have endured much criticism from above—all for fear that you might be mocked—and tomorrow you must exert yourselves fully!”

They replied, “When Grandmother is in charge, how could we dare disobey? But these matters from above are so burdensome. We only manage to see to today’s meal; some dine here, others at home; we have invited this mistress and that matron—but not all have come. In such a case, how can everything be complete? We pray that Grandmother will counsel the maidens to pick their battles sparingly.”

Wang Xifeng said, “The first obstacle is that the maids of Grandmother’s household are hard to handle, and those of the mistresses are equally unyielding—whom shall I send?”

They replied, “In the old days when Grandmother served in the Eastern Mansion, she was strict enough to command respect; who would dare defy her? Now, the maidens cannot even hold their own.”

Wang Xifeng sighed, “As for the affairs of the Eastern Mansion—though we entrusted them to others and though the mistresses were present—they are now our own matters, and everyone speaks about them. Moreover, the silver outside cannot be used either; even if the pavilion requires an item, once it is sent out, it is never returned—what recourse do I have?”

They replied, “Is it not that the silver for Grandmother is not held by Second Master?”

Wang Xifeng said, “Ask the managers, and you shall know.”

They murmured, “No wonder the men outside grumble, ‘For such a grand affair, we can find nothing but hardship, and it is all for naught!’ How can we ever unite our efforts?”

Wang Xifeng said, “Let us not speak further. For now, everyone, stay vigilant. If those above begin to dictate, I will not abide it.”

They replied, “Grandmother’s wishes—what can we do but obey? We are all but one-minded in following orders from above.”

Wang Xifeng, with no answer, pleaded, “Oh, dear ladies, tomorrow please help me for one day. Once I have made the arrangements clear for the maidens, we shall speak further.”

They all departed in obedience.

Wang Xifeng was seething with grievances and anger that grew as the day wore on; when morning came she had to go up again. She needed to organize the various people but feared angering Lady Xing; she attempted to speak with Madame Wang, yet Lady Xing egged her on. The maidens, seeing that Lady Xing and the others did not support Wang Xifeng’s authority, further denigrated her. Only Ping’er came to defend Wang Xifeng, saying, “Second Madam truly wishes well—if only our mistresses did not give orders from outside so as to waste resources, then Second Madam could manage everything.” After several such interludes, calm was eventually restored. Although rites and memorials, with continuous offerings and processions, were held, the silver was so stingy that no one was enthusiastic—everything was done in haste. For days, imperial decrees arrived concerning the status of the family; Wang Xifeng could not personally attend but had to coordinate behind the scenes. People were sent one way, then another; after one urgent round, more orders were given—and then things were dispatched together. Not only did Yuanyang and the other maidens appear shabby, but even Wang Xifeng herself felt her conscience pricked.

Lady Xing, though technically the matron, relied on the maxim “sorrow in grief is filial”—yet she herself did nothing. Madame Wang simply followed Lady Xing’s lead, and the rest need not be mentioned. Only Li Wan, noticing Wang Xifeng’s suffering, dared not speak up for her and instead murmured, “As the saying goes, ‘Although the peony is beautiful, it is supported by the green leaves.’ Our mistresses have not failed Wang Xifeng—but who will support her now? If our third sister still resided at home it would be different; now only her few retainers are left to manage matters, and both those at the front and back complain that not a single coin remains or even a scrap of dignity. Our master devotes himself solely to filial piety but knows little of practical household management. With such a major matter at hand, couldn’t a few coins be spared? Alas, Wang Xifeng has struggled for years—yet in Grandmother’s affairs, she is in danger of losing face.”

Thus, Li Wan summoned her own staff and instructed them, “Do not let those people’s appearances bring shame—don’t let them come and disgrace Second Madam’s legacy. Consider that in our family, even if someone wears mourning clothes, it is not considered a great matter; simply get through a few days. When you see that our people cannot manage, lend a hand; that too is a public duty, and everyone must pitch in.”

Some of the servants, dressed in their plain clothes, agreed, “Our mistress speaks truly—we dare not disobey. We heard Yuanyang and the others remark that it seems Second Madam is not doing her job.

Li Wan said, “I already told them that Second Madam is not negligent in Grandmother’s matters—only that the funds are not in her hands, leaving her with naught but a poor porridge to serve. Now that Yuanyang is aware, she does not blame him. But Yuanyang’s look is not what it once was; that too is strange. In the old days when Grandmother adored him, he never showed any airs; now that Grandmother is gone and no one supports him, I fear he has lost his bearing. I had fretted on his behalf earlier—thank goodness our master was away, or he might have come to no good; otherwise, what chance would there be for Brother Lan?”

As she spoke, Jia Lan entered and said, “Mother, please rest. With people coming and going all day, it has become tiresome—at least let me have a book or two to read, so that I might not forget by the time the mourning is over.”

Li Wan said, “Good child, reading is well—but for today, let us rest. Once Grandmother’s funeral is arranged, then you may read in peace.”

Jia Lan replied, “If mother must rest, then I shall remain in bed and think over a few things.”

The others praised him, “Good lad! How is it that at his age he always turns to books? Unlike Baoyù, who, even after marriage, still remains so childlike. In these days, following our master’s orders, he seems discontent and longs for our master to come quickly looking for Second Madam—he even babbles incoherently and then seeks out Miss Qin. Miss Qin, however, avoids him; and Fourth Sister does not speak with him much. It seems that among our kin, only our joyous Fourth Sister remains close to him. We suspect that aside from cavorting with the grandmistresses, Baoyù has nothing else on his mind—wasting our master’s heart while we neglect Brother Lan entirely. Our master will eventually have no cause for worry.”

Li Wan said, “He is still young. But I fear that when he grows older, our household will not know what to do.”

“What do you think, Huan’er?” someone asked.

Everyone replied, “He looks like a little monkey with his wide, darting eyes, constantly glancing around. Even when he is mourning, once he sees the grandmistresses, he sneaks glances from behind the mourning veil.”

Li Wan remarked, “He is not so young now. I heard just the other day that he was to be betrothed again—but now we must wait. Ah, one more thing—our household, I dare say, is difficult to explain; let us not indulge in idle chatter. What of the vehicles for the funeral procession tomorrow?”

They replied, “Second Madam has lately been in such a state of despair that nothing has been arranged. Yesterday we heard the men outside saying that Second Master had sent Second Young Master Qiang to manage the matter—apparently our family vehicles are insufficient and even the number of drivers is few, so that we must borrow them from our relatives.”

Li Wan laughed, “Vehicles are borrowed?”

They replied, “Mother is jesting—how can vehicles not be borrowed? It is just that on that day all our relatives need vehicles, and it may be difficult; perhaps we must hire them.”

Li Wan sighed, “The lower-class ones must be hired, but what of the free carriages from above?”

They replied, “Now the eldest mistress, as well as the grandmistresses in the Eastern Mansion, have no vehicles—if they are not hired, where will they come from?”

Li Wan, listening, sighed and said, “I recall that our mistresses once arrived in hired vehicles, and we laughed at them; now it is our turn. Go and tell your men that our carriages are to be prepared early, so that we may avoid the crush.”

Everyone agreed and dispersed without further comment.

Meanwhile, Shi Xiangyun—because her husband was ill and due to Grandmother’s death—had come only once, counting that she must attend the funeral the day after; and upon seeing that her husband’s illness had become one of tuberculosis, she could only grieve through the night. She wept bitterly for half the night. Yuanyang and the others tried repeatedly to console her. Baoyù, observing all this and overwhelmed with sorrow, longed to offer his words but dared not approach. He saw that she was dressed in plain clothes—without the usual makeup, even more so than before marriage. Then he looked at Baoqin and the others, who too wore simple attire with refined grace. Only when he saw Baochai, dressed in mourning, did he note a certain elegance, more refined than when she wore bright colors. In his heart he thought, “The ancients said: ‘Though all colors flourish, ultimately the plum blossom reigns supreme.’ It appears that not only does the plum blossom bloom early, but those words ‘pure and fragrant’ are truly unattainable. Yet if Miss Daiyu were here at such a time, adorned in such finery, what a vision she would be!” At this thought his heart grew achingly sad, and tears streamed down his cheeks. Seizing the moment of Grandmother’s affairs, he broke down in loud weeping. The others tried to console Xiangyun, but soon another mourner emerged from outside. Everyone assumed it was the deep sorrow for Grandmother that moved them—and indeed each shed their own tears. This grand outpouring of grief caused everyone in the room to weep uncontrollably. It was only Aunt Xue, Aunt Li, and others who managed to restrain themselves.

The next day, on the appointed night of the wake, the atmosphere grew even more tumultuous. Wang Xifeng that day found herself unable to hold on any longer—exhausted and hoarse from endless crying, she barely managed to get through half the day. As the afternoon wore on and more relatives and friends arrived, matters became even more chaotic, and one could neither look ahead nor behind. In the midst of the haste, a little maid ran in saying, “Second Madam is here! No wonder the eldest mistress said, ‘There are so many people inside that no one can be properly attended to—Second Madam has been forced to suffer in seclusion!’”

Hearing these words, Wang Xifeng suddenly burst into a fit—she staggered, her throat tightening, and soon tears streamed down her face. In an instant her vision darkened and a sweet taste filled her throat; she began spitting forth bright red blood and could no longer stand, collapsing to the ground. Fortunately, Ping’er rushed over to support her. Soon, blood gushed continuously from Wang Xifeng’s mouth.

What will be her fate?
Chapter 111
The Maiden Yuanyang Sacrifices Herself for Her Master and Ascends to the Realm of Ultimate Void;
While the Swine–Like Lackey and Thieving Scoundrels, in Their Insolence, Invite Disaster

Meanwhile, upon hearing the maid’s words, Wang Xifeng—already overcome by anger, distress, and sorrow—coughs up a mouthful of blood and suddenly lapses into unconsciousness, collapsing onto the floor. Ping’er rushes over to support her and immediately calls for help. Soon, attendants gently carry Wang Xifeng into a private room. There, Ping’er carefully places her on the kang (heated bed) and quickly sends for a cup of hot water, which Little Hong brings to her lips. Wang Xifeng sips the water but remains unresponsive in a deep sleep.

Soon, Qiu Tong comes by to take a brief look; then she departs, and Ping’er does not even beckon her further. Nearby, Feng was standing when Ping’er says, “Hurry and go back to report to the two mistresses!” Feng then returns and conveys, in tearful tones, that Wang Xifeng had vomited blood and was now unable to be properly attended to. Lady Xing and Madame Wang exchange troubled glances. Lady Xing, examining Wang Xifeng’s evasive behavior, finds herself not entirely convinced but, with the other female relatives present, she only murmurs, “Let her rest for now,” and no further words are exchanged.

That very night, while relatives and friends continue their endless visits amid mourning, several of the household staff—accustomed to a once-comfortable life—now slacken in their vigilance. In the ensuing chaos the household is thrown into disarray, and nothing seems to work properly.

A few days later, after distant guests have departed, preparations begin for the funeral rites. The female attendants of the mourning chamber weep for a while. Among them, Yuanyang has cried herself into near collapse; those present hold her gently as she is roused, murmuring that “Grandmother suffered terribly and now has gone to join her.” Most of the mourners, overcome by grief, speak little; and when it comes time to prepare the coffin, over a hundred people attend—but Yuanyang is nowhere to be found. In the hectic confusion no one remembers to check on her. Later, when Huopa and the others come to offer their respects, they find that Yuanyang has apparently exhausted herself from crying and has withdrawn to a secluded spot, silent and unmoving.

After the funeral, outside, Jia Zheng calls on Jia Lian to discuss the logistics of the funeral procession. They plan to assign someone to guard the house. Jia Lian explains, “In the upper quarters the master has sent Yun’er to look after things; in the lower quarters, Lin Zhixiao’s family has been tasked with dismantling the temporary pavilions and such. But I’m not sure who will guard the inner chambers.” Jia Zheng remarks, “I heard your mother said that your wife is too ill to go out—so she shall remain at home. And your eldest sister-in-law also mentioned that your wife is gravely unwell; she even requested that Fourth Sister accompany her and lead a few maidservants to oversee the upper rooms.” Hearing this, Jia Lian thinks, “Our eldest sister-in-law and Fourth Sister never see eye to eye; they now argue over who should stay. But even if the upper part is looked after by them, it would still be insufficient. And if one of our own is ill, how can we manage?” After a moment’s thought, he returns to Jia Zheng and says, “Master, let us pause for a while and deliberate further before making any decisions.” Jia Zheng nods, and Jia Lian goes inside.

At this moment, Yuanyang—alone and overwhelmed by grief—begins to cry anew. In her heart she laments, “I have served Grandmother all my life, yet I have never secured a proper place for myself. Now that our eldest master is away and the eldest mistress behaves in such a manner, I feel deeply dejected. Our master is one who cares little for affairs, and in a time of chaos he will surely ‘rule a chaotic world’ soon enough. Won’t we be left to bear the brunt of their mismanagement? Who among us is to be entrusted with the household? I cannot stand this torment any longer—it would be better if I were dead and free of all this misery. But what manner of death is to befall me?”

Lost in these thoughts, Yuanyang stealthily makes her way into Grandmother’s inner chamber. No sooner does she step across the threshold than she sees the room dimly lit; in a corner a woman holds a damp cloth to her face, appearing as if on the point of hanging herself. Yuanyang is not frightened; rather, her heart resonates with the same desolation. “Who are you?” she asks softly. “We share the same sorrow—we might as well die together.” But the woman gives no answer. Yuanyang steps closer and, upon careful observation, realizes that this is not one of the chamber maids. As she studies the figure, a chill seems to seep into her bones; in the blink of an eye, the apparition vanishes. Stunned, Yuanyang retreats to the edge of the bed and sits down, pondering, “Ah! Of course—it is the late Second Mistress of the Eastern Mansion, Little Rong, isn’t it? She died long ago—so how has she come here? It must be to summon me… Has she come to show me the method of death?”

As this thought takes hold, a perverse, unsettling resolve infects Yuanyang’s very marrow. She rises, tears streaming, and hurriedly opens her personal jewelry box. She retrieves a single lock of hair—one she had cut off long ago—and clutches it to her bosom. Then she undresses a strip from her sweatband, and, recalling the spot where Qin’s family once compared such tokens, she fastens it around her throat. After shedding another bout of tears, she hears that the guests outside have nearly departed; fearing someone might enter, she quickly bolts the door. Then she fetches a footstool, positions herself, and stands upon it. With trembling resolve, she uses the footstool to propel herself, fastening the sweatband tightly around her throat. In that final moment, as her throat grows constricted and her spirit begins to depart, she collapses—her fragrant soul seemingly released into the void.

Just then, a faint figure appears before her: Qin’s figure, visible in silhouette. Yuanyang’s disembodied spirit rushes toward the vision, exclaiming, “Grand Mistress Rong, wait for me!”

The figure replies in a calm tone, “I am not Grand Mistress Rong; I am Keqing of the Illusory Palace.”

Yuanyang retorts, “But you unmistakably resemble Grand Mistress Rong—how can you say otherwise?”

Keqing explains, “There is a reason for that, which I shall now tell you so that you may understand. In the Illusory Palace I once held the post of chief attendant, overseeing the matters of passion and the debts of love. Upon my descent into the mortal world, I was destined to be the foremost lover, drawing in impassioned maidens to join the Department of Affections. In time, I was to be suspended from life by my own hand. Yet, having seen through the vanities of the mortal realm and transcended the sea of attachments, I ascended to the realm of true emotion—so much so that the ‘Department of Foolish Passion’ in the Realm of Ultimate Void was left without a master. Now, the Fairy of Illusion has chosen you to replace me and to govern this department.”

Yuanyang’s disembodied voice murmurs, “But I, who am utterly devoid of feeling, how can I be considered capable of love?”

Keqing replies, “You have yet to understand. People mistake lust for genuine ‘emotion’ and thus commit all manner of debauched acts—claiming that such frivolity is true affection, though it is not. Know this: before one’s feelings are expressed, they are merely one’s ‘nature’—once emotions are unleashed, they become what they are. And the emotion between you and me is precisely that which remains unexpressed, like a bud on a flower. Should it be allowed to blossom fully, it would no longer be pure love.”

Hearing these words, Yuanyang nods slowly in understanding. With that, she follows Keqing out.

Meanwhile, outside, after Huopa has finished the funeral rites, Jia Zheng calls on Jia Lian to review the arrangements for guarding the house. They search for Yuanyang but cannot find her; some suspect she has exhausted herself by crying, so she may have taken refuge elsewhere and remains silent.

After the funeral, Jia Zheng summons Jia Lian to discuss the departure arrangements. They agree to assign a few family members to keep watch. Jia Lian reports, “In the upper quarters, Yun’er has been assigned to watch over things; in the lower quarters, Lin Zhixiao’s household will handle dismantling the temporary structures. But I am uncertain who will remain to guard the inner chambers.”

Jia Zheng says, “I heard that your mother mentioned your wife is too ill to leave; let her remain. And your eldest sister-in-law also said your wife is gravely unwell—so much so that she requested Fourth Sister accompany her, along with several maidservants, to oversee the upper rooms.”

Jia Lian, troubled, thinks, “My eldest sister-in-law and Fourth Sister are at odds again; if they do not go together, even if one manages the upper part, it will not be sufficient. And if one of our own is sick, who can manage?” After a pause, he tells Jia Zheng, “Master, let us pause and deliberate further before making any final decisions.” Jia Zheng nods, and Jia Lian retires inside.

At that moment, news of Yuanyang’s distress spreads among the household. Some among the lower servants begin to murmur about her—complaining that, having served Grandmother all her life, she has never secured a stable position; now, with the eldest master away and the eldest mistress’s conduct unworthy, she fears that our master will soon “rule in chaos” and that we shall all be left to suffer. Unable to bear such torment, Yuanyang’s sorrow swells until she decides to take her own life.

In a fit of despair, Yuanyang quietly slips into Grandmother’s private suite. As she enters, she sees the dim light and notices a lone woman clutching a damp handkerchief—a figure who appears on the verge of hanging herself. Yuanyang, rather than being frightened, feels a kinship with this figure—recognizing that their sorrows mirror each other. “Who are you?” she asks softly. “We share the same heart; if we must die, let us die together.”

The mysterious woman remains silent. Yuanyang moves closer, only to find that she is not one of the maids of this room. As she studies the figure, a chill seems to invade her very being; and in an instant the apparition vanishes. Stunned, Yuanyang steps back and sits on the edge of the bed, pondering, “Ah, it is as I suspected—this is the departed Second Mistress of the Eastern Mansion, Little Rong! She died long ago—so why has she come here? It must be to summon me. Perhaps she is here to teach me the proper way to die.”

As this thought takes hold, a perverse determination takes root in Yuanyang. Her despair turns to a dark resolve. She rises, weeping bitterly as she retrieves from her old jewelry box a lock of hair she had cut in years past and clutches it to her bosom. Then she undresses a strip from her sweatband and, recalling the spot where Qin’s kin once compared similar tokens, she fastens it firmly around her throat. After another burst of tears, she hears that the guests outside are nearly gone; fearing someone might come in, she hastily bolts the door. Then, grabbing a small footstool, she positions herself upon it, adjusts the sweatband, and uses the stool to hurl herself forward. In that final, desperate act, her throat is constricted until she draws her last breath, her fragrant soul departing this mortal coil.

At that moment, a faint figure appears before her. In a spectral voice, the figure calls, “Grand Mistress Rong, wait for me!”

The apparition replies calmly, “I am not Grand Mistress Rong; I am Keqing of the Illusory Palace.”

Yuanyang retorts, “But you are unmistakably Grand Mistress Rong—how can you claim otherwise?”

Keqing explains, “There is a reason for this discrepancy, one I shall now share so that you may understand. In the Illusory Palace I once held a position as the chief of affairs concerning passion and its debts. Upon descending into the mortal realm, I was destined to become the primary lover—drawing in countless infatuated maidens to the Department of Affections. I was fated, in time, to hang myself in atonement. But having seen through the vanity of mortal attachments and transcended the sea of feelings, I have now returned to the realm of true emotion. In fact, the ‘Department of Foolish Passion’ in the Realm of Ultimate Void now lies without a master. The Fairy of Illusion has chosen you to replace me and to oversee this domain. Therefore, it was by her command that I come to lead you.”

Yuanyang, her spirit trembling, asks, “Then how can I, a soul so devoid of feeling, be considered one capable of true love?”

Keqing replies, “You have yet to understand. Mortals mistake mere lust for genuine love, engaging in debauchery and then priding themselves on their ‘passion’—yet in truth, when feelings are unexpressed they remain but one’s nature; once emotions are released, they become love. The bond between you and I is that of unexpressed emotion, like a bud about to bloom. If it were to burst forth, it would cease to be pure.”

Hearing these words, Yuanyang nods slowly in understanding, and with a final tearful glance, she follows Keqing away.

Meanwhile, as the funeral rites conclude, Jia Zheng calls on Jia Lian to settle the details of the post-funeral arrangements and to assign someone to guard the house. Jia Lian searches for Yuanyang but finds no trace of her. He even peers through the door and, seeing only faint, flickering light, he wonders aloud, “Where on earth has that maid gone?” He inquires of Zhenzhu, “Have you seen Sister Yuanyang?”

Zhenzhu replies, “I looked for her too—our mistresses are waiting for her words. Perhaps she has fallen asleep in the private suite?”

Jia Lian says, “I have looked through every door; I see nothing. The lights remain unlit, and no one stirs. Let us all go inside and check for ourselves.”

Jia Lian and several attendants enter; as they peer in through the crack of the door, they catch sight of vague figures and shifting shadows. Fear grips them, and one of them exclaims, “Oh dear, what has happened?” In his shock, he stumbles and falls backward onto Jia Lian.

Jia Lian, alarmed, shouts, “Quick, who is this? Have you seen Sister Yuanyang?”

Zhenzhu responds, “I have searched for her—she must be asleep, for our mistresses have been conversing. I suppose she lies in the suite.”

Jia Lian says, “I must go and find her,” and gathers a few others to search. They make their way toward the suite, only to find that the door is closed. Suddenly, the group hears the sound of a heavy knock at the door. One stout attendant—a burly man holding a wooden staff—forces the door open. The assembled servants are startled and cry out, “Don’t run! Come with me!”

Among the gathered family, one sharp-eyed servant recognizes the man as none other than Bao Yong, the very one who had once been recommended by the Zhen family. Stirred by newfound courage, the servants murmur, “One has escaped; others are in the upper rooms.” Bao Yong dives down and climbs up to the upper floor, chasing after the intruders. The robbers, aware that no one else is in the Jia household, first peer into the room of Xiuchun. There they spy a breathtakingly beautiful nun and their lewd thoughts are aroused. Noting that the upper floors are filled entirely with women—and out of fear—they intend to kick down the door. But hearing voices of pursuit from outside, the band of thieves retreats upstairs. Finding few defenders, they try to resist, but suddenly see a man arriving, and, realizing that he is alone, they become even more unruly and engage in melee with short weapons. The guards from outside, emboldened by their courage, rush in. When the thieves find themselves outnumbered and unable to fight back, they flee, scurrying over the garden wall. Bao Yong continues his pursuit upstairs; however, unknown to him, several fellow conspirators have already hidden inside to collect the stolen items. When the robbers return, the defenders, brandishing weapons, confront them. Realizing that only one man remains in pursuit—and that the odds are no longer in their favor—the thieves turn and charge. In a burst of anger, Bao Yong shouts, “You wretched scoundrels—dare you challenge me?!” The thieves retort, “One of our comrades has been knocked down; let us simply seize him!” At that moment Bao Yong swings his staff powerfully, striking a thief and sending him crashing to the ground. The remaining band, seeing that the fight is hopeless, scatter and flee over the garden wall. Bao Yong chases after them; but as he runs, he trips over a box and stops short. Glancing around and finding that nothing appears missing and that the robbers have fled, he orders that the lights be lit so everyone may search. In the dim interior only a few empty boxes remain for gathering. He then attempts to return upstairs but, unfamiliar with the route, finds himself near Feng Xifeng’s quarters and asks, “Have any robbers come in here?” A trembling Ping’er replies, “There’s no one here—the door is shut. I heard someone upstairs mention robbers; please, go elsewhere.” Bao Yong, unsure of the path, spots some of the night-watchmen coming and follows them until he reaches the upper floor. There, upon opening the door, he finds the attendants weeping in the room.

Soon after, Jia Yun and Lin Zhixiao arrive. Realizing that a theft has occurred, everyone is in a state of panic. They quickly inspect the rooms. Grandmother’s door stands open wide, and when the lights are turned on, the locks are found broken. Peering inside, they see that the chests and cabinets have been ransacked. Angered, they scold the night-watch women, “Are you all dead? Did you not know that robbers had come in?” The night-watchmen, weeping, explain, “Our shifts rotate—we cover the second and third watches. We never remain in one place. We only heard the robbers’ shouts during the later watches; by the time we reached them, no one was in sight. We hurried to secure the premises but can’t say when the items disappeared. Please, our master, inquire with the officers in charge of the later watches.”

Lin Zhixiao retorts, “You all are doomed! Let’s return and check elsewhere first.” The night-watchmen are led to Lady You’s quarters, where the door is locked. Some murmur, “It’s terrifying!” Lin Zhixiao asks, “Were anything stolen here?” The occupants open the door and reply, “Nothing is missing.” Lin Zhixiao, accompanied by his men, then proceeds to Xiuchun’s courtyard. There, they hear voices: “Oh my, the poor lady has been frightened to death—please, wake up!” Lin Zhixiao orders someone to open the door and inquire. An old maid opens it and explains, “Robbers battled here and frightened the lady badly. Thankfully, Master Miaoyu and Caiyun managed to rouse her. Nothing appears to be missing.” Lin Zhixiao asks, “How did the robbers fight?” One of the night-watchmen replies, “Fortunately, Lord Bao ascended to the upper floor and drove the robbers away—we even heard that one was knocked down.”

Lord Bao Yong then declares, “These riffraff dare challenge me?!” One of the thieves retorts, “One of our men has been downed—let us seize him!”

At this, Bao Yong and his companions engage fiercely. After a short but brutal scuffle, the robbers, outnumbered, flee. Bao Yong pursues them but is then tripped by a box. Realizing that nothing appears to be missing and that the robbers have fled far away, he orders his men to secure the area. In the end, a few empty boxes remain, which someone is ordered to gather. Bao Yong, intent on returning upstairs, finds himself disoriented near Feng Xifeng’s quarters. He asks, “Have any robbers been here?” A trembling Ping’er replies, “No—only that we heard men outside shouting. Please, go elsewhere.” Unable to find his way, Bao Yong eventually joins a group ascending the upper floor. There, the attendants are mourning loudly.

Shortly thereafter, Jia Yun and Lin Zhixiao enter; hearing that a theft has occurred, everyone grows anxious. They search the inner chambers. It is discovered that Grandmother’s door was left wide open, and when the lights are on, the locks are broken. As they look around, the chests and cabinets are found open and ransacked. Accusing the night-watch women, they shout, “Do you not know that robbers came in?” The night-watchmen, in tears, explain that they were covering the later watches and did not see anyone. Lin Zhixiao orders, “You all are hopeless! Let us check around the premises.” The men are then led to Lady You’s quarters where, after opening the door, they exclaim that nothing appears to be missing. Lin Zhixiao then proceeds to Xiuchun’s courtyard, where voices are heard: “It’s terrible! The poor lady has been frightened out of her wits. Wake up!” Lin Zhixiao orders the door opened, and an old maid reports, “The robbers clashed here and nearly frightened the lady. Fortunately, Master Miaoyu and Caiyun rescued her. Nothing has been stolen.”

Lin Zhixiao asks, “How did the robbers fight?” A night-watchman replies, “Thank goodness Lord Bao was there on the upper floor and drove them off; we even heard that one man was knocked down.” Lord Bao declares in anger, “These petty thieves dare to contend with me!” The band of robbers retorts, “One of our men has been knocked down—let’s simply seize him.” Hearing this, Lord Bao shouts, “If these insignificant brutes dare challenge me, then let them come!” Suddenly, the night-watchmen arrive from outside; the robbers, realizing they are outnumbered, scatter. As Lord Bao tries to catch up with them, he trips over a box and stops, realizing that nothing appears to be missing and that the robbers have fled. He instructs his men to secure the area. Meanwhile, inside the house, a few empty boxes are hastily gathered. Lord Bao then attempts to return to the upper floor but, unfamiliar with the route, wanders toward Feng Xifeng’s quarters and asks, “Have any robbers come in here?” A frightened Ping’er replies, “No—please, go where you can.”

Shortly thereafter, Jia Yun and Lin Zhixiao come in, alarmed by the report of theft. When they learn that the night-watchmen have been crying and shouting, they order, “Secure the valuables and hand over the report to the authorities!” However, even as they do so, news spreads that the robbers have been described as “bandits” by the night-watchmen. One officer exclaims, “This is not a case of overt robbery—how can they be called bandits?” A night-watchman replies, “We chased the thieves, but as they were throwing off roof tiles we could not reach them. Fortunately, a man of the Bao family on the upper floor struck them off. When the robbers retreated into the garden, several of them were intercepted. Those we captured were from among our own ranks. One man was even overpowered.” The officer, growing impatient, declares, “If they are truly bandits, then why could you not overcome them? Quickly verify the stolen items and file the loss report.”

Jia Yun and others then inspect the upper rooms. They see that Wang Xifeng has been assisted by Feng Xifeng and that Xiuchun has also arrived. Jia Yun greets Wang Xifeng and inquires after Xiuchun; meanwhile, they begin inventorying the missing items. Since Yuanyang is already dead and Huopa and others have escorted her spirit away, all of the items belonged to Grandmother—and nothing appears to have been properly recorded. In the ensuing confusion, some say that the theft was so extensive, “that even the night-watchmen would not have been able to take it all.” Others remark that the thief who was killed was the adopted son of Zhou Rui, which indicates a conspiracy among the robbers. Outraged, Wang Xifeng orders, “Tie up all the night-watchwomen and hand them over to the authorities for interrogation!”

The assembled crowd groans and falls to their knees in lament. How the situation will ultimately be resolved—and whether any of the stolen items will ever be recovered—remains to be seen.
Chapter 112
When the Living Curse Is Punished, the Extraordinary Maid Suffers a Great Calamity;
While the Vengeful Spirits of the Dead and the Dishonorable Concubine of Zhao are Doomed to the Underworld

Wang Xifeng ordered that the night-watch women be bound and taken off to the authorities for interrogation. The bound women fell to their knees, crying and pleading. Lin Zhixiao and Jia Yun exchanged words: “No matter how much you beg, it will be of no use. Our master has sent us to guard the house; if nothing happens it is fate. But now that misfortune has struck, with chaos both inside and out, who is there to rescue you? Even if it is the adopted son of Zhou Rui, not even the eldest mistress or any of the household is free from corruption.”

Wang Xifeng, panting and choked with emotion, exclaimed, “This is all what fate has wrought—what need is there to argue? Just take them away. As for the items that were lost, tell the authorities: ‘They were truly Grandmother’s possessions; only our masters knew their true worth. Once we report and the officials return, the missing items shall be recovered in due course.’ That is how we report matters in the civil offices!” Jia Yun and Lin Zhixiao assented and went out. Xiuchun said nothing but burst into tears, lamenting, “I’ve never heard of such things before—why must it fall on us? When our master and mistress return tomorrow, how can I face anyone? They say the household is entrusted to you, and now things have come to this extreme—what hope is there?”

Wang Xifeng replied, “Do we have any choice? There are still those night-watch women out there.”

Xiuchun added bitterly, “And what can you say? Besides, you yourself are ill; I have nothing to add. It is all because of my elder sister-in-law’s doing—she egged on the mistress to have me watch the house. Now, look at my face!” And she burst into more heart-wrenching tears. Wang Xifeng consoled her, “Girl, do not think so. If you say you’ve lost face, then everyone is in the same boat. If you persist with such dismal thoughts, I simply cannot hold back my anger.”

Just then, voices from the courtyard outside rose in a loud clamor: “I tell you, those meddlesome old women are absolutely unacceptable! In the Zhen Mansion we never allow such riffraff to come to our door—but in this household, they care nothing for decorum. Yesterday, when Grandmother’s funeral procession was out, that nun from some hermitage demanded to come here. I shouted at her and would not let her in, yet the maids at the gate cursed me and pleaded until they forced that ‘old maid’ to enter. The gate outside kept swinging open and shut; what is the meaning of it? I was so uneasy that I couldn’t sleep. By the fourth watch, the commotion grew so fierce that I finally forced the door open and saw someone standing in the western courtyard. I rushed over and beat him to death. Only now do I learn that this room belongs to Third Aunt— that very ‘old maid’ was the thief who sneaked in!”

Ping’er and the others, upon hearing this, cried out, “Who is so unruly? With Grandmother present, how dare they make such noise?”

Wang Xifeng asked, “What did that person call ‘old maid’? Did you take in a certain maid to live here?”

Xiuchun then recalled the time when Miaoyu came to see her—leaving behind only memories of playing chess on watch. Wang Xifeng said, “Was it him? How could he agree to such a thing? Even if nothing else, the fact that he is causing such a ruckus is no good, for if our master hears it, nothing will be well.”

Xiuchun, more and more fearful, rose to leave. But Wang Xifeng, not wanting Xiuchun to be frightened into causing further trouble, called after her, “Hold on—let us first see that those stolen items are gathered up and that someone is appointed to watch over them. Then we can proceed calmly.”

Ping’er replied, “We dare not gather them; once the authorities arrive and inspect everything, we must let them handle it. We can only watch. But tell me—has anyone from the master’s side been sent?”

Wang Xifeng answered, “Ask the old maids at the gate.” After a short while, one returned, “Lin Zhixiao cannot leave; the household people must remain to inspect, and some say it is all too confused—already, Second Elder Yun has been sent.” Wang Xifeng nodded, and she and Xiuchun sat together in anxious despair.

Meanwhile, the bandits—who had been originally invited by He San and his cronies—had stolen a good deal of gold, silver, and treasures and were attempting to transport their loot away. When pursued, they knew that they were mostly dealing with inept servants and planned to hide their plunder in one of the western rooms. Peering out a window, they saw by lamplight two beautiful women—a young maiden and an older maid. The thieves, thinking only of saving their skins, were about to force their way in; but when they saw Bao Yong coming to drive them off, they fled with their loot—though He San was not among them.

Later that day, the robbers, having hidden in their lair, discussed their actions. One remarked that He San had been beaten to death, a fact which had already been reported to the civil and military authorities—and that it would be impossible for them to hide any longer. They resolved to quickly join forces with the sea bandits, for if they delayed, the authorities’ warrants would soon close all escape routes. One bold fellow lamented, “We must leave, though I am reluctant to part with that maid, for she is exceedingly beautiful—could she be the little one from the hermitage?” Another said, “Ah, now I recall—it must be that ‘maid’ from Luocui An in the Jia garden. Wasn’t it said a few years ago that she had some history with our Master Baoyù, and later she fell ill with lovesickness and had to be treated with medicine? That must be her.” The man added, “Let us hide for a day; then our elder brother will provide funds for us to outfit ourselves properly. At daybreak, we’ll slip out. I’ll wait for you all on that twenty-li slope.” The bandits dispersed, and their share of the loot was divided—but we shall not recount those details further.

Back at the temple, after the funeral ceremonies had concluded and the body had been laid to rest, Jia Zheng sent off the funeral procession. In the outer anteroom he kept vigil with the mourners, while Lady Xing and Madame Wang wept inside—all through the night.

On the following day, as the family gathered for the next memorial feast and served the meal, Jia Yun entered. He quickly bowed before Grandmother’s spirit and then rushed to Jia Zheng, kneeling to offer his respects. Breathless, he reported that during the theft the household’s upper chambers had been ransacked; that many valuables had been stolen; and that Bao Yong had, in his attempt to chase the robbers, fatally beaten one man—a report which he had already submitted to the authorities. Jia Zheng was stunned. Lady Xing and Madame Wang inside, upon hearing the news, were so frightened they could barely speak, crying uncontrollably.

After a while, Jia Zheng asked, “How was the loss report opened?”

Jia Yun replied, “None of the household know—it hasn’t even been formally drawn up.”

Jia Zheng said, “That is good. If we were to formally account for it, our disgrace would be greater. Quickly, call for Jia Lian.”

At that time, Jia Lian, who had been away for the memorial service with Baoyù and others, was hurriedly recalled. When Jia Lian arrived, he was so agitated that, ignoring Jia Zheng’s presence, he began berating Jia Yun harshly, “You unworthy wretch! I entrusted you with this heavy duty—to have the night-watch patrol the premises—and you, of all people, dare to come here telling us such nonsense? How dare you!” He spat in Jia Yun’s face several times. Jia Yun stood silently, hands hanging, too terrified to reply. Jia Zheng then admonished, “Your insults serve no purpose.”

Jia Lian then knelt and asked, “What then shall we do?”

Jia Zheng replied, “There is no other recourse but to report the theft to the authorities. But note, these were Grandmother’s possessions—we have not touched a single item. You say we need silver? How many days after Grandmother’s death will anyone be able to part with her silver? We simply account for what remains and return it to its rightful owners; any surplus shall be used for the cemetery lands in the south.”

Jia Lian, knowing full well that all of Grandmother’s assets were managed by Yuanyang, thought, “If she dies, who will manage them? Perhaps ask Zhenzhu, who surely keeps careful records?” But he dared not contradict and repeatedly agreed. He then went back inside. Lady Xing and Madame Wang rejoined him and admonished, “Hurry back and make sure the watchmen know how to report to us!”

Jia Lian was then ordered to arrange the vehicles; he himself mounted a mule and, accompanied by a few young servants, rode out in haste. Jia Yun, meanwhile, dared not return to Jia Zheng’s presence and slipped away on horseback to catch up with Jia Lian. All the while, there was not a word spoken.

Back at home, Lin Zhixiao came in to pay respects. When Jia Lian reached Grandmother’s private chamber, he saw Wang Xifeng and Xiuchun present. Overcome with both anger and sorrow he asked Lin Zhixiao, “Have the authorities inspected the household?”

Knowing his own guilt, Lin Zhixiao knelt and replied, “The civil and military offices have inspected, tracked the robbers’ trail, and verified the body.”

Jia Lian, shocked, exclaimed, “Verified the body?”

Lin Zhixiao then recounted that the man beaten to death by Bao Yong was believed to be the adopted son of Zhou Rui. Jia Lian said, “Call for Jia Yun!”

Jia Yun entered, also kneeling to listen. Jia Lian then demanded, “When you met our master, why did you not mention that Zhou Rui’s adopted son was killed by Bao Yong?”

Jia Yun explained, “The night-watchmen said he resembled him—but they feared the truth, so nothing was reported.”

Jia Lian exclaimed, “You foolish wretch! Had you told us, I would have summoned Zhou Rui for confirmation, and all would be clear!”

Lin Zhixiao replied, “The authorities have already placed the corpse at the market for identification.”

Jia Lian said, “That is absurd! When one of our people is killed for theft, must he pay the ultimate penalty?”

Lin Zhixiao replied, “There is no need for others to verify—it is clear to me.”

Jia Lian, remembering that the previous year our eldest brother was set upon by robbers from Zhou Rui’s household, grew even more angry and threatened to lash out at the night-watchmen. Lin Zhixiao pleaded, “Please, Second Master, do not be angry. Those night-watchmen, who were sent by our master, did their duty—they only follow our household rules. In our house, no man dares to enter the inner chambers; only the servants are allowed, and they do so under strict orders. Our servants outside, along with Yun’er, have been checking constantly. When they saw that the outer doors were tightly closed and none of the interior doors opened, it is clear the robbers came in from the rear.”

Jia Lian asked, “And what of the night-watchwomen?”

Lin Zhixiao reported, “They were bound by order and left to be interrogated by our master.”

Jia Lian then asked, “What about Bao Yong?”

Lin Zhixiao replied, “He has gone back to the garden.”

Jia Lian said, “Send for him.” The servants then brought Bao Yong, who replied, “Thankfully you are here. Had you not, I fear all the household’s valuables would have been stolen!” Bao Yong said no more.

Xiuchun, afraid that he might mention such matters, grew anxious. Wang Xifeng also dared not speak. Suddenly, voices from outside cried, “The Missour sisters have returned!”

Everyone, upon hearing this, began to weep anew.

Jia Lian then ordered the remaining valuables to be inventoried. Only some clothing, a few measuring rods, and a money chest remained untouched; all else had vanished. Jia Lian grew even more anxious, wondering how the silver from the temporary pavilions and the funds from the kitchen would be repaid tomorrow. He sat in silence for a long time.

Soon, Bao Ming and others returned, weeping bitterly. When they saw the opened chests and cabinets with no clear record of the contents, they hastily fabricated a “loss report” and ordered it to be immediately sent to the civil and military offices. Jia Lian then dispatched additional night-watchmen. Wang Xifeng and Xiuchun returned to their rooms. Unable to bear staying at home or to direct blame at Wang Xifeng, Jia Lian mounted a horse and rode out of the city in haste. Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng, fearing that Xiuchun might have a breakdown, sent Feng to comfort her.

It was then two watches past midnight. Though the thieves had already locked the gates, everyone was on high alert and dared not sleep.

At that time the bandits—who had long been fixated on Miaoyu, knowing she belonged to the solitary nuns of the hermitage—plotted to take advantage. When night fell and the hours grew still, they armed themselves with short weapons and bundles of scented incense and climbed atop the high wall. From a distance, they spied that the Luocui An still glowed with light. Stealthily, they crept down and hid near the roof. By the fourth watch, they noticed that only one lantern remained lit inside and that Miaoyu was meditating on her cushion. After a while, she sighed softly and said, “Since I arrived at the Xuanmu to the capital, I had intended to secure a name for myself here—but I cannot settle elsewhere. Yesterday I kindly visited Fourth Sister and was met with these foolish insults, and last night I was so terrified. Now, returning here, even my cushion feels unstable; my flesh trembles and my heart races.” Being accustomed to meditating alone, she had refused company the previous night. But by the fifth watch she began to shiver from the cold. Just as she was about to call for help, she heard a noise outside the window. Recalling the events of last night, her fear increased; she called out, but no one answered. Suddenly, she sensed a fragrance waft through her mind so penetrating that her limbs grew numb and she could no longer speak, her heart pounding in terror. At that moment a man entered with a bright knife. Miaoyu, understanding his intent, realized he wished to kill her. Yet she, in a state of transcendent calm, decided not to resist. Unexpectedly, the man placed his knife against his own back, freeing his hand to gently lift Miaoyu and caress her lightly before hoisting her onto his back. In that instant, Miaoyu felt as if in a drunken stupor—a pitiable, immaculate daughter now being defiled by a brutal thief.

Meanwhile, the robber who had carried Miaoyu led her to the garden wall, where he arranged a makeshift ladder and scaled the wall. Once outside, his accomplices were already waiting with a carriage. He placed Miaoyu gently onto the carriage, then feigned official insignia by lighting a lantern and ordered the gate to be opened. At the gate, the officials, thinking someone on official business was leaving, did not question him. The bandits then hurried out of the city. With whips cracking, they rode to a twenty-li slope where, after a brief clash with a group of rough men, they dispersed and fled toward the South Sea. It is unknown whether Miaoyu, having been abducted, submitted to humiliation or resisted to her death, and her fate remains unrecorded.

Elsewhere, in the Luocui An, a nun who had long been associated with Miaoyu lived in a quiet chamber at the back. Awakening at the fifth watch, she heard voices and assumed Miaoyu was restless. Later, as she heard footsteps and the sounds of doors and windows, she attempted to rise to investigate but found herself too weak to speak. At dawn, still unable to ascertain Miaoyu’s whereabouts, she donned her clothes and summoned the abbess to prepare tea. She then went forward, only to find no trace of Miaoyu—the doors and windows thrown wide open. Perplexed by the previous night’s commotion, she murmured, “Where could she have gone this early?” Venturing out, she discovered a ladder propped against the wall, a dagger scabbard on the ground, and a tattered jacket lying nearby. “Oh no! The thieves must have burned the scented incense!” she cried, and immediately ordered others to inspect the hermitage. However, the hermitage’s doors remained firmly closed. The maids all insisted, “Last night the fumes made us so drowsy that we could barely speak—surely our mistress was silenced by the thieves? Even if they threatened her with knives and staffs, how could she raise her voice?” Just then, Bao Yong’s shouts were heard from the gate: “Quick, chase down those wretches and seize them!” The assembled servants pleaded with him, “Master, please open the door so we can see—if not, we dare not disturb you further.” Bao Yong retorted, “If you don’t believe me, go and see for yourselves. If nothing is found, then come back and ask again!” With that, Bao Yong pried open the gate. In due course, they located Xiuchun’s quarters.

Xiuchun was deep in sorrow, thinking of Miaoyu. “When I went later, did you hear what Bao Yong said? I fear we have once again incurred his wrath—and I have no true confidante left. With both my parents gone and my sister-in-law disdainful, and though Grandmother still loves me, now that she is dead, I am left utterly alone. What shall become of me?” she lamented bitterly, and in her grief she resolved to shave off her own hair in order to enter a nunnery. Cai Ping and others, alarmed, rushed to console her—but before long, she had already shaved off half of her hair. Cai Ping fretted even more, “Not only have you lost everything, but now you’ve lost your hair too—what will become of you?”

Amid the clamor, Miaoyu’s abbess arrived seeking her mistress. Cai Ping inquired anxiously, “Where has she gone?” The abbess explained in a trembling voice the events of last night—the sounds of clamor, the burned incense, the ladder and dagger found in the hermitage. Xiuchun, horrified, wondered if the bandits had indeed abducted her mistress. Yet she was uncertain, for she had always been so solitary—could she really have been taken? No one knew. Meanwhile, Bao Yong’s group had already been dispatched back to the city to report the theft.

Later, Jia Zheng and his entourage brought the funeral procession to the temple. Once the body was enshrined and the relatives dispersed, Jia Zheng summoned Jia Lian to review the loss report concerning the theft. Jia Lian recounted the numbers as recorded by Bao Ming, explaining that the items bestowed by the former Empress had been clearly noted; however, for the rest of the items—scarcely sufficient to be itemized—they had been haphazardly estimated and a “loss report” hastily drafted and delivered to the authorities. Jia Zheng approved with a nod. He then called for Jia Lian, Jia Rong, and Jia Yun to confer with him.

Before long, Baoyù approached the study to speak with Jia Zheng, but Jia Zheng replied, “No need for that.” Meanwhile, Lan’er remained with her mother. The night passed in heavy silence.

The next day, early in the morning, Lin Zhixiao entered the study on bended knee. Jia Zheng questioned him about every detail of the theft and then recounted Zhou Rui’s testimony, adding, “The authorities have seized Bao Er and found the stolen items among his belongings. They are now interrogating him to identify this entire band of thieves.” Jia Zheng’s face darkened with rage: “How dare our servants betray our master by allowing thieves to steal from our household!” He immediately ordered that Zhou Rui be bound and taken out to the authorities for interrogation. Lin Zhixiao remained kneeling, too fearful to rise. Jia Zheng shouted, “Why do you still remain kneeling?” Lin Zhixiao pleaded, “I deserve death—please, Master, have mercy!”

Just then, Lai Da and other officials arrived to offer their respects and presented the household’s financial accounts for the mourning. Jia Zheng said, “Let them be handed over to Jia Lian to sort out.” He then barked at Lin Zhixiao, “Get up and go!”

Jia Lian knelt beside Jia Zheng and murmured a few words. Jia Zheng glared and exclaimed, “Nonsense! Just because Grandmother’s silver was stolen, do you expect me to punish the servants by forcing them to pay it out?”

Jia Lian blushed fiercely and dared not reply; he stood up uncertainly. Jia Zheng then asked, “And what of your wife?”

Jia Lian knelt again, “It appears she is beyond help.”

Jia Zheng sighed, “I never imagined our family’s fortunes would fall so low! Moreover, Huan’er’s mother remains ill in the temple, and I know not what ails her. Do any of you know?”

Jia Lian dared not speak. Jia Zheng ordered, “Send word out and have someone bring a doctor immediately.”

Jia Lian hurried out and sent for a doctor to inspect Zhao Yiniang at the temple of Tiekan. The outcome of her fate remains unknown.
Chapter 113
Atoning for Past Wrongs – Sister Feng Relies on a Village Crone; Letting Go of Old Resentments – The Maid’s Tender Devotion to a Foolish Young Master

It is said that Concubine Zhao, while staying in the temple, was stricken by a sudden and violent illness. With fewer people about, her babbling grew even more incoherent, frightening everyone present. Two women assisted her, holding her knees as she knelt on the floor; each time she spoke, she burst into sobs. Sometimes, crawling about on the ground, she cried out, “They’re going to beat me to death! Red-bearded master, I dare not do it again!” At other moments she clasped her hands together and moaned in pain. Her eyes bulged, blood streamed from her mouth, and her hair lay disheveled. Everyone was terrified and dared not come near her.

As dusk fell, Concubine Zhao’s voice grew husky—as if wailing like a ghost. No one dared approach her, so only a few brave men were summoned to sit with her. At one point, she seemed to die, only to return after a while, making a tumult throughout the night. By the next day, she no longer spoke; instead, she wore a ghastly expression and began to tear open her own clothes with her hands, exposing her chest as though someone had stripped her bare. Though she could not speak, the agony on her face was unmistakable.

In the midst of this crisis, a physician arrived. Yet, even he dared not take her pulse; he only instructed, “Make the proper arrangements for the funeral,” and then rose and left. The family members who had accompanied him pleaded repeatedly, “Please, sir, take her pulse so that I might report back to the master of the house.” But when the doctor felt her, he found no trace of a pulse. Hearing this, Jia Huan broke into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone focused on Jia Huan, and no one paid attention to the fact that Concubine Zhao, with her wild hair and bare feet, lay dead upon the kang (heated brick bed). Only Aunt Zhou’s heart whispered, “Is this the fate of a concubine? Moreover, she bore his child – what will become of me when my time comes?” And so she too was overcome with sorrow.

It wasn’t long before a servant rushed back to report to Jia Zheng. In response, he sent men to perform the customary funeral arrangements, and Jia Huan remained with the body for three days before returning. As word spread—first one person told ten, then ten told a hundred—it was widely known that Concubine Zhao had harbored a poisonous heart and had harmed others, and that she had been tortured to death in the netherworld. Rumors also circulated that “Second Madame Lian, poor soul, is hardly faring any better—what with all those complaints she’s made!” Such talk reached Ping’er’s ears, and she grew anxious. Looking at Fengjie’s state, she believed there was no hope for improvement. Moreover, Jia Lian had lately been distant, their previous closeness replaced by many trivial quarrels, as if nothing concerned him. Ping’er could only offer solace to Fengjie. When both the second madams of the Xing and Wang families returned home for a few days, they merely sent someone to inquire about Fengjie’s condition without coming to see her personally, deepening Fengjie’s despair. Even when Jia Lian returned, not a single word of tenderness was spoken.

At that moment, Fengjie longed only for a swift death. As she brooded in her heart, dark forces seemed to gather. Suddenly, Second Sister You emerged from behind the partition and approached the bedside. “Sister,” she said, “it has been so long since we last met. Your little sister has missed you terribly and longed to see you. At last, I have managed to come and see you. But it seems your wits have all been spent. Our Second Master is so muddle-headed that he does not appreciate your affection—instead, he reproaches you for being too harsh, ruining his prospects, and leaving him unable to face the world. I sympathize with your anger.”

In a dazed state, Fengjie murmured, “Now I too regret how narrow-minded I have been. And yet, my dear sister shows no ill will and even comes to see me.” Hearing this, Ping’er asked, “What did you say, Sister?” For a moment Fengjie regained her senses, and then recalled that Second Sister You had already passed away—surely she must have come now to claim her life. Roused by Ping’er’s question, and fearful, Fengjie refused to speak the truth. Instead, she managed to say, “My spirit is unsettled—I must have been speaking in my dreams. Please, give me a light blow to rouse me.”

At that moment, as Ping’er was about to start, a small maid entered, announcing that Old Liu had arrived, and that the village women had come to pay their respects to Madam. Ping’er hurriedly inquired, “Where is she?” The little maid replied, “She dares not come in without your orders, Madam.” Nodding, Ping’er reasoned that in her illness, Fengjie must be too feeble to see anyone. “Madam is resting her spirit,” she explained. “Let her be. Inquire of him what business he has.” The maid said, “They have asked and there is nothing. They only noted that, since the old lady’s passing was not reported, they are late in coming.”

Upon hearing this, Fengjie called out, “Ping’er, come here. They have come out of kindness—do not be so dismissive. Please go and invite Old Liu in; I wish to speak with him.” Reluctantly, Ping’er went out to summon Old Liu. Soon, Fengjie was about to close her eyes when she saw a man and a woman approaching the kang as if they were about to lie down. Alarmed, she cried to Ping’er, “There’s a man coming—he’s sneaked in!” After calling out twice, Fengjie saw Feng’er and Xiao Hong hurrying over. “What is it, Madam?” asked Feng’er. Opening her eyes wide but seeing no one, Fengjie inwardly understood but could not bring herself to speak. Instead, she asked, “Where did that Ping’er go?” Feng’er replied, “Didn’t Madam send her to invite Old Liu?” After a moment of gathering herself, Fengjie said nothing further.

Not long after, Ping’er returned with Old Liu and a little girl, saying, “We’re here to pay our respects to our revered Madam.” Ping’er led them to the kang. Old Liu bowed and said, “Please accept my respects, Madam.” When Fengjie opened her eyes to see him, her heart sank with grief. “Old Liu, how are you? Why have you come only now?” she managed to ask. Old Liu, seeing Fengjie so gaunt and lost in a daze, felt deep sorrow as well. “My dear Madam, how is it that in these past few months, without so much as a glance from you, you have become so ill? I—an old fool nearing death—could not help but come sooner to pay my respects!” He then beckoned Qing’er to convey his respects. Qing’er only smiled.

Fengjie, moved by compassion for him, signaled to Xiao Hong. Old Liu went on, “You know, in our village folk, no one gets sick without first making vows to the gods; we hardly ever take medicine. I wonder, Madam, might your illness be due to some unforeseen misfortune?” Though Ping’er thought his words were ill-timed and hurriedly pulled him aside, Old Liu seemed to understand and fell silent. Yet Fengjie, finding his words to echo her own thoughts, half-jokingly said, “Old Liu, you—being of a certain age—speak truthfully. You have seen that Concubine Zhao is dead, haven’t you?”

Old Liu was taken aback. “Amitābha! How could a perfectly sound person die? I recall she even had a little brother—what shall become of him?” Ping’er interjected, “What does that matter? She also had the master’s wife!” Old Liu replied, “My dear, you have no idea! It is far worse when one dies as a blood relative; a mere ‘bastard’ is of no consequence.” These words only deepened Fengjie’s sorrow. Overwhelmed, she began to weep pitifully, and everyone tried in vain to console her.

At that moment, young Qiaojie, upon hearing her mother’s lament, stepped to the kang and took Fengjie’s hand, joining her in tears. Between sobs, Fengjie said, “Have you ever seen Old Liu, Qiaojie?” Qiaojie replied, “No, Madam.” Fengjie continued, “Your name was given to you by him—it’s just like that of your godmother. Please go and pay your respects.” Qiaojie obeyed and moved toward him. Old Liu hastily said, “Amitābha! Please spare me the rebuke. Little Qiaojie, it has been over a year since I last came—do you still remember me?” Qiaojie responded, “How could I forget? I was so little the last time I saw you in the garden. When you came the year before, you promised me a cricket for the coming year—but you must have forgotten.” Laughing, Old Liu replied, “Good child, I have grown old and confused. As for crickets, our village is full of them; even a whole cartful would be no trouble.”

Fengjie interjected, “No, no—you should simply take her with you.” Old Liu laughed again, “Madam, with your exquisite finery, swathed in the finest silks and eating only the best, when I take her to our village, what will I offer her for amusement or nourishment? Would that not ruin me?” He chuckled at his own jest. Then he added, “How about this—I will try my hand at matchmaking for you. Although our village is but a humble place, we do have a wealthy family with several thousand acres of land, hundreds of livestock, and plenty of silver. It may not be adorned with gold or jade like here, and I’m sure Madam would look down on such folk. But among the gentry, such a wealthy family is regarded as one touched by heaven.”

Fengjie replied, “Go on—I’m willing to give it a try.” Old Liu, knowing it was all in jest, continued, “Of course, it is mere talk. Even if Madam were agreeable, the high-ranking ladies would never consent to marry one of our rustic folk!” At this, Qiaojie, finding his words unseemly, walked away to speak with Qing’er; the two girls soon struck up a lively conversation.

Not wishing Old Liu’s chatter to further unsettle Fengjie, Ping’er pulled him aside and said, “Since you’ve already mentioned the master’s wife, why don’t we go and see her? I’ll send someone to fetch you—so your trip need not be in vain.” Old Liu began to rise, but Fengjie interjected, “No need to hurry—please sit. Tell me, have you been faring well these days?” With endless gratitude, Old Liu replied, “Were it not for Madam’s kindness…” as he gestured toward Qing’er, “even his parents would be starving. Although times are hard for the villagers, we have managed to earn a few acres, dig a well, and grow vegetables and fruits; the money we make in a year is enough for our daily bread. Over these past two years, Madam has even occasionally sent clothes and fabric, which has been more than enough for us in the village. Amitābha! The other day, when his father went into town, he heard that something was amiss here at Madam’s place—and I nearly fainted! Thankfully, someone said it was not here, so I could breathe easier. Later, I heard that the master had been promoted, and I rejoiced, thinking of the bountiful harvest waiting for us. But yesterday, I learned that the old lady has passed on. I was out in the fields threshing beans when I heard the news—so shocked I couldn’t even pick up a bean—and I bawled my eyes out right there. I told my son-in-law, ‘I won’t mind you all any longer! Whether the words are true or not, I must go into town to see for myself!’ Even my daughter and her husband, who are not heartless, wept for a while upon hearing it. At daybreak today, they hurried me into town. I knew no one there and had no one to inquire with. I went straight to the back gate and found that even the door gods were in a muddle—my fright was immense. Once inside, I searched for Aunt Zhou, but couldn’t find her; eventually, I encountered a young maiden who said, ‘Aunt Zhou fell ill and was driven out.’ I waited for a long time until I met someone familiar, and that’s how I managed to get in. And yet, even Madam appears to be as ill as this!’” Tears then welled from his eyes.

Before he could finish, Ping’er, anxious to change the subject, tugged at him and said, “You’ve spoken long enough—your throat must be parched. Let’s go have some tea.” Leading Old Liu to the back room, and with Qing’er nearby and Qiaojie off with her friends, Old Liu said, “Tea is unnecessary. Good child, please send someone to fetch the master’s wife so I may pay my respects to her and weep for the old lady.” Ping’er replied, “There’s no need to rush; even today we can’t get anyone out of town. Earlier, I was worried that your unguarded words might provoke our Madam to weep again, so I urged you out. Please don’t trouble yourself.”

Old Liu sighed, “Amitābha, dear child—you are so kind-hearted; I understand completely. But pray tell, how is Madam’s illness faring?” Ping’er asked, “Is it getting worse?” Old Liu admitted, “I fear it is a grievous fault; it appears most untoward to me.”

Just then, Fengjie’s voice was heard calling. Ping’er hurried to the bedside, but Fengjie fell silent once more. As Ping’er was about to question Feng’er, Jia Lian entered. He glanced toward the kang without a word, then stormed off to the inner room and took a seat in a huff. Only Qiu Tong followed him inside, diligently pouring tea and chattering softly. Soon after, Jia Lian summoned Ping’er, “Aren’t we to give Madam her medicine?” Ping’er replied, “What good is medicine if it is not taken?” Jia Lian retorted, “Do you think I do?” He then beckoned, “Fetch the key from the cabinet.” Noting Jia Lian’s ire, Ping’er dared not question him and instead whispered something into Fengjie’s ear. Fengjie remained silent. Ping’er then set a small box before Jia Lian and departed.

Jia Lian grumbled, “Is there a ghost calling for you? Who do you expect to fetch it?” In her vexation, Ping’er opened the box, retrieved the key, unlocked the cabinet, and asked, “What are we to get?” Jia Lian replied, “What is there for us to get?” Ping’er, nearly in tears, cried, “If you have something to say, speak plainly—even if it is that a dead person speaks!” Jia Lian responded, “Isn’t that obvious? The trouble in the head is of your own making; now, the old lady’s account is short by four or five thousand silver dollars. The master has ordered me to liquidate the estate’s land accounts to obtain silver—do you think there is any? The external ledgers won’t open, as if fate itself has ordained it! So we must exchange what the old lady left us—do you agree?”

Hearing this, Ping’er fell silent as she began to remove items from the cabinet. At that moment, Xiao Hong rushed over, exclaiming, “Sister Ping, hurry! Madam is in no good state!” Disregarding Jia Lian’s protests, Ping’er hurried over. Finding Fengjie reaching out with empty hands, Ping’er clutched her and cried. Jia Lian came over, stamping his foot and said, “If it comes to this, then it’s as if my very life is in danger!” Tears began to fall from his eyes. Feng’er then announced, “They’re calling for Second Master outside.” With no choice, Jia Lian had to leave.

Fengjie’s condition worsened still, and as Feng’er and the others broke into anguished weeping, Qiaojie came running. Old Liu, hurrying to the kang and softly chanting Buddhist sutras while making some mystical gestures, seemed to ease Fengjie’s distress somewhat. Soon, upon hearing the news from one of the maids, Madame Wang also arrived. Seeing Fengjie a bit calmer, her heart eased. Upon meeting Old Liu, she asked, “Old Liu, how are you? When did you arrive?” He merely replied with his respectful greeting and did not elaborate further, instead discussing at length Fengjie’s ailment. Shortly afterward, Caiyun entered with the message, “The master is calling for the madam.” Madame Wang, after giving a few instructions to Ping’er, departed.

After the tumult, Fengjie gradually regained some clarity. Seeing Old Liu present, and trusting that his prayers might help soothe her troubled spirit, she ushered Fengjie and the others aside and beckoned Old Liu to sit beside her on the kang. She confided her inner torment and described how she appeared as if haunted by ghosts. Old Liu said, “In our village, we have many sacred Buddhas and temples with proven efficacies.” Fengjie replied, “Please, pray for me. I have the silver for the offerings.” Removing a gold bracelet from her wrist, she handed it to him.

Old Liu responded, “Madam, there is no need for that. In our village, when we make a vow, a few hundred silver coins suffice. Even if I pray on your behalf, it is merely a vow; when Madam recovers, spend what you will.” Knowing well that Old Liu’s intentions were pure and not wishing to press him, Fengjie could only say, “Old Liu, I entrust my life to you. And my dear Qiaojie, who has long suffered from many ailments, is also in your care.” Old Liu readily agreed, saying, “In that case, since the weather is still fair and I can hurry out of town, I will be off. When Madam recovers, we shall return to fulfill our vow.”

Fengjie, tormented by the ghosts of past grievances and desperate for relief, was almost glad to see him depart. “If you can devote your heart to me, I might finally sleep peacefully, and I shall be forever grateful. Have your granddaughter remain here,” she added. Old Liu countered, “Village children have not seen much of the world; it would be better if I took her along so as not to cause any mischief.”

“Is that too much thinking?” Fengjie asked. “We are all one family. Though we are poor, an extra mouth to feed is not a burden.” Seeing Fengjie’s sincerity, Old Liu happily consented to let Qing’er stay for a few days—saving on the household’s expenses. Fearing Qing’er might object, he went to speak with her; and, satisfied with her acquiescence, he bid farewell to Ping’er and hastily left town.

Meanwhile, the Lóngcuì Nunnery (栊翠庵)—originally an estate of the Jia household, enclosed within the ancestral garden and long maintained by incense offerings without drawing on the Jia family’s provisions—became the refuge for Miaoyu after she was kidnapped. The nun had reported her abduction to the authorities, not only so that officials might trace the whereabouts of the criminals, but also because Miaoyu’s inheritance was too significant to be dispersed; she was to remain there, awaiting further instructions from the Jia household. Although everyone in the Jia family knew of the matter, they kept it secret—since Jia Zheng had recently suffered a loss, and the family was in no frame of mind to deal with such trifles. Only Xichun was aware of the incident, and she was tormented day and night. Gradually, word reached Baoyu, who heard rumors that “Miaoyu has been abducted by thieves.” Others even said, “Miaoyu, moved by worldly desires, has run off with someone.”

Baoyu, upon hearing this, was deeply perplexed: “Surely she must have been seized by bandits. That poor soul would never submit—she would rather die than be cowed.” Yet, with no further news, he grew increasingly uneasy. Each day he sighed and lamented, “How can one so pure, who calls herself ‘one beyond the threshold,’ suffer such a fate!” He recalled the lively scenes in the garden in days past—ever since Second Sister left home, some have died, others married. He had thought her untarnished, destined to remain so, but now storms had arisen that made her death even more strange than that of Lin Daiyu. Thus, one thought led to another, and he recalled the words in the Zhuangzi about the illusory nature of life. In our brief existence, it is inevitable that passions fade like drifting clouds; before one knows it, one is inconsolable and weeping bitterly. It is a pity that the dead may never know the torment of the living—a sorrow so deep it seems unending. In comparison, even the plants and stones, ignorant and insensate, have pure hearts.

At that very moment, while Baoyu was preparing for sleep, the atmosphere grew restless. In the East Courtyard, voices began to raise in clamour over some unknown matter. (To be continued in the next chapter.)
Chapter 114
Wang Xifeng’s Illusory Return to Jinling; Zhen Yingjia Receives Favour and Returns to the Jade Palace

It so happened that upon hearing how gravely ill Fengjie was, Baoyu and Baochai hurriedly rose, and the maids lit candles to attend her. Just as they were about to leave the infirmary, word came from the direction of Madame Wang: “Second Madame Lian is in a dire state—she has not yet taken her final breath. Second Master and Second Madame, please wait a while longer. There is something uncanny about Second Madame Lian’s illness. Since the third watch, and until the fourth, she has not ceased speaking, uttering a great many absurd words. She keeps saying she must take a boat or a sedan chair and that she is to hurry off to Jinling to be enrolled in some register. None of us understand what she means—she is merely crying and bawling. Second Master had no choice but to attempt preparing a boat and sedan chair for her, but before they could be arranged, Second Madame Lian was left gasping for breath in anticipation. The lady has sent word that we should wait until Second Madame Lian is gone before we proceed.”

Baoyu remarked, “How strange—what business does she have in Jinling?”
Xi Ren answered softly, “Do you not recall your dream from that year? I remember you mentioned a great many registers. Perhaps Second Madame Lian is destined for that place?”

Baoyu nodded. “Indeed. It seems every man has his fate. But what of Lin Daiyu? Now that you mention it, I have a faint idea. Next time I dream this dream I shall watch more closely—maybe I can divine the future.”

Xi Ren chided, “You are such a fanciful fellow! Is it really wise to take every passing remark as truth? Even if you could foretell events, what use would that be?”

Baoyu replied, “I fear I won’t actually be able to foresee anything. And if I did, I wouldn’t trouble you all with needless worry.”

As they were conversing, Baochai entered and asked, “What are you two discussing?”
Fearing her inquiry might lead to further questioning, Baoyu quickly answered, “We were talking about Sister Feng.”
Baochai scolded, “When a person is dying, you two still prattle on. Not long ago you even said I cursed someone—and wasn’t that divination fulfilled?”

Baoyu paused to reflect, then clapped his hands and said, “Yes, yes—when you put it that way, it seems you have the gift of foresight. I might as well ask you: do you know what fate holds for me?”
Baochai laughed, “Now you’ve gone off the deep end! I was merely interpreting the divination for Second Madame Lian’s case—you take it as gospel. You’re no different from our Second Sister-in-law. When you lost the jade, you went to seek assistance from Miaoyu’s spirit-writing, and the outcome confounded everyone. In private you even told me that Miaoyu had been foretelling things and was versed in meditation and Zen—yet now, in the face of calamity, he himself is in the dark! Where is the precognition in that? Even if I casually mention Second Madame Lian’s plight, how could I possibly know what will befall you? I daresay I know not even my own fate. All these matters are but absurdities—do you truly believe them?”

Baoyu said, “Let’s not talk about him. Tell me about Sister Xing instead—ever since we’ve been beset by calamities here, that matter has been completely forgotten. How is it that such a major event in their family was handled so hastily? Not even close relatives or friends were invited.”
Baochai replied, “That’s rather too old-fashioned a view. In our family, the only close relatives are those in our own household and the Wang family. But the Wang family has lost its proper folk, and with our family reeling from the old lady’s calamity, nothing proper was arranged—only Second Brother Lian did a bit of organizing. There are a couple of other relatives, but since you didn’t go there yourself, how would you know? Come to think of it, our Second Sister-in-law’s fate is much like mine. When our dear Second Brother was promised to me, my mother had intended to arrange a very proper match for him. First, because my elder brother was in custody and Second Brother was unwilling to make a grand affair; second, because of our family’s matters; and third, because our Second Sister-in-law was suffering terribly under the strictness of the main wife’s household—and on top of that, her family had been confiscated. It was all too unbearable for her. So my mother and I agreed to settle for a simpler match. I dare say our Second Sister-in-law now lives in quiet contentment, paying filial respects to my mother—much better than any proper daughter-in-law ever could. And Second Brother, though frugal, is extremely dutiful as a husband. He and Xiangling get along splendidly. Even if they are poor, my mother has been enjoying a more peaceful life these days. Yet, whenever I think of my elder brother, I cannot help but feel sorrow. Moreover, he often sends people here to work for him—thankfully, Second Brother has managed to retrieve some funds from outside to cover these expenses. I even heard that several city houses have been mortgaged; only one remains, and they are planning to move there.”

Baoyu interjected, “But why should they move? Living here is convenient—if they move far away, it would take an entire day just to visit.”
Baochai replied, “Even among relatives, each prefers his own comfort. Who in his right mind spends his whole life living in someone else’s house?”

Before Baoyu could further expound his objections to moving, word came again from Madame Wang’s side: “Second Madame Lian has taken her last breath. Everyone has now gone to pay their respects; Second Master and Second Madame, please come over.”

Hearing these words, Baoyu could not help stamping his foot in grief. Although Baochai too was sorrowful, fearful that Baoyu might be overwhelmed, she said, “If you must weep here, why not weep over there instead?”

And so the two proceeded to Fengjie’s side, where they found many gathered in mourning. Baochai approached and, seeing that Fengjie had already been removed from the bed, broke into loud wails. Baoyu, holding onto Jia Lian’s hand, began to cry bitterly as well, and Jia Lian resumed his own weeping. Xi Ren and the others, seeing that no one was in a position to offer comfort, could only come up and gently try to dissuade them. All were engulfed in sorrow.

At this point, Jia Lian felt utterly at a loss and sent for Lai Da to handle the funeral arrangements. He then planned to return to report to Jia Zheng before setting the proceedings in motion. Yet, lacking sufficient funds, every matter had to be carefully calculated. Moreover, when he thought of Fengjie’s long years of service and goodness, his grief deepened further. Observing how Qiao Jie was weeping inconsolably, his heart ached even more. They cried through the night until dawn; then, without delay, someone was sent to summon his elder brother Wang Ren.

Since the death of Wang Ziting and with Wang Zisheng being a feckless man who had long sown discord among his kin, Wang Ren, upon hearing of his sister’s passing, hurried over to weep with the family. But when he saw how hastily everything was being arranged, he felt uneasy and said, “My sister served in your household for many hard years without fault. You ought to see to it that her funeral is conducted properly—how is it that nothing is in order yet?”

Jia Lian, already on poor terms with Wang Ren, paid little heed to his insolent remarks, knowing he did not understand the true situation. In response, Wang Ren called for his niece Qiao Jie and said, “When your mother was alive, her handling of things was rather careless—she only knew how to ingratiate herself with the old lady and never paid proper regard to our kin. Now that your mother is gone, you must listen to your uncle. Your maternal relatives are now only me and your second uncle. I have long known your father’s character—always respectful of others. I recall that the year when Aunt You passed away, though I was not in the capital, I heard that a good deal of silver was spent. Now that your mother is dead, your father has arranged everything so sloppily. Have you no sense to advise him?”

Qiao Jie replied, “My father would dearly love to see things done properly, but alas, he is not what he once was. Now that funds are short, he must economize in every way.”
Wang Ren said, “Are you still short of money?”
Qiao Jie answered, “After everything was confiscated last year, there is nothing left.”
Wang Ren remarked, “Is that so? I hear that the old lady had given quite a bit of wealth as well—you should present it.”
Qiao Jie, unwilling to reveal that her father had already spent it, could only demur.
Wang Ren then said, “Ah, I see—it is simply that you wish to keep it as dowry.”
Qiao Jie, unable to retort, burst into choked sobs.

Xi Ren, irritated, said, “Uncle, let us wait until Second Master arrives. You’re too young to understand these matters.”
Wang Ren snapped, “You all are just waiting for Second Madame Lian to die so you can have your way. I ask for nothing more than a dignified appearance—it is for your own reputation!” He sat down in a huff.

Qiao Jie’s heart was heavy, thinking, “My father is not unfeeling. While my mother was alive, my uncle took so many things—now he speaks as if everything were clear-cut!” And from that moment on, she began to look down on her uncle. Unbeknownst to her, Wang Ren’s mind was full of thoughts of his late sister’s accumulated wealth. “Even if the property was confiscated, is there any fear that the silver in the house might be scant? They must be afraid I will pester them, so they put it like this. This little girl is utterly useless!” From then on, Wang Ren grew to despise Qiao Jie.

Jia Lian, oblivious to all this, busied himself with gathering funds. The major expenses outside were being handled by Lai Da, but inside the household there was also a great need for money—and there was a particularly persistent, muddle-headed clerk causing trouble. “What are we to do?” he grumbled.

Xi Ren said to him, “Second Master, do not overtax yourself. If funds are short, I have some items that—fortunately, they were not confiscated last year—can be used. If you wish, take them as payment.”
Jia Lian thought, “What a blessing!” and smiled. “That would be even better—saving me from scrambling everywhere. Once I have the money in hand, I will return it to you.”
Xi Ren replied, “These were given by the old lady. There’s no need to fuss over returning them. As long as the funeral is conducted properly, that is all that matters.”
Jia Lian, deeply grateful, took Xi Ren’s items to use as funds. Every matter was now discussed with her. Qiu Tong, observing all this, could not help but feel resentful; every time she had the chance, she would mutter, “Without the old lady’s blessing, Xi Ren will soon rise in status. I am one of the masters’ own; how can she bypass me?” Xi Ren sensed this but paid it no heed. For a time, Jia Lian himself came to understand and began to resent Qiu Tong, venting his frustrations on her. Lady Xing knew of it and complained that Jia Lian was being unkind. Jia Lian gritted his teeth and said nothing further.

After more than ten days, Fengjie’s funeral was held. Jia Zheng, observing proper mourning for the old lady, remained in the study offsite. At that time, the “Qing Guests” (the refined visitors) had gradually all departed—only Cheng Rixing still lingered, often conversing and remarking, “Our family’s fortunes are waning; one after another, people are dying. Even the great lords, Da Lao Ye and Zhen Da Ye, are away. The household finances are growing ever more strained—what will become of the fields in Dongzhuang? It’s all quite worrisome!”

Cheng Rixing replied, “I have been here many years and know all the family members—each one is only looking out for himself. Year after year, money is funneled into their pockets, and naturally the household coffers never suffice. Then there are the expenses for those great lords Da Lao Ye and Zhen Da Ye, and outside there are debts as well. Recently, much wealth was lost; if the authorities are to pursue the misappropriated funds, it will be no easy matter. If the old patriarch is to set things in order, he must summon the managers and send a trusted aide to conduct an inquiry—those who must go, should go; those who should remain, must be retained. Any shortfall would have to be made up by the hands that handled the affairs. In truth, that great garden—no one dares buy it now—and its potential is not small, yet no one is appointed to manage it. For years the old patriarch has been away, and these people have been acting as if possessed, making it so no one dares enter the garden. That is the true bane of the family. Now, if we were to check on the servants—keeping the good ones and dismissing the bad—that would be the proper way.”

Jia Zheng nodded, “You know, sir, you may not realize this—but even our own nephews cannot be relied upon. If I were to inspect every detail, how could I possibly do so? Moreover, I am busy with my official duties and cannot oversee such matters. I have never been one to fuss over household affairs; there is much that escapes my notice.”

Cheng Rixing said, “The old patriarch is the most benevolent of men. In another family, such a state of affairs might lead to poverty lasting ten years or more. But if you demand too much from the managers, you will find it hard to extract the funds. I even heard that some members of the old patriarch’s household have become magistrates.”

Jia Zheng remarked, “If one were to take advantage of the household’s funds, it would be most unseemly—I must economize. But as for the properties recorded in the register, if they truly exist it would be all the better; one fears they might be nothing more than names on paper.”

Cheng Rixing replied, “Sir, you are exactly right. Why do I insist on checking? Perhaps you have heard something?”
Jia Zheng said, “You must have heard something.”
Cheng Rixing continued in a low tone, “I know something of the managers’ cunning, but dare not speak openly.”
Jia Zheng sighed, “Ever since our great-grandfather, our family has been kind and generous—never harsh to the servants. Yet now these people seem more troublesome each day. When they act the part of a master in my hands, it becomes a laughingstock.”

They were still speaking when a messenger entered and announced, “Old Lord Zhen of Jiangnan has arrived.”
Jia Zheng inquired, “Why has Lord Zhen come to the capital?”
The messenger replied, “I have heard that he has been favoured by the Emperor and reinstated.”
Jia Zheng said, “No need for further explanation—please, see that he is received at once.”

The messenger went out and soon returned with Lord Zhen. This Lord Zhen was none other than Zhen Baoyu’s father—named Zhen Yingjia, styled Youzhong—a native of Jinling and a descendant of men of merit. He had long enjoyed close ties with the Jia household. A couple of years earlier, after being dismissed from office and losing his family fortune, he had fallen on hard times; but now, having caught the Emperor’s eye for his past service, he was granted reinstatement and had come to pay his respects at court. Learning of the recent passing of the old lady, he had prepared a proper tribute and, choosing an auspicious day, had come to pay his respects at the spirit-shrine before visiting the family.

Jia Zheng, still in mourning, could not afford to give him a grand reception, so he waited outside the study. As soon as Lord Zhen saw him, a mix of grief and joy overcame him. Since he was in official attire and it was not proper to prostrate himself, the two clasped hands and exchanged words of long separation and remembrance. Then, taking seats as guest and host, they served tea and spoke of events that had transpired since they last met. Jia Zheng asked, “When did your esteemed father come to court?”
Zhen Yingjia replied, “Just the other day.”
Jia Zheng said, “The Emperor’s favour is such that he must have issued a warm edict.”
Zhen Yingjia responded, “The Emperor’s grace is indeed higher than the heavens—several edicts have been issued.”
Jia Zheng asked, “What sort of edicts?”
Zhen Yingjia explained, “Lately, bandits have been rampant along the coastal borders. The common folk are in distress, so the Duke of Anguo has been dispatched to suppress these outlaws. The Emperor, knowing that I am familiar with the local territories, has ordered me to go and pacify the region—but I must depart at once. Yesterday, upon learning of the old lady’s passing, I hastened to bring a small offering of incense to pay my respects at the spirit-shrine.”

Jia Zheng quickly bowed in thanks and said, “Your undertaking on this mission will surely comfort the Emperor’s heart and bring solace to the people. Truly, there is no greater service than this. Alas, I cannot personally witness such a brilliant talent; I must content myself with hearing of your swift success. By the way, the current Commander of Zhenhai is our relative—when the time is right, I hope he will shine his light upon our affairs.”

Zhen Yingjia asked, “And what relation is this Commander to you?”
Jia Zheng replied, “Some years ago, while I was serving in the Jiangxi granary, I betrothed my youngest daughter to the Commander’s son—a match that has now endured for three years. Yet because the situation at Haikou remains unresolved and with coastal bandits colluding with traitors, we have lost contact. I miss my daughter deeply, and once your mission is complete, I shall humbly ask you to see her. I have even prepared a few written words to send along with my request, for which I would be most grateful.”
Zhen Yingjia said, “Parental affection is inevitable. I have, in fact, been entrusted with matters by my own elderly relative. Recently, by the Emperor’s command I was summoned to the capital. Because my youngest is still but a child and my household is short of attendants, I have brought along all my dependents. I was ordered to travel swiftly day and night—my dependents will follow more slowly, and it will be some time before we arrive in the capital. I must now depart in obedience to the imperial command and cannot stay long. When my family eventually reaches the capital, they will most certainly visit your esteemed household—indeed, even the little ones shall pay their respects. If there is any prospect of an advantageous match, I would be most obliged if you would keep it in mind.”
Jia Zheng assented to every word. Lord Zhen then said a few more words before preparing to leave: “I hope we may meet again tomorrow outside the city.” Seeing that he was pressed for time, Jia Zheng understood that no further conversation could take place and saw him out of the study.

Jia Lian and Baoyu had long been waiting to see Lord Zhen off but, since Jia Zheng had not summoned them, they did not intrude. When Zhen Yingjia emerged, both Jia Lian and Baoyu went up to offer their respects. Upon seeing Baoyu, Yingjia paused in astonishment and thought, “Why does this young man resemble my own Baoyu so closely—yet he is clad entirely in mourning white!” He then asked, “It has been so long since I saw my kin—have I been unrecognized?”
Jia Zheng quickly pointed to Jia Lian, “This is my elder brother’s son, our Second Nephew Lian.” Then, pointing to Baoyu, he added, “And this is our Second Little Dog, named Baoyu.”
Zhen Yingjia clapped his hands in delight, “How extraordinary! At home I heard that our old patriarch had a beloved son called Baoyu—sharing the same name with your little one. I thought it was mere coincidence, but to see you now, not only does he bear the same name, but he even looks and acts just like you—it is truly marvelous.” After asking his age, he noted that “he is but a year younger than the others here.” Jia Zheng then recalled the matter of recommending Bao Yong and mentioned the curious coincidence of the name. Yingjia, clearly taken with Baoyu, could not spare a word about Bao Yong; he only showered praise, “Truly remarkable!” He then took Baoyu’s hand in a most attentive manner. Fearing that the Duke of Anguo might depart very swiftly and that he must prepare for his long journey, Yingjia reluctantly bid farewell and walked slowly out. Jia Lian and Baoyu saw him off, and along the way Baoyu was peppered with questions about his welfare before finally boarding the carriage. Later, upon returning and meeting Jia Zheng, Jia Lian recounted all that Yingjia had inquired. Jia Zheng then dismissed the two and set about finalizing the accounts for Fengjie’s funeral.

Returning to his own room, Baoyu confided in Baochai: “I’ve always heard talk of that Zhen Baoyu—I never thought I’d meet him. But today I met his father instead. I even heard that Baoyu is soon to come to the capital and will pay a visit to our master. He claims to be exactly like me—but I find that hard to believe. If his son later comes to see us, you all must look and see for yourselves whether he indeed bears any resemblance to me!”
Baochai scolded, “Oh, for goodness’ sake—your words have become even more nonsensical. How can you claim that every man is just like you, and then ask us to go and check?”
Realizing he had misspoken, Baoyu’s face flushed scarlet and he stammered, “I—I didn’t mean it that way…”

And with that, many matters remained unsaid. (To be continued in the next chapter.)
Chapter 115
Misguided by Bias, Xi Chun Vows Her True Intent; In Kind, Baoyu Finds No True Confidant

It happened that Baoyu, chagrined by his own slip of the tongue and being reproved by Baochai, sought to cover his past misstep. At that moment, Qiu Tong entered and announced, “Outside, the master is calling for Second Master!” Baoyu, eager to escape the conversation, quickly excused himself and went off.

When he arrived before Jia Zheng, his father said, “I have summoned you for a reason. Now that you are dressed in mourning garments, you cannot go to school; you must stay at home and review the compositions you have learned. I have some leisure these days, and in a couple or three days I shall ask you to compose a few pieces for me to examine, so I can see if you have improved.” Baoyu had no choice but to agree. Jia Zheng added, “I have also sent your brothers Huan and Lan to review their lessons. If your essays do not measure up to theirs, then it will be a serious matter.” Daunted, Baoyu could only reply a timid “Yes,” standing unmoving. “Off you go then,” his father ordered. Baoyu left promptly and, just then, Lai Da and several others entered carrying some registers; Baoyu dashed back to his own room. When Baochai inquired, she was pleased to learn he was to compose essays—even though Baoyu himself was reluctant, he dared not refuse.

Just as he was about to sit down and clear his mind, two women from the Dizang Monastery entered. Seeing Baochai, they said, “Please accept our respects, Second Madame.” Baochai, somewhat cool in manner, replied, “Greetings.” Then she called for someone to bring tea for their “Masters” (i.e. the monastic elders). Baoyu had intended to speak with the visitors, but noticing Baochai’s evident reluctance to engage with them, he refrained. Recognizing that Baochai was naturally aloof, the two soon excused themselves with a promise to depart. Baochai then said, “Do sit a while longer.” The visitors replied, “We have come to pay our respects since our merit at Tiekan Temple has earned us some good karma—and it has been a long time since we visited the mistresses here. Today, having seen you, we still wish to see Fourth Young Lady as well.” Baochai nodded and let them be. The visitors then went off to see Xi Chun. When they arrived, they inquired about “Cai Ping” (a maidservant’s name) by asking, “Where is the young lady?” Cai Ping answered, “There is no need to mention her. For days now, she hasn’t eaten; she has merely been sulking.” The visitor asked, “Why is that?” Cai Ping replied, “It is a long story. If you meet the young lady, she may explain it to you.”

Xi Chun, who had already overheard the conversation, hurriedly sat up and said, “You two are too kind—if our family matters become unsatisfactory, why would you come?” One of the visitors replied, “Amitābha! Whether one has merit or not, do not forget that we are from the original Dizang Monastery and have received so many favors from the late old lady. Now that the old lady is gone, all the mistresses here have come to pay their respects except for the young lady. Our hearts are concerned—and that is why we have come especially today to see you.”

Xi Chun then inquired about the nuns from Shuiyue Monastery. One of them said, “There has been some trouble at that temple lately; they no longer open the gate as freely as before.” She then asked Xi Chun, “I heard the other day that Master Miaoyu from Longcui Monastery left with someone—what is that about?”

Xi Chun replied, “Where did you hear that? Such talk is utter nonsense, uttered by those who would slice one’s tongue! How could he be spoken of so badly when he was seized by bandits?”

The nun said, “Master Miaoyu has always been a strange fellow—perhaps it is merely false piety on his part? In your presence, we cannot speak frankly. You see, we simple folk only know to recite sutras and chant the Buddha’s name, to repent on behalf of others and earn merit for ourselves.”

Xi Chun asked, “What do you mean by earning merit?”

The nun explained, “Apart from families like ours—whose virtuous deeds are secure—even those illustrious ladies of official rank may not preserve their splendor for a lifetime. When calamity strikes, they cannot be saved. Only the Great Compassionate Guanyin, with her boundless mercy, will be moved by a person’s suffering and devise a way to deliver them. That is why they say, ‘Guanyin, the Great Compassionate, saves the suffering and rescues those in distress.’ Though we practitioners may endure far more hardships than those ladies, we at least face no mortal peril. We may not attain Buddhahood or become revered ancestors, but through diligent cultivation—or even by being reborn as a man in the next life—we may find solace. Unlike those born as women, who cannot speak of their grievances, you, young lady, still do not understand. If you were to leave home, bound always to serve another, your lot would be even worse. As for cultivation, it is only worthwhile if pursued sincerely. Master Miaoyu, with talents far surpassing ours, looked down on us as vulgar folk—but who would have thought that his vulgarity would earn him good karma in the end? Alas, he has now suffered a great calamity.”

Xi Chun was so moved by the nun’s words that she gathered her thoughts. Disregarding the presence of the maidservants, she then related to the nun how Mistress You had treated her the other day and recounted the household matter, even showing her hair as evidence, saying, “Do you think I am some thoughtless woman, hopelessly enamored of fire pits? I have long harbored such feelings, only unable to find a way out.” The nun, feigning alarm, cried, “Please, young lady, do not say such things! If Madame Zhen hears, she will scold us to death and expel us from the monastery!” Then she added, “With your character and conduct, you will someday find a fine husband and enjoy a lifetime of honor and wealth.”

Before Xi Chun could finish, her face flushed red as she retorted, “If Madame Zhen expels you, does that mean I cannot be expelled?” The nun, realizing her sincerity, gently teased her further, “Please forgive our clumsy words. The mistresses here are quite accustomed to your temperament; it would be unseemly if things were to escalate into a fuss. We merely speak as our hearts prompt.” Xi Chun replied coolly, “We’ll see about that.”

At that moment, Cai Ping, fearing that the conversation might lead to further trouble, quietly went to report to Mistress You, saying, “Fourth Young Lady still harbors the thought of cutting her hair, it seems. She is not ill these days—rather, she is burdened by a sense of doomed fate. Mistress, please be cautious so that we do not all end up blamed.” Mistress You responded, “She does not wish to become a nun out of true desire; it is simply that her elder brother is absent and she feels aggrieved with me. There is nothing we can do but let it be.” Cai Ping and the others, at a loss, could only continue to offer gentle counsel. Yet day by day, Xi Chun ate less and grew more intent on cutting her hair. Cai Ping, unable to contain her concern, reported the matter to everyone. Even the Second Mistresses of the Xing and Wang households tried to persuade her on several occasions, but Xi Chun remained obstinate.

Meanwhile, as the time came for the formal end of mourning, Mistress Wang herself went to see Baochai, and noticing that Baoyu looked distraught and scattered, she called Xi Ren aside and said, “You all are so inattentive! Second Master is unwell, yet he does not return to me.”

Xi Ren explained, “Second Master’s illness has been recurring—some days he is better, some days worse. He still goes to greet the madam every day; it is only today that he appears confused. Second Madame was just on her way back to see the madam—fearful that she might be taken aback by our excessive display.”

Baoyu, upon hearing Mistress Wang’s remarks, suddenly understood. Worried that they might be blamed, he said, “Madam, rest assured—I am not seriously ill; I just feel rather gloomy inside.”

Mistress Wang replied, “You indeed have the root of an ailment. You should have told me sooner so we could have the doctor examine you and administer some medicine. If your condition worsens to the point where you lose your precious ‘jade’ appearance, it will be a great loss.”

Baoyu replied, “If madam is so concerned, send someone to have you examined—I will take my medicine.”

Mistress Wang immediately sent a maid to summon the doctor. For a time, everyone’s attention centered on Baoyu, and the matter of Xi Chun was nearly forgotten. After a delay, the doctor came, examined him, and prescribed medication; Mistress Wang then returned indoors.

A few days later, Baoyu’s condition deteriorated further—he grew so confused that he could not even eat his meals. The household was in a tizzy. At a time when the family was busy with the formal removal of the mourning garments and no one was at home, Jia Yun was called in to attend to the doctor, while Jia Lian’s household, finding no one to manage matters, summoned Wang Ren from outside to help. Meanwhile, Qiao Jie cried day and night for her mother and fell ill herself. Thus, within the Rong Mansion, chaos reigned.

Then, on the day scheduled for the lifting of the mourning period, Mistress Wang personally went to check on Baoyu. Seeing that he was barely conscious and that everyone was at a loss—crying and reporting to Jia Zheng that “the doctor says he refuses to take further medicine; we must prepare for his end”—Jia Zheng sighed repeatedly and, upon examining him himself, found that his condition was indeed dire. He then ordered Jia Lian to make the necessary arrangements. Jia Lian, not daring to defy the order but pressed by financial constraints, was at a loss. Suddenly, a person leaped forward and cried out, “Second Master is in worse shape—and a famine is coming!” Jia Lian, startled by the news, cried, “What is this?” A young servant explained, “A monk has appeared at the gate carrying Second Master’s lost jade, demanding ten thousand in silver as reward.” Jia Lian spat scornfully, “What nonsense is this? Do you not remember the last time? Wasn’t that a sham? And now it’s true—the man is near death, so what need is there for jade?” The servant insisted, “I told you so. That monk says that if we give him the silver, all will be well.”

While they were talking, shouts arose from outside: “That monk is rampaging—he’s darting in everywhere, and no one can stop him!” Jia Lian exclaimed, “Has such a thing ever happened? Hurry and drive him out!” Amid the commotion, Jia Zheng also heard and became perplexed. Inside, people cried, “Second Master is doomed!” Jia Zheng grew ever more anxious. Soon the monk declared, “Bring me the silver at once or he shall perish!”

In that moment, Jia Zheng recalled that once a monk had cured Baoyu’s illness—so perhaps this monk’s appearance might yet be a sign of hope. However, if this jade truly were genuine and the monk demanded silver for it, what would that mean? After mulling it over, he resolved, “For now, let us wait and see—if the man recovers, we shall deal with it then.”

Jia Zheng sent for the monk. The monk entered without ceremony or reply, rushing straight inside. Jia Lian called out, “This is an inner family matter—you, wild fellow, what do you think you are doing?” The monk replied, “It’s now or never—if I’m delayed, there is no hope.” Jia Lian, frantic, ran about exclaiming, “Everyone inside, cease your weeping! The monk is here!” Mistress Wang and the others, still weeping, paid him little heed. Jia Lian rushed in again, shouting. At last, Mistress Wang and the others turned to see a tall monk, who startled them so that they could not even avoid him. The monk strode directly up to Baoyu’s kang. Baochai stepped aside, and Xi Ren, seeing Mistress Wang standing, dared not move. The monk announced in a booming voice, “Dear benefactors, I have come to deliver the jade!” Holding aloft the precious stone he declared, “Now bring forth the silver so that I may work my remedy!” Mistress Wang and the others, alarmed and unsure whether to believe him, managed only to say, “If your art can restore him, the silver is ours to spare.”

The monk laughed heartily and, holding the jade before Baoyu’s ear, called, “Baoyu, Baoyu! Your ‘Baoyu’ has returned!” At those words, Mistress Wang and the others saw Baoyu slowly open his eyes. Xi Ren cried out, “It is done!” Baoyu then inquired, “Where is it?” The monk handed the jade to him. At first, Baoyu clutched it tightly; then gradually he relaxed his grip, held it before his eyes, and, studying it carefully, said, “Ah! I have missed it so dearly.” Everyone present rejoiced in their recitation of the Buddha’s name—so much so that even Baochai paid little attention to the monk now.

Jia Lian came over to take a look and was delighted to see Baoyu recovering. Overcome with joy, he hastily slipped away. The monk, without a word, then rushed to seize Jia Lian by the arm and led him out. Jia Lian had no choice but to follow, and soon he went off to report everything to Jia Zheng. Upon hearing the news, Jia Zheng was pleased; he bowed respectfully to the monk and thanked him. Yet Jia Lian, suspicious in his heart, thought, “Surely he won’t leave without taking the silver!” Jia Zheng scrutinized the monk—he was not the same one they had seen before—and asked, “From which monastery do you come? What is your full monastic name? And where did you obtain this jade? How is it that you can restore a man merely by presenting it?” The monk smiled slightly and replied, “I do not know; all that is required is the payment of ten thousand silver.” Jia Zheng, noting the monk’s brusque manner, dared not offend him and said, “We have the money.”

The monk said, “Then bring it forth quickly—I must be on my way.”

Jia Zheng replied, “Please, have a seat a little longer while I go inside and check.”

“Go on—hurry, please!” the monk urged.

Jia Zheng indeed went inside; before he could say a word, he walked over to Baoyu’s kang. Baoyu, upon seeing his father, tried to sit up but, weakened, could not. Mistress Wang gently pressed him, “Do not move.” Baoyu smiled weakly, and holding out the jade for Jia Zheng to see, said, “Baoyu has returned.” Jia Zheng glanced briefly, recognizing that the jade held some significance, and without examining it closely, he said to Mistress Wang, “It seems Baoyu is better now. And what of the reward in silver?”

Mistress Wang replied, “Give him everything—whatever we can contrive by any means.”

Baoyu interjected, “But what if this monk is not demanding silver for his art?”

Jia Zheng nodded, “I, too, find it rather odd, yet he insists on silver by his every word.”

Mistress Wang said, “Let the master hold onto the funds for now and deal with it later.” Jia Zheng then stepped out.

Baoyu began to cry out that he was hungry and drank a bowl of porridge, even begging for more food. The maidservants indeed brought him some rice, though Mistress Wang hesitated to let him eat. Baoyu insisted, “It does me no harm—I am already feeling better.” He climbed up and ate a bowl; gradually his spirit revived, and he attempted to sit up.

At that moment, Mèi Yuè came forward to gently help him up. Overcome with affection, she, forgetting herself, said, “My dear treasure, barely a short while has passed and you are recovered. How fortunate that your jade was not shattered back then!”

At these words, Baoyu’s expression changed suddenly; he dropped the jade and leaned back heavily.

What fate awaits him now? We shall have to wait for the next chapter to learn the outcome.
Chapter 116
Attaining the Mystical Realm, Comprehending One’s Immortal Fate; Sending the Compassionate Coffin Back Home in the True Spirit of Filial Piety

When Baoyu heard what Mèi Yuè had said, his body suddenly slumped backward as if to die once more. Mistress Wang and the others were stricken with grief and wept without ceasing. Mèi Yuè, realizing that his careless words had caused such calamity, wept bitterly and, in his despair, resolved, “If Baoyu dies, then I shall end my own life and join him.”

(We do not reveal Mèi Yuè’s inner thoughts further here.)

Meanwhile, Mistress Wang and the others, seeing that no one could revive him, hurriedly sent out servants to fetch a monk to treat him. Yet, as Jia Zheng stepped out briefly, he found that the monk had already vanished. Returning inside in astonishment, he then heard commotion again and rushed back in—only to see Baoyu lying just as before, his jaw clenched, with no detectable pulse. Yet when Jia Zheng pressed his hand against Baoyu’s chest, it still felt warm. With no other choice, Jia Zheng urgently summoned another physician and ordered that Baoyu be given medicinal treatment. But little did they know that Baoyu’s soul had already left his body.

You might think that he was truly dead—yet, in a haze, Baoyu found himself drifting toward the front hall. There he encountered the monk who had delivered the jade earlier. The monk bowed and then quickly took hold of Baoyu, leading him away. Following the monk, Baoyu felt as if his body were as light as a leaf, drifting unsteadily. He did not pass through any great gate nor was he sure whither he was being led.

After traveling some distance, they reached a desolate, barren stretch. In the far distance, Baoyu saw a paifang (a traditional archway) bearing an inscription that looked very familiar—as if he had been here before. Just as he was about to question the monk, he noticed a woman approaching in a confused, wavering manner. In his heart Baoyu thought, “In such a lonely, barren place—could there be a beauty like this? Surely she must be a celestial being who has descended to the mortal realm.”

Drawing nearer and examining her closely, he found that she was somewhat recognizable, though he could not immediately place her identity. At that very moment the woman met the monk’s gaze, and in a flash she disappeared. Baoyu, pondering the encounter, thought she resembled Third Concubine You; his confusion deepened: “How is it that she is here?” Before he could ask further, the monk had already pulled him past the paifang. The archway was inscribed with the four large characters “True Like a Blessed Land” and flanked by a couplet that read:

  “False departing, truth arriving surpasses all pretense;
  What appears to be existence is nothing but nonexistence.”

Passing through the arch, Baoyu found himself before a palace gate. Upon the door were also four large characters: “Fortune and Goodness, Calamity and Depravity”, accompanied by another couplet proclaiming:

  “Past and future—do not presume that the wise can shatter them;
  Cause and effect—one must know that close kin may never meet.”

Baoyu looked on and mused, “So it is. I must ask about the matters of cause and effect and the way of return.” Just then he saw Yuanyang (a maid whose affectionate nickname means “Mandarin Duck”) standing by, beckoning him with a wave. Baoyu wondered, “I have walked half a day and never left the garden—how has everything changed so utterly?” Rushing to speak with Yuanyang, he found that in the blink of an eye she had vanished. Filled with doubt, he proceeded to the spot where Yuanyang had stood. There, in its place, was a row of side halls with plaques on every door. Baoyu, disinclined to look at every inscription, made straight for the spot where Yuanyang’s stand had been. He found one of the side hall doors ajar. Not daring to barge in, he hesitated at the threshold and longed to call for the monk; but when he turned around, the monk had already disappeared.

In his bewilderment, Baoyu looked up at the grand, imposing hall before him—clearly nothing like the familiar splendor of the Grand View Garden. He halted and read the plaque above the door, which bore the words “Awakening of Foolish Passions”. Flanking it was a couplet:

  “Joy and sorrow are all but pretense;
  Covetous longing stems solely from foolishness.”

Baoyu nodded in quiet sorrow. Wishing to go inside and ask Yuanyang what this place might be, he recalled that it seemed very familiar. Summoning his courage, he pushed the door open. Inside, however, the hall was shrouded in darkness and Yuanyang was nowhere to be seen. Overcome with fear, he was about to retreat when he noticed a row of a dozen large cabinets with their doors half ajar. Suddenly, a recollection came to him: “In my youth I dreamed that I came to such a place. To now have actually set foot here is a great fortune indeed!” In his daze, his thought of seeking Yuanyang was forgotten, and he boldly opened the largest cabinet. Inside he found several books. His heart lifted with delight as he thought, “They say that dreams are mere illusions—but if I have dreamed it, then it must be real! I once vowed never to dream this dream again; yet today I have found it. But I cannot quite recall whose volume this is...” Reaching out, he took one book labeled “The Official Register of the Twelve Beauties of Jinling”. Cradling it, Baoyu murmured, “I faintly remember this one—but my recollection is vague.” He opened its first page. The top featured a painting, though the brushstrokes were blurred beyond clear recognition. Further down were several lines of writing, their characters faint yet legible enough to be roughly discerned. As he studied them, he noticed on a jade belt there appeared a character resembling “Lin”, and he thought, “Could this be referring to Sister Lin?” He examined it intently. Below, the words “Golden Hairpin in the Snow” appeared, and he was startled: “How could this so resemble her name?” He then re-read the four lines before and after, musing, “It makes little sense—only that the words ‘pity’ and ‘sigh’ seem out of place. How is that to be understood?” At this moment he spat softly, “I’m sneaking a look—if I linger too long, someone may come and catch me.” Hastily he skimmed through the remaining pages of poems. Some verses he grasped at once; others, after contemplation, became clear; yet some remained obscure—he committed them all to memory. As he sighed and studied, he also opened another volume, the “Supplementary Register of Jinling”. When he read the line “How enviable are the fortunate actors; who would have guessed that the young master has no fate?” he was stricken with pain and burst into tears.

Just then he heard a voice calling, “You’re daydreaming again—Sister Lin is calling for you!” It sounded like Yuanyang’s voice, but when he turned around, no one was in sight. Startled and confused, he suddenly saw Yuanyang standing outside the door, beckoning. Overjoyed, Baoyu hurried toward her; yet when he reached the spot, Yuanyang’s form was hazy and elusive—and try as he might, he could not catch up. “Good sister, wait for me!” he cried. But Yuanyang did not reply, continuing on her way. Helplessly, Baoyu strained to follow. Suddenly, he found himself before another wondrous scene: an otherworldly landscape with soaring pavilions and delicate palace corners; in the distance, several palace maidens appeared in shadowy figures. So entranced by the scenery, Baoyu momentarily forgot about Yuanyang.

He stepped through a palace gate into an inner court filled with exotic, unidentifiable blossoms. The only striking feature was a white stone balustrade encircling a small patch of green grass, its leaves tinged with red. “I wonder what this precious little herb is called?” he mused as a gentle breeze set it swaying hypnotically. Though it was merely a slender blade of grass and bore no flowers, its graceful, alluring form stirred his heart and captivated his soul. As Baoyu gazed transfixed, a voice suddenly rang out from nearby: “What foolish mortal are you, spying on the immortal herb!” Startled, Baoyu turned to see a celestial maiden standing before him. He immediately bowed and said, “I was seeking Sister Yuanyang. I seem to have mistakenly entered this immortal realm. Forgive my intrusion. May I ask, O divine sister, where is this place? And why is it that Sister Yuanyang is here? I was told by Sister Lin that I should come—please, enlighten me.”

The celestial maiden replied, “Who says you have any sister or close kin here? I am the guardian of the immortal herb; no mortal is permitted to linger.”

Baoyu hesitated, torn between leaving and his burning desire to ask further. “If you are the guardian of this herb, you must be the Flower Goddess herself. Pray, tell me, what virtue does this herb possess?”

She answered, “You must understand—the tale of this herb is long. Once, upon the banks of the Spirit River, there grew a plant known as ‘Jiangzhu Grass’. In its time of decay, it was nurtured by a divine attendant who daily watered it with ambrosial dew, thus granting it immortality. Later, having descended to the mortal realm to undergo trials, it repaid that kindness by returning to its true state. Hence, Fairy Jinghuan commanded that I guard it, that no earthly creature be seduced by its charm.”

Baoyu, though still puzzled, was convinced he had encountered the Flower Goddess. Determined not to let this chance slip away, he asked, “You who guard the herb—surely many wondrous flowers are here, each under the care of a divine mistress. May I ask, which goddess watches over the lotus blossoms?”

The celestial maiden replied, “I know not; only my master, Fang Xiao, tends to them.”

Baoyu pressed further, “Who is your master?”

She answered, “My master is the Xiāoxiāng Consort.”

At these words Baoyu’s heart leapt. “Of course! You must not know—the consort is none other than my cousin Lin Daiyu.”

The celestial maiden retorted sharply, “Nonsense! This realm belongs to the goddesses of the Upper World. Though one may be titled ‘Xiāoxiāng Consort,’ she is not of the rank of Ehuang or Nüying; what mortal business would you have with her? Cease your idle chatter, or you’ll have a strongman escort you out!”

Baoyu was dumbfounded, suddenly feeling his own unworthiness. Just as he was about to withdraw, he heard voices calling from within: “Come in, we are calling for the Divine Attendant of Shenying!” A servant said, “I have waited long for the Divine Attendant, but he has not yet arrived. Whom should I summon?” Another laughed, “Didn’t you just leave?” In a flurry, a maid rushed out saying, “Please, call back the Divine Attendant of Shenying!”

Wary of being pursued for his intrusion, Baoyu scrambled to escape. As he made his way out, a man carrying a broadsword suddenly stepped forward and blocked his path, shouting, “Where do you think you’re going?”

Terrified, Baoyu lifted his eyes and saw that it was none other than Third Concubine You. Recovering slightly, Baoyu pleaded, “Sister, why must you pursue me so?”

She replied coldly, “None of your brothers is a good man! You sully our family’s honor and ruin our matches. Today, having reached this place, I shall not let you off!”

Baoyu, now utterly confused by her words and anxious beyond measure, turned to flee. Suddenly, a voice from behind called, “Sister, stop him! Do not let him escape!”

Third Concubine You declared, “I have long awaited you on behalf of the Consort. Today, upon meeting you, I will sever your worldly ties with one swift stroke!”

Baoyu, even more frantic and unable to grasp the meaning of these words, could only turn and run.

But then, from behind, a familiar voice spoke—it was not someone else at all but Qingwen. Overjoyed and distraught in equal measure, Baoyu cried out, “I have lost my way, and now I’m beset by foes! I long for you, Sister Qingwen—please, take me back home!”

Qingwen answered, “There’s no need for doubt. I am not truly Qingwen; I have been sent by the Consort to summon you for a brief while. I mean you no harm.”

Still full of suspicion, Baoyu asked, “You say the Consort sent you—then who is this consort?”

Qingwen replied, “That need not be revealed now; you shall know when we arrive.”

Having no choice, Baoyu reluctantly followed her. Observing her every movement, he noted that her appearance and voice were unmistakably Qingwen’s. “But she insists otherwise… my mind is muddled. I shall wait until we reach our destination—then I shall ask her properly. Women’s hearts are so compassionate; surely they will forgive my clumsiness,” he reasoned.

Before long, they arrived at a wondrous place. Before him rose a palace of exquisite design, resplendent in vibrant colors; within the courtyard grew clusters of verdant trees, and outside, ancient pines loomed. Beneath the eaves, several palace maids in full regalia watched as Baoyu entered, whispering among themselves, “Is this the Divine Attendant of Shenying?” One of them beckoned him, “Yes—hurry in and announce your arrival.”

A maid smiled and led Baoyu inside. Passing through several rooms, he finally came upon the main hall, behind heavy pearl curtains. “Please wait for the edict,” said a maid. Baoyu dared not speak and so quietly waited outside. After a short time the maid returned, announcing, “The attendant requests your presence.” Another servant lifted the pearl curtain.

Inside, seated gracefully was a woman wearing a floral crown and embroidered robes. When Baoyu caught sight of her delicate features, they resembled those of Daiyu, and he could not help exclaiming, “My dear sister is here—I miss her so!”

But a maid outside scolded, “That attendant is being rude—please step aside!” Before he could say more, another servant lowered the curtain. At that moment, Baoyu longed to go in but, uncertain and timid, he hesitated. When he tried to ask, the maidens did not recognize him and drove him out. Distraught, he searched about for Qingwen, but she was nowhere to be seen. Suspicious and forlorn, he stepped out, intending to retrace his steps—but he could not find the way back to his former path.

In his distress, he noticed Mistress Feng standing beneath a eave, beckoning him. Overjoyed, Baoyu cried, “At last, I have returned to my own home! Why have I become so lost and confused?” Rushing toward her, he called, “Sister, are you here? I have been toyed with by these people, and Sister Lin Daiyu refuses to see me—what is the reason?”

But as he drew near, he realized that the woman he saw was not Mistress Feng at all—it was Qin, the former wife of Jia Rong. Baoyu stopped, uncertain, and tried to ask, “Where is Sister Feng?” Yet Qin said nothing and instead went quietly into a room. Baoyu, in his confused state, dared not follow her and stood frozen, murmuring, “What misfortune has befallen me? No one cares for me!” Overcome with despair, he burst into tears.

Soon a few strong men in yellow turbans and wielding whips arrived, shouting, “Who is this man who dares trespass into our celestial blessed land? Leave at once!” Terrified, Baoyu dared not reply. As he searched desperately for an exit, he saw in the distance a group of women laughing and chattering. At first he thought they might be Yingchun and the others, and his heart lightened; he cried out, “I am lost—please, come and rescue me!” But as he shouted, the strongmen closed in, and Baoyu began to run erratically. Suddenly, the group of women transformed into ghastly apparitions and pursued him.

In his desperate plight, Baoyu suddenly saw the monk who had earlier delivered the jade reappear. In his hand he held a mirror which he waved, and he proclaimed, “I have come under the orders of the Former Consort to rescue you!” Instantly, the ghastly shapes vanished, and the barren wilderness reappeared. Grasping the monk’s arm, Baoyu said, “I recall that you once brought me here—and then you disappeared. I saw many of my kinsmen here who did not acknowledge me, and then they transformed into specters. Tell me, is this dream real or not? Please, master, explain.”

The monk inquired sternly, “Before coming here, did you secretly view any documents or registers?”

After a pause, Baoyu admitted, “Indeed, I saw several books.”

The monk replied, “Then you understand. The bonds of mortal love are but illusions—if you record in detail the events you have experienced, someday I shall explain everything to you.” With that, he gave Baoyu a firm push and ordered, “Return at once!”

Unable to withstand the force, Baoyu tumbled and cried, “Ouch!”

As everyone wept at his fall, they soon heard Baoyu stir and call out. Opening his eyes, he found himself once again lying on the kang, surrounded by the tear-stained faces of Mistress Wang, Baochai, and the others. Collecting his senses, he thought, “Yes, I have truly come back from death.” Slowly, he recalled every episode of his strange journey, and a soft laugh escaped him as he murmured, “It is so, it is so.” Mistress Wang, believing it to be merely a relapse of his old malady, ordered that his treatment be continued and sent a maid to inform Jia Zheng: “Baoyu has returned! His heart was lost in confusion, but now he speaks—there is no need to prepare his funeral.”

When Jia Zheng heard this, he hurried in to examine him. Seeing that Baoyu was now revived, he said, “My unfortunate, foolish child—do you intend to scare everyone to death?” Tears welled in his eyes as he sighed deeply, then went out to call for further physicians to check his pulse and adjust his medication.

At that very moment, Mèi Yuè, who had been contemplating suicide, relaxed at the sight of Baoyu’s return. Mistress Wang then ordered that a bowl of longan soup be brought for him; after sipping a few mouthfuls, Baoyu’s spirit gradually steadied. Reassured, Mistress Wang no longer mentioned Mèi Yuè and instead had the jade returned to Baochai so that it might be worn again.

Recalling the strange monk—“Where did that jade come from? It is so mysterious: at times he demands silver, and then it vanishes. Could it be that he is not a true immortal?” Baochai remarked, “Considering the monk’s comings and goings, that jade was not simply found—it must have been taken by the monk when it was lost.”

Mistress Wang protested, “But the jade was in our home—how could it be taken away?”

Baochai replied, “Wherever it can be sent, it can also be taken.”

Xi Ren and Mèi Yuè then recalled, “That year when the jade was lost, Master Lin measured an inscription. Later, when Second Madame passed through the door, I even told her that the character measured was the ‘reward’ character. Do you remember, Second Madame?”

Baochai mused, “Yes indeed. You mentioned that it was found in the pawnshop. Now I see clearly—it was the monk’s ‘shang’ character on it, indicating that the monk took it away!”

Mistress Wang exclaimed, “That monk has always been peculiar! When Baoyu was ill that year, he claimed that our family possessed a treasure that could cure him—referring to this very jade. Since he knew its origin, it is no wonder that this jade is so mysterious. Moreover, your betrothed, from time immemorial, has always carried it in his mouth. Have you ever heard of a second one like it? But we still do not know what will ultimately become of this jade. It was both the cause of his illness and his cure, his life and his fate.” At these words she suddenly fell silent and tears streamed down her face. Baoyu, listening, understood all too well—and his own desire for death grew ever stronger. Yet he said nothing, inwardly recording every detail.

At that time, Xi Chun remarked, “When the jade was lost that year, Miaoyu once invoked the immortal realm, saying, ‘Under the ancient pine at the foot of Qinggeng Peak’—and something like ‘Enter my gate and smile in passing.’ The phrase ‘enter my gate’ is of great import. In the Buddhist path, the greatest secret is that Second Brother might never be able to enter it.”

Baowang snorted coldly. Baochai frowned deeply, lost in thought. Mistress You interjected, “Now you are once again speaking of Buddhism—have you still not abandoned your wish to become a monk?”

Xi Chun laughed, “I confess, I have long since forsaken worldly pleasures.”

Mistress Wang said, “Good child, Amitābha—such thoughts must not arise!”

Xi Chun fell silent. Baoyu, recalling verses about “the ancient lamp beside the Buddha,” sighed repeatedly. Suddenly, he remembered a verse about a bedding and a flower; gazing at Xi Ren, tears welled in his eyes. Everyone present saw him oscillate between laughter and weeping, and none could fathom his meaning. They assumed it was merely a relapse of his old malady. Little did they know that Baoyu had, in his trance-like state, committed every verse from the register to memory—even forming a fixed impression in his heart that he kept silently for himself.

In time, those around him saw that Baoyu had truly recovered—day by day, with the continued administration of his medicine, his condition steadily improved. Meanwhile, Jia Zheng, seeing that Baoyu was now well, and with his period of mourning (dingyou) coming to an end, recalled that Jia She had been granted a pardon long ago and that the late old lady’s coffin had long remained in the temple. Unsettled, he decided he must escort the coffin to South An for proper burial. He called upon Jia Lian to discuss the matter.

Jia Lian said, “Father, your plan is excellent. Now, while you are still in mourning, it is the best time to settle this great matter. Later, when you resume official duties, you may not have another chance. But since our father is no longer at home and we dare not act beyond our station, it will cost several thousand silver coins. Recovering misappropriated funds from the authorities is nearly impossible.”

Jia Zheng replied, “My decision is made. It is only because our late patriarch is absent that I have called you to discuss the details. You alone must manage things here. There is no one else; I intend to bring along several capable men. Even Rong Ge’s household is to accompany me, for his wife’s coffin is with us. And there is also that of Lin Daiyu, for the old lady’s dying wish was that she be interred with her. I believe that with a few thousand silver coins—borrowed from somewhere—it will be enough.”

Jia Lian remarked, “Alas, nowadays people’s sentiments have grown so cold. Our old master is in mourning; our master is away; it is impossible to borrow such sums at once. We must use our property deeds as collateral.”

Jia Zheng retorted, “But the houses are government-issued—how can they be touched?”

Jia Lian answered, “Houses cannot be disposed of. Outside there are a few that may be liquidated; once our master resumes his duties, they can be redeemed. When our father returns, if he may be employed again, redemption will be easier. Yet, at your advanced age, seeing you labor so strenuously, we are all anxious.”

Jia Zheng said, “The old lady’s matters must be seen through. Just be sure to manage things prudently at home.”

Jia Lian, giving a meek “Yes,” withdrew to arrange for the funds.

Jia Zheng then informed Mistress Wang, instructing her to manage the household while he selected an auspicious day for the funeral procession. Soon, he set off from the ancestral hall. After spending a few days outside the city reciting sutras, he embarked on a boat, accompanied by Lin Zhixiao and others. He did not alert relatives or friends—only his own family, both male and female, accompanied him part of the way before returning.

Because Jia Zheng had ordered Baoyu to take the imperial examinations, Mistress Wang repeatedly urged him and began to test his scholarly lessons. Baochai and Xi Ren often offered gentle encouragement. But though Baoyu’s spirit was improving after his illness, his thoughts had become even more erratic. Not only had he come to disdain the pursuit of fame and official rank, but he also began to view worldly love affairs with marked indifference. Yet few noticed, and Baoyu himself kept his inner thoughts to himself.

One day, coincidentally, Zi Yuan returned with the funeral bier of Lin Daiyu. Sitting alone in his room weeping, Baoyu thought, “Baoyu is so unfeeling—when he saw Sister Lin’s coffin returned, he did not weep; yet here I am crying bitterly, and no one comes to comfort me. In the past, I was seduced by his sweet words. Had I been more open-minded last night, I might have avoided falling for his tricks! It is all so perplexing: now I see him treating Xi Ren with cold indifference. Second Madame was never one for affectionate displays; must it be that Mèi Yuè and the others do not care for him? It seems that the girls, though so devoted, have wasted their hearts away—and I wonder what fate awaits them!”

Just then, Wu’er came by to see him. Noticing Zi Yuan’s tear-streaked face, she said, “Sister, are you weeping again for Sister Lin? I always believed that to see is better than to hear. I was told that Second Master favors having girls about him. My mother fussed so much to get me in here. Yet now, after faithfully serving during your illness, you have recovered and not a kind word remains—and now you refuse even to look at us properly?”

Zi Yuan found his remark so amusing that she burst into a chuckle and spat, “Bah! You little runt—what do you expect Baoyu to do for you? A girl need not be so fretful. In the mansion of the Honorable Master, there are plenty of well-to-do people; does he really have time for you?” Then, laughing, she wiped her face with a finger and asked, “But who exactly do you reckon you are to Baoyu?”

Wu’er, realizing she had spoken out of turn, flushed scarlet and stammered in her attempt to explain—trying to recount how Baoyu had lately spoken uncharitably about others. At that moment, shouts arose from the courtyard: “The monk is here again—demanding that ten thousand silver coins!” Mistress Wang grew anxious and instructed that Jia Lian be told to speak with the monk. But Jia Lian was not at home. Outside, the monk was heard spouting mad words, and Mistress Wang ordered that Second Madame be called over to discuss the matter.

(How they eventually managed to handle that monk, and the fate of the jade, will be explained in the next chapter.)
Chapter 117
Preventing the Extraordinary Beauty from Escaping, Safeguarding the Jade Together; While the Wicked Offspring Rejoice, the Family Alone Bears Its Burden

Mistress Wang sent word for Baochai to come and consult with her. Hearing that a monk was outside, Baoyu rushed off alone toward the front, shouting, “Where is my master?” He called repeatedly but saw no monk, so he went outside. There he saw Li Gui blocking the monk’s entry. Baoyu said, “Madam instructed me to invite my master inside.” At these words, Li Gui released his hold, and the monk, swaying unsteadily, entered. Recognizing that the monk’s appearance was identical to what he had seen at his near-death moment, Baoyu felt he understood what was going on. He stepped forward, bowed, and repeatedly said, “Master, forgive my tardiness in welcoming you.”

The monk replied, “I do not require your hospitality; simply hand over the silver and I will depart.”

Baoyu was taken aback; the man did not seem to possess any genuine spiritual cultivation. Observing his head marked with sores and his body in tatters, Baoyu recalled the saying, “A true man does not show his true appearance, and one who does is no true man.” He thought it best not to miss this chance. “I will pay you silver,” he said, “and then ask you a few questions.”

“But first,” Baoyu continued, “please do not be hasty. My mother is preparing refreshments; please sit and wait a while. May I ask, did you come from that Illusory Void Realm?”

The monk scoffed, “Illusory Void? I come and go as I please. I have come to return your jade. Now tell me, from where did that jade come?”

Caught off guard, Baoyu found himself at a loss for words. The monk laughed and said, “You do not even know your own origins? And now you ask me?”

Though naturally perceptive, Baoyu—having already seen through the worldly illusions—still did not understand his inner self. When the monk inquired about the jade, it struck him like a blow. He replied, “There is no need for silver; I will return the jade to you.”

The monk smiled, “It is indeed time you gave it back.”

Without another word, Baoyu bolted inside his courtyard. Finding that Baochai, Xi Ren, and the others had already gone to Mistress Wang’s side, he hurried to his bed, retrieved the jade, and came out again. On his way he collided with Xi Ren, nearly embracing her by accident. Startled, she exclaimed, “Madam said it would be fine if you sat with the monk. Now that she is planning to give him some silver, why have you returned?”

Baoyu retorted, “Quickly tell madam: there is no need for silver; I will simply return the jade to him.”

Hearing this, Xi Ren grabbed him, protesting, “This cannot be allowed! That jade is your life—if you hand it over, you will fall ill again, and then neither you nor I will survive!”

Baoyu replied, “I am no longer prone to illness. I have made up my mind—what use is that jade?” With that he tried to break free from Xi Ren’s grasp and leave. Xi Ren cried out desperately, “Come back! Listen to me!”

Baoyu turned, “There is nothing more to say.”

Xi Ren, disregarding decorum, ran after him, shouting, “When you lost the jade last time, it nearly cost me my life. Now that you have it again, if you hand it over, we both will perish! You must return it, unless you wish for my death!”

As she spoke, she seized him firmly. Anxious, Baoyu insisted, “You must return it whether you live or die!” He pushed at Xi Ren with all his might, trying to break free, but she clutched his belt and wouldn’t let go, crying and pleading until she collapsed onto the ground.

At that moment, the maids inside rushed over upon hearing the commotion. They saw the distressed expressions on both and heard Xi Ren sobbing, “Quick, inform madam! Second Master is about to return the jade to the monk!” The maid hurriedly ran off to alert Mistress Wang.

Now even more incensed, Baoyu tried to pry Xi Ren’s hands apart with his own. Fortunately, Xi Ren gritted her teeth and refused to let go. Suddenly, Zi Yuan, who had long observed Baoyu’s habitual indifference, forgot all her usual reserve and dashed out to help hold him. Although Baoyu was a man, he struggled fiercely, but the two held him fast. In exasperation he cried, “For the sake of a single piece of jade, you refuse to let go! If I leave on my own, what will become of you?”

At these words, Xi Ren and Zi Yuan began to wail uncontrollably.

Amid the ensuing chaos, Mistress Wang and Baochai hurried in. Seeing the scene, Mistress Wang cried out, “Baoyu, have you lost your mind again?”

Realizing he could no longer free himself, Baoyu managed a forced smile and said, “What is the matter? Must I make mad remarks that distress madam? They always overreact. I told them that the monk is unfeeling—he demands ten thousand silver; if he receives even a little less, I become angry and retrieve the jade, saying it is counterfeit. Once he sees that we do not value the jade, he will leave with only a nominal payment.”

Mistress Wang scolded, “I really must return it to him! Why do you not explain this clearly so that they won’t wail and shout like this?”

Baochai observed, “In a way, it might be better so. For if you do hand the jade over, that peculiar monk might cause more trouble at home; once he gets it, chaos may ensue. As for the silver, if we sacrifice my dowry, it would be more than enough.”

Mistress Wang, after some thought, said, “Very well, let it be so.”

Baoyu said nothing further. Then Baochai stepped forward and took the jade from his hand, saying, “There is no need for you to go out—I will give him the silver on your behalf.”

Baoyu replied, “It is not enough to return the jade; I must see him face to face.”

Yet Xi Ren and the others would not let go of him. Finally, Baochai decisively said, “Let him go. Leave him be.”

Reluctantly, Xi Ren released him.

Baoyu laughed wryly, “You people value jade more than life itself. Since you are letting me go, I will follow the monk. Let us see if you can guard the jade properly afterward!”

Xi Ren, deeply agitated, called to a little maid at the outer gate, “Inform Second Master that he is acting irrationally!” The maid hurried off to deliver the message.

Inside, Mistress Wang and Baochai sat down and questioned Xi Ren about the matter. Xi Ren explained in detail what Baoyu had said. Distraught and uneasy, Mistress Wang and Baochai sent others out to listen to what the monk might be saying. Soon a little maid returned and reported to Mistress Wang, “Second Master is truly behaving irrationally. The young servants outside say that if he is not given the jade, he cannot be calmed; now that he has appeared, he is demanding that the monk take him away.”

Mistress Wang asked, “What exactly did the monk say?”

The maid replied, “He said, ‘I want the jade, not the man.’”

Baochai interjected, “Not even silver?”

The maid answered, “No, nothing was mentioned about silver. Later, the monk and Second Master joked among themselves in such a way that the servants outside could scarcely understand.”

Mistress Wang said, “Foolish fellow—the learned cannot be understood even if one tries to study him!” She then called for the maid, “Bring that young servant inside.” The maid quickly went out and summoned the servant, who stood under the eaves and greeted them through the window.

Mistress Wang asked, “What did you understand of what the monk and Second Master said? Have you learned anything?”

The servant replied, “All we heard were words like ‘Great Wilderness Mountain,’ ‘Qinggeng Peak,’ and phrases such as ‘the Illusory Void Realm’ and ‘severing worldly ties.’”

Mistress Wang, not understanding any of it, and Baochai, her eyes wide with astonishment, were left speechless.

Just then, someone was sent out to fetch Baoyu back in. Moments later, Baoyu entered with a broad smile.

Baochai, still dazed, asked, “What on earth are you babbling about, you lunatic?”

Baoyu replied, “I am speaking honestly—yet they call me mad! The monk, whom I recognized from before, only wished to see me one last time. He never truly wanted silver; he only wished to transform our bond into a benevolent connection. That explains why he departed so lightly. Isn’t that good?”

Mistress Wang, skeptical, peered out the window and asked the young servant. The servant hurried out, returned, and reported, “Indeed, the monk left. He said, ‘Madams, fear not—I require no silver. As long as Second Master visits me from time to time, everything will follow its destined course.’”

Mistress Wang asked, “So he is a good monk! Have you ever asked where he resides?”

The servant replied, “The guard at the door said that Second Master knows where he lives.”

Mistress Wang then asked Baoyu, “Where does he live, exactly?”

Baoyu smiled mischievously, “That place is as distant as it is near, according to how you look at it.”

Before Baochai could continue, she said, “Come to your senses, and do not lose yourself in such delusions! Now, our master and mistress care only for you, and the master has ordered you to pursue learning and advancement.”

Baoyu said, “Am I not speaking of learning? Do you not know that ‘When one becomes a monk, seven ancestors ascend to heaven’?”

Hearing this, Mistress Wang grew pained and said, “What sort of fate is this for our family? One girl after another is always about to become a nun—now another is added to the list! What use is there in these troubled days?” And she burst into loud weeping.

Baochai, seeing Mistress Wang in anguish, stepped forward to console her.

Baoyu laughed and said, “I merely made a jest, and madam took it seriously again.”

Mistress Wang managed to quiet her tears, “Are these words all merely nonsense?”

In the midst of the commotion, a maid came running back saying, “Second Master Lian has returned, his face pale, and he has asked that madam come to speak with him.”

Mistress Wang was startled and said, “Bring him in at once. The young lady is an old family acquaintance; there is no need to avoid her.”

Jia Lian then entered, greeted Mistress Wang, and Baochai went forward to greet him as well. Jia Lian explained, “I have just received a letter from my father stating that he is gravely ill. He ordered me to come at once; if I delay, I fear I shall not be able to see him!” Tears welled in his eyes as he continued, “The letter says it is due to a cold that developed into consumption. The situation is critical, and someone has been sent day and night saying, ‘If we delay even one or two more days, you will not see him again.’ Hence, madam, I must leave immediately. But there is no one to look after the household. Qiang’er and Yun’er, though a bit scatterbrained, are men and can relay messages if needed. My own household is in no turmoil. Qiu Tong has been crying day and night, unwilling to remain here, so I have had her relatives take her away, which has saved Ping’er a great deal of trouble. Even though there is no one to attend to Qiao Jie, at least Ping’er’s heart is kind. My sisters understand, yet their temperaments are even firmer than that of their mother; they always require madam’s guidance.”

His eyes filled with tears as he quickly pulled down a small handkerchief from his waist to wipe them.

Mistress Wang said, “What use have I for you when your grandmother is still here, expecting me to manage affairs?”

Jia Lian replied softly, “Madam, if you were to speak like that, I would be heartlessly beaten to death. There is nothing more to say; please, just know that madam must always care for your nephew!” And, falling to his knees, he pleaded.

Mistress Wang’s eyes filled with tears as she said, “Quickly, get up! Among the women, such talk is unacceptable. He is grown now; if your father makes even a small mistake and delays things, or if a suitable match arises, perhaps it is best that you wait until you return and let madam decide?”

Jia Lian said, “Now that the madams are here, they naturally have the final say. There is no need to wait for me.”

Mistress Wang said, “If you must go, then write a memorial to the Second Old Master, informing him that there is no one at home. Your father is in no condition—please, have the Second Old Master quickly settle the late lady’s affairs so that you may return as soon as possible.”

Jia Lian agreed with a quiet “Yes,” and stepped out to arrange the silver.

He then explained everything to Mistress Wang, instructed her to manage the household, and informed her that he had chosen an auspicious day for the funeral procession. Soon, he left the ancestral hall. After spending a few days outside the city reciting scriptures, he embarked on a boat accompanied by Lin Zhixiao and others. They did not alert relatives or friends; only close family members accompanied them part of the way before returning.

Because Jia Zheng had ordered Baoyu to take the imperial examinations, Mistress Wang repeatedly urged him and began to scrutinize his studies. Baochai and Xi Ren often encouraged him. Yet, despite his physical recovery, Baoyu’s thoughts had become ever more peculiar. Not only had he come to despise the pursuit of fame and office, but he also regarded worldly love affairs with marked indifference. Few noticed, and Baoyu himself kept his inner thoughts to himself.

One day, coincidentally, Zi Yuan returned with Lin Daiyu’s funeral bier. Seated alone in his room, Baoyu wept bitterly, thinking, “Baoyu is so unfeeling—when he saw Sister Lin’s bier returned, he did not shed a tear; yet here I am, crying my heart out, with no one to comfort me. In the past, he used sweet words to coax us. Had I been more open-minded last night, I might not have fallen for his tricks! But it is baffling: now I see him treating Xi Ren so coldly. Second Madame never cared for intimacy; surely Mèi Yuè and the others do not value him? It seems the girls have all wasted their hearts in vain—what fate awaits us in the end?”

At that moment, Wu’er came to see him. Noticing Zi Yuan’s tear-streaked face, she said, “Sister, are you once again crying for Sister Lin? I believe that seeing is better than hearing. I have heard that Second Master prefers having ladies around him. My mother fussed so much to bring me here; yet after faithfully serving during your illness, you now have nothing kind to say—so much so that you even refuse to look at us properly.”

Zi Yuan found his remark so amusing that she burst into a chuckle and spat, “Bah! You little runt, what do you expect Baoyu to do for you? A girl need not be so anxious. In the household of the Honorable Master, there are plenty of people; does he really have time for you?” She then wiped her face with a finger and asked, “But who exactly do you think you are to Baoyu?”

Wu’er, realizing she had spoken out of turn, blushed deeply. Just then, shouts arose from outside: “The monk is here again—demanding that ten thousand silver coins!” Mistress Wang grew anxious and ordered that Jia Lian be told to speak with the monk. But Jia Lian was not at home. Outside, the monk was heard babbling crazily, and Mistress Wang summoned Second Madame to come and discuss the matter.

Before anyone could resolve the situation with the monk, the matter would be continued in the next chapter.
Chapter 118
Accusing the Maternal Uncle of Bullying a Frail Girl; Astonishing Riddles, Wives and Concubines Advise the Foolish

The conversation among the Second Mistresses of the Xing and Wang households turned grave when they listened to a certain account from Mistress You—an account that seemed irreparable. Mistress Wang could only say, “If the young lady chooses the path of virtue, it must be due to a predestined fate from a previous life, and we really cannot stop her. But our girls from a refined family who become nuns rarely achieve success. Now that your sister-in-law has spoken and permitted you to practice, there is one stipulation: you need not shave your head. If your heart is sincere, what does your hair matter? Think of Miaoyu—she practices with her hair intact. I do not understand how her worldly desires suddenly stirred so much trouble. If you are determined, we shall designate the room you reside in as your meditation chamber, and everyone serving you must be instructed accordingly. If he wishes to follow, we will not mention any match; if he does not, we shall devise another plan.”

Xi Chun, having heard this, gathered her tears and gratefully bowed to the Second Mistresses, Li Wan, and Mistress You. Mistress Wang then inquired of Cai Ping and the others, “Who is willing to accompany the young lady on her path?” Cai Ping and the rest replied in unison, “Whoever the madams assign shall be so.”

Mistress Wang, aware that none were eager, began to consider the matter herself. Meanwhile, Xi Ren stood behind Baoyu, convinced that he would soon burst into tears and relapse into his old illness. Yet Baoyu sighed, “It is truly a rare occurrence!” At this, Xi Ren felt even more heartbroken. Although Baochai said nothing, she looked on with silent concern and, seeing his stubbornness, shed secret tears. Just then, Zi Yuan approached and knelt before Mistress Wang, saying, “Earlier, madam inquired about the opinion of the elder sister of Fourth Young Lady—what did you think?” Mistress Wang replied, “How can one force someone to follow? If a girl is willing, she will speak up on her own.” Zi Yuan continued, “When a young lady embarks on the path of cultivation, it is naturally her own decision; it does not mean that the other sisters disagree. I only wish to say that I do not intend to separate the sisters, for each has her own heart. I have served Miss Lin for a time, and you all know well how deeply she treated me—her kindness was as weighty as a mountain, impossible to repay. Had she died, I would have longed to follow her; but since she is not of this world and I have received favor from my mistress’s family, I cannot simply embrace death. Now that Fourth Young Lady is set on the path, I humbly beg the madams to allow me to accompany her and serve her for the rest of my days. Would you grant me this grace?”

Before the Second Mistresses of the Xing and Wang families could answer, Baoyu, upon hearing this, was reminded of Daiyu and felt a surge of heartache; tears welled in his eyes. Just as others were about to question him, he burst into hearty laughter and approached, saying, “I should not have spoken thus. Zi Yuan was assigned by madam to my room, so I dared only to mention it on her behalf—asking madam to approve her service, which I appreciate for her kindness.”

Mistress Wang scolded, “You call your sisters off to marriage and then weep as though you have died! And now, upon seeing Fourth Young Lady set to become a nun, instead of offering advice, you cheer it on—what exactly are you trying to say? I simply do not understand.”

Baoyu replied, “Has Fourth Young Lady truly resolved to pursue the way? If she is truly determined, then allow me to say: if she is not, I dare not speak further.”

Xi Chun interjected, “How comical it is that a man with no fixed mind can so quickly sway the madams! As for me, if I am permitted, it is nothing more than my destined fate; if I am not, I might as well as die—and that would be the end of everything. Now, if you have something to say, please speak.”

Baoyu then said, “This is nothing to reveal—it is already decided.” He continued, “Allow me to recite a poem for you all.”

The assembled retorted, “At a time of such sorrow, you now choose to recite poetry to unsettle us further?”

Baoyu, undeterred, began:

  “The beauty of spring is fleeting;
  In mourning garb, yesterday’s adornments are shed.
  Alas for a noble lady of an illustrious household,
  Who now lies alone by a lone lamp and ancient Buddha.”

Li Wan and Baochai, upon hearing these lines, gasped, “Oh no! Has our son been possessed by demons?” Mistress Wang, nodding in sorrow, then asked, “Baoyu, where did you see this?”

Baoyu, unwilling to elaborate, answered, “Madam, there are places of vision that I have seen.” Mistress Wang mulled over his words, then burst into fresh tears, lamenting, “You claimed earlier it was merely a jest—how do these verses appear suddenly? Never mind; I understand now. What would you have me do? I have no power to intervene; we are all doomed to our own fates when our eyes close.”

Baochai tried to console him, but her heart was torn as if cut by a knife; soon she wept aloud. Xi Ren cried inconsolably as well, while Baoyu neither wept nor consoled—he remained silent. Jia Lan and Jia Huan, hearing this, each withdrew. Li Wan explained at length, “It is simply that, upon seeing that Fourth Young Lady has chosen the path of cultivation, our Second Master felt excruciating pain—so much so that he spouted nonsense without regard for propriety, making it impossible to grant any permission. Only the matter regarding Zi Yuan can be salvaged, to rouse him from his stupor.”

Mistress Wang said, “Whether or not it is granted, a man’s mind is set in stone and cannot be swayed. But what Baoyu said is as fixed as fate!” Zi Yuan, having prostrated herself, received his words. Xi Chun thanked Mistress Wang once more. Zi Yuan then also prostrated before Baoyu and Baochai. Baoyu intoned, “Amitabha! How rare, how rare—it appears you have recovered before I did.”

Baochai, though trying to remain composed, found it hard to restrain herself. Xi Ren, too, would no longer heed Mistress Wang’s authority and burst into tears, exclaiming, “I too wish to accompany Fourth Young Lady on the path!”

Baoyu smiled wryly, “You are kind-hearted indeed, but you cannot share in such an exalted blessing.” Xi Ren cried, “Are you saying then that I am doomed?” At these words, Baoyu felt his heart ache, but could offer no reply.

Soon the morning grew to five before dawn. Baoyu requested that Mistress Wang allow him to rest. Li Wan and the others departed one by one. Cai Ping and the rest temporarily attended Xi Chun until she was later assigned to another household. Zi Yuan, however, remained in constant humble service, never changing her nature. (This, dear reader, is a story for another time.)

Meanwhile, Jia Zheng escorted Grandmother’s funeral bier on the journey south. Along the way, he encountered returning troops and a congested river channel that slowed their progress, causing him great anxiety. Fortuitously, he met officials from the coastal regions and learned that the Commander of Zhenhai had been urgently recalled to the capital. He presumed that Tan Chun would certainly be returning home, which eased some of his worry. However, without any confirmed departure date and faced with mounting expenses, he had no choice but to write a letter and send someone to borrow 500 taels of silver from Lai Shangrong’s office to cover the needs along the route.

After several days, Jia Zheng’s boat had progressed only a dozen or so li when relatives arrived to meet the vessel, presenting Lai Shangrong’s memorial along with 50 taels of silver. Outraged, Jia Zheng ordered, “Return this immediately! Dispatch the original letter back and tell him not to trouble himself.” The messengers, with no alternative, returned to Lai Shangrong’s office. Lai Shangrong, upon receiving the returned letter and silver, was dismayed—aware that the matter had not been handled properly—and added another 100 taels, urging someone to bring it back with pleasing words. Yet the man refused to return with the extra funds and departed. Troubled, Lai Shangrong immediately wrote a letter to his family, informing his father and imploring him to arrange leave so that he might be recalled. In the end, the Lai family, through the intercession of Jia Cang and Jia Yun in Mistress Wang’s presence, obtained permission for his release. Although Jia Cang knew this was a delicate matter, one day he pretended that Mistress Wang was unyielding and returned a reply. The Lai family simultaneously applied for leave and sent someone to Lai Shangrong’s office to inform him to resign on account of illness. Mistress Wang remained unaware of these machinations.

Jia Yun, upon hearing Jia Cang’s fabricated tale, was left perplexed. After losing a considerable sum of silver over several days with no reimbursement, he began borrowing from Jia Huan. Jia Huan, already without a penny (having long squandered the modest savings of Aunt Zhao), wondered how he could possibly help. He recalled how Sister Feng had treated him harshly and, taking advantage of Jia Lian’s absence, decided to use this matter to vent his anger by placing the blame on Jia Yun, deliberately complaining, “You, among all of us without money, dare to discuss matters of silver!” Jia Yun retorted, “Uncle, your words are laughable. We play and frolic together—what money matter is there?” Jia Huan said, “Didn’t someone mention that the outlying family intends to buy a secondary residence? Why don’t you discuss arranging Sister Qiao’s match with Uncle Wang?” Jia Yun, frowning, said, “Uncle, allow me to say something that might anger you: How can an outsider spend money to buy people and then expect to mingle with us?” Jia Huan whispered something into Jia Hui’s ear. Although Jia Yun nodded, he merely dismissed it as childish talk. Just then, Uncle Wang entered and asked, “What are you two discussing? Are you hiding something from me?” Jia Yun quietly repeated what Jia Huan had said. Uncle Wang clapped his hands, “This is indeed a good opportunity—there is silver to be made. I wager you cannot manage it. If you dare to proceed, I, as your maternal uncle, will be the one in charge. If Old Huan mentions it before the madams, I will remind Uncle Xing, and when the madams ask, you all shall agree on the matter.”

After some discussion, Jia Huan and Jia Yun reached an agreement. Uncle Wang then went off to consult with Uncle Xing, while Jia Yun returned to report to the Second Mistress of the Wang household. Uncle Wang promptly found people and visited the mansion of the outlying official. Not knowing the full details, they arranged for an inspection. Jia Yun, when the inspectors arrived, explained, “We concealed the fact that it was a cohabitation arrangement, simply stating it is a match within the Wang household. Once the match is finalized, Grandmother will decide, and with the assurance of our maternal uncle’s backing, there is nothing to fear.” The inspectors agreed. Jia Yun then sent a letter to Uncle Xing’s household and reported back to Mistress Wang. Li Wan, Baochai, and the others, not knowing the full details, considered it a fortunate affair and rejoiced.

That very day, several elegantly attired women arrived. Mistress Xing received them, exchanging pleasantries. Although the visitors knew they came with official mandates, they dared not be remiss. Since Mistress Xing had not yet made a final decision regarding Sister Qiao, she only mentioned that relatives had come to visit and invited the guests to see her. Sister Qiao, still very young and unconcerned with such matters, followed along with her wet nurse. Cai Ping, ever cautious, accompanied them. Two palace attendants, dressed immaculately, upon seeing Sister Qiao, scrutinized her thoroughly, then led her away after a brief inspection, leaving her feeling abashed. Later, back in her room and puzzled, Sister Qiao wondered why there was no proper match; she asked Cai Ping, who, upon noticing the visitors’ origins, guessed, “It must be an arranged match. But since Second Master is absent and the principal madams are in charge, I do not know which family it is. If it were a proper match, they should not even glance at each other. Look at the background of these visitors—they do not seem to be from our branch of the Wang household, but rather follow a different pattern. Let us not tell Sister Qiao yet; let us first inquire further.”

Cai Ping, keeping her wits about her, questioned the servants and soon learned from the gossip outside. Alarmed, she had no idea what to do; though she did not confide in Sister Qiao, she hurried to inform Li Wan and Baochai, imploring them to tell Mistress Wang. Mistress Wang, realizing the gravity of the situation, confided in Mistress Xing. But Mistress Xing, trusting her brothers and Uncle Wang’s account, grew suspicious of Mistress Wang’s intentions, saying, “My dear granddaughter is grown now. With Jia Lian absent, I must take charge of this matter. And if her maternal uncle and my other brother are inquiring, could they possibly be less sincere than others? I am willing—if nothing goes wrong, I shall have no one to complain about.” Mistress Wang, hearing these words, grew secretly angry and, with forced light conversation, went to tell Baochai while shedding tears. Baoyu interjected, “Madam, please do not worry; I believe this match will not come to fruition. It is merely a matter of Sister Qiao’s fate, and madam should not concern yourself with it.” Mistress Wang retorted, “You speak madness! When a match is agreed upon, it must be carried through. If, according to Cai Ping, even your Second Nephew would object, then not only would your own niece suffer, but even relatives from other families would be troubled. Mistress Xing is the one mediating for you—if she approves the match with your Second Uncle, wouldn’t that be ideal? And then, Sister Qin from the Qin family—if she marries into the Mei family, it is said they will be prosperous. Even Sister Shi, which was originally your uncle’s idea, now, with her prospective husband having died of consumption, Sister Shi’s vow to remain a widow would be most unfortunate. If Sister Qiao is mismatched, how can my heart not break?”

At that, Cai Ping went over to see Baochai and inquired after Mistress Xing’s tone. Mistress Wang then recounted what Mistress Xing had said. Cai Ping, after a long moment, fell to her knees and earnestly entreated, “Sister Qiao’s fate ultimately rests with madam! If you heed their words, not only will our young lady suffer for life, but even when Second Master returns, what can be done?” Mistress Wang said, “You are a sensible one; listen to me: Sister Qiao is, after all, the granddaughter of the principal madam. How could I possibly oppose her decision?”

Baoyu consoled, “There is no harm, as long as everything is clear.” Cai Ping, fearing Baoyu might blurt out more foolishness, remained silent and withdrew.

Feeling troubled, Mistress Wang herself was overcome with sorrow. With the help of her maids, she barely managed to return to her own room and lie down, instructing that neither Baoyu nor Baochai be disturbed—she believed that sleep would cure her troubles. Yet her heart remained heavy. When she heard that Aunt Li had arrived, she was too stricken to receive her.

Just then, Jia Lan entered and greeted her. “This morning, Grandfather sent a letter carried by a messenger, brought in by the young ones from outside. My mother received it and was about to come over, but when my own mother arrived, I was told to present it to you first; then my mother will come to see you. She even mentioned that my mother would be coming.” He then presented the letter.

As Mistress Wang accepted the letter, she inquired, “What is the purpose of my mother’s visit?” Jia Lan replied, “I do not know. I heard her say that there was some news from the family of my third aunt’s in-laws.” Mistress Wang recalled that she had earlier spoken with Lord Zhen about Li Qi, and after settling tea, deduced that the Zhen family must be preparing for a wedding, which is why Aunt Li had come to discuss the matter. Nodding, she unwrapped the letter; it read:

  “Due to our triumphant return on the coastal ships, our journey has been delayed. I have heard that Tan has arrived with her husband—have you received word? Earlier, I received word from Nephew Lian that Grandfather’s health is failing, and I do not know if confirmation has been received. The examination date for Baoyu and Lan is near; you must study diligently and not slack off. Grandmother’s coffin remains at home and requires timely handling. My own health is stable; do not worry. This message is for Baoyu and the others to know. Sincerely, on this day. – From Rong’er.”

Mistress Wang, after reading, handed the letter back to Jia Lan, “Take this to your Second Uncle and also give it to your mother.” At that moment, Li Wan and Aunt Li arrived to greet her. After exchanging pleasantries, Mistress Wang explained the Zhen family’s intent to wed Li Qi. The assembly discussed for a while. Li Wan then asked, “Has madam seen Grandfather’s letter?” Mistress Wang replied, “Yes, I have.” Jia Lan then took the letter out for his mother to see. Li Wan remarked, “Our third young lady has been away for years and has not returned. Now that she is coming back to the capital, madam is greatly relieved.” Mistress Wang said, “I was pained in my heart, but seeing that the maid Tan is returning has eased me somewhat. However, I wonder when she shall arrive?” Aunt Li then inquired about Jia Zheng’s progress. Li Wan, looking at Jia Lan, said, “Have you seen? The examination date is near—as if Grandfather is constantly fretting over it. Quickly, take this letter to your Second Uncle.” Aunt Li added, “They have never attended school before—how can they possibly manage the examinations?” Mistress Wang explained, “When Grandfather was in charge of the granary, he arranged for them to attend the junior academy.” Aunt Li nodded.

Jia Lan, clutching the letter, went out to find Baoyu.

Meanwhile, after escorting Mistress Wang away, Baoyu sat down to pore over a chapter from “Autumn Waters.” Baochai emerged from the inner room and, noticing him so absorbed and elated, approached to look. Seeing his state, she felt troubled and thought, “He is treating these lofty, transcendent words as though they were something utterly serious—this cannot last!” Observing him thus, she concluded that no amount of counsel would sway him, and she sat beside him, silently watching. Baoyu, noticing her concern, asked, “What troubles you now?”

Baochai replied, “I think that although you and I are husband and wife, and you are my lifelong support, you have forsaken earthly affection. True wealth and honor are but transient illusions; since ancient times, sages have valued the character of a person over mere worldly gain.”

Baoyu, not letting her finish, set the book aside with a slight smile and said, “As you speak of character, do you not recall that the ancient sages declared that one must never lose one’s childlike heart? And what benefit is there in that childlike heart? It merely denotes a lack of knowledge and restraint. We are born enmeshed in greed, anger, and delusion—like mud we cannot easily escape. Only now have I come to understand the meaning of ‘gatherings and partings in this fleeting life,’ a truth the ancients never warned us about. And if we speak of one’s character, who among us has truly ascended to the primordial state?”

Baochai said, “You speak of the ‘childlike heart’—but the ancient sages regarded loyalty and filial piety as the essence of that heart; it is not about renouncing the world and severing all ties. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Zhou, and Confucius dedicated themselves to saving the people. That childlike heart, in truth, signifies compassion. If you now speak of enduring the abandonment of familial bonds, what logic remains?”

Baoyu nodded and smiled, “Yao and Shun did not force the order of nature, nor did Wu or Zhou force the alignment of the tribes.”

Before Baochai could reply, Xi Ren interjected, “Madam, we do not understand the words of the ancient sages. I only think that those of us who have to labor so hard in Second Master’s household deserve proper recognition. And though Second Master neglects marital matters, he must not disappoint our hearts. Moreover, to speak of the celestial realm is mere fancy—who has ever seen a celestial being come down to the mortal world? And yet, this monk speaks nonsense, and Second Master believes him as truth! Is Second Master’s word more important than that of our esteemed elders?”

Baoyu, hearing this, lowered his head in silence.

Just then, footsteps were heard outside, and through the window a voice asked, “Is Uncle in the room?” Recognizing Jia Lan’s voice, Baoyu rose with a smile, “Come in, please.” Baochai also stood. Jia Lan entered, greeting both Baoyu and Baochai warmly, and inquired about Xi Ren’s wellbeing. After exchanging greetings, he presented the letter for Baoyu to see. Baoyu took the letter and said, “Has our third aunt returned?”

Jia Lan replied, “Grandfather’s letter states so; naturally, she is coming back.” Baoyu nodded silently, lost in thought. Jia Lan then asked, “Uncle has seen it—Grandfather wrote that we must study diligently. I fear that my efforts might result in blank papers?”

Baoyu laughed, “I, too, must compose a few essays to hone my skills, so as to fool the world for the sake of that elusive success.”

Jia Lan said, “Then let us propose a few topics together, so that I might join you in writing. We must not submit blank papers and invite ridicule—not only from others but even from those who judge our uncle!”

Baoyu responded, “You need not worry so much.”

At this point, Baochai ordered Jia Lan to sit. Baoyu remained where he was while Jia Lan settled beside him. As the two discussed literature, their faces lit up with genuine delight. Observing their animated exchange, Baochai quietly withdrew to her room, pondering, “At this moment, perhaps Baoyu has regained some clarity. Yet, his insistence on the phrase ‘henceforth it shall cease’ remains utterly mysterious…”

Baochai hesitated, while Xi Ren, delighted by his literary discourse and his remarks on future prospects, mused, “Amitabha! It is wonderful that he has finally begun discussing the Four Books.” At that moment, Baoyu and Jia Lan recited their compositions while Ying’er came to serve tea. Later, Jia Lan rose to present further rules regarding the examinations and even invited Zhen Baoyu to share his thoughts; Baoyu seemed agreeable.

After some time, Jia Lan departed, leaving the letter with Baoyu. Baoyu, smiling broadly as he read the letter, then walked in to hand it over to Mèi Yuè for safekeeping, and afterward went to put away his copy of the “Zhuangzi.” He gathered a few of his favorite works—such as the “Can Tong Qi,” “Yuan Ming Bao,” “Wu Deng Hui Yuan,” and others—and asked Mèi Yuè, Qiu Tong, and Ying’er to set them aside in a quiet study. Observing this, Baochai found his actions most unusual and teasingly asked, “If you have no intention of reading them, why bother moving them?”

Baoyu replied, “Now I understand—they are of little value. I intend to burn them completely, so as to purify my mind.” Baochai, hearing this, was exceedingly pleased. Baoyu then softly murmured, “Within the classic texts, there is no buddha nature; beyond the method of the Golden Elixir, there exists an immortal vessel.” Baochai caught only the words “no buddha nature” and “immortal vessel,” and felt a surge of suspicion, wondering what he might do next.

Baoyu then ordered Mèi Yuè, Qiu Tong, and the others to prepare a quiet room, in which he laid out various aphorisms, compilations of famous passages, and the poems he had composed for official examinations. He resolved to practice his cultivation in earnest. Only then did Baochai feel relieved.

Xi Ren, having witnessed such unprecedented sights, quietly laughed and said to Baochai, “Madam, you speak so clearly! In one fell swoop, you have managed to set Second Master straight. It is only a pity that it came too late, right at the moment of crisis.” Baochai nodded with a slight smile, “Success in the imperial examinations is predestined; whether one succeeds or not does not depend solely on one’s efforts. I only hope that from now on he will wholeheartedly embrace the righteous path and never again be tainted by those wicked influences.”

At that, seeing no one else in the room, she whispered, “Though this newfound resolve is most commendable, I fear it might revive his old affliction when he deals with the maidens. What do you think, dear?”

Baochai replied, “I share your concern. Ever since he put his faith in that monk, he has grown cold toward his sisters; but if he now loses that faith, I worry he will relapse into his former malady. I fear that neither madam nor I can manage him if he falls back into it. And besides, with Zi Yuan gone, only the four of them remain. Even if Wu’er exhibits a bit of coquettish behavior—she claims that her mother has pleaded with both the Second Mistress and madam to take action—these days she remains here. Mèi Yuè and Qiu Tong may not have much else, but Second Master himself, in his earlier years, was somewhat mischievous. Now, it seems only Ying’er does not pay him much mind; besides, Ying’er is dependable. I intend only to instruct Ying’er to see to tea and water and have the little maids serve, if madam agrees.”

Baochai said, “I, too, am concerned about that. What you say is well taken.”

From that moment on, Baochai assigned Ying’er to oversee the little maids’ service. Meanwhile, Baoyu rarely left his room, and each day he sent someone to greet Mistress Wang. Hearing of his reclusive state, Mistress Wang’s heart swelled with satisfaction.

On the third day of the eighth lunar month—the anniversary of Grandmother’s spirit birthday—Baoyu bowed in the morning, then returned to his study, sitting quietly in meditation. After the meal, Baochai, Xi Ren, and the other sisters followed the Second Mistresses into a front room to exchange idle gossip. Meanwhile, Baoyu remained alone in his quiet room, deeply absorbed in meditation.

Suddenly, Ying’er entered carrying a tray of fruits and melons, announcing, “Madam has sent these to Second Master to eat; they are the auspicious fruits of our late grandmother.”

Baoyu rose to receive them, then sat again and said, “Set them there.” Ying’er, as she set the fruits down, whispered to him, “Madam is praising you.” Baoyu smiled faintly. Ying’er continued, “Madam said that if you apply yourself, you will pass the examination tomorrow and, if you succeed, next year you will become a successful candidate and hold office. Then our master and mistress’s long wait for you will not have been in vain.” Baoyu merely nodded with a smile.

Recalling the words he had once spoken during the days when he played with the string game, Ying’er remarked, “If you succeed, it will truly be a blessing bestowed upon us by our aunt. Do you remember that day in the garden when, while you played the plum blossom game, you said that our aunt later took me to a family of great destiny? Now, Second Master, you appear to be destined!”

Hearing this, Baoyu felt his worldly attachments stir, and he quickly stilled his racing heart, smiling faintly, “According to you, I possess destiny, and you girls, too—but what of you?” Ying’er blushed furiously and, forcing a smile, replied, “We are merely destined to be servants for life; what destiny is there for us?”

Baoyu laughed, “Truly, to be a servant for life is an even greater destiny than ours.” Ying’er, fearing that such words might rekindle Baoyu’s old malady, contemplated leaving. But Baoyu, still smiling, said, “Foolish girl, let me tell you something…”

(What Baoyu said next remains for the next chapter.)
Chapter 119
In the Homeland, the Esteemed Baoyu Breaks Free from Worldly Ties; Under Imperial Grace, the Jia Family Extends Its Legacy

Ying’er, confused by Baoyu’s words and unable to grasp their meaning, was about to leave when Baoyu called after her, “Foolish maid, let me tell you something. Since our young lady is endowed with destiny, if you serve by her side, you too will be blessed. Your sister Xi Ren cannot be relied upon—simply devote yourself wholeheartedly to him, and in time good fortune may come, making your efforts worthwhile.”

Hearing that the first part sounded sensible but the latter part less so, Ying’er replied, “I understand. But remember, the young lady still waits for me. When Second Master calls for fruits, send a little maid to fetch me.”

Baoyu nodded, and Ying’er departed. Soon after, Baochai and Xi Ren returned and retired to their own rooms, and the matter was not mentioned further.

A few days later, the day of the examinations arrived. While others merely hoped that our two gentlemen would compose excellent essays and be successful, Baochai noticed that although Baoyu’s scholarly work was fine, there was in his manner an unusual, detached calm. In light of his imminent appearance at the examination hall, several concerns arose. First, both he and his uncle were making their debut in the public examination, and with the crowds expected, there was worry they might be jostled or even lost in the throng. Secondly, since Baoyu had not left home since his encounter with the monk, despite his diligent study his transformation had been so rapid that it seemed almost unbelievable—fostering fears of further unforeseen calamities.

Thus, on the day before the examination, Xi Ren was dispatched with several little maids, together with Su Yun and others, to ensure that our two young gentlemen were properly prepared. They carefully inspected their attire, making sure everything was in order, and then reported back to Mistress Wang and Li Wan. A decision was made to send extra reliable household managers to accompany them in case the crowded procession caused any mishaps.

The next day, Baoyu and Jia Lan, donning garments that were neither entirely new nor completely old, went happily to see Mistress Wang. She reminded them, “You both are making your debut in the examination field, yet you have never been away from me even for a day. Even if you are not in my presence, you are surrounded by maids and attendants—have you ever spent a night alone? Today, as you enter the examination hall, you will be isolated and without kin, so take care of yourselves. Complete your essays swiftly and return soon, so that your mother and your wives may rest assured.”

Mistress Wang’s words were laced with sorrow. Jia Lan replied in agreement after every sentence. When Baoyu, silent until Mistress Wang finished speaking, approached her on bended knee with tears streaming down his face, he kowtowed three times and said, “Mother, you gave me life and I can never repay you. All I can do is to devote my heart to my essay and, by becoming a successful candidate, earn your favor. Then even if misfortune befalls me, it will all be eclipsed by this achievement.”

Hearing this, Mistress Wang’s heart ached even more as she sobbed, “You have such resolve…if only your late grandmother could see you now!” She wept and clutched him, and Baoyu, remaining on his knees, added, “Whether our grandmother sees me or not, she knows my heart and loves me. Her affection transcends mere appearances—although separated in form, our spiritual bond remains unbroken.”

Li Wan, fearful that Mistress Wang’s sorrow might trigger Baoyu’s recurring ailment and feeling that the mood was ominous, hastened over to say, “Madam, this is a joyous occasion! Why must we be so heartbroken? Moreover, our young gentlemen have shown such filial devotion and are studying diligently. Once they enter the examination hall and complete their essays, our honored guests among the scholarly circles will see their work, and soon your heart shall be at ease.” As she helped Baoyu to his feet, Baoyu turned and bowed to Li Wan, saying, “Sister-in-law, rest assured that we will succeed. In time, Jia Lan will achieve great things, and you, too, will have the honor of wearing the phoenix coronet and radiant robes.”

Li Wan laughed, “May what Uncle said come true, so that we shall not be disappointed...” She trailed off, careful not to further sadden Mistress Wang. Baoyu smiled, “Once we have a good son to carry on the family line, even if I remain unseen, our family’s affairs will be made whole, and all past misfortunes will be covered.” Li Wan, aware that time was short, nodded silently.

At that moment, Baochai listened with a heavy heart. Not only were Baoyu’s words ill-omened, but Mistress Wang’s and Li Wan’s remarks all seemed to portend misfortune. Yet none dared speak up, and only silent tears fell from Baochai’s eyes.

Baoyu then came forward and bowed deeply to Baochai, saying, “Sister, I must depart now. Please remain with madam and await my good news.”

Baochai replied, “It is time—you need not continue your ramblings.”

Baoyu retorted, “Your urging makes me anxious; I know well that I must go!” Noticing that everyone else was present except Xi Chun and Zi Yuan, he added, “Tell Fourth Young Lady and Sister Zi Yuan on my behalf that we shall meet again.”

His words were met with mixed reactions—some found them sensible, others absurd. Most assumed that his behavior was merely a product of the mad ramblings induced by madam’s influence, and they urged him to leave without further ado: “There are people waiting for you outside—if you delay, you will miss your chance!”

Baoyu threw his head back and laughed heartily, “Off I go then! No more foolishness—this is the end!”

While others laughed and urged him on, only Mistress Wang and Baochai remained as if facing a final parting, tears streaming down uncontrollably as if they were parting in sorrowful farewell. Yet Baoyu, with a look of wild abandon and foolish glee, stepped out the door. As he left, a fitting verse rang in our minds:

  “Entering a realm unrivaled in fame and fortune,
  He breaks the first barrier of the gilded cage.”

Not to dwell on the details of Baoyu and Jia Lan’s departure for the examination, we note that Jia Huan, seeing them off, was both angry and resentful. He declared, “I shall take vengeance for Mother! In our household there is no man left—while the madam holds me dear, who else can I rely on?” Convinced of his resolve, he scurried to Mistress Xing’s quarters, offering flattery. Mistress Xing, pleased, remarked, “Now that you have the wisdom, you truly are a sensible child. As for Sister Qiao’s matter—it should have been under my jurisdiction. Yet your brother Jia Lian is hopelessly muddled, allowing our dear grandmother to be deceived by others.”

Jia Huan continued, “I heard from some that only our branch is recognized—if we dare to proceed, I, as your maternal uncle, will be responsible. Should Old Huan speak before the madams, I will remind Uncle Xing, and when they ask, you all must agree.”

After further discussion, Jia Huan and Jia Yun reached an accord. Uncle Wang then went off to consult with Uncle Xing, while Jia Yun returned to report to the Second Mistress of the Wang household. Uncle Wang wasted no time in visiting the mansion of the outlying official, and after a brief inspection, the official agreed that, as the Jia family had long been renowned for their merits, this match was auspicious. Jia Yun then dispatched a letter to Uncle Xing’s household and reported back to Mistress Wang. Li Wan, Baochai, and the others, unaware of the full details, took it as a fortunate event and rejoiced.

That very day, several elegantly attired women arrived. Mistress Xing received them with polite conversation. The visitors, knowing they came on official business, showed no laxity in their manners. Since Mistress Xing had not yet explained matters to Sister Qiao, she merely said that relatives had come to visit and invited them to see her. Being very young and unconcerned with such details, Sister Qiao followed her nurse. Cai Ping, ever vigilant, accompanied them. Two palace attendants, impeccably dressed, upon seeing Sister Qiao, scrutinized her from head to toe before leading her away after a brief inspection, leaving her deeply embarrassed. Later, in her room and perplexed by the lack of any serious match, Sister Qiao inquired of Cai Ping. Cai Ping, having already deduced from the visitors’ origins, whispered, “It must be an arranged match. But since Second Master is absent and the principal madams are in charge, I am not sure which family it is. If it were a truly suitable match, they would not even glance at each other. Look at the stature of these visitors—they do not seem to be from our branch of the Wang household, but rather of an outside order. For now, let us not tell Sister Qiao; we must first learn more.”

Cai Ping, cautious as ever, questioned the servants and soon discovered from the latest gossip that caused her alarm. Although she did not confide in Sister Qiao, she hastened to inform Li Wan and Baochai, urging them to relay the news to Mistress Wang. Mistress Wang, realizing the gravity of the situation, confided in Mistress Xing. Yet Mistress Xing, trusting the words of her brothers and Uncle Wang, grew suspicious of Mistress Wang’s motives, remarking, “My dear granddaughter is grown now. With Jia Lian absent, I must take charge of this match. Besides, if her maternal uncle and my other brother inquire, who could be less sincere? I am willing—if nothing goes wrong, I shall have no cause for complaint.”

Hearing these words, Mistress Wang seethed with anger but maintained a composed facade. She went to Baochai in tears and confided her worries. Baochai, with a heavy heart, replied, “We must act swiftly; we need someone to stop Brother Yun from pursuing this further.” Mistress Wang agreed, but lamented that she could not locate Jia Huan. Baochai assured her, “Madam, you must feign ignorance until I find someone to alert the principal madam. Just wait a little.” Mistress Wang nodded, leaving the matter momentarily unresolved.

Meanwhile, the outlying official originally intended to purchase several household maidservants based on the agent’s account and had sent inspectors. The inspectors, upon returning to report to the provincial prince, were candid about the match. The prince, recognizing that the Jia family were long-standing meritorious relatives, declared, “Remarkable! This matter, if not resolved, could have jeopardized everything. My audience with the emperor is over; we must now choose a date for the match. If anyone comes with further objections, send them away at once!”

That day, as Jia Yun and Uncle Wang delivered the chosen age and auspicious details, a herald at the mansion’s gate announced, “By order of the prince, those who impersonate the daughters of the Jia family shall be apprehended and punished! In these peaceful times, who would dare act so boldly?” This caused Uncle Wang and others to scramble in dismay and disperse, their excitement dampened.

Back at home, Jia Huan awaited word and, upon hearing Mistress Wang’s summons, grew agitated. When Jia Yun returned alone, he hurriedly asked, “Has it been finalized?” Jia Yun stamped his foot and exclaimed, “This is outrageous! I don’t know who leaked the news.” He then recounted his misfortune. Jia Huan, incensed, declared, “I already spoke well of it to the principal madam—but what has become of it? You all have ruined it for me!”

In the midst of their confusion, voices inside cried out for “the Second Mistress and the First Mistress!” Jia Huan and Jia Yun scurried inside. Mistress Wang, furious, shouted, “What have you done? You have driven Sister Qiao and Cai Ping to the brink! Hurry and fetch her body so that we may resolve this!” Both boys fell to their knees. Jia Yun meekly said, “We meant no harm. It was on account of Uncle Wang and the principal madam’s wishes that we arranged a match for Sister Qiao. If the match is refused, then how could we force her?”

Mistress Wang roared, “You speak of arranged marriages as if we are forcing it! Now bring Sister Qiao back to us so that when our master returns, we can settle the matter!” Mistress Xing, unable to utter a word, wept silently. Mistress Wang then berated Jia Huan, “That scoundrel Zhao Yiniang left a bad seed indeed!” Jia Huan replied, “Madam, please spare me—I have my own reasons.”

Soon, Cai Ping returned to Mistress Wang with Sister Qiao, reporting, “Madam, Sister Qiao and Cai Ping are safe.” They explained that the principal madam had ordered them to prepare all of Sister Qiao’s belongings. If any ransom were required, it would be arranged when Second Master returned. Mistress Wang sighed heavily. Cai Ping then reported that Mistress Wang’s plan should be executed; someone would be sent to inform Second Master that he was acting irrationally. Mistress Wang, though troubled, retreated, leaving Baochai to handle further arrangements.

Later that day, news from the outlying official arrived. According to the agent’s account, they intended to buy several maidservants. The agent’s report was forwarded to the provincial prince, who inquired directly. The officials, unwilling to hide the truth, confessed. Upon hearing this, the prince declared, “Inconceivable! This matter has nearly jeopardized the entire affair. Since my audience with the emperor has passed, we must now select a departure date. Should anyone object, send them away immediately!”

That same day, Jia Yun, Uncle Wang, and others delivered the chosen auspicious details. At the mansion’s gate, a herald announced that the family of the Jia household was to be commended for its contributions. This news caused jubilation among the household, though none were aware of Baoyu’s whereabouts.

After several days of anxious waiting, Mistress Wang only hoped that Baoyu and Jia Lan would return. By noon, when they had not yet come back, Mistress Wang, Li Wan, and Baochai dispatched messengers to search. The search yielded no news; neither the messengers nor their informants returned. In the afternoon, as the sun began to set, someone finally arrived—a figure identified as Jia Lan. All rejoiced and asked, “Where is Second Master?” Jia Lan, unable to wait for formal greetings, burst into tears, “Second Master is lost!”

Mistress Wang was struck silent for a long moment, then lay down, overwhelmed by grief. Cai Ping, alarmed, cried out, “You foolish boy! How could you let your uncle be lost when you were together?” Jia Lan explained, “This morning, Second Master finished his examination paper and was waiting for me. We went to submit our papers together, and while at the gate of the examination hall, in the crushing crowd, he was jostled away and vanished. Our people searched everywhere. Li Gui even said, ‘He was only a few steps away—how could he disappear in an instant?’ I have sent men to search, but none have found him, which is why I have returned empty-handed.”

Mistress Wang wept wordlessly, while Baochai, sensing the gravity of the loss, was stricken with sorrow. Xi Ren also wept until her eyes overflowed. Jia Cang and others immediately set out to search for Sister Qiao. It seemed that the Jia family was in utter turmoil—meals had been prepared for the examination, but no one knew what to do with the lost Second Master. Jia Lan, unable to remember the hardships he had endured, now faced yet another crisis. Meanwhile, Mistress Wang chided, “My dear child, can you afford to lose him as well? What will become of you?” Jia Lan replied, “If he is truly lost, then I shall speak up; but if he is found, nothing more need be said.”

Within the household, everyone fretted. Only Xi Chun knew in her heart the truth but dared not speak it. Instead, she asked Baochai, “Did Second Master take the jade with him?” Baochai answered, “It is something he carries always; how could he leave it behind?” Xi Chun fell silent at that, and Xi Ren recalled the incident of the jade’s disappearance—the whole affair appeared to have been orchestrated by that wily monk. She wept bitterly, remembering how Baoyu once treated her with tenderness: “When he was angered, he would swear to become a monk. Who would have thought that his words would now be fulfilled?”

Before long, the time for departure had come. Mistress Wang only hoped that Baoyu and Jia Lan would return soon. By noon they were nowhere to be seen, and Mistress Wang, Li Wan, and Baochai, anxious, sent messengers once more to inquire. With no news, the messengers returned empty-handed, and the household simmered in anxiety like boiling oil.

At dusk, someone arrived—Jia Lan. Everyone rejoiced and asked, “Where is Second Uncle?” Jia Lan, scarcely pausing to greet them, burst into tears, “Second Uncle is lost!” Mistress Wang, hearing this, was stunned into silence, then collapsed onto her bed, nearly overwhelmed by grief. Cai Ping and others rushed to rouse her. Amid sobs, Mistress Wang glared at Jia Lan, “You foolish boy! How could he vanish when you were together?” Jia Lan replied, “I and Second Uncle were always together—eating, sleeping, even at the examination hall we were side by side. This morning, after finishing our papers, we were so tightly pressed at the gate that he vanished. I have searched everywhere.”

Mistress Wang was inconsolable. Baochai’s heart ached, while Xi Ren wept until she could cry no more. Jia Cang and others, without waiting for further orders, set off separately. The Jia family, it seemed, was in a state of disarray, with their feasts prepared for the examination now rendered moot. Jia Lan, feeling the weight of his misfortune, now faced the task of explaining everything to the household, while Mistress Wang consoled him, “My child, if you lose him again, how can I bear it?”

Afterward, Jia Lan went to the gate where several vehicles were gathered. Family members bickered and jostled; Jia Lan, knowing that the arriving car belonged to Sister Qiao, cursed the household for driving her away. He shouted, “You careless brats! Though I am absent, you dare to betray my trust and force Sister Qiao away! Now that she is being sent back, how can you obstruct her when she arrives? Have you some grudge against me?” The family, fearful of Jia Lan’s return, grumbled, “When Second Master departs, it is the decision of Third Master, Mr. Qiang, or Mr. Yun—this is none of our concern.” Jia Lan roared, “You miserable wretches! I will not be deterred—bring the car in immediately!”

Jia Lan stormed in and, noting that Mistress Xing was silent, turned to Mistress Wang, knelt, and said, “Sister, you have returned safely, and it is all thanks to your wisdom. You need not speak of Brother Huan. As for what happened with Sister Yun—he caused chaos when he was in charge of the household, and now after several months I return to find it in such disarray. Let the madam know: if such people are expelled, he will never return!”

Mistress Wang fumed, “How can Uncle Wang’s worthless offspring be so disgraceful!” Jia Lan replied, “Madam, do not worry; I have my reasons.” Just then, Cai Yun’s voice rang out, “Sister, he has arrived!”

Soon, Sister Qiao appeared before Mistress Wang. The painful memories of her escape overwhelmed her, and she wept bitterly. Jia Lan hurriedly thanked Liu Laolao. Mistress Wang then gathered everyone and recounted the events of that day. Jia Lan, seeing Cai Ping, felt deep gratitude, and tears welled in his eyes. From then on he respected Cai Ping even more, vowing that once Jia She returned, he would help set Cai Ping right. (This is a matter for later discussion.)

Meanwhile, Mistress Xing feared that Jia Lan’s failure to locate Sister Qiao might lead to further complications. When she learned that Jia Lan had been seen conversing with Liu Laolao outside the city, she was astounded—knowing that they were up to no good—and complained bitterly to Mistress Wang, “My mother and I are at odds because of this! Who was it that sent the message to Cai Ping?” As she spoke, Sister Qiao was seen with Liu Laolao and Cai Ping, and Mistress Wang followed silently. She first blamed Jia Yun and Uncle Wang, exclaiming, “Our esteemed madams heard that it was all for the sake of good fortune. Who could have imagined it was orchestrated by those miscreants?” Mistress Xing, overcome with guilt, recalled that Mistress Wang’s plan was not at fault, and the two Second Mistresses reconciled internally.

Cai Ping then returned to Mistress Wang with Sister Qiao, and they all exchanged their grievances. Cai Ping added, “With the emperor’s grace, our family shall flourish. Surely Second Master will return.”

At that moment, someone remarked, “Have you seen Xi Ren?!”

Baoyu, noticing it was Jia Lan’s voice through the window, stood up and said, “Come in!” Baochai also rose. Jia Lan entered with a warm smile and greeted both Baoyu and Baochai. After exchanging greetings with Xi Ren, he presented a letter for Baoyu to read. Taking it in hand, Baoyu said, “Has our third aunt returned?”

Jia Lan replied, “Grandfather’s letter confirms her return.” Baoyu nodded thoughtfully. Jia Lan then inquired, “Did our father mention that we must study diligently? I fear my efforts might result in blank essays.”

Baoyu laughed, “I too must compose several pieces to sharpen my skills and secure success.”

Jia Lan continued, “If you agree, then let us propose some topics together, so that I might also join in writing. We must not submit blank papers and invite ridicule—not only will others laugh at us, but they will laugh at our uncle as well.”

Baoyu replied, “You need not worry so much.”

Baochai then ordered Jia Lan to sit down. Baoyu remained where he was, while Jia Lan sat beside him. The two engaged in lively literary discussion, their faces glowing with genuine delight. Seeing this, Baochai quietly withdrew to her room, pondering, “At this moment, perhaps Baoyu has regained some clarity. Yet his fixation on the phrase ‘henceforth it shall cease’ remains inexplicable…”

Baochai hesitated, and Xi Ren, pleased by his literary discourse and the discussion of future prospects, mused, “Amitabha! It is marvelous that he has begun to speak of the Four Books at last.” At that moment, Baoyu and Jia Lan recited their compositions while Ying’er served tea. Later, Jia Lan rose to explain further details regarding the examinations and even invited Zhen Baoyu to contribute his thoughts; Baoyu appeared agreeable.

After some time, Jia Lan departed, leaving the letter with Baoyu. Baoyu, smiling broadly as he read the letter, then went to hand it over to Mèi Yuè for safekeeping. Afterwards, he collected his copy of the “Zhuangzi” along with a few of his favorite texts—the “Can Tong Qi,” “Yuan Ming Bao,” “Wu Deng Hui Yuan,” and others—and had Mèi Yuè, Qiu Tong, and Ying’er store them in a quiet study. Observing this unusual behavior, Baochai teasingly asked, “If you have no intention of reading them, why go through the trouble of moving them?”

Baoyu answered, “I have come to understand their insignificance. I intend to burn them completely, so as to purify my spirit.”

Baochai, upon hearing this, was unexpectedly delighted. Baoyu then softly recited, “Within the inner canon there is no buddha nature; beyond the Golden Elixir there lies an immortal vessel.” Baochai caught only the words “no buddha nature” and “immortal vessel,” and her heart filled with a mixture of intrigue and doubt, awaiting his next move.

Baoyu then commanded Mèi Yuè, Qiu Tong, and the others to prepare a quiet room, where he laid out various aphorisms, renowned passages, and the poems he had composed for the examinations. Resolving to practice his cultivation with earnest sincerity, he settled into deep meditation. Only then did Baochai finally feel at ease.

At that moment, Xi Ren, who had never seen such a spectacle before, quietly laughed as she whispered to Baochai, “Madam, your words are so clear! In one fell swoop, you have managed to set Second Master on the right path. It is only a pity that it came too late—just as the moment was upon us.” Baochai nodded with a slight smile, “Success in the examinations is predestined; whether one succeeds or fails does not depend solely on one’s effort. I only hope that henceforth he will wholeheartedly embrace the righteous path and never again allow those wicked influences to taint him.”

Then, noticing that the room was empty, she whispered, “This newfound resolve is commendable, but I fear it might rekindle his old affliction when he deals with the maidens.” Xi Ren replied, “Madam, you speak truly. Ever since he put his faith in that monk, he has grown cold toward his sisters; if he now abandons that faith, I fear his old ailment may return. I worry that neither you nor I will be able to manage him if that happens. And with Zi Yuan gone, only the four of them remain. Even if Wu’er behaves coquettishly—she claims that her mother has pleaded with both the Second Mistress and madam—things would be intolerable. I plan only to have Ying’er see to tea and water and instruct the little maids, if madam agrees.”

Baochai agreed, “I share your concerns.”

From that day on, Baochai assigned Ying’er to oversee the service of the little maids. Meanwhile, Baoyu rarely left his room, sending someone each day to greet Mistress Wang. Mistress Wang, upon hearing of his reclusive state, felt an indescribable joy.

On the third day of the eighth lunar month—the anniversary of Grandmother’s memorial—Baoyu bowed in the morning and then returned to his quiet room, where he sat in deep meditation. After the meal, Baochai, Xi Ren, and the other sisters gathered in the front room with the Second Mistresses for idle chatter, while Baoyu remained alone in his study, his mind absorbed in meditation.

Suddenly, Ying’er entered with a tray of fruits and melons, announcing, “Madam has sent these for Second Master; they are the auspicious fruits favored by our late grandmother.”

Baoyu rose to accept them, then sat back down and said, “Place them there.” Ying’er, setting the fruits down, whispered to him, “Madam is praising you.” Baoyu smiled faintly. Ying’er continued, “Madam declared that if you apply yourself diligently, you will achieve success tomorrow and, if you do, next year you shall become a successful candidate and hold office. Then our master’s and madam’s long hopes for you will be fulfilled.” Baoyu merely nodded with a slight smile.

Recalling a remark he had once made while playing the string game, Ying’er added, “If you succeed, it will truly be a blessing from our aunt. Do you recall that day in the garden when you said that our aunt later took me to a family of great destiny? Now, Second Master, it appears you are destined indeed!”

Hearing this, Baoyu felt his earthly attachments stir and quickly stilled his beating heart, smiling faintly, “According to you, I possess destiny, and so do you girls—but what of you?” Ying’er blushed furiously and, forcing a smile, replied, “We are destined only to serve as maids for life—what fortune is there in that?”

Baoyu laughed, “Truly, to serve for life is an even greater destiny than what we share.” Ying’er, alarmed that such words might rekindle Baoyu’s old ailment, contemplated leaving. But Baoyu, still smiling, said, “Foolish girl, allow me to explain…”

(What Baoyu said next remains for the next chapter.)
Chapter 120
Zhen Shiyin Expounds on the Feelings of the Void; Jia Yucun Sums Up the Dream of the Red Chamber

It happened that when Baochai heard from Qiuwen that Xiren was unwell, she quickly went in to see for herself, with Qiaojie and Ping’er following along. Arriving at Xiren’s bedside, they found her in deep distress, her heart aching so much that she had a fainting spell. Baochai and the others poured hot water over her and helped her lie back down, while sending for a doctor. Qiaojie, curious, asked Baochai, “What could have caused Sister Xiren to fall so ill?” Baochai replied, “Earlier last night, she wept herself to heartache and, in a sudden fit, lost consciousness. Madam had someone help her back, and she fell asleep. Since there was something urgent outside, no doctor was summoned until now.” Just then the doctor arrived, and Baochai and the others stepped aside. After feeling her pulse, the doctor declared that it was an acute condition brought on by anger and prescribed a remedy before leaving.

It turned out that Xiren had only caught a vague glimpse of a conversation in which it was mentioned that if Baoyu did not return, everyone in the household would be dismissed—and in her distress, her condition worsened. After the doctor’s visit, Qiuwen prepared the medicine for her, and each of them lay there, their minds unsettled. In her half-waking state, it seemed as though Baoyu were standing before her; in a haze he appeared both like a monk holding a book he was leafing through and uttering, “You are not mine; in time, you will belong to another.” Xiren seemed on the verge of replying, but Qiuwen intervened, “The medicine is ready, Sister. Please take it.” When Xiren opened her eyes, she realized it had all been a dream, yet she kept it to herself. After taking the medicine, she pondered deeply, “Baoyu must have joined that monk. The last time he tried to leave with the jade, he appeared intent on escaping. When I grabbed him, he acted strangely—pushing and shoving without the slightest affection. Later, when Second Madam grew tired of him, he showed no emotion even before the other sisters; this is what one must do to attain enlightenment. But if you have reached enlightenment, how could you cast aside Second Madam? I serve Madam because she ordered it. Although the monthly allowance is determined by a strict formula, I have never really accounted for myself before the masters of the household, let alone the people of this inner chamber. If the masters dismiss me and I stubbornly refuse to leave, I would only invite ridicule; yet if I leave, I cannot bear the thought that Baoyu’s feelings for me might be so slight.” Torn by conflicting thoughts and overwhelmed by difficulty, she recalled the dream in which someone said, “You are not mine,” and mused that perhaps it would be better to end it all cleanly. Little did she know that after taking the medicine, her heartache lessened somewhat, though she still found it difficult to lie still and had to force herself to remain upright.

A few days later, as she rose to serve Baochai, Baochai herself, missing Baoyu, wept silently in secret, lamenting her miserable fate. Knowing that his mother intended to make amends with her brother—a task requiring considerable effort—she resolved to help in the arrangements. (We shall leave that matter aside for now.)

Meanwhile, Jia Zheng escorted the ancestral coffin of Grandmother Jia, and Jia Rong saw to it that the coffins for Qin Shi, Fengjie, and Yuanyang were delivered to Jinling for burial. Jia Rong also personally sent Daiyu’s remains for interment. Jia Zheng handled the affairs regarding the graves. One day, upon receiving a family letter, he read line after line about Baoyu and Jia Lan having passed the examinations, which filled his heart with delight; yet later, reading about Baoyu’s disappearance, he was troubled and hastened back. On the way, he heard news of a general amnesty, and when he read further in the letter, he discovered that those guilty had been pardoned and reinstated—a piece of news that lifted his spirits, prompting him to hurry along day and night.

On one day, as he was traveling near the Lingyi Post Station, the day suddenly turned cold and began to snow. They anchored at a quiet spot. Jia Zheng sent his retinue ashore to send letters of farewell to friends, explaining that the boat was to depart immediately and none would be allowed to board. Only a single servant remained on board to attend to him as he sat down to write a family letter, with instructions to have someone depart for home at dawn. As he wrote about Baoyu, he paused. Suddenly, he looked up and noticed a faint figure in the drifting snow at the bow—a man with a bare head and feet, draped in a great red cloak made of orangutan fur, who bowed deeply toward Jia Zheng. Before Jia Zheng could recognize him, he hurriedly stepped off the boat to support the stranger and inquire who he was. The man had already bowed four times and then stood up to announce his greeting. Only then did Jia Zheng, returning the salute, see that the visitor was none other than Baoyu. Startled, Jia Zheng cried out, “Surely you are Baoyu?” The man said nothing, his expression a mix of joy and sorrow. Jia Zheng then asked, “If you are indeed Baoyu, why dress in this manner and come here?” Before Baoyu could reply, two figures—a monk and a Taoist priest—appeared at the bow, seizing him and saying, “Your worldly ties are severed; come quickly.” With those words, the three ascended the shore as if floating away. Jia Zheng, stumbling on the slippery ice, rushed to catch up but could not possibly overtake them; all he could hear were fragments of a song from their lips:

“My dwelling is on the blue ridge’s peak,
My wanderings in the vast, primordial void.
Who shall accompany me on this journey—
I am destined to return to that boundless wilderness!”

As Jia Zheng listened and hurried along, rounding a small slope, the three suddenly vanished. Out of breath and full of uncertainty, he turned back to see his servant arriving shortly after. “Did you see those three just now?” he asked. The servant replied, “I did. I pursued them for you, sir, but afterwards I saw only you and not those three.” Just as Jia Zheng prepared to press on, he found himself confronted by a vast, featureless expanse with no one in sight. Realizing something was amiss, he had no choice but to return.

Back on the boat, the household learned from the boatman that their master had gone ashore in pursuit of two monks and a Taoist priest. They set out into the snowy field to search for him and soon spotted Jia Zheng from afar; they went to meet him and together returned to the boat. Once seated and having caught his breath, Jia Zheng recounted what he had seen of Baoyu. The others, upon hearing his account, resolved to search the area. Jia Zheng sighed, “You do not understand—what I witnessed was not a ghostly apparition. And the song they sang held profound mystery. When Baoyu was born, he came into the world with a jade in his mouth—a most extraordinary omen. I had long suspected that he was an ill-starred child, cherished only because our Grandmother doted on him, which is why he has been nurtured until now. I have seen these monks and Taoist priests three times before: the first time, a monk and a Taoist extolled the virtues of the jade; the second time, when Baoyu was gravely ill, they came, recited passages while holding the jade, and Baoyu recovered; and the third time, when the jade was brought forth in the front hall, in the blink of an eye, it vanished. I was quite astonished, and thought that perhaps Baoyu indeed possessed a mysterious fate, guarded by high monks and immortal Taoists. But little did I know that Baoyu was destined to undergo mortal tribulation—a deception that beguiled our Grandmother for nineteen long years! Only now have I come to understand.” At this point, tears welled in his eyes. One of the company remarked, “Certainly, Second Young Master Baoyu is nothing less than a celestial monk incarnate—it was inevitable he should not have taken the civil service examination. How could one like him, even after success, leave us so?” Jia Zheng replied, “You know nothing of it. In the celestial realm there are stars in the heavens, aged monks in the mountains, and sprites in the caves—each with their own nature. Have you ever seen Baoyu showing any inclination toward studying? With the slightest effort, there is nothing he cannot do. His temperament is entirely his own.” He then sighed several times more. The group went on to discuss Jia Lan’s exam success and the restoration of the family’s fortunes. Jia Zheng resumed writing his letter, including an account of this incident, advising the family not to dwell on the past. Once he finished and sealed the letter, he departed with his family, returning home shortly thereafter. (We shall leave the rest aside for now.)

Meanwhile, Aunt Xue received news of a pardon for her family’s transgressions. She immediately sent Xue Ke to borrow funds from various sources and managed to collect enough silver for redemption. With the approval of the Ministry of Justice, the silver was exchanged, along with a document bearing one-tenth of a piece of writing, and Xue Pan was released. When the family—mother, children, sisters, and brothers—reunited, emotions mingled between sorrow and joy, a scene too elaborate to recount in full. Xue Pan himself swore, “If I ever commit another offense, I shall surely face death by execution or dismemberment!” Seeing this, Aunt Xue clutched his mouth, chiding, “Must you curse so vehemently? Remember all that hardship that Xiangling has endured, and how your wife already took her own life—though we are poor now, at least we have a bowl of rice to share. In my eyes, consider her as your wife. What say you?” Xue Pan nodded in acquiescence. Baochai and the others agreed, though Xiangling’s face flushed scarlet with indignation, exclaiming, “You speak as though you were a nobleman—must it be so?” In the end, everyone referred to her as “Big Madam,” and no one dared to disagree.

Xue Pan then planned to visit the Jia family to offer his thanks, with Aunt Xue and Baochai accompanying him. When they met with everyone, words were exchanged. Just then, on that same day, a messenger from Jia Zheng’s household arrived with a letter announcing, “Master will be arriving soon.” Lady Wang instructed Jia Lan to read the letter aloud. When Jia Lan read the passage in which Jia Zheng himself witnessed Baoyu, everyone burst into tears—and Lady Wang, Baochai, Xiren, and the others wept even more bitterly. The family further explained in the letter that there was no need for mourning, for the incident had been a matter of fate: “Better to have produced an official than to have an ill-fated life, for misfortune in office could bring ruin upon the family. It is far preferable that we produce a Buddhist monk, whose merit would benefit both Master and Madam. Not to speak carelessly, even the old Master of the Eastern Mansion spent over a decade in cultivation without becoming immortal; how much more difficult it is for a Buddhist to achieve enlightenment! Madam, thinking thus, has found solace.” Lady Wang wept as she said to Aunt Xue, “Baoyu abandoned me—I even resent him for that. I lament for the suffering of my daughter-in-law; we were only bound for a year or two, and yet he heartlessly left us!” Aunt Xue, hearing this, was deeply grieved.

Baochai wept so inconsolably that she seemed unaware of her surroundings. All the men were gathered outside. Lady Wang then said, “I have borne the anxiety for him all my life. Just as my son was recently married and passed the examination, only then did I feel hopeful—never did I imagine it would end like this! Had I known, I would never have consented to the marriage, for it ruined an innocent girl.” Aunt Xue replied, “This is fate. What more can be said? Thankfully, with the child in the womb, a grandson is sure to be born, and in time all will be right. Look at Big Madam—now that Jia Lan has passed the exam and is on his way to becoming a jinshi, he will soon hold an official post, and all his past sufferings will be repaid by future sweetness. Our daughter-in-law’s kind heart is known to all; she is neither harsh nor frivolous. There is no need for you to worry.” Lady Wang, comforted by Aunt Xue’s wise words, mused, “Baochai has always been gentle and ascetic since childhood; that is why this has come to pass. In life, one’s fate is predetermined. Though Baochai weeps bitterly, her dignified manner remains unaltered as she counsels me—this is truly rare. Yet, it is lamentable that a man like Baoyu should have no share of worldly blessings!” After a while, her heart felt eased. Then she thought of Xiren, “As for the other maids, their fates are not difficult to resolve—a senior maid can be married out, and the junior maid may serve Second Madam. But what of Xiren? Although she is a servant, she and Baoyu never truly shared a clear path.” Lady Wang said, “I was just about to consult with my younger sister. If we were to send her away, she might not agree and might even resort to self-destruction; but if we keep her, Master may object—what a dilemma!” Aunt Xue replied, “I think our master will not allow her to remain. Besides, he does not know much about Xiren—she is merely a maid. We could have someone from her family come in and firmly instruct her, arrange for her to be married properly, and even provide her with gifts. The girl is kind-hearted and young; if she benefits from Sister’s care, she won’t have suffered in vain. We must gently persuade Xiren—perhaps have someone from her family come without her knowledge. Once her family finds a suitable match with adequate prospects and a groom who is decent, then we can send her away.” Lady Wang agreed, “That is an excellent idea. Otherwise, forcing Master to act rashly might harm yet another person.” Aunt Xue nodded and, after a few more words, took her leave to return to Baochai’s room. There, seeing Xiren’s tear-stained face, Aunt Xue comforted her with gentle analogies. Xiren, naturally an honest and uneloquent soul, replied whenever Aunt Xue spoke, saying, “I am but a servant; it is only because Madam holds me in high regard that she imparts such words to me. I dare not go against Madam’s wishes.” Hearing this, Aunt Xue murmured, “What a meek and obedient child!” feeling ever more fond of her. Baochai then reiterated the profound truth, and everyone found a measure of solace.

A few days later, Jia Zheng returned home, where he was met by the entire household. Upon seeing that Jia She and Jia Zhen had already arrived, with brothers, uncles, and cousins reuniting, they all recounted the events of their time apart. Yet, when the inner family members met, thoughts naturally turned to Baoyu, and sorrow filled their hearts once more. Jia Zheng rebuked them, “This is how things must be! Henceforth, as long as we manage the family affairs outside, and you assist within, we must not be as lax as before. Each branch of the family shall manage its own matters without interfering with the main line. All affairs of our own household must be handled properly.” Lady Wang then mentioned Baochai’s pregnancy, adding, “In the future, all the maidservants will be let go.” Jia Zheng listened and nodded without further comment.

The next day, Jia Zheng entered the inner court to report to the ministers, saying, “We are deeply grateful for Your Grace. Yet before we can settle our affairs, we seek your advice on how best to express our gratitude.” The ministers replied that they would draft a memorial requesting an edict. In due course, with imperial favor abundant, an edict was issued permitting an audience with the Emperor. Jia Zheng went in to thank the Emperor. The Emperor even issued several more edicts, inquiring about Baoyu’s case. Jia Zheng reported everything truthfully. The Emperor, marveling at Baoyu’s clear and extraordinary writings, mused that he must be someone who had transcended mortal life; hence, if he ever entered officialdom, he could be employed. Since Baoyu did not dare to accept an imperial title, the Emperor awarded him the Taoist honorific “Wen Miao Zhenren.” Jia Zheng bowed deeply in thanks and left. Back home, Jia Lian and Jia Zhen gathered around as Jia Zheng recounted the conversation from court. The assembled guests rejoiced. Jia Zhen then said, “The Ningguo Mansion is well-appointed; soon we shall move in and settle matters. The Longcui Nunnery, enclosed within the garden, will be set aside for Fourth Sister’s quiet cultivation.” Jia Zheng said nothing, but after a while he issued instructions to report the heavenly favor.

Jia Lian also mentioned, “The match for Qiaojie has been arranged—both Father and Madam have agreed that she shall be married into the Zhou family.” That very night, having learned of Qiaojie’s circumstances, Jia Zheng remarked, “Let the elders decide. It matters not if the match is with a rustic family—as long as they are virtuous, the child studious and ambitious, he can rise. Are all the officials in the capital not from the city?” Jia Lian agreed, “Yes,” and added, “Now that Father is advanced in years—and still with his lingering phlegm condition—a few years of seclusion are in order; all matters shall depend on the two old masters.” Jia Zheng replied, “The thought of retiring to the countryside appeals to me, though I remain deeply indebted for past favors.” Having finished his report to the court, Jia Lian sent for Old Liu to attend to the matter. When Old Liu met with Lady Wang and the others, he expounded on how, in time, one might rise in rank, build a fortune, and enjoy prosperity for one’s descendants.

As they were speaking, a maid announced, “A lady from Hua Zifang’s household has come to extend her greetings.” Lady Wang inquired a few questions, and the lady from Hua Zifang spoke of a match with the Jiang family of the southern city—a family possessing a house, land, and even a storefront. The prospective son-in-law, though a few years older, had never married, and his character was said to be one in a hundred. Lady Wang, pleased with the news, said, “Please accept this offer. In a few days, come again, and bring your younger sister along.” Lady Wang then had inquiries made, and all responses were favorable. She informed Baochai, who in turn requested Aunt Xue to gently relay the news to Xiren. Xiren, overwhelmed with grief and unable to defy orders, recalled how Baoyu had once declared that even if he went to her household, he would never return; now that Madam was so insistent, if she remained, people might say she was shameless, yet if she left, it would betray her true heart. Unable to contain her sobs, she wept with a choked voice. After much earnest persuasion from Aunt Xue and Baochai, Xiren finally thought, “If I die here, I would only sully Madam’s kindness. I must remain alive at home.” With a heavy heart, she tearfully bid farewell to everyone. The sisters parting ways exchanged words of reluctant sorrow.

Carrying a resolve that she might as well die, Xiren boarded the carriage to return. When she met her brother and sister-in-law, she wept silently, unable to speak her true feelings. The lady from Hua Zifang displayed the Jiang family’s betrothal gifts and showed her the bridal trousseau one by one, saying, “These were bestowed by Madam, and these were prepared for you.” Xiren found it impossible to speak at that moment. After two days, pondering over everything, she thought, “My brother has handled matters well. If I were to die in his home, would I not only bring harm upon him?” Torn by endless thoughts and caught in a dilemma—her tender heart nearly breaking—she could only endure.

That day was the auspicious wedding day. Xiren, who was never a headstrong woman, meekly climbed into the sedan chair, her heart already devising plans for the future. Yet upon arriving at the Jiang household, she found that their arrangements were conducted with utmost seriousness, all in strict accordance with the formalities of a proper marriage. As soon as she entered, the maids and servants all addressed her as “Granny.” At that moment, Xiren wished she could die right there, yet feared that her refusal might offend her hosts and squander their goodwill. That night, though she wept and resisted all attempts to yield, the young master treated her with tender, coaxing affection. The next day, when the dowry was unpacked, the young master noticed a crimson handkerchief—a token that revealed her identity as Baoyu’s maid. Originally, it was only known that she served Grandmother Jia; none would have guessed that it was Xiren. At that moment, Jiang Yuhan, recalling Baoyu’s former affection for her, felt a pang of guilt and made extra efforts to placate her. He even deliberately produced the pine-flower green handkerchief that Baoyu had once exchanged, and upon seeing it, Xiren understood that the man surnamed Jiang was indeed Jiang Yuhan, and that fate had long been preordained. Only then did she pour out her heart. Jiang Yuhan, moved to deep sympathy and respect, dared not impose, and became ever more gentle and considerate, so that Xiren felt as if she had no reason to fear death. Readers, though fate is predetermined and sometimes one is forced by circumstances, the phrase “it cannot be helped” does not cover every nuance—thus it is said that Xiren also earned her second rank in the imperial registry. As an old poem once in the Peach Blossom Temple goes:

In all ages, death is the sole ordeal;
Who but the sorrowful Mrs. Xi can understand?

Needless to say, from that point on Xiren’s life took on a new dimension.

Meanwhile, Jia Yucun, having been implicated in a case of corruption, was convicted but then pardoned by a general amnesty and restored to civilian status. Accompanied by his family and a small servant, and with a small carriage of belongings, he arrived at the ferry crossing known as Jilu Xuan. There he saw a Taoist priest emerging from a thatched hut at the ferry, who came forth to greet him warmly. Recognizing him as Zhen Tuyin, Yucun quickly bowed in courtesy. Tuyin said, “Master Jia, it has been long since we last met. How do you fare?” Jia Yucun replied, “Old Immortal, you are indeed the venerable Mr. Zhen! Why, when we met before, did I fail to recognize you? Later, when the Caoting was burned, I was filled with terror. Today, meeting you again, I am even more awed by your profound virtue. Alas, my own ignorance has led me to this predicament.” Zhen Tuyin responded, “Previously, you held high office—how could a mere priest dare to reckon with you? Yet, because of our old friendship, I offer you these few words, never expecting you to have so thoroughly forsaken me. But the rise and fall of fortune is never accidental; to meet again today is itself a marvel. This place is not far from my humble cottage—please, let us sit and talk. Would that be agreeable?” Yucun gladly accepted the invitation.

The two walked hand in hand, with the servant driving the cart behind them, until they reached a thatched hut. Inside, after seating themselves, a young attendant brought tea. Yucun then inquired about the Taoist’s transcendental journey. With a smile, Zhen Tuyin replied, “In but a moment’s thought, the mundane world is transformed. I have come from the midst of worldly splendor—did you not know that within the realm of wealth and luxury there is a treasure named Baoyu?” Jia Yucun said, “How could I not know? I have heard many rumors that he has retired from the world. In my ignorance, I once met him several times, never expecting that he would be so resolute in his renunciation.” Tuyin said, “Not at all. I foresaw this peculiar fate. Many years ago, before our conversation at the old residence on Renqing Alley, I had already met him once.” Yucun, astonished, asked, “The capital is so far from your humble abode—how could you have met?” Tuyin answered, “Our spiritual kinship runs deep.” Yucun then inquired, “In that case, surely you must know where Baoyu is now?” Tuyin replied, “Baoyu—yes, that Baoyu. In the days before the Rongning confiscations, on the day when the fates of Chai and Dai separated, the jade had already departed this world—for two reasons: first, to avoid calamity; second, to effect a destined match. Thus the predestined bond was severed, and his form returned to oneness. Moreover, with a slight revelation from the divine spirits, it was shown that this jade was indeed a treasure wrought from the very marvels of heaven and earth, incomparable to mortal things. Previously, I had witnessed a Great Master and a True Immortal escorting him down to the mortal realm. Now that his earthly ties are fulfilled, these two have brought him back to his origin—that is the whereabouts of Baoyu.” Though Yucun could not fully understand, he grasped four or five parts of it, nodded, and sighed, “So it is. I did not know. But if Baoyu has such an origin, how could his heart be so enraptured and yet so enlightened? I must ask further.” Tuyin smiled and said, “There is much in this matter that you may not entirely comprehend. The Grand Illusory Realm is truly a blessed land. Through repeated perusals of the scriptures, one gradually comes to understand the eternal way—life’s records unfold before one. When the immortal herb returns to its true nature, is it not natural that it loses its miraculous power?”

Yucun listened, though he did not fully grasp the hidden meanings and sensed that these were matters of divine mystery—he dared not press further. Then he said, “Regarding Baoyu’s affairs, we have now heard of his fate. But among our clan there are so many refined maidens—why should the outcomes of all, from Consort He Yuan downwards, be no different from the ordinary?” Tuyin sighed, “Please do not blame my clumsy words, but noblewomen have always been caught in the snare of predestined passion. Throughout the ages, while the sin of lewdness is unforgivable, even the emotion of love itself is something one must not become entangled with. Thus, whether it be Cui Ying, Su Xiaoxiao, or others, their fates are merely the tragic outcomes of literary talents and unfulfilled hearts. Once one is caught in the tangled webs of love, the ending is all but inevitable.”

Yucun, hearing this, could only stroke his beard and sigh deeply. He then asked, “Pray tell, immortal sir, will the fortunes of the Rongning households eventually be restored to their former glory?” Tuyin replied, “Good fortune and misfortune, virtue and vice—these are the immutable laws of the ages. In the Rongning households today, the good cultivate their destiny while the wicked lament their misdeeds; in time, when orchids and osmanthus bloom together, the family’s fortunes shall be restored—such is the natural order.” After a long pause, Yucun suddenly laughed and said, “Indeed, indeed. I have heard that in that household there is a young man named Lan who has already passed the local examination—aptly corresponding to his name. Just now, you mentioned that ‘orchids and osmanthus bloom together’ and that ‘Baoyu is a distinguished and illustrious talent.’ Could it be that he has an illegitimate son who will one day soar to great heights?” Tuyin smiled faintly and replied, “That is a matter for later; it is not yet time to speak of it.”

Yucun wished to ask more, but when Tuyin remained silent, he bade his men to prepare a meal and invited Yucun to dine with him. After the meal, as Yucun inquired further about his own destiny, Tuyin said, “Please rest a while in my humble abode. I, too, have some earthly ties to conclude, and today is the day they come to an end.” Yucun, surprised, exclaimed, “Immortal sir, you who practice such asceticism—what earthly matter could possibly bind you?” Tuyin replied, “It is nothing more than a matter of love and familial duty.” Yucun, hearing this, became even more astonished. “Pray, tell me, from whence does this come?” Tuyin explained, “You may not know that my daughter Yinglian, stricken by misfortune at a young age, was once under my care. When I first took up my post, I had already made my judgment. Now she is returned to the Xue family, her trials incomplete, leaving behind a son to carry on the family line. At this moment, as her earthly ties finally dissolve, I have no choice but to guide her onward.” As he finished speaking, Tuyin swept his sleeve aside and departed. Dazed at the ferry crossing in that snowy, rushing current, Yucun soon fell asleep.

Later, that very same Zhen Tuyin went on to liberate Xiangling, delivering her to the Grand Illusory Realm, where she was formally registered with the Fairy of Jinghuan. Soon after, as he was visiting the signboard, he observed a monk and a Taoist priest drifting ethereally toward him. Addressing them, Tuyin said, “Great Master, True Immortal, congratulations! Has your destined love been fully resolved?” The monk and Taoist replied, “The ties of love have not yet been entirely severed; however, that foolish soul has returned. We must escort him back to his original place and settle his final affairs, so that he may not be burdened in a further lifetime.” Hearing this, Tuyin clasped his hands in farewell. The monk and the Taoist then carried the jade down to the foot of Qinggeng Peak, placing “Baoyu” at the very spot where Nuwa had once patched the broken heavens with stone, before each set off on his own wanderings. From that day onward, it was said:

“Matters beyond the mortal realm are chronicled in celestial scrolls;
In the passage of time, one life begets another.”

On that very day, Kongkong the Daoist passed once more by Qinggeng Peak and saw that the stone—yet unused to repair the heavens—still bore the ancient inscriptions. Reading it all over again from the beginning, he noted that after the verses came an account of how many bonds were ultimately severed. Nodding and sighing, he mused, “I once transcribed this remarkable passage upon seeing it in Stone Brother’s writings, thinking it could herald legendary tidings, yet it never returned to its original form. Who would have imagined that, after all these years, there would be yet another such fine account? It seems that Stone Brother, in his earthly sojourn, has polished himself to luminescence and attained perfect enlightenment, leaving nothing regrettable behind. I only fear that with the passage of time the inscriptions may fade and become distorted. It would be best if I transcribe it once more and entrust it to a worldly soul of leisure, so that it may be circulated—celebrated as wondrous yet unpretentious, genuine yet not overblown. Perhaps, in our wearied mortal dreams, we might even hear the birds call us home, for the mountain spirits are ever hospitable, and who knows, they might even cause the stone to speak again.”

Having finished his reflections, Kongkong transcribed the passage once more and tucked it into his sleeve, making his way to that bustling place. He searched high and low—among those who were either accomplished in their careers or merely eking out a living—yet who would have the leisure to chat idly with a stone? At last, he found a man sleeping at the grass hut by the rushing ferry. Thinking him to be a person of leisure, Kongkong approached, intending to show him the transcribed “Record of the Stone.” However, the man could not be roused at first. Kongkong pulled him insistently until he finally opened his eyes and sat up. Glancing briefly at the document, the man threw it aside and declared, “I have witnessed all of these events firsthand; your transcription is free of error. I am naming you my sole confidant—pass it on, so that this new and fascinating case may be concluded.” Kongkong anxiously inquired, “Who is that person?” The man replied, “You must come at a certain year, month, day, and hour to a place called the Mourning Red Pavilion, where a Mr. Cao Xueqin awaits. Merely say that it is ‘as spoken by Jia Yucun.’” With that, he fell back asleep.

Kongkong committed those words to heart, not knowing through how many lifetimes and tribulations they would pass, until indeed there came a Mourning Red Pavilion where Mr. Cao Xueqin was found poring over ancient histories. Kongkong then related what Jia Yucun had said and showed him the “Record of the Stone.” Mr. Xueqin smiled and remarked, “It is indeed as ‘Jia Yucun said’!” Kongkong then asked, “Sir, how did you recognize this, and why are you willing to pass on his story?” Mr. Xueqin laughed, “To call you ‘Kongkong’ is apt—your mind is indeed empty. Although it is ‘Yucun’s words,’ there is neither the absurdity of a butcher’s tale nor contradictions in it. It delights me to share it with a few companions in times of feasting and idleness, by the lamp at a rainy dusk, so as to dispel our solitude. To probe this matter so deeply is akin to marking the spot on a drifting boat or beating a drum with a rigid stick.” Kongkong laughed heartily at this and, tossing aside the transcription, drifted away, exclaiming, “It all turns out to be mere buffoonery! Neither the author, nor the transcriber, nor even the reader truly understands—it is simply the play of pen and ink, a diversion to suit one’s fancy!”

Later, when future generations beheld this legendary chronicle, they added a four-line verse as an epitaph for the author’s origin, which reads:

“At the very depths of bitterness, the absurd becomes ever more mournful.
Since all is but one shared dream, do not mock the world’s foolish hearts!”
