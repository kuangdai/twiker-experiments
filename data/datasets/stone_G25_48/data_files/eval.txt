Only after watching her carriage roll away did they turn back. What followed is left for the next chapter. Chapter 37 An Impromptu Crab-Flower Society in Autumn Cool Lodge Nighttime Plans for Chrysanthemum Odes in the Fragrant Bank Court  Once Xiangyun departed for home, Baoyu and the others continued their daily carefree wandering and verse-making in the Garden, not worth detailing further. Now, after Yuan-chun’s palace visit, Jia Zheng devoted himself even more diligently to his official duties, hoping to repay the imperial favor. The Emperor, seeing his upright conduct and his family's scholarly heritage, although Jia Zheng was not from the civil-exam track, specially appointed him to supervise certain academic affairs—an intention to foster genuine talent. Jia Zheng thus received the edict and prepared to depart on the twentieth day of the eighth lunar month. On that date, he bade farewell at the clan shrine and to Grandmother Jia, then set out. How Baoyu and others attempted to see him off, how Jia Zheng handled matters on the road, we will not dwell on. We focus on Baoyu, who, after Jia Zheng’s departure, found life in the Garden even more unconstrained: day after day, he idly strolled and composed trifles, letting precious time slip by. One day, feeling quite bored, he went to linger in Grandmother Jia’s and Lady Wang’s quarters, then came back into the Garden. No sooner had he changed clothes than Cui Mo appeared, bringing him a note penned on fancy paper:  “Your Third Sister requests to see you, Master. She’s better now.” Baoyu, immediately recalling he had thought of visiting her, brightened:  “Good! I was just about to see her—perfect timing. Is she really feeling better?” Cui Mo replied, “Yes, the fever’s nearly gone, she doesn’t need medication—just a mild chill.” Pleased, Baoyu opened the note. It read: A humble letter from your younger sister Tan, to my second brother: Late last night, it had just cleared after the rain, and the moon shone bright as washing. Not wanting to waste such a rare clear scene, I paced about under the paulownia trellis until the water-clock had struck three times, and was caught by the damp chill of night dew, so that I fell ill. Yesterday, you kindly came to ask after me, then even sent a maid to inquire again, and with your gift of fresh lychees and that excellent Yan-qing ink—truly how profound is your generosity! Today, as I rest at my desk, I recalled how, in ancient times, men of letters and official ranks, though occupying the arenas of fame and competition, would yet carve out some small corner of mountains and waters, gathering a few kindred souls, inviting guests near and far, and establishing some circle or society—be it for writing or banquets—though spontaneous, it often yielded wonders that last through the ages. I, though unworthy, happen to share in the Garden’s scenic leisure, along with the refined company of the Xue and Lin cousins. Such breezy patios and moonlit halls, we lament not having feasts of poets. Streams of apricot trees, banks of peach blossoms—why not indulge in wine and freewheeling verse? It’s said men’s ‘Lotus Society’ is esteemed for its heroic talents—should only be for them, leaving us womenfolk aside? If you, dear brother, would take pity on me and come, I’d humbly sweep the flowers in welcome. Respectful greetings. Reading this, Baoyu couldn’t help clapping his hands and laughing:  “Splendid, Third Sister has real taste! Let’s do it— let me hurry to discuss it with the others.” Handing the note to a nearby maid, he dashed off with Cui Mo. Passing the Qinfang Pavilion, an old gate-warden woman approached from the back gate, carrying a letter:  “It’s from Cousin Yu (Jia Yun). He’s waiting outside, paying respects. He asked me to deliver this to you.” Baoyu opened it:  Your unworthy son Yun, respectfully greets Father: Ever since you magnanimously acknowledged me, day and night I think of how to fulfill my filial duty, yet find no way to repay your kindness. Some time ago, handling the purchase of flowers and plants, by Heaven’s grace I made acquaintance with many horticulturists and discovered many noted gardens.
If you remain unappreciated by your master all your life, then you’ve missed your chance. Now, what if he were to lay hands on you? That would be a disaster indeed.”  Yuan Yang coldly laughed, “What nonsense! I simply won’t go.”  Ping’er interjected softly, “Sister, you need not worry. We’ve already reached a consensus. I’ll tell you everything later.”  Mrs. Xing, smiling broadly, then rose and said, “Now, go and attend to your own duties. I’ll have dinner prepared and then come back.”  Fengjie, overhearing all this, thought to herself, “Yuan Yang has always had a generous heart. Even if I propose this, will she agree? I must go first; then, once Mrs. Xing arrives, if she complies I’ll smoothly withdraw. But if not—if Mrs. Xing suspects and then uses her influence to cause trouble for me—I’ll be in a pickle. In that case, I might as well go together with them. If she agrees, no one will suspect a thing.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just now, my aunt sent over two cages of quail, which I had ordered fried to be served with Madam’s dinner. When I arrived at the gate, I saw the boys carrying a carriage saying that Madam’s carriage had been taken away for repairs. Perhaps it is best if I ride in my own carriage and go together.”  Mrs. Xing, pleased with the plan, ordered her servants to prepare new garments. Soon, Fengjie, having finished her tasks and attended to her duties, along with her maid, rode in a carriage to Grandmother’s. Meanwhile, after dinner, Fengjie returned to her room. As she recounted the incident to Ping’er, Ping’er shook her head and laughed, “From what I can see, it may not be so proper after all. When we speak in private, his ideas might not be accepted. We’ll just have to see.”  Fengjie replied, “Madam will surely come into the room to discuss it. If they agree, that’s all; if not, it’s no great loss. Besides, you mustn’t worry—I’ll send some quail, along with other accompaniments, prepared for the meal. And what about the extra clothes you mentioned? They must be sorted out for use.”  Li Wan interjected, “I won’t meddle in these matters; just take care of my own affairs so that I may rest—there’s no need for the girls to fuss over me.”  Fengjie quickly said, “Dear sister, please spare me a moment. You’ve always been so dear to me—why is it that today you care for Ping’er but not for me? In the past you advised me, ‘Even with many things to do, one must find time to rest and take care of oneself.’ But today, you seem determined to make me work myself to death. Besides, if it’s only the extra clothes for others, that’s one thing; but if it’s your own responsibility, then Grandmother will surely blame you. I’d rather bear the burden myself than trouble you!”  Li Wan smiled and said, “You listen to yourself—so eloquent! Now, tell me truly: does this poetry society really have any regulations?”  Fengjie laughed, “What nonsense! If I don’t contribute money to the society, wouldn’t I be branded a rebel in the Grand View Garden? And if I don’t participate, how could I dine here? Tomorrow morning, once I assume my post and swear an oath, I’ll deposit fifty taels for you to run the society. I am no poet or essayist—I’m just an ordinary person. Whether I serve as ‘inspector’ or not, once the money is in, you’ll have no choice but to kick me out!”  This sent everyone into another round of laughter. After a while, Fengjie announced, “Later, I will have the upstairs hall prepared. I’ll arrange for all the necessary supplies to be brought out for you to inspect. If something is lacking, we’ll order it according to your list. As for the painting cloth, I’ll have it cut to size.
Xi Ren stood there, deeply unsettled. He must have meant that speech for Lin Daiyu, she realized. It implies a dangerous entanglement—if they transgress in some way . . . oh dear, how can we prevent trouble? She was still pondering this when Baochai arrived from another path, calling cheerily, “Why are you daydreaming in the blazing sun?” Xi Ren quickly steadied herself: “I was watching two birds fight, amusements of nature.” Baochai laughed, “So that’s it. I saw Baoyu rush out in a hurry—I tried calling him, but he looked so preoccupied he didn’t respond. Where’s he off to?” Xi Ren explained, “Master just summoned him—likely a visitor. Might be some official call.” Baochai said, “So hot—why drag him out? Maybe the Master is annoyed and wants to scold him.” Xi Ren replied, “I think it’s just a guest.” Baochai laughed, “That guest must be insane, trudging about in this heat.” Xi Ren said, “Isn’t that so!”  Baochai then inquired, “I saw Xiangyun heading to your place. Why?” Xi Ren answered, “We chatted awhile, and I asked her to help me with some sewing. She agreed.” Baochai nodded: “That girl’s always doing needlework at home. She told me she’s worn out by it—her family can’t afford hired seamstresses, so all chores fall on them. I recall her eyes turning red whenever the subject arises. She complains about all the exhausting tasks, but dares not speak openly.” Xi Ren sighed, “Yes, I recall requesting her to tie a few butterfly knots last month. She said she’d do them, but took a long while. Likely she had to do it late at night. If I’d known, I’d not have asked her. Master Baoyu is picky, though, refusing the house seamstresses for his personal items.” Baochai said quietly, “Don’t worry, I’ll do some for you if needed.” Xi Ren brightened, “Truly? That would be such a blessing! Perhaps tonight I’ll bring them over.”  She was mid-sentence when an old woman came in a hurry: “Something dreadful! Jin Chuan’er, from the Mistress’s rooms, has just drowned herself in a well.” Xi Ren gasped: “That Jin Chuan’er? The one in Lady Wang’s service?” The old woman confirmed, “Yes, that same one. Dismissed a few days ago, she’d been weeping non-stop at home. No one minded her. Suddenly she disappeared. Then, a maid drawing water from that old corner well found a corpse below—turns out it was her. Some tried fishing her out, but too late.”  Baochai exclaimed, “Such a tragedy!” Xi Ren, recalling Jin Chuan’er’s usual camaraderie, shed tears. Baochai, seeing Xi Ren upset, said softly, “I’d better go console Aunt Wang.” Xi Ren, forced to stifle her grief, also excused herself. Baochai reached Lady Wang’s quarters to find it silent, Lady Wang alone, tears on her cheeks. Not wishing to bring up Jin Chuan’er’s death first, Baochai quietly sat. Lady Wang asked, “Where have you come from?” “From the garden.” “Did you see your Cousin Baoyu? Just now he returned with a dull expression.” “He’s just gone out again,” Baochai answered. Lady Wang nodded with a sigh, “Did you hear the terrible news? Jin Chuan’er hurled herself down a well!” Baochai said, “What? Why on earth would she do that? That’s so strange.” Lady Wang lamented, “Some days back I scolded her over a minor mishap and dismissed her in anger. I intended only to let her reflect for a few days before recalling her. Who’d have guessed she had such a fierce temper! Now she’s drowned, and I’m at fault.”  Baochai attempted to reassure her, “Aunt, you’re naturally compassionate.
Now, when you speak, treat it as proper business. Hurry and bring the silver inside.”  The maids, laughing, hurriedly gathered the silver, which came in two sealed packets—even Baochai’s and Daiyu’s shares were present. You (Youshi) then asked, “Whose share is still missing?”  Lin Zhixiao answered, “Only that of Grandmother, the madams, and the young ladies—of our lower-ranking maidservants.”  You (Youshi) added, “And what about your eldest aunt’s share?”  Lin Zhixiao replied, “Previously, all the silver was distributed from Second Madame’s funds to the eldest aunt.”  After this, You (Youshi) finished her grooming and ordered that vehicles be readied. Soon she proceeded to Rong Mansion, where she first met Fengjie. Fengjie was busy sealing the silver packets, preparing to send them off. You (Youshi) asked, “Are all the shares in order?”  Fengjie laughed, “Yes—they’re all here. Just take them; if any go missing, I won’t be responsible.”  You (Youshi) replied with a laugh, “I don’t fully trust this—let me count them in person.”  Sure enough, after counting they found that only Li Wan’s share was short by one coin. You (Youshi) laughed, “I knew something was amiss—you don’t have your eldest sister’s share?”  Fengjie replied, “Even if it is one coin short, it’s alright. If it’s not enough, I’ll find it for you.”  You (Youshi) retorted, “Yesterday you were so flattering in front of people, and today you come to pester me about it—I won’t abide it. I will only claim what Grandmother owes me.”  Fengjie laughed, “I see you are quite shrewd. Tomorrow, if any matter arises, I will be as precise as the calendar; don’t you dare complain.”  You (Youshi) smiled, “If you withhold even one coin, then despite your usual filial piety, I shall hold you to account.” She then produced the coin collected from Ping’er, saying, “Ping’er, hand over your share. If it falls short, I’ll top it up for you.”  Ping’er, understanding, replied with a smile, “Madam, please use mine first; if there’s any surplus, you may reward me with something later.”  You (Youshi) laughed, “So long as your mistress is not cheating, how can I plead for mercy?”  Ping’er had no choice but to accept. You (Youshi) went on, “I see you handle these matters so meticulously—what do you plan to do with this money? Will you carry it off in your coffin tomorrow?” As she spoke, she turned and went back toward Grandmother Jia’s quarters. After offering her respects and exchanging a few words, she entered Yuan Yang’s room to consult with her. Listening to Yuan Yang’s plan for pleasing Grandmother Jia, they quickly reached an agreement. Before leaving, You (Youshi) returned the 2 taels of silver that Yuan Yang had contributed, saying, “This isn’t enough, I must stand ready.” Then she went over to Madame Wang, and after speaking with her for a while—Madame Wang having just entered the Buddhist hall—returned the 1 tael from Cai Yun. With Fengjie not present, she even returned the shares belonging to Zhou and Zhao. Neither Zhou nor Zhao dared to keep them, so You (Youshi) said, “You poor dears—where do you expect to get such idle money? Once Feng knows, I must answer for it.” They received her words with heartfelt thanks. In the blink of an eye the date came to the second day of the ninth lunar month. Everyone in the garden had learned that You (Youshi) had arranged a rather lively celebration—not only would there be performances, but even a troupe of female performers who acted out various sketches and told stories was present. Li Wan then told the other sisters, “Today is a proper festival day—don’t forget.
Upon reaching the Flower Hall, he saw Grandmother Jia, Madame Wang, and the others. They all behaved as though they had been blessed by the arrival of the “phoenix.”  Grandmother Jia asked first, “Where did you go? Why did you arrive so late? You should have bowed to your elder sister!” Then, laughing, she chided Fengjie, “Your brother does not know how to behave. To have some important matter, he should have mentioned it rather than sneaking off. If he does it again, when your father returns home, I will have him beaten!”  Fengjie laughed, “A simple bow is one thing—but tomorrow, Bao, you must at least announce your departure. Do not let anyone follow you out unsupervised. There are so many carriages and horses on the street that one cannot be left in the lurch. It is not like the strict rules we observe when we leave the house.”  At this, Grandmother Jia scolded those in attendance, “Why do you all simply follow his orders? When he says he is leaving, he leaves without so much as a word in return!” Then she asked, “Where exactly did he go? Has he eaten anything? Has he been frightened?”  Bao Yu could only reply, “A favored concubine of the Prince Bei has passed away. Today he went to express his grief. I saw him crying so bitterly that I could not leave him there, so I waited for him a while longer.”  Grandmother Jia declared, “If he ever leaves without informing me beforehand, I will have your father beat you!”  Bao Yu hastily agreed. Grandmother Jia then threatened to discipline the attendants as well. The others interjected, “Grandmother, please do not be angry. He has promised he will not do it again—and besides, he has returned safely, so let us all enjoy ourselves for a while.”  Though Grandmother Jia remained uneasy at first, when she saw Bao Yu return she was overjoyed and her earlier anger melted away. She only worried that he might not have eaten enough or that something might have startled him on the way. In the end she fussed over him lovingly. Xiangren had long since come over to attend to him, and everyone settled in to watch the performance. That day the play was “The Record of the Thorned Hairpin” (Jingchai Ji). Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue, and the others wept with sorrow at times, laughed at others, and even cursed in parts. How exactly all this turned out… we shall explain in the next installment. Chapter 44 Unexpected Ups and Downs: Fengjie’s Jealousy and Outburst, While Ping’er Cheerfully Prepares Her Appearance  It happened that Baoyu and the sisters were sitting together watching the performance of “The Record of the Thorned Hairpin.” When Daiyu saw the scene “Male Sacrifice” on stage, she remarked to Baochai, “That Wang Shipeng is so clueless—no matter how often he offers a ritual, he’ll surely end up by the river doing something foolish. As the saying goes, ‘Seeing an object makes one think of someone.’ All water in the world comes from one source; no matter from which stream you scoop a bowl, once you begin to cry, you may as well let your heart be completely moved.”  Baochai offered no reply, and Bao Yu, upon hearing this, fell silent in thought. Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia resolved that today, unlike previous days, she must teach Fengjie a lesson in both joy and sorrow. Rather than fussing about with elaborate banquet seating in the main room, she reclined lazily on a couch in a side room with Aunt Xue and Madame Xue (Xue Yima) watching the play. Several of her favorite snacks were casually laid out on a small table for her to nibble on while she conversed at ease. She arranged two small banquets for herself—one to entertain the little maids and other attendants (who otherwise had no assigned seats), instructing them to sit beneath the eaves and help themselves without the need for strict etiquette. Madame Wang and Mrs. Xing sat at a high table downstairs, while several of the sisters occupied seats on a platform. From time to time Grandmother Jia would instruct You (Youshi) and others, “Let Feng lie on the upper table so that you may properly attend to me—it’s too hard for her all year long.” You readily agreed and teasingly added, “She says she can’t sit properly at the head of the table; once she’s seated up there, she’s all over the place, and she refuses to drink her wine!”  Grandmother Jia laughed and replied, “You don’t know—wait until I send her up myself.”  Just then, Fengjie hurried in with a laugh: “Old Ancestor, don’t believe their nonsense!
Tomorrow, we return to Grandmother. If the household already has these items, fine; if not, then use money to purchase them—I will help match them for you.”  Baoyu quickly put away the list. After some more idle conversation, in the evening they went to pay respects at Grandmother Jia’s. Grandmother Jia, who was not gravely ill but merely weary and slightly chilled, having taken a couple of doses of medicine and feeling better by evening, received them. What conversation follows the next day remains to be told in the next installment. Chapter 43 Casual Amusements—Accidentally Gathering Gold in Celebration of Longevity; Unspoken Affections—For a While, Pressing Earth to Make Fragrance  It happened that Madame Wang noticed Grandmother Jia had only caught a mild chill during her time in the Grand View Garden—not a serious illness. After giving the doctor two doses of medicine, Grandmother Jia recovered, and Madame Wang sent for Fengjie with orders to prepare a gift for Jia Zheng. As they were discussing the matter, Grandmother Jia’s servant called out, and Madame Wang quickly ushered Fengjie over. Madame Wang then inquired, “Do you think Grandmother is feeling any better now?”  Grandmother Jia replied, “Today I am much improved. Earlier, when you sent over that wild‐chicken soup, I tasted it and found it quite flavorful; then I had two pieces of meat and felt very well satisfied.”  Madame Wang laughed, “That is the filial offering from young Feng—her piety is evident. It is not in vain that Grandmother has always doted on her.”  Grandmother Jia nodded and smiled, “It was very thoughtful of her. If only there were still some fresh meat, we could fry two more pieces—salted until savory. Though the soup is good, it just doesn’t go with plain porridge.”  At these words, Fengjie promptly agreed and sent orders down to the great kitchen. Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia confided to Madame Wang with a twinkle in her eye, “The reason I sent for you today is not for any other matter—the second day of the lunar month is Feng’s birthday. For the past two years I had planned to celebrate her birthday, but with other matters always arising the celebration was put off. Now that everyone is here and there seems to be no pressing business, we can all enjoy a fine day together.”  Madame Wang smiled, “I had been thinking the same. Since Grandmother is pleased, why not settle on a plan?”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “You know, in past years it did not matter who celebrated their birthday—the gifts were given separately. That has become too formal and standoffish. This year, I intend to try something new—something that is both informal and fun.”  Madame Wang eagerly added, “Tell me, Grandmother, what do you have in mind?”  Grandmother Jia explained, “I was thinking we might follow the custom of a small family, pooling our money together so that everyone contributes a share. Don’t you think that’s a fine idea?”  Madame Wang replied, “That sounds excellent—but how exactly are we to pool it?”  Upon hearing this, Grandmother Jia’s delight grew. She immediately sent for Aunt Xue, Aunt Xue’s husband’s sister (Xing’s wife), and others—including the young ladies, Bao Yu, as well as the Youshi and the Lài family members, and even some of the respectable ladies in charge. Before long—within the span of one meal—all the elders and youngsters, from the highest to the lowest, crowded into one room. (In the customs of the Jia household the elders who serve their parents are held in higher esteem than the younger masters, so while You and Feng and others remained standing on the floor, the senior matron of the Lài family and three or four other elderly nurses had been provided with small stools to sit upon.)  Grandmother Jia cheerfully recounted the previous evening’s conversation to everyone, and all joined in the merriment. Some were pleased to see Fengjie doing so well, while others, even anxious to curry favor with her, practically clamored for the chance. Since everyone was eager to offer their share, the idea was met with unanimous approval. Grandmother Jia began, “I will contribute 20 taels.”  Aunt Xue (Suo Xie, known as Xue Yima) laughed, “I, following Grandmother’s lead, will also give 20 taels.”  Madame Wang and Xing’s wife then said, “We dare not equal Grandmother; naturally, we are a step lower—each giving 16 taels.”  You (Youshi) and Li Wan laughed, “We, too, are lower in status, so let us each give 12 taels.”  Grandmother Jia quickly chided Li Wan, “You poor widow—you need not worry about coming up with the money; I will pay your share for you.”  Fengjie interjected with a laugh, “Grandmother, don’t get too excited.
In former times, when Zhu was alive, I kept my sons well in hand. Now, with only Baoyu left, and he so delicate—plus the Old Ancestor dotes on him so. If I restrain him too severely, suppose something befalls him, or the Old Ancestor is upset. Then who’s to blame? That’s why we end up spoiling him. I often scold him, beseech him in tears. He listens for a moment, then soon reverts. In the end, not until he experiences real suffering does he seem moved. But if he were to be beaten so badly that he’s crippled, who can I rely on? He’s all I have!” She too was moved to tears. Seeing Lady Wang so affected, Xi Ren felt her own eyes prickle, and tears fell. She said:  “It’s only natural a mother would love her child, but we servants who attend him daily also yearn for a peaceful outcome. If matters escalate, even peace is lost. Every day I implore him, but he won’t be awakened. Moreover, certain others encourage him, and so how can we blame only him? We try, yet it’s sometimes unwelcome. Today you bring it up, so I’ll speak of one concern in particular, hoping you can decide. But I fear you might suspect me of ill motives, losing me my place.” Lady Wang coaxed, “What is it, my dear? You can trust me.”  Xi Ren said quietly, “It’s just that . . . I think perhaps it would be best if Master Baoyu were made to move out of the garden. . . .”  Lady Wang blanched: “Is there something improper—did he do some mischief with the young ladies?”  Xi Ren hastened to clarify: “No, no, Madam—don’t alarm yourself! I just worry that with him grown and the girls also grown—particularly Miss Lin and Miss Bao, who are maternal cousins—it might not be appropriate for them to be day and night together. If something is innocently done, yet watchers with evil minds might spread rumors and tarnish reputations. Considering I was placed by you and the Old Ancestor to guard him there, that would be partly my responsibility. Baoyu’s temperament being what it is, if the slightest real or contrived slip occurs, tongues will wag. All of you, and Baoyu’s future name, would be jeopardized. That’s the sort of dreadful trouble I hope to avert. You have many affairs, so perhaps you haven’t dwelled on it. I have, and if I kept silent, that’s even guiltier.”  At these words, Lady Wang, recalling Jin Chuan’er’s calamity, fell silent for a long while, increasingly admiring Xi Ren’s foresight:  “My dear, you show such thoroughness—indeed, I’ve considered it but neglected to act. Thank you for reminding me. You show real heart, good child. Very well then, no need to say more—I’ll handle it. Since you’ve spoken so frankly, let me speak plainly too: From now on, I entrust him to your care. Keep an eye that he doesn’t ruin himself. We shall not forget your loyal effort.” Xi Ren bowed her head a moment, murmuring, “I’ll do as you say, ma’am.” Then she excused herself to return. When she got back, Baoyu had just awakened. She described the fragrance dew from Lady Wang. Baoyu was delighted. They mixed some in water, which proved exquisitely tasty. His thoughts, however, turned to Daiyu. Anxious to send a message but fearing Xi Ren would stop him, he contrived an excuse: “Could you pop over to Miss Bao’s place and borrow me some books?” The moment Xi Ren left, Baoyu summoned Qingwen and directed her:  “Go check on Miss Lin. See what she’s doing. If she asks about me, say I’m improving.” Qingwen huffed, “I can’t just barge in with no pretense. I might look foolish. Maybe I should bring her something?”  Baoyu rummaged around, producing two pieces of old silk, handing them over:  “All right, take these as a token. Just say I’m giving them to her.” Qingwen was perplexed: “She’ll suspect you’re mocking her, sending two half-worn scarves.
Looking up, he saw a dazzling interior but found no sign of Baoyu. Glancing about, he then saw a large dressing mirror standing to the left, behind which two pairs of young maids, about fifteen or sixteen years old, emerged saying, “Please, Second Master, come inside and sit.” Overawed, Jia Yun quickly agreed without meeting their gaze. Next he entered a small, emerald-shaded tea room. There, on a lacquered bed, hung a splendid, intricately designed flower-screen canopy. Baoyu, dressed in his casual clothes with his shoes on, leaned against the bed holding a book. Upon seeing Jia Yun enter, he tossed his book aside, rose with a smile, and greeted him. Jia Yun quickly bowed, and Baoyu invited him to sit; Jia Yun then took a seat on a chair below. Baoyu laughed and said, “Ever since I saw you that month, I told you to come to the study—but with so many things happening one after another, I completely forgot about you.” Jia Yun smiled, “It’s just that I’ve had no good fortune lately, and instead I’ve run into misfortune with Uncle’s ill health. Is Uncle doing any better now?” Baoyu replied, “Much better. I heard you’ve been working hard these past few days.” Jia Yun said, “Hard work is only natural. Uncle’s good health is a blessing for our whole family.” As they spoke, a maid came with tea. While Jia Yun conversed with Baoyu, his eyes kept drifting to the maid—a striking young woman with a slender figure, an elegant oval face, dressed in a silver-red jacket with a blue satin vest and a delicately pleated white skirt. Ever since Baoyu had fallen ill, Jia Yun had memorized the names of the notable maids in the household. Seeing that this maid was serving tea in Baoyu’s room, and with Baoyu sitting nearby, he quickly rose and laughed, “Sister, why are you serving me tea? I’m here at Uncle’s house—not as a guest. Let me pour my own tea.” Baoyu said, “Just sit; the maids are handling it as always.” Jia Yun replied, “Even so, how could I dare be impertinent in the presence of the elder sisters in this house?” He then sat down to enjoy his tea. Baoyu and Jia Yun exchanged idle chatter about which troupe’s actors were the best, which gardens were loveliest, which maids were most attractive, whose banquets were lavish, who had exotic goods and curiosities, and so on. Jia Yun merely went along with Baoyu’s words. After a while, noticing that Baoyu was becoming listless, Jia Yun got up to take his leave. Baoyu did not insist; he said, “If you have free time tomorrow, do come again,” and then ordered the little maid Kui’er to see him out. Once outside Yihong Court, seeing that no one else was around, Jia Yun strolled slowly while chatting with Kui’er. He first asked, “How old are you? What’s your name? What do your parents do? How many years have you been in Uncle Bao’s household? And how much is your monthly allowance? Also, how many girls are there in Uncle Bao’s house altogether?” Kui’er answered each question in turn. Then Jia Yun said, “That little maid who just spoke—is her name Xiao Hong?” Kui’er laughed, “Yes, that’s her. What did you ask her for?” Jia Yun replied, “Earlier she asked about some silk; I happened to find a piece and selected it.” Kui’er laughed and said, “She asked me several times, but did you see her silk? I don’t have the time for such things. Today she asked me again, saying that if I found it, she’d thank me. We were just talking at the gate of Hengwu Court; even Second Master heard it—it wasn’t me fibbing. Ah, Second Master, since you’ve chosen it, give it to me. Let’s see what she will use as a token of thanks.” It turned out that last month when Jia Yun had come in to plant trees, he had found a piece of embroidered silk, knowing it had been lost by someone in the garden—but not knowing who, he hadn’t dared to ask.
Unable to hold her tears, she choked out, “Your words mean nothing to me! From now on, I dare not get close to you again—I shall pretend I’ve left for good.”  Baoyu smiled, “Where would you go?”  Daiyu said, “Home. I’ll go back to my home.”  Baoyu said, “Then I’ll follow you.”  Daiyu murmured, “And if I die?”  Baoyu replied, “Then I’ll become a monk.”  At the mention of “death,” Daiyu’s face immediately fell. “Are you implying you want me dead, spouting such nonsense? You have so many real sisters in your family—once they died, would you become a monk for them too? I’ll go tell everyone about your absurd words and let them judge!”  Baoyu realized he’d made a rash statement, regretted it instantly, and flushed crimson, speechless in shame. Luckily no one else was around. Daiyu stared daggers at him for a long moment. Finally, she gave a sharp “hmph!” but found nothing else to say and, taking up her handkerchief again, quietly resumed crying. Baoyu, already laden with regrets and uneasy thoughts, could only shed tears himself. He sought a handkerchief in his sleeve to wipe them, but had forgotten to bring one, so he used the sleeve of his brand-new lotus-colored gauze robe. Seeing that, Daiyu—though crying—caught sight of him dabbing tears with his fine new sleeve, so she paused her own sobbing, reached behind the pillow for a small kerchief, and flung it toward Baoyu without a word, still covering her face and weeping. Overjoyed, Baoyu snatched it up to wipe his tears. Then he drew closer, took hold of her hand, and whispered, “My heart’s shattered to pieces. Why won’t you stop crying? Come with me to see the Old Lady, would you?”  Daiyu yanked her hand away. “Why must you grope me so? You’re growing more brazen by the day—have you no sense of decency?”  Before she could finish, someone outside shouted, “Ah, wonderful!” Startled, both turned to see Wang Xifeng rushing inside with a grin, “So there you are! The Old Lady’s been ranting at the sky and the earth about you two, ordering me to check whether you’ve made up. I told her you’d be fine on your own within three days, but she said I was lazy and forced me here. Indeed, I see you’ve made peace on your own, so I’m spared the trouble of mediating. Truly, you’re like ‘two roosters with locked spurs’: You fight, then cling tight—why the big fuss? Come along and soothe the Old Lady, or you’ll worry her to death.” With that, she seized Daiyu by the arm to lead her away. Daiyu called out for her maids, but none came. Wang Xifeng laughed, “Why bother them? I can look after you.” She dragged Daiyu away, with Baoyu trailing in their wake. Exiting the garden, they arrived at Jia Mu’s quarters. Wang Xifeng said, “I told our Old Ancestor there was no need to send me—these two would reconcile on their own. She wouldn’t believe, forced me to come mediate. But I found them nestling together, perfectly fine. Tell me, what’s there for me to do?” She made the entire household burst into laughter. At that moment, Baochai was also present. Daiyu, speechless, took a seat next to Jia Mu. Baoyu, having nothing else to say, turned to Baochai and teased, “Today’s my big brother Xue Pan’s birthday, and I’m sick—I haven’t even paid him a courtesy. He might think I’m shunning him. Sister, please explain that I truly am unwell.”  Baochai responded, “Goodness, must that be spelled out? If you had the energy, you wouldn’t disturb him, and if you don’t, you’re hardly at fault.
Isn’t it all because of your petty instigations? If you’re so intent on pushing him to death, then you’ll have your way! I’ll not spare a word!” She wept and cursed as she cried. Jia Zheng, overhearing these words, grew even more anxious and quickly shooed Aunt Zhao away, trying to soothe everyone. Suddenly, someone returned with the news, “Both coffins are ready.” Hearing this, the Lady Dowager felt as if a knife had stabbed her heart; she burst into tears and furious curses, “Who ordered these coffins to be made? Bring the men who made them here so I can beat them to death!” The uproar became absolute. Then, faintly, they heard the sound of a wooden fish from afar, accompanied by the chanting, “Namo Jieyuan, Jiejie Pusa! Whoever suffers misfortune, whose household is troubled, who is plagued by evil spirits or meets with calamity—come to us for healing!” Both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang heard this and ordered their servants to search the street. It turned out that the voices belonged to a ragged monk and a shabby Taoist priest. What did that monk look like? He had a nose like a suspended gallbladder, long eyebrows; his eyes shone like bright stars with a precious gleam. Clad in a tattered kasaya and worn straw sandals with no trace of luxury, he bore a raw, festering sore on his head. And what of the Taoist? He appeared as if one foot were high and the other low, his body perpetually wet and trailing mud. When asked where he hailed from, he replied, “From Penglai, beyond the Weak Water in the West.” Jia Zheng ordered the two to be brought in and asked, “From which mountain do you practice your way?” The monk smiled and said, “Officer, there is no need for further words. Knowing that the household here is in distress, I have come specifically to heal it.” Jia Zheng asked, “There are two people afflicted by evil—do you know of any immortal remedy?” The Taoist laughed and said, “Your household now possesses a treasure of singular rarity; with it, there is no need to ask about a remedy.” Moved, Jia Zheng said, “When the child was born, he carried a piece of jade with the inscription ‘Able to Remove Evil’—yet it has lost its power. The monk replied, “Officer, you are unaware—Baoyu was originally endowed with spiritual vitality, but he has been seduced by the allure of pleasures and worldly gains, and that is why it has lost its effect. Now, remove that precious jade from his neck and let me recite a few incantations; it will naturally regain its power.” Jia Zheng then took the jade from Baoyu’s neck and handed it to the two holy men. The monk held it in his palm, sighed deeply, and said:    “Beneath Qingeng Peak we parted thirteen years ago. Time in this world flies by; yet the bonds of fate remain unbroken—alas, alas! How enviable were those days:   Unfettered by heaven or earth, with neither joy nor sorrow in one’s heart. But after attaining spiritual insight, one inevitably stirs up strife among men. Alas, what a pity this ordeal has become:   The once-precious jade is now marred by stains and smudges, and every day the windows imprison the mandarin ducks. When the stupor of dreams finally lifts, debts of injustice must be repaid so that all may be set free.”  After reciting, the monk fiddled with the jade again, muttering nonsensical words, and then told Jia Zheng, “This object is now powerful—do not desecrate it. Hang it above your bedside, and let none but your kin come near to disturb its spirit. In thirty-three days, its power will be fully restored.” Jia Zheng quickly ordered tea, but the two holy men had already departed; all he could do was follow their instructions. In time, Feng Jie and Baoyu gradually recovered; one day they awoke with genuine hunger, and both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang finally relaxed. The sisters, meanwhile, listened anxiously from outside. Lin Daiyu first chanted a Buddhist verse, while Baochai smiled without a word. Xi Chun remarked, “What is it that Sister Bao is laughing about?” Baochai replied, “I’m laughing at how even the Tathāgata seems busier than ordinary mortals—having to save souls, to shield people from illness, and to oversee marriages, ensuring all comes together.
In that case, I might as well go together with them. If she agrees, no one will suspect a thing.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just now, my aunt sent over two cages of quail, which I had ordered fried to be served with Madam’s dinner. When I arrived at the gate, I saw the boys carrying a carriage saying that Madam’s carriage had been taken away for repairs. Perhaps it is best if I ride in my own carriage and go together.”  Mrs. Xing, pleased with the plan, ordered her servants to prepare new garments. Soon, Fengjie, having finished her tasks and attended to her duties, along with her maid, rode in a carriage to Grandmother’s. Meanwhile, after dinner, Fengjie returned to her room. As she recounted the incident to Ping’er, Ping’er shook her head and laughed, “From what I can see, it may not be so proper after all. When we speak in private, his ideas might not be accepted. We’ll just have to see.”  Fengjie replied, “Madam will surely come into the room to discuss it. If they agree, that’s all; if not, it’s no great loss. Besides, you mustn’t worry—I’ll send some quail, along with other accompaniments, prepared for the meal. And what about the extra clothes you mentioned? They must be sorted out for use.”  Li Wan interjected, “I won’t meddle in these matters; just take care of my own affairs so that I may rest—there’s no need for the girls to fuss over me.”  Fengjie quickly said, “Dear sister, please spare me a moment. You’ve always been so dear to me—why is it that today you care for Ping’er but not for me? In the past you advised me, ‘Even with many things to do, one must find time to rest and take care of oneself.’ But today, you seem determined to make me work myself to death. Besides, if it’s only the extra clothes for others, that’s one thing; but if it’s your own responsibility, then Grandmother will surely blame you. I’d rather bear the burden myself than trouble you!”  Li Wan smiled and said, “You listen to yourself—so eloquent! Now, tell me truly: does this poetry society really have any regulations?”  Fengjie laughed, “What nonsense! If I don’t contribute money to the society, wouldn’t I be branded a rebel in the Grand View Garden? And if I don’t participate, how could I dine here? Tomorrow morning, once I assume my post and swear an oath, I’ll deposit fifty taels for you to run the society. I am no poet or essayist—I’m just an ordinary person. Whether I serve as ‘inspector’ or not, once the money is in, you’ll have no choice but to kick me out!”  This sent everyone into another round of laughter. After a while, Fengjie announced, “Later, I will have the upstairs hall prepared. I’ll arrange for all the necessary supplies to be brought out for you to inspect. If something is lacking, we’ll order it according to your list. As for the painting cloth, I’ll have it cut to size. The design isn’t with Grandmother—it’s with Old Master Zhen. That way, we avoid any mishaps. I’ll also have the cloth delivered to the officials for treatment with alum—will that suffice?”  Li Wan nodded with a smile, “That is very much appreciated. Now then, let’s head home. Once his things are delivered, we’ll tease him a bit more.”  Fengjie added with a laugh, “All this fuss is really because of Bao Yu’s doing!”  Li Wan turned and laughed, “It’s all because of Bao Yu! He was the one who ruined our first gathering. Our faces might be soft, but how can we let him off so easily?”  Fengjie thought for a moment and said, “I see no better punishment than having him sweep every inch of the garden in every house.”  Everyone laughed, “That’s not a bad idea at all!”  Just as they were about to depart, a little maid came in carrying Old Madam Lai.
What do you say?”  Bao Yu laughed, “I know what you mean. You must be the only one who came with me. You worry that if you alone return, you’ll be burdened—so you have chosen this grand idea to persuade me. I have come only to fulfill my filial duty; I never intended to stay away from town for a day. My heart is now content, so I shall head back promptly, and everyone may rest assured.”  Bei Mei said, “That is even better.”  With that the two arrived at the Chán Hall, where indeed the elderly nun had prepared a table full of fine vegetarian dishes. Bao Yu quickly ate a bit, and so did Bei Mei. Then the two mounted their horses and retraced their steps. Bei Mei, riding behind, cautioned, “Second Young Master, ride carefully. This horse is not one for heavy riding; keep a firm grip.”  Before long they re-entered the city by the rear gate and hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard. Inside, Xiangren and the other maidservants were not present; only a few elderly maids were keeping watch. Upon seeing Bao Yu arrive, they beamed and exclaimed, “Amitābha, he’s finally here! We were so worried our young lady might go mad with worry. The seat upstairs is set—please, Second Young Master, come in.”  When Bao Yu heard this, he quickly removed his plain garment and changed into a brightly colored, auspicious outfit. He then inquired, “Where is the seat arranged?”  The elderly maids replied, “It is in the newly constructed, spacious Flower Hall.”  Bao Yu then strode directly toward the Flower Hall; already he could hear the soft sound of flutes and bamboo pipes in the air. As he reached the passageway, he saw Yu Chuan sitting alone under the eaves, weeping. At the sight of Bao Yu, she let out a long sigh and exclaimed, “Ah! The phoenix has come! Quickly, come in! If you delay any longer, everything will be reversed.”  Bao Yu smiled in reply, “Can you guess where I have been?”  Yu Chuan twisted her body and, ignoring his question while dabbing her tears, Bao Yu, with a slight look of dismay, had no choice but to enter. Upon reaching the Flower Hall, he saw Grandmother Jia, Madame Wang, and the others. They all behaved as though they had been blessed by the arrival of the “phoenix.”  Grandmother Jia asked first, “Where did you go? Why did you arrive so late? You should have bowed to your elder sister!” Then, laughing, she chided Fengjie, “Your brother does not know how to behave. To have some important matter, he should have mentioned it rather than sneaking off. If he does it again, when your father returns home, I will have him beaten!”  Fengjie laughed, “A simple bow is one thing—but tomorrow, Bao, you must at least announce your departure. Do not let anyone follow you out unsupervised. There are so many carriages and horses on the street that one cannot be left in the lurch. It is not like the strict rules we observe when we leave the house.”  At this, Grandmother Jia scolded those in attendance, “Why do you all simply follow his orders? When he says he is leaving, he leaves without so much as a word in return!” Then she asked, “Where exactly did he go? Has he eaten anything? Has he been frightened?”  Bao Yu could only reply, “A favored concubine of the Prince Bei has passed away. Today he went to express his grief. I saw him crying so bitterly that I could not leave him there, so I waited for him a while longer.”  Grandmother Jia declared, “If he ever leaves without informing me beforehand, I will have your father beat you!”  Bao Yu hastily agreed. Grandmother Jia then threatened to discipline the attendants as well. The others interjected, “Grandmother, please do not be angry. He has promised he will not do it again—and besides, he has returned safely, so let us all enjoy ourselves for a while.”  Though Grandmother Jia remained uneasy at first, when she saw Bao Yu return she was overjoyed and her earlier anger melted away. She only worried that he might not have eaten enough or that something might have startled him on the way.
Just then, she heard laughter from inside—a soft murmur. Listening closely, she recognized the voices of Baoyu and Baochai. The more she thought, the angrier she became. Suddenly she recalled what had transpired earlier: “Surely Baoyu must be angry at me for telling on him—yet when have I ever told you?” she wondered bitterly. “If you don’t let me in today, does that mean we’ll never meet again?” Overwhelmed with sorrow, she could no longer stand; braving the cold dew and the biting wind along the flowered paths, she stood alone in the shadow of a wall beneath flowering trees, weeping bitterly. For Lin Daiyu, whose beauty was peerless and whose grace was rare in the world, her tears so moved even the birds resting in the nearby willow branches and blossoms took flight in alarm, unwilling to hear her sorrow. As one might say:    “Flower spirits, tear by tear, show no emotion;   In the dreams of birds, where does the madness begin?”  Another poem came to mind:   “Qin’er, with beauty rare as it may be,   Clutches her fragrance deep within her embroidered boudoir. One wail, and yet it is never enough—   Fallen petals litter the ground as startled birds take wing.”  As Lin Daiyu wept, she suddenly heard a creak at the gate. Someone was coming out—but who? (To be continued…)  Chapter 27 At Di Cui Pavilion, Yang Fei Teases Colorful Butterflies; At the Fragrant Burial Mound, Flying Swallows Weep Over Faded Crimson  Lin Daiyu was in the midst of her sorrowful tears when she suddenly heard a noise at the courtyard gate. Looking out, she saw Baochai coming out, escorted by Baoyu, Xi Ren, and a group of others. Just as someone was about to ask Baoyu about something, they feared that questioning him in front of everyone might embarrass him. So they stepped aside and allowed Baochai to approach. Baoyu and the others went inside and closed the door. Then Baochai turned back; as she gazed toward the door, a few tears fell from her eyes. Feeling that life had lost its flavor, she turned and returned, her makeup carelessly removed. Ever since long ago, Zijuan and Xueyan—who had long understood Daiyu’s sensitive nature—had habitually sat in silence. They were either lost in frowns or deep in sighs, and for reasons unknown they would often weep without drying their tears. In the past, people had attempted to comfort her with kind words—fearing that thoughts of her parents and home might cause her further distress—but over the course of a year, such scenes had become so familiar that no one bothered to offer consolation any longer. They left her to sit alone in silence while they went off to do their own business. Daiyu, leaning against the bed’s railing with her arms wrapped around her knees and tears brimming in her eyes—as if she were a carved figure of wood or molded clay—remained seated until well past the second watch of the night before finally falling asleep. Not a word was spoken throughout that long, silent night. The next day turned out to be April 26th—by tradition, the end of the Grain in Ear (Mangzhong) season. According to ancient custom, on the day marking the close of Mangzhong, one must arrange an array of gifts and hold a farewell ceremony for the Flower God; for once Mangzhong passes, summer begins, all the blossoms wilt, and the Flower God abdicates his throne. In the inner chambers, this custom was especially popular, so everyone in the Grand View Garden rose early. The young ladies, some having fashioned sedan chairs from flower petals and willow twigs, others having assembled banners from layers of woven brocade and gauze, all tied these items with colored strings. Every treetop and every flower branch was adorned with these festive ornaments. The garden was awash with fluttering embroidered ribbons and flamboyant floral branches; the maidservants, dressed like blushing peaches and demure apricots, stirred up such an array that one could hardly describe it all. Meanwhile, Baochai, Yingchun, Tanchun, Xichun, Li Zhi, Feng Jie, along with the eldest sister, Xiangling, and the other maids were all playing in the garden—except for Daiyu. Yingchun remarked, “Where’s Lin Daiyu? What a lazy maid; could she still be sleeping at this hour?” Baochai replied, “Just wait, I’m going to rouse her.” With that, she left the group and headed straight for Xiaoxiang Pavilion.
Looking for an exit, he found none; to his left was a bookcase and to his right a screen. Just as he found a door behind the screen, an old woman came in from outside. Startled, Old Liu, in a daze, wondered, “Could this be my mother-in-law?” and asked, “You too have come? I hear I haven’t been home these past few days? How fortunate you found me—was it that young girl who brought you in?” Noticing that she wore a head full of flowers, he teased, “You really haven’t seen the world! Look at these flowers—surely you must be adorned head to toe!” The old woman only smiled without replying. Old Liu reached out to playfully pinch her cheek, and she responded with a hand of her own; soon the two were in playful scuffle. Suddenly, Old Liu’s hand landed, and he felt her cheek was as cold and firm as ice—a shock that made him recoil. He suddenly recalled, “I’ve often heard that wealthy families have a dressing mirror of this sort—is this not the mirror I see now?” After a moment’s thought he swiped his hand again and took a closer look. Sure enough, it was a carved, hollow panel with a mirror embedded in the center—and he couldn’t help but laugh. “How on earth does one get out of here?” he mused. While he was feeling around, he heard a clicking sound—“clack-clack”—and was startled as a Western-style mechanism, designed to open and close, was activated by his fumbling; the mirror slid aside, revealing a door. Old Liu, both astonished and delighted, stepped out and soon encountered a remarkably exquisite bed canopy. Now, having imbibed several more portions of wine and feeling exhausted, he collapsed onto the bed. He intended only to rest for a while, but before he knew it he was contorting and rolling about, his eyes clouded, and soon he fell asleep in a heap. Meanwhile the others, noticing his absence—Old Liu was nowhere to be seen—began to worry. Ban’er cried out in alarm. The guests teased, “Did he fall into the latrine? Send someone to look for him!” Two old maids were ordered to search. They returned saying, “He’s not here.”  Perplexed, everyone began to wonder. Finally, Xiangyun thought, “He must have gotten so drunk that he lost his way, following this path into our rear courtyard. If he goes through the flower barrier and enters by the back door, the little maids will know. But if he doesn’t, and instead wanders further southwest, he might be well and truly lost. I’ll go look for him.” And with that she set off. After a while, she entered the Yíhóng Courtyard and called out—but to her surprise, the few little maids had already slipped away to play. Xiǎo Yín entered a room, turned past a woven screen, and was met by thunderous snoring. She hurried in and was greeted by the reek of stale alcohol. Glancing about, she found Old Liu wildly flailing on a bed. Startled, Xiǎo Yín rushed over to wake him. Old Liu, suddenly awakened and blinking, saw Xiǎo Yín and quickly got up, exclaiming, “Miss, I’m doomed! At least I haven’t soiled the bed!” As he spoke he brushed himself off. Fearing to wake Baoyu, Xiǎo Yín signaled him with a wave to remain silent. She then fetched a large cauldron containing three or four handfuls of lily incense, and covered him with a lid. Fortunately, he did not vomit. Quietly, she smiled and said, “Never mind—I'm here. Come with me.”  Old Liu agreed and followed her out to the little maids’ room. She had him sit down and then instructed him, “Just say, ‘I fell asleep on the rocks and took a little nap’ and that’s that.”  Old Liu replied, “Yes.” Then she served him two bowls of tea, and he slowly felt the alcohol wear off. Looking around, he asked, “Whose embroidered room is this? It is so exquisite—I feel as though I have entered the palace of heaven.”  Xiǎo Yín smiled faintly, “That, sir, is actually the bedroom of Second Young Master Bao.”  Old Liu was so startled he dared not utter another word.
You needn’t worry. If I’d sent any of the young maids, they might misunderstand your instructions, leading to mistakes. Better that I come.”  Lady Wang nodded:  “I wasn’t calling for anything special—just to ask how his pain is. Has it eased some?” Xi Ren said,  “Miss Bao brought a special remedy. I applied it, so he’s better. Before, the pain kept him from lying still, but now he’s dozed off, so likely it’s taking effect.” Lady Wang asked, “Has he eaten?”  Xi Ren answered, “Grandmother prepared a broth; he only had two mouthfuls. Then he asked for sour-plum juice. But I worried it might aggravate his pent-up heat inside, so I dissuaded him. Instead, I made a small bowl of sweet rose infusion, but he said it tasted dull.”  Lady Wang exclaimed, “Oh dear—you should have told me earlier. I have a few bottles of fragrant syrups that were gifted recently. I was going to give him some but worried it might be wasted. Go ahead and take two bottles. Just a spoonful in a bowl of water yields a marvelous flavor.”  She ordered the maid Caiyun to fetch them. Xi Ren said, “Two bottles is plenty. If we need more, we can always come get them.” Caiyun went off, returning after a while with two miniature glass bottles, each about three inches tall, with silver screw caps. One read “Osmanthus Dew,” the other “Rose Dew.” Xi Ren laughed:  “Such precious things—these little flasks must not hold much!” Lady Wang told her, “They’re imperial tributes—see the canary-yellow label? Guard them well so they’re not wasted.”  Xi Ren promised to do so and started to go, but Lady Wang called her back:  “Wait. I have one more question.” So Xi Ren came near. Seeing the room empty, Lady Wang asked:  “I seem to recall hearing that the reason Baoyu was beaten—besides the matter of that Prince’s actor—was because Huan mentioned something. Did you catch wind of that?” Xi Ren said, “I only heard it was because of the missing performer, that’s all. Any other reason, I wouldn’t know.” She paused, looking hesitant, then ventured,  “Forgive my boldness in your presence, but . . . truly, to speak bluntly. . . .” She trailed off. Lady Wang encouraged her: “Go on, speak plainly.”  Xi Ren said, “You won’t be angry? Then—I must say: It’s not necessarily a bad thing that the Master spanked Baoyu. If the Master never disciplined him, who knows what havoc he’d eventually cause?”  Hearing these words, Lady Wang nodded sadly and sighed. She took Xi Ren’s hand: “My child, how well you speak. Exactly my own thinking. Indeed, do you imagine I don’t realize Baoyu needs strict guidance? But consider. In former times, when Zhu was alive, I kept my sons well in hand. Now, with only Baoyu left, and he so delicate—plus the Old Ancestor dotes on him so. If I restrain him too severely, suppose something befalls him, or the Old Ancestor is upset. Then who’s to blame? That’s why we end up spoiling him. I often scold him, beseech him in tears. He listens for a moment, then soon reverts. In the end, not until he experiences real suffering does he seem moved. But if he were to be beaten so badly that he’s crippled, who can I rely on? He’s all I have!” She too was moved to tears. Seeing Lady Wang so affected, Xi Ren felt her own eyes prickle, and tears fell. She said:  “It’s only natural a mother would love her child, but we servants who attend him daily also yearn for a peaceful outcome. If matters escalate, even peace is lost. Every day I implore him, but he won’t be awakened. Moreover, certain others encourage him, and so how can we blame only him? We try, yet it’s sometimes unwelcome. Today you bring it up, so I’ll speak of one concern in particular, hoping you can decide.
I’m afraid, though, that he might end up saving himself more by staying put,” Baochai observed thoughtfully. After a long pause, Aunt Xue agreed, “It’s as you say. Spending a little money to teach him some manners is worthwhile.” Their discussion ended without further words. The next day, Aunt Xue (or “Aunt Yita”) summoned Zhang Dehui to the study. She ordered that Xue Pan be treated to wine and a meal. Meanwhile, she positioned herself in the back corridor by a window, speaking in earnest to Zhang Dehui and imploring him to look after Xue Pan. Zhang Dehui promised in full, finishing the meal and then saying, “The fourteenth day is an auspicious day for travel. Our esteemed brother will prepare his luggage and hire mules so that he may set out at dawn on the fourteenth.” Xue Pan was overjoyed and promptly reported this to his mother. Aunt Xue, Baochai, Xiangling, and two elderly maids and young maids busied themselves for several days preparing for the journey. They assigned one of Xue Pan’s “old servant” (the one responsible for his milk delivery) and two veteran servants familiar with old customs. In all, there were six attendants. They hired three large carts solely for moving luggage, and also hired four sturdy mules. Xue Pan rode a sturdy, dark-blue mule bred in the household, while an extra riding horse was arranged. Once all was in order, Aunt Xue and Baochai spent the night admonishing him (words need not be repeated here). On the thirteenth day, Xue Pan first bade farewell to his maternal uncle, then went to bid farewell to the Jia family. Jia Zhen and others made a few parting remarks; details need not be recounted. Finally, on the morning of the fourteenth, Aunt Xue, Baochai, and the others escorted Xue Pan out of the ceremonial gate—while his mother and his younger sister’s four eyes watched him leave and then return. Aunt Xue’s retinue from the capital consisted of only four or five households, along with two or three elderly maids and a few young girls. Now, having accompanied Xue Pan away, only one or two men remained outside. Thus, that very day Aunt Xue went to the study and had all the furnishings, playthings, curtains, and such moved inside and stored away. She then ordered the wives of the two men who had accompanied them to come in and sleep. She further instructed Xiangling to tidy up his room and “lock the door—so that at night you can sleep with me.” Baochai said, “Since Mother has these people to keep her company, why not ask Sister Ling and me to accompany her? Our garden is empty, and as the night grows long, if I work all night, adding another companion would only be better.” Aunt Xue laughed, “That’s right—I almost forgot. I should have asked you earlier. I even told your brother the other day: ‘Wen Xing is still young; he won’t last long; Ying’er by herself isn’t enough to serve, so you must also buy a maid for assistance.’” Baochai replied, “We need to find one who is reliable; if we get the wrong one, it’s a small expense, but it’s best to take our time and, if someone with a proven background is found, purchase her.” With that, she ordered Xiangling to pack up the bedding and furniture and have an elderly maid and Zhen’er deliver them to the Hengwú Courtyard; then Baochai and Xiangling returned to the garden. Xiangling said to Baochai, “I originally planned to speak with Madam later, once Grandfather had left, so that we might be companions. I feared Madam might suspect that I was simply coming to loaf about in the garden—but you ended up mentioning it.” Baochai laughed, “I know you’ve long envied this garden for more than just a day or two, but you never had the leisure to enjoy it fully. Coming here every day in a rush is no fun. So take this opportunity and settle in for a year—then you’ll have more companions, and your heart’s desire will be fulfilled.” Xiangling replied, “Dear sister, then teach me how to compose poetry!” Baochai laughed, “You say you’re ‘always seeking more’—I advise you to slow down.
Today, as I rest at my desk, I recalled how, in ancient times, men of letters and official ranks, though occupying the arenas of fame and competition, would yet carve out some small corner of mountains and waters, gathering a few kindred souls, inviting guests near and far, and establishing some circle or society—be it for writing or banquets—though spontaneous, it often yielded wonders that last through the ages. I, though unworthy, happen to share in the Garden’s scenic leisure, along with the refined company of the Xue and Lin cousins. Such breezy patios and moonlit halls, we lament not having feasts of poets. Streams of apricot trees, banks of peach blossoms—why not indulge in wine and freewheeling verse? It’s said men’s ‘Lotus Society’ is esteemed for its heroic talents—should only be for them, leaving us womenfolk aside? If you, dear brother, would take pity on me and come, I’d humbly sweep the flowers in welcome. Respectful greetings. Reading this, Baoyu couldn’t help clapping his hands and laughing:  “Splendid, Third Sister has real taste! Let’s do it— let me hurry to discuss it with the others.” Handing the note to a nearby maid, he dashed off with Cui Mo. Passing the Qinfang Pavilion, an old gate-warden woman approached from the back gate, carrying a letter:  “It’s from Cousin Yu (Jia Yun). He’s waiting outside, paying respects. He asked me to deliver this to you.” Baoyu opened it:  Your unworthy son Yun, respectfully greets Father: Ever since you magnanimously acknowledged me, day and night I think of how to fulfill my filial duty, yet find no way to repay your kindness. Some time ago, handling the purchase of flowers and plants, by Heaven’s grace I made acquaintance with many horticulturists and discovered many noted gardens. One day, encountering an extremely rare type of white begonia, I contrived countless methods to procure just two pots. If you, father, will accept me as truly your own child, please take these and enjoy them. As it’s still hot weather, and the young ladies in the Garden might be inconvenienced, I dared not come in personally, but instead sent a note of respectful greeting. I humbly kneel. Baoyu read, laughed, and asked the old woman:  “Has he come alone? Did he bring the flowers?” She replied, “Yes, two pots of them.” Baoyu said, “Alright, tell him I understand, I appreciate his kindness. Place them in my rooms.”  And so, continuing with Cui Mo, he arrived at Tanchun’s Autumn Fresh Hall, only to find Baochai, Daiyu, Yingchun, and Xichun already there. Seeing him come, all laughed, “Here’s another one!” Tanchun herself remarked:  “I had the notion to form a little circle. I wrote you all a note, and see, not one has declined. This show that my single summon enticed them all.” Baoyu grinned, “If we’d done this earlier in spring, we could have formed a club. Now in the autumn, we’re a bit late.” Daiyu said, “It’s not too late. No regrets. Just you, don’t keep pushing me—I dare not join.” Yingchun teased, “If you’re too shy, who dares join?” Baoyu said, “This is a serious undertaking, let’s all share ideas. No modest disclaimers. Everyone speak—Sister Bao, Sister Lin, propose something.” Baochai said, “Why hurry? We’re missing a few people.”  Just then Li Wan arrived, remarking, “Oh dear—how refined! Forming a Poetry Club, I claim the leading seat. Last spring, I had half a mind for it. But I can’t compose verses well, so I kept quiet. Now that Third Sister’s raised the idea, let me come help see it done.”  Daiyu teased, “Yes, but first we must discard old forms of address, so we call each other poet-ladies instead of the usual sister or aunt. Or at least adopt courtesy names, so it’s not so mundane.” Li Wan nodded, “Indeed.
So now you want me to do more for him? What am I, your slave?”  Baoyu intervened, “I didn’t know it was your workmanship at the time.”  Xi Ren likewise: “He truly had no idea it was yours. I tricked him, telling him, ‘We found a new craftswoman outside—her skill is truly splendid, so we tested one piece, a fan case, to see if it’s any good.’ He believed it and showed it to folks. Somehow that offended someone else, who tore it up. Later, when he wanted another made, I revealed it was your handiwork—he was mortified. Pardon us.”  Xiangyun laughed, “The culprit is none other than Miss Lin, I guess. She’s hardly reason to fuss over my trifling work. If she’s so adept, let her do the handiwork!”  Xi Ren said, “It’s not that. She rarely does needlework these days. The old lady fears it might tire her, and her doctors say she needs calm rest. She rarely even picks up a needle. Last year she spent all year making a scented pouch for him. Half a year into this year, she hasn’t touched a thread.”  Just then, a servant arrived: “Master invites Second Master—someone from Xinglong Street is here.”  Baoyu knew it must be the newly arrived official, Jia Yucun, so he frowned. Xi Ren rushed to fetch his robe. He grumbled while pulling on his boots, “There’s Father with him, so why call me? Must I greet that man every time?”  Xiangyun fanned herself, quipping, “It’s only natural that you meet important guests. Or your father wouldn’t summon you.”  Baoyu scowled, “It’s not he wants me. That man demands to see me.”  Xiangyun teased, “The adage says: ‘A cultured master invites many guests.’ He must admire your brilliance. You do have a special knack for pleasing, I guess.”  Baoyu retorted, “Please—save it. I’m the most mediocre of all, no interest in officialdom or associating with such people.”  Xiangyun shook her head in good humor, “Still your old ways. You’re grown now, and even if you don’t want to be a scholar or official, you should meet men of rank, discuss administrative matters, and build up a circle. If you spend your days only among us girls, what can come of that?”  Her words rankled Baoyu. He said sharply, “You’d best go chat in another room, or you’ll end up stifled by my ignorance!” Xi Ren, attempting to defuse the tension, explained, “Cousin Xiang, better not talk politics around him. Last time Miss Bao remarked something similar, and he stormed off, leaving her embarrassed.”  Baoyu said, “Now you see how I label such talk as nonsense. If Lin cousin ever uttered such nonsense, I’d have kept her at a distance, too.”  Hearing that, Xiangyun and Xi Ren both chuckled ironically, “So talk of ‘statecraft’ is nonsense?”  It happened that Lin Daiyu was drawing near, suspecting that with Xiangyun here, Baoyu would come around to discuss the golden qilin or some such trifling token. She had read enough “frivolous romances” in which minor tokens—jade ornaments, gold trinkets, embroidered sashes—led to fated couplings. Concerned that Baoyu and Xiangyun might form the sort of “talented scholar and beautiful maiden” scenario, she’d quietly approached to observe. But what she actually heard was Xiangyun extolling “managing finances” (jingji) to Baoyu, and then Baoyu telling Xi Ren, “Lin cousin never utters such rubbish. If she did, we’d become estranged.”  This statement pierced Daiyu’s heart with mingled joy and sorrow. She mused: He truly is my confidant, praising me in front of others and never minding suspicion. But if he’s wholeheartedly for me, why the persistent talk of “gold and jade,” or the presence of Sister Bao?
. . well, I might want many.” Yinger teased, “Then I’ll be at it for ten years!” Baoyu laughed, “Sweet sister, you have nothing else to do, so might as well.” Xi Ren joked, “We’ll do some essential ones first, not an endless variety.” Yinger nodded: “Sure, probably for fans, scent pouches, and handkerchief ties?” Baoyu said, “Focus on handkerchief ties.” Yinger asked, “Which color is the hankie?” “Bright red,” he replied. “Then black or deep blue sets it off.” Baoyu wondered, “And if the silk is pine-green?” “Match it with pink,” Yinger answered. “Oh, that’s quite dainty indeed,” Baoyu said. “Though I love some faintly-lush color, you suggest onion-green with willow-yellow. That might be elegantly muted.” Yinger replied, “Yes, or peach pink.” Baoyu said, “I do like that. Let’s do both.”  So Yinger started. She also described certain patterns: “A Single Incense Stick,” “The Rising Stool,” “Elephant-Eye Blocks,” “Fangsheng,” “Linked Rings,” “Plum Blossoms,” “Willow Leaves,” and so forth. Baoyu recalled, “What did you do for Third Sister Tanchun the other day?” Yinger said, “It was the ‘Gathered-Heart Plum Blossom.’” “Yes, that’s lovely—do that,” said Baoyu. At that moment, Xi Ren came in with thread, then someone outside announced, “It’s mealtime.” Yinger insisted Xi Ren and the others go eat, while she kept on twisting cords. Thus Baoyu reclined, content to watch Yinger tying cords while they chatted. He asked her age, her surname. Hearing “Huang,” he joked that it fit well with her name “Oriole (Yinger).” She teased back that her name used to be Jin Ying, “Golden Oriole,” but her mistress shortened it. Baoyu teased: “Our Sister Bao must be very fond of you. When she marries, I bet you’ll go with her.” Yinger only smiled, while Baoyu bantered, “I often tell your older maids that whoever’s fated to have Mistress and her maid both is quite lucky.” Yinger laughed, “Miss has many hidden virtues, but you can’t guess them all.” Baoyu’s curiosity piqued. “Tell me everything.” She lowered her voice: “But promise you won’t let her know I said it.” He swore secrecy, and they chatted on. Just then, they heard someone outside remark: “Why is it so quiet in here?” Turning, they saw it was Baochai herself. Baoyu quickly invited her to sit. She noticed Yinger in mid-lacing. “What’s so interesting about cords?” she mused. “Might as well tie one around your jade.” That reminded Baoyu: “Brilliant suggestion! But which colors would suit my jade best?” Baochai said, “Never pure black or scarlet, or you’ll overshadow the jade’s own color. Better use your gold thread with blackish beads, plait them together for a refined look.” Baoyu was delighted, calling Xi Ren for the gold thread. Just then, Xi Ren came back in, carrying two dishes, puzzling over them: “Strange. Lady Wang had them delivered just to me—by name—and didn’t even call me over to thank her. How odd.” Baochai laughed, “It’s just a small token—why overthink?” Xi Ren sighed, “I’m not used to such direct gifts.” Baochai, half smiling, said, “If this embarrasses you, then just wait. Perhaps you’ll have bigger embarrassments soon.” Xi Ren, recalling Lady Wang’s hints the other day, colored and fell silent.
Baoyu, out of sorts, spoke little. Lady Wang, guessing he felt awkward about “yesterday’s business with Jin Chuan’er,” barely acknowledged him. Daiyu, for her part, assumed Baoyu was glum over how he’d offended Baochai, so she herself kept aloof; her manner, too, was listless. Wang Xifeng, aware of how Lady Wang disliked any mention of the matter, likewise avoided jokes and kept quiet. Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun, seeing everyone so subdued, also lost interest, and they all dispersed early. Daiyu, by nature, disliked gatherings. As she often reasoned:  “If there’s an assembly, it must at some point disperse. You enjoy the bustle for a time, but then the quiet after everyone leaves can be so desolate—why not avoid these gatherings altogether? It’s like a blossom: lovely while in bloom, yet withers to become a source of sorrow. Better if it had never bloomed.” And so, she remained indifferent. But Baoyu, who liked constant gatherings and lamented the inevitable dispersal, felt especially morose as the party ended so soon. He went back to his room, sighing deeply. Happening to see him in one of his pensive moods, the maid Qingwen came in to change clothes. By chance, she fumbled and dropped a fan, snapping one of its ribs. Baoyu, startled, blurted:  “How careless—just as I was lamenting, you go and break that fan. Someday, if you have a household of your own, will you manage it so carelessly?” Qingwen, feeling stung, gave a cold laugh, “You’ve grown quite harsh lately—always scolding. Just the other day, you even struck Xi Ren. Now, over a broken fan, you blow up again. Why the fuss? It’s only a fan. Far bigger things have been broken before—porcelain jars or glass bowls—and you never gave a second thought. So why erupt now? Maybe you’re tired of us—fine, then dismiss us kindly. No need for a tantrum!”  Her words angered Baoyu so much he shook all over. “Then you had better leave soon enough,” he seethed. “If you despise me that badly, tomorrow I’ll see you’re thrown out.” Xi Ren, overhearing from the next room, rushed in:  “What’s going on, for heaven’s sake? I step away a moment and it’s all raised voices.” Qingwen sneered, “Oh, Sister Xi Ren, how convenient you show up—everyone praises your skill at waiting upon him! Yet you got kicked the other day. Now it’s my turn for scolding. If he’s so fed up with me, let him strike me or dismiss me. Just do it properly and be done!”  Hearing Xi Ren’s name, Baoyu realized how his ill-temper with Xi Ren might re-emerge. Furious at the tumult, he snapped:  “If you’re so unhappy, then indeed, I’ll speak to Mistress tomorrow and send you away. Might that suit you? I cannot stand this endless quarreling—life was never this full of bickering!” Xi Ren tried restraining him:  “You mustn’t bring the Mistress into it. With strangers listening, you’ll only upset her, and it does neither you nor Qingwen any good. Let’s solve it quietly, or you’ll only make everything worse.” Qingwen choked back tears:  “I never said I wanted to go. But a few scoldings, or a mere broken fan, and you talk of sending me away? Fine—go, get the Mistress. I can throw myself against a wall and die if I must, but I won’t step out of these gates by choice!” Seeing how dire this had become, Baoyu muttered, “I am sick of it. Perhaps I’ll go to Mistress so it’s over with.” Xi Ren dropped to her knees, pleading, “If you won’t relent for my sake, then think about the gossip—this is no small scene. Wait until tempers cool; we can talk it through. Must you rush to blow it up?”  Baoyu, seeing Xi Ren kneel, was taken aback.
For instance, that Qiguan: I saw him many times, yet he never grew close with me. But after meeting Baoyu once or twice, they exchange scarves. Was that my doing?” This only reinforced Aunt Xue and Baochai’s impression that Xue Pan had caused the fiasco. So Xue Pan lamented, “I’m simply outraged—everyone orbits Baoyu’s dramas!” Baochai teased, “You’re the one brandishing weapons. Who’s making more fuss?”  Seeing that reason served no further use, Xue Pan left. Baochai felt wounded and furious, but disinclined to upset her mother further. She stifled her anger, parted from Aunt Xue, and cried silently through the night. The next morning, with eyes swollen from tears, she neglected her usual grooming, threw on random clothes, and went out. She chanced upon Daiyu alone under the shade of some blossoms. Daiyu, noticing her weary expression and tear-swollen eyes—so unlike her usual calm—asked, “Sister, where are you going?”  “Heading home,” Baochai said curtly, continuing on. Daiyu noted the signs of weeping, so she called after her with a faint laugh:  “Sister, do take care of yourself. Weeping two barrels of tears won’t heal someone else’s bruises!” What did Baochai answer in return? That, dear reader, awaits our next chapter. Chapter 35 In Passion’s Realm, Tender Care Moves the Younger Cousin; Amid Wrong upon Wrong, an Elder Brother Gains Some Counsel  It came about that, once Baochai had clearly heard Lin Daiyu’s biting words toward her, her mind turned to her mother and brother, and she left without looking back. Daiyu remained under the shadow of the flowers, gazing from a distance toward the Garden of Illusion (Yihong Court). She watched as Li Wan, Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun—all accompanied by maids—went in to see Baoyu. Then one group after another drifted away, yet she saw no sign of Wang Xifeng. To herself she speculated: “Why has she not come to check on Baoyu? Even if something has kept her, she normally would show off a bit, or curry favor with the Old Ancestor and Aunt Wang. If she still hasn’t come by now, there must be some particular reason.”  While thus guessing and wondering, she lifted her eyes once more toward Baoyu’s place. There she spotted another crowd—Old Madam Jia supported by Fengjie’s hand, followed by Lady Xing, Lady Wang, then Aunt Zhou, plus a retinue of maids and older women, all entering the courtyard of Yihong. Daiyu looked on, then nodded reflectively. Recalling the blessings of having both parents alive—though she herself had none—she was moved to tears yet again. After a moment, she saw Aunt Xue and Baochai also head in. Just then, Zicjuan came up behind her, saying, “Miss, time for your medicine. The hot water’s going to cool.” Daiyu responded, “Why must you keep rushing me? What is it to you whether I do or don’t take it?” Zicjuan smiled: “You only just got rid of your cough, yet skip your medication. True, it’s the fifth lunar month and the weather is hot, but you still must be careful. You’ve been standing here on damp ground half the day. Maybe you should go rest.” Her words reminded Daiyu that her legs felt a little stiff. After standing a while longer, she finally leaned on Zicjuan and returned to the Naiad’s House (Xiaoxiang Pavilion). Arriving in her courtyard, they saw the uneven shadows of bamboo scattered across the ground, moss thickly or lightly marking the way. Daiyu’s mind lit on two lines from Romance of the Western Chamber:  “In such a deserted spot, can anyone pass by? The moss grows thick, and the dew is piercingly chill.” She mused that even the tragic figure of Double-Wen (Shuangwen) from that story at least had a widowed mother and younger brother. “But as for me, Daiyu, with my wretched fate, I have neither father nor mother nor siblings at all.” At that thought, tears welled anew.
After checking herself in the mirror, she noticed that her temples were a little disheveled. Hastily, she opened Li Wan’s makeup box, took out her brush, dabbed at her face a couple of times, and then tidied herself up before coming out and pointing at Li Wan, saying, “I asked you to have us do our needlework and learn proper conduct—but instead, you’ve brought us here for a great laugh!”  Li Wan laughed, “Listen to his sly words—he’s the one stirring up the mischief and drawing the laughter, so it must be my fault! I truly detest it… I only hope that tomorrow you get a formidable mother-in-law and a few shrewish elder and younger sisters-in-law—then let’s see if you’ll still be so sly!”  Daiyu’s face turned even redder as she pulled Baochai aside and said, “Let’s grant him a year’s leave.”  Baochai replied, “I have a fair word: listen well. Although Lóu Yatou is adept at painting, her style is merely freehand sketching. But painting this garden—if one does not have the profound feeling of nature’s undulations in one’s heart—how can it become a true work of art? This garden is like a painting: its mountains, rocks, trees, pavilions, and houses, the spacing and arrangement, are just so—not too many, not too few. Yet if you try to replicate it on paper exactly, it will never please. One must consider the scale of the paper, what to emphasize and what to omit; the host and the guests must be arranged in due measure. One must add what is needed and hide what is best reduced; reveal only what must be revealed. Only after all these are carefully drafted and examined can a proper pattern emerge. Second, these pavilions and houses must be delineated with precision. With the slightest negligence, the railings will skew, the pillars collapse, the doors and windows tilt, the steps lose their alignment—and soon the entire work becomes a laughingstock. Third, when inserting figures, one must observe their spacing, height, drapery, gestures, and footwork. The most crucial detail is that if even one stroke is imprecise, one ends up with swollen hands or a lopsided gait; facial makeup or disheveled hair is trivial in comparison. In my view, it is extremely difficult. Granting him a year’s leave is too generous, a month is too little—perhaps we should give him six months; and even assign Brother Bao to assist him. Not so that Brother Bao will be found teaching him to paint—that would only spoil the work further—but so that, in case anyone is uncertain or finds difficulty with placement, Brother Bao can consult with skilled painters and ease the task.”  Baoyu, delighted, exclaimed, “That is absolutely right! Mr. Zhan Ziliang’s meticulous pavilions are exquisite, and Mr. Cheng Rixing’s beauties are unparalleled—let’s consult them!”  Baochai said, “I think you’re just ‘busy doing nothing’—you mention it, and then ask them, but wait for everything to be arranged before proceeding. For now, what shall we use to paint?”  Baoyu replied, “We have Xuelang paper at home—large sheets that hold ink well.”  Baochai sneered, “You’re hopeless! Xuelang paper is used for calligraphy or freehand landscapes—especially for the Southern School of landscape painting. With ink alone, it hardly accepts textures; and if you try to paint without using colors, it is difficult to fire, and neither the painting nor the paper is worth much. Let me give you a method. Originally, when this garden was built, there was a detailed design, even if executed freehand, the scale and proportions were correct. If you and Madame Wang step out and compare that design with a piece of heavy silk from Sister Feng, have the gentry outside make a draft according to that pattern, adding figures as needed, it will be acceptable. Of course, if you want to add the green hues and even embellish with gold and silver paste, they will have to be added. You’ll also need a furnace for preparing glue, extra glue, and brushes to wash. You must have a large table for grinding pigments, laid out with felt. Many of your small dishes are missing, and so are your brushes—start anew with a complete set.”  Xīchūn said, “I’ve never owned such painting implements; I only use what’s at hand.
I have always felt unique, and I feared that my heart might be as solitary as yours. But alas, all my heartfelt endeavors have been in vain—with grievances left unspoken!” As he spoke, tears began to well in his eyes. Daiyu, hearing these words and witnessing his state, felt her own heart grow heavy and tears welled without her control; she lowered her head and said nothing. Seeing her like this, Baoyu added, “I know I am not well these days, but no matter how poorly I fare, I dare not make any mistake before you, dear sister. Even if I err by a small fraction, if you would scold or even beat me, I would not lose heart. Yet you never speak to me, leaving me utterly lost, with not a clue as to what I should do. Even if I die, I would die a death of disgrace—a wretched death from which, even if high monks and Taoists chant repentance, I cannot be reborn unless you explain the cause to me!” Daiyu, hearing this, forgot all about last night’s incident and said, “If you say so, then why is it that when I go, you won’t have the maid open the door for me?” Baoyu, startled, replied, “From where did you get that idea? If I did that, I’d be finished in an instant!” Daiyu spat, “You have no qualms—whether it happens or not, why must we swear oaths?” Baoyu said, “Truly, I never meant for you to leave; it was only when Sister Bao sat for a while that you emerged.” After pondering a bit, Daiyu smiled wryly, “Yes, it must be that the maids are too lazy to move, their voices slurred and off-key. That is understandable.” Baoyu replied, “It must be so. I shall ask when I return and have them properly reprimanded.” Daiyu said, “Your maidservants, too, should be given a good telling-off. But I mustn’t speak of it in detail. Today, the slight offense done to me—if tomorrow “Sister Bao” or “Sister Bei” should come and offend you, then the matter would be grave indeed.” She smiled demurely. Baoyu, hearing this, gritted his teeth and laughed. They conversed for a while until a maid came to call them for a meal, and together they went inside. At the meal, Lady Wang asked Daiyu, “Big daughter, do you find the medicine from Dr. Bao satisfactory?” Daiyu replied, “It’s… about as well as can be expected. The Old Lady even told me to take medicine prescribed by Dr. Wang.” Baoyu interjected, “The Mistress doesn’t know: Lin Daiyu suffers from an internal weakness, a congenital frailty that renders her susceptible to even a slight chill; yet if she takes two doses of a decoction to disperse the cold wind, it is best that she take the pill form.” Lady Wang said, “The other day, the doctor mentioned the name of a pill—I have forgotten it.” Baoyu said, “I know the pills; he tells her to take some kind of ginseng tonic pill.” Lady Wang replied, “That isn’t it.” Baoyu ventured, “Is it the Eight-Treasure Tonic Pill? Or perhaps the Left-Regulating, Right-Regulating pill? Or maybe the Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill?” Lady Wang answered, “None of those. I only recall that its name contains the characters ‘Diamond’ or ‘Vajra.’” Baoyu clapped his hands with a laugh, “I’ve never heard of a ‘Diamond Pill’! If there were such a thing, surely there would also be a ‘Bodhisattva Powder’!” His remark made the whole room burst into laughter. Baochai murmured with a smile, “Perhaps it is the Heavenly King’s Heart-Balm.” Lady Wang laughed, “That name indeed. I am now all confused.” Baoyu said, “It isn’t that Mistress is confused—it’s that when terms like ‘Diamond’ and ‘Bodhisattva’ are thrown about, everything becomes muddled.” Lady Wang snapped, “Damn you!
Have you taken your medicine? How many meals have you had today?” As he spoke, he removed his hat and raincoat. Lifting a lantern in one hand and shielding the light with the other, he examined Daiyu’s face and smiled, “You look much better today.”  Daiyu noted that beneath his raincoat he wore a half-worn short red silk jacket, tied with a green scarf, exposing green silk trousers decorated with scattered floral patterns, and below, a cotton gown embroidered with gilt thread and butterfly motifs, with delicate shoes. Daiyu inquired, “Weren’t you afraid of the rain? Yet your shoes and socks look so clean.”  Bao Yu replied with a smile, “This entire outfit is complete. I just got a new pair of tangwood clogs; I took them off under the eaves.”  Daiyu then examined his raincoat and hat, noting they were not of common market quality but finely made. “What kind of grass were they woven from? No wonder they don’t feel as prickly as others,” she observed. Bao Yu explained, “These three items were gifts from Prince Beijing. On rainy days he himself wears them at home. If you like them, I’ll have a set made for you. Everything else aside, it’s the hat that intrigues me most. The top part is adjustable—in winter when it snows, one removes the bamboo ties and uses just the rim; both men and women wear it. I’ll give you one to wear in winter.”  Daiyu laughed, “I don’t want that. Wearing it would make me look like one of those painted, theatrical fisherwomen.” As soon as she spoke, she realized her remark echoed Bao Yu’s earlier words; mortified, her face flushed scarlet, and she buried her face in the table, stifling sobs. Bao Yu, however, was oblivious. Noticing a poem on the table, he picked it up and read aloud, exclaiming his approval. Daiyu quickly snatched it from him and, in a burst of anger, almost set the lamp on fire. Bao Yu laughed, “I already memorized it!”  Daiyu said, “I’m tired now—please go on. I’ll come back tomorrow.”  Bao Yu then reached into his pocket and withdrew a walnut-sized gold watch. Glancing at its hands, which pointed between the hours of 7 and 8, he quickly tucked it away, saying, “I should let you rest; I’ve disturbed your peace all day.” With that, he donned his raincoat and hat once more, stepped out, then reentered and asked, “What would you like to eat? Tell me so that tomorrow when I return to Grandmother’s, I can be clear about it.”  Daiyu smiled, “I’ll think it over tonight and tell you in the morning. Listen—the rain is growing heavier. Hurry now. Is anyone with you?”  Two maids replied, “Yes, outside someone is holding an umbrella and lighting a lantern.”  Daiyu laughed, “That kind of lantern at this hour?”  Bao Yu said, “It doesn’t matter—it’s a ‘goat-horn’ style, not prone to damage by rain.”  Hearing this, Daiyu went to the bookshelf and took down a glass, embroidered-ball lantern, instructed someone to light a small candle, and handed it to Bao Yu, saying, “This one shines brighter—perfect for use in the rain.”  Bao Yu replied, “I have one just like that, but I’m afraid it might slip and break, so I didn’t light it.”  Daiyu said, “If the lantern falls, it’s the lantern that loses value—not the person. And you’re not accustomed to clogs anyway. Let those outside hold up the lantern; this one is light and bright—indeed, it’s my own. Bring it back tomorrow. Even if you drop it, it can’t be too serious—why, all of a sudden, you’ve developed a temperament like one who ‘splits her belly to hide pearls’!”  Bao Yu laughed and took the lantern. Ahead, two maids with umbrellas and goat-horn lanterns, and behind, two little maids with umbrellas, accompanied him.
Startled, Qingwen slipped out. Daiyu, smiling faintly, asked: “Why such tears on a festive day? Are you quarreling over who gets to eat the biggest dumpling?” Baoyu and Xi Ren, forced to laugh, tried to compose themselves. Daiyu teased Xi Ren: “Oh, dear sister-in-law—tell me, did you two have a couple’s spat? Let me mediate.” Xi Ren, blushing, waved her off: “Don’t joke, Miss. We’re only servants.” Daiyu responded with a grin, “But you are my sister-in-law, as I see it.” Baoyu interjected, “Now let’s not provoke talk. If folks overhear, it’ll cause more trouble for her.”  Xi Ren smiled, “Aye, if I truly offended you, let me die and be done.” Daiyu mock-sobbed, “If you died, I’d cry my own life away.” Baoyu added with a laugh, “If you died, I’d become a monk.” Xi Ren exclaimed, “That’s enough now!” Daiyu feigned annoyance, “Ah yes, you said that about me as well—how many times do you plan to become a monk?” She wiggled two fingers. Baoyu realized she was reminding him of his earlier vow and, feeling awkward, hastily changed the subject. Daiyu giggled, letting the matter drop, then left as well. Soon a servant announced, “Young Master Xue invites you.” Baoyu had no choice but to go, drinking with Xue Pan until evening. Returning with some drink in him, he headed to his courtyard. In the yard, stands and mats were arranged for fresh air, but on the main couch lay a person, apparently sleeping. Baoyu assumed it was Xi Ren and sat on the edge, patting her:  “Is your pain better now?” Startled, the person turned—Qingwen. “Hmph! Why are you bothering me?” Baoyu recognized her and, pulling her up, smiled: “How aloof you’ve grown! This morning you only broke a fan, I teased you a little, and you started talking about leaving. And you even snapped at Xi Ren, who was only trying to help. Was that fair?”  Qingwen responded, “It’s too hot for you to be grabbing me like this. Others might see. I’m just a maid, not worthy of sharing your couch.” Baoyu laughed, “If you knew it wasn’t your place, then why were you napping here?” Qingwen hesitated, then let out a giggle: “True enough. I’ll go wash up. Xi Ren and the others have all bathed; I must do the same. Let me fetch them.” Baoyu grinned, “I’ve had a fair bit to drink, so I’d like a wash as well. Why don’t we share water?” She smirked, “No, thanks. I recall how you once bathed for hours, flooding the floor! I’ll bring you water for your face, and get you some fruit from the crystal bowl.” Baoyu responded, “Fine. If you’re not bathing, at least wash your hands and peel me some fruit.” Qingwen laughed, “I’m a clumsy fool—just look how I snapped that fan. If I broke a plate or something, you’d scold me. Better not risk it.” Baoyu rejoined, “Don’t be silly. All these items are merely borrowed from the world. If you enjoy ripping a fan to hear the sound, so be it—just don’t do it in a rage. If you delight in the crash of porcelain, you might even break a dish. Just not from anger. That’s real cherishing: using them how you like.” Encouraged, Qingwen teased, “Is that so? Then hand me a fan to rip, so I can relish the sound!” Baoyu, in high spirits, offered her a fan. Taking it, she promptly tore it in two with a crisp “rip.” Baoyu clapped and laughed, “Marvelous—rip it louder!” She tore a few more times, sending fragments fluttering.
Besides, our household is notorious for its lawlessness. Mother only feels sorry because she’s worried. Once, when your brother recovered after several losses, those respectable men like Mr. Zhen and Jia Lian didn’t let him off lightly—and eventually someone had to apologize on his behalf.”  A few days later, Sè Pan lay in his room, cursing Xianglian, and even ordered his servant, “Go dismantle his house! Beat him to death and sue him!” But Sè Pan’s attendant was quickly hushed by Aunt Xue, who said, “Xianglian may have been rude while intoxicated, but now that he’s sober, he regrets his actions and is terrified of punishment.” Sè Pan, upon hearing this, realized his predicament. (How things ultimately resolve… we shall continue in the next installment.) Chapter 48 Excessive Passion Misleads One’s Pursuit of Leisure; The Cultivated Maiden, in Elegant Assembly, Sorrowfully Struggles to Compose Poetry  It happened that after hearing those words, Xue Pan’s anger gradually subsided. Three or five days later—though his pain had eased, and his wounds still had not fully healed—he pretended to be ill at home, ashamed to face his relatives and friends. Before long the calendar showed October. In the various shops, managers were busy settling their annual accounts and preparing farewell drinks for those returning home. One of these men, Zhang Dehui, who had long served as the overseer at Xue Pan’s pawnshop and now enjoyed a modest income of two or three thousand taels, announced that he, too, must return home this year and would only come back next spring. He said, “This year the supply of paper, letters, and spices is short—and next year they will be dearer. Next year, we’ll first send the younger ones up to manage the pawnshop; then before the Dragon Boat Festival, I can conveniently sell some paper, letters, and fans. After deducting the customs and expenses, I might even net a handsome profit.”  Xue Pan listened and mused privately, “Right now I’m beaten and barely able to face anyone. I plan to hide away for a year and a half—pretending to be ill every day is not a sustainable method. Besides, I’m already grown-up; I’m neither scholarly nor martial. Although I might engage in business, I’ve never held a proper abacus, nor do I know the local customs or the roads around. Perhaps I should invest some capital and accompany Zhang Dehui on a tour of the region. Whether we make money or not, at least I can hide away in shame; and touring the countryside isn’t a bad diversion.”  His mind was made up. After the banquet dispersed that evening, he calmly explained his plan to Zhang Dehui and arranged to set out together in a day or two. Later that night, Xue Pan told his mother. When Aunt Xue (Xue Yima) heard this, though she was pleased, she feared that he might stir up trouble while away—spending money would be a secondary matter. So she forbade him from going, saying, “You’d better stick with me; that way I’ll be more at ease. Besides, there’s no need for this business—how can a few hundred taels be so indispensable?”  But Xue Pan’s mind was set. “You always say I know nothing of worldly affairs—neither this nor that, never learning a thing. Now I’ve resolved to cut off all the trivial attachments. When I become an adult and set about my own affairs, I won’t be confined at home. Besides, Zhang Dehui is an established man of a reputable family. If I end up with no refuge when things go awry, he will naturally advise me. I need not trouble you; I’ll simply slip away without informing the family and come back next year a rich man,” he declared stubbornly, then went to sleep in a fit of anger. Aunt Xue, upon hearing his words, discussed the matter with Baochai. Baochai laughed and said, “Our brother is bound to encounter real matters one day—that’s fine. It’s just that when he speaks at home, his words sound grand; but out in the world his old ailments might return, and he’d be uncontrollable. Still, I don’t think it will matter much. If he really reforms, it will be a blessing for his whole life; if not, mother won’t have any other remedy.
Yours is far better, keep it for folks to see.”  Baochai said, “I’ll produce a forced piece, likely no good, but for a laugh.” She wrote:  **Seated amid cassia haze, beneath the phoenix-trees, I raise the cup; In Chang’an, drooling mouth awaits Double Ninth. Right before us, no clear lines or angles can be traced in the road— Within the shell, layered spring-autumn illusions, all emptily black and yellow. Wine hardly washes away the fishy stink, so we add chrysanthemum; We guard against chill by strong ginger. Now tossed into the pot, what use is that? The moonlit shores remain behind—where the millet and wheat still wave.” At this, everyone exclaimed, “This is the ultimate crab ode— these lines are meaningful indeed, though the satire is quite scathing.” They were discussing further when Ping’er re-entered the Garden. What was her errand? The next chapter shall disclose. Chapter 39:  The Old Village Woman Speaks Off the Cuff; The Young Gentleman Insists on Getting to the Bottom  Seeing that Ping’er had arrived, everyone asked, “What’s your mistress up to that she hasn’t come herself?”  Ping’er smiled. “She’s too busy. And since she didn’t get to eat enough earlier and couldn’t come over again, she asked me to find out if there are any left and if so, to ask for a few more to bring home.”  “Of course there are plenty!” Xiangyun said at once, motioning for someone to fill a box with ten of the largest ones. “Take a few round-bellied ones,” Ping’er requested. Everyone urged Ping’er to sit with them, but she demurred. Lady Li^1 noticed her reluctance, smiled, and said, “Oh no, you must sit!” She pulled her down beside herself, poured a cup of wine, and raised it to Ping’er’s lips. Ping’er quickly sipped it and was about to leave, but Li Wan insisted, “I won’t allow it. Apparently, you only obey Feng girl and not me.” So saying, she told the older women, “Take this box away for now and tell her I’ve kept Ping’er.”  Not long after, a maid returned with the box, saying, “Her Ladyship (Second Mistress) says: ‘Please don’t laugh at me for craving a few bites. Inside this box are some lotus-root-starch cakes and chicken-fat rolls from Aunt^2—do have some, ladies.’” She then turned to Ping’er: “And she said, ‘You ran off to gorge yourself, so don’t go overboard on the drinks.’”  Ping’er laughed, “What if I do overdo it? What could she do to me?” She went on drinking and eating crab as she spoke. Lady Li reached over to give her a playful hug, laughing, “Such a lovely face, such a fine figure, and yet you’re just a live-in maid! Anyone who didn’t know better would take you for a mistress.”  While Ping’er drank and chatted with Baochai, Xiangyun, and the others, she glanced back at Li Wan and joked, “Madam, please, this kind of touching is making me itch!”  Suddenly, Lady Li said, “Ah—what’s that stiff thing here?”  Ping’er replied, “It’s a key.”  “What can be so important you’re afraid someone will steal it, that you keep it on you?” Lady Li said. “All day long I tell people: for every Tang Monk traveling for scriptures, there’s a white horse to carry him; for every Liu Zhiyuan^3 founding a realm, there’s a melon sprite to present armor; for every Feng girl, there’s a you. You’re the master key to all her locks—why carry any other key at all?”  Ping’er laughed, “My lady’s had a bit of wine and is teasing me for fun.”  Baochai smiled, “But it’s true enough.
What is there to do?” Xi Ren’s own eyes brimmed with tears. Qingwen, too, had been crying, on the verge of speaking, when Daiyu entered. Startled, Qingwen slipped out. Daiyu, smiling faintly, asked: “Why such tears on a festive day? Are you quarreling over who gets to eat the biggest dumpling?” Baoyu and Xi Ren, forced to laugh, tried to compose themselves. Daiyu teased Xi Ren: “Oh, dear sister-in-law—tell me, did you two have a couple’s spat? Let me mediate.” Xi Ren, blushing, waved her off: “Don’t joke, Miss. We’re only servants.” Daiyu responded with a grin, “But you are my sister-in-law, as I see it.” Baoyu interjected, “Now let’s not provoke talk. If folks overhear, it’ll cause more trouble for her.”  Xi Ren smiled, “Aye, if I truly offended you, let me die and be done.” Daiyu mock-sobbed, “If you died, I’d cry my own life away.” Baoyu added with a laugh, “If you died, I’d become a monk.” Xi Ren exclaimed, “That’s enough now!” Daiyu feigned annoyance, “Ah yes, you said that about me as well—how many times do you plan to become a monk?” She wiggled two fingers. Baoyu realized she was reminding him of his earlier vow and, feeling awkward, hastily changed the subject. Daiyu giggled, letting the matter drop, then left as well. Soon a servant announced, “Young Master Xue invites you.” Baoyu had no choice but to go, drinking with Xue Pan until evening. Returning with some drink in him, he headed to his courtyard. In the yard, stands and mats were arranged for fresh air, but on the main couch lay a person, apparently sleeping. Baoyu assumed it was Xi Ren and sat on the edge, patting her:  “Is your pain better now?” Startled, the person turned—Qingwen. “Hmph! Why are you bothering me?” Baoyu recognized her and, pulling her up, smiled: “How aloof you’ve grown! This morning you only broke a fan, I teased you a little, and you started talking about leaving. And you even snapped at Xi Ren, who was only trying to help. Was that fair?”  Qingwen responded, “It’s too hot for you to be grabbing me like this. Others might see. I’m just a maid, not worthy of sharing your couch.” Baoyu laughed, “If you knew it wasn’t your place, then why were you napping here?” Qingwen hesitated, then let out a giggle: “True enough. I’ll go wash up. Xi Ren and the others have all bathed; I must do the same. Let me fetch them.” Baoyu grinned, “I’ve had a fair bit to drink, so I’d like a wash as well. Why don’t we share water?” She smirked, “No, thanks. I recall how you once bathed for hours, flooding the floor! I’ll bring you water for your face, and get you some fruit from the crystal bowl.” Baoyu responded, “Fine. If you’re not bathing, at least wash your hands and peel me some fruit.” Qingwen laughed, “I’m a clumsy fool—just look how I snapped that fan. If I broke a plate or something, you’d scold me. Better not risk it.” Baoyu rejoined, “Don’t be silly. All these items are merely borrowed from the world. If you enjoy ripping a fan to hear the sound, so be it—just don’t do it in a rage. If you delight in the crash of porcelain, you might even break a dish. Just not from anger. That’s real cherishing: using them how you like.” Encouraged, Qingwen teased, “Is that so? Then hand me a fan to rip, so I can relish the sound!” Baoyu, in high spirits, offered her a fan.
Perhaps in the future it will amount only to a modest dowry—but for now, it leaves me so vulnerable.”  Baochai laughed, “In the end, it will amount to nothing more than a small dowry—nothing to worry about.”  Daiyu blushed and said, “Others take you seriously enough to confide their burdens in you, yet you laugh at me!”  Baochai smiled, “Even if it is in jest, it is the honest truth. Don’t worry—I shall spend the day with you, and if you have any grievances or troubles, just tell me; I will do what I can. I have a brother, as you know, though he is somewhat better off than you—but we share in our hardships. We are, in a way, companions in suffering. You are an understanding person; why then resort to lamentations as grand as ‘Sima Niu’s lament’? Sometimes less is more. Tomorrow I’ll speak with my mother; I suspect we have some bird’s nest left over that I can give you. Have the maids prepare it—cheap and discreet—and it will do wonders.”  Daiyu smiled faintly, “It is a trifle—but I’m touched by your kindness.”  Later that day, Daiyu sipped a bowl of watery porridge while lying in bed. As dusk approached, the sky grew dark and a steady rain began. The autumn drizzle, soft yet unceasing, mingled with the rustle of bamboo and banana leaves, deepening the desolation. Knowing Baochai would not be coming, Daiyu retrieved a book from her bedside—a collection of miscellaneous tunes from the Music Bureau, including “Autumn Chamber Lament” and “Farewell Lament.” Moved by the sound of rain and overcome with emotion, she began composing a poem reminiscent of “A Moonlit Night on the Spring River.” She titled her work “Evening Wind and Rain at the Autumn Window.” The verses read:    Autumn blossoms wither, autumn grasses fade to yellow,   A solitary autumn lamp burns; the autumn night stretches on. Already the autumn window seems unending—how can I bear such chill? How swiftly the wind and rain bolster autumn’s cool, shattering my autumn dreams. Cradling autumn sorrow, I can’t bear to sleep; I light a candle by the screen. The candle flickers, its short wick trembling,   Illuminating my sorrow and anger, stirring my parting grief. In whose autumn courtyard does no wind intrude? In what place is there not the sound of autumn rain at the window? Even a woven quilt cannot resist the force of autumn wind,   While the tick-tock of a broken timepiece hastens the urgent autumn rain. All night long, the cold air murmurs and rushes—by the lamp, it seems to accompany a sorrowful parting. In a desolate courtyard veiled in faint smoke, through sparse bamboo and a vacant window,   I wonder: when will the wind and rain cease? Already tears have soaked the gauze of my window. After finishing her poem, Daiyu set her brush aside, planning to rest. Soon a maid announced, “Second Young Master Bao has arrived!” Before the announcement was finished, Bao Yu appeared—wearing a large straw hat and a raincoat. Daiyu couldn’t help but laugh, “From where has such a fisherman come?”  Bao Yu quickly inquired, “How are you today? Have you taken your medicine? How many meals have you had?” As he spoke, he removed his hat and raincoat. Lifting a lantern in one hand while shielding his face with the other, he examined Daiyu and said with a smile, “You look much better today.”  Daiyu observed that beneath his raincoat he wore a half-worn short red silk jacket fastened with a green scarf, revealing green silk trousers adorned with floral patterns; his cotton gown was embroidered with gilt thread and butterfly motifs. Daiyu asked, “Weren’t you afraid of the rain? Yet your shoes and socks look remarkably clean.”  Bao Yu laughed, “My whole outfit is complete. I just got a new pair of tangwood clogs and took them off under the eaves.”  Daiyu then inspected his raincoat and hat—these were not common market items but finely made. “What kind of grass were they woven from? No wonder they feel so gentle and not prickly,” she observed.
If I really had such airs, let me be struck dead right now. Look, is it not true that in all this hot weather, I came here first of all to see you? If you don’t believe me, ask Lü’er. At home, hardly an hour passes that I don’t think of you. Actually, that’s the truth!”  Baoyu and Xi Ren both laughed, urging, “Calm down, calm down. We’re only joking, but you’re taking it to heart. Still that same quick temper, we see.”  Xiangyun retorted, “He’s the one who needles me. You call me quick-tempered?”  As she spoke, she untied the silk cloth and handed a ring to Xi Ren. Xi Ren thanked her repeatedly, smiling: “So you remember me, after all. The other day, you gave rings to the other girls, and I received one from them, but now you’ve brought me one in person—I see how thoughtful you are. A trinket is a trinket, but it shows your sincere heart.”  Xiangyun asked, “Who gave it to you previously?”  Xi Ren said, “Miss Bao (Baochai) did.”  Xiangyun sighed, “So she’s the one who gave it. I was sure it was Miss Lin (Daiyu). Day in and day out, I keep telling people there’s truly no one kinder than Sister Bao. How sad we aren’t real sisters! If I only had a sister like that, no parents in the world wouldn’t matter.” Her eyes were reddening again. Baoyu interjected, “All right, no more talk about that.”  Xiangyun eyed him and teased, “I get it: you’re worried your dear Lin cousin might overhear me praising Bao sister. Are you afraid she’ll be displeased?”  Xi Ren, chuckling at Xiangyun’s frankness, said, “Miss Xiang, you’re older now, yet still so direct.”  Baoyu chimed in, “I always say trying to converse with you all is precarious.”  Xiangyun cut him short, “Dear older brother, spare me your words that give me gooseflesh. You only talk big in front of me, but with your Lin cousin—goodness knows how you sweet-talk her.”  Laughing, Xi Ren spoke up, “Let’s not banter. I do have a favor to ask of you, Miss Xiang. There’s a pair of shoes, and the insole has come loose. I’ve been under the weather and can’t manage the sewing. Could you find a moment to fix them?”  Xiangyun asked, “Why me? You have so many skilled seamstresses in your household. Why ask me to do your needlework?”  Xi Ren clarified with a smile, “You must know, in this room, Master Baoyu’s personal items are not made by outside needleworkers.”  Realizing these were for Baoyu, Xiangyun grinned, “Oh—so they’re his shoes, are they? Fine, I’ll do them for you, on one condition: that it’s your request. I can’t be saddled with tasks from everyone.”  Xi Ren laughed, “Where do you get your ideas? As if I’d trouble you for something of mine. Let me say plainly, yes, they are for him, but just accept my thanks, and never mind whose they are.”  Xiangyun teased, “I recall how much sewing I’ve done for you in the past. I’d do it, but you see, the reason I balk at sewing for him is that I heard the other day a fan case I’d made was compared with some other, and in a fit, it got snipped in two. So now you want me to do more for him? What am I, your slave?”  Baoyu intervened, “I didn’t know it was your workmanship at the time.”  Xi Ren likewise: “He truly had no idea it was yours. I tricked him, telling him, ‘We found a new craftswoman outside—her skill is truly splendid, so we tested one piece, a fan case, to see if it’s any good.’ He believed it and showed it to folks.
Soon, Yingchun and the other sisters, along with Baoyu, boarded the boat, followed by the others. The remaining old maids and maidservants all followed along the bank. Baoyu grumbled, “These cursed lotus leaves—why haven’t we had someone come to pull them up yet?”  Baochai laughed, “For these past few days, the garden has hardly had a moment to rest. With everyone out strolling every day, who has time to tidy up?”  Dai Yu said, “I detest Li Yishan’s poetry. I only like this line: ‘Leftover lotus leaves listen to the sound of rain.’ Yet you all insist on pulling up the lotus leaves.”  Baoyu replied, “That is indeed a fine verse. In future, let’s not have the lotus leaves plucked.”  They soon reached the base of the Flower Stream, where the dark, eerie surroundings—with two banks strewn with withered grasses and broken waterlilies—only deepened the autumnal mood. Grandmother Jia, noticing a neat and spacious residence on the bank, asked, “Isn’t this Miss Xue’s house?”  Everyone answered, “Yes.”  Grandmother Jia then hastily ordered that the boat be brought to shore, and using the Yúnbu stone steps, she led everyone into the Hengwu Courtyard. There, a delicate fragrance filled the air. Strange, otherworldly plants and fairy-tale vines, growing even more lush in the cool, damp air, bore fruit like clusters of coral-like beans, dangling enticingly. Upon entering the room, which was as quiet and pristine as a snow cave, there was naught in the way of ornaments. On the table stood only a plain earthen vase, in which were placed a few chrysanthemum stems, two books, a tea caddy, and teacups. The bed was hung only with a blue gauze curtain, and the bedding was exceedingly simple. Grandmother Jia sighed, “This child is far too plain—without any adornments, perhaps you should ask your concubine for a few things. I have no objections; I never expected that the things in your home wouldn’t be brought along.” With that, she ordered Yuan Yang to fetch some antiques and then chided Fengjie, “Not sending even a few ornaments for your sister—such meagerness!” Madame Wang, Fengjie, and the others all laughed, “She doesn’t want them anyway; we originally sent some, but they were all returned.” Aunt Xue laughed too, “He isn’t one for such things even at home.”  Grandmother Jia shook her head, “That won’t do. Though he is thrifty, if a relative comes by and sees such plainness—and the young ladies, too, are superstitious about that—then what? We old women ought to be living in stables by now. You’ve seen those exquisite embroidery chambers in the plays and books of the well-to-do young ladies! Even if our sisters cannot match them, they shouldn’t stray too far from propriety. If ready-made things are available, why not display them? If one is really keen on simplicity, then having fewer items may suit; but I, who used to be so adept at arranging a household, now in my old age have no leisure for it. Our sisters are still learning how to manage things well. I fear that if the common taste prevails, even good things may be misplaced. I wager they’re not too vulgar. Now, leave it to me to arrange your sister’s room—it will be both elegant and simple. My two personal items, which have been with me until now, have never even been shown to Baoyu; if he were to see them, they’d vanish in an instant.”  With that, she called Yuan Yang over and ordered, “Bring that stone penjing, that silk-screen with the embroidered scenes, and the ink-smoked frozen-stone cauldron. Those three items displayed on this table will suffice. Also fetch that water-ink calligraphy on a white gauze screen and let’s replace that one too.”  Yuan Yang readily agreed, laughing, “All these items have been stored away in the East Chamber, somewhere in a trunk—I must search for them slowly. I’ll bring them over tomorrow.”  Grandmother Jia said, “Tomorrow, the day after, whenever it suits—just don’t forget.”  After sitting for a while, they all came out and proceeded to the Zhuangjin Pavilion.
Baoyu smiled, “Always so articulate—never yields an inch.” Daiyu muttered under her breath, “He’s not so articulate, yet he cherishes that ‘golden qilin.’” With that, she rose and left. Luckily no one heard but Baochai, who stifled a smile. Baoyu, overhearing Daiyu’s remark, regretted speaking so freely; seeing Baochai smirk, he grinned as well, but Baochai immediately got up and excused herself, chatting with Daiyu. Jia Mu told Xiangyun, “Have some tea, rest awhile, then visit your sisters-in-law. The garden is cool—take a stroll.” Xiangyun agreed. Presently, she tucked three of the ring boxes away and rose to meet Feng Jie. From there, she wandered the Garden, greeting Li Wan. After a short time, she said to her nurse and maids, “You needn’t follow me everywhere—go visit your own relatives or friends. I’ll keep only Lü’er with me.” They agreed and scattered off. Xiangyun and Lü’er, strolling under the midday sun, chatted about the flowers and pond-lotuses yet to bloom. Lü’er pointed at a towering branch of pomegranate blossoms, remarking how it grew “layer upon layer.” Xiangyun mused, “Flowers are like people. If the plant’s vigor is strong, it grows well.” Lü’er quipped, “I don’t see people sprouting an extra head.” Xiangyun snickered, “It’s not that literal. All things reflect Yin and Yang in their transformations. . . .” The two debated as they walked, until Xiangyun spied something gold lying under the rose trellis. “What’s that?” she asked. Lü’er picked it up—some brilliant gold object, apparently a small golden qilin, bigger and more ornate than Xiangyun’s own. She exclaimed, “Look, this must have a Yin side and a Yang side!” Xiangyun said, “Indeed—creatures, male or female, each have their nature.” Lü’er teased, “So is this qilin a boy or a girl?” Xiangyun scolded: “Don’t be coarse.” They laughed, speculating about who might have dropped it, for Xiangyun had never seen it before. Just then, Baoyu approached. Spotting him, Xiangyun hid the newfound qilin. Baoyu said, “It’s so hot—why not find Xi Ren? Let’s go together.” Xiangyun merely nodded. They proceeded to Yihong Court. At the entrance, Xi Ren was relaxing under the eaves, letting the breeze cool her. She greeted Xiangyun warmly, and Xiangyun reciprocated, excited to chat. Baoyu said with a smile, “You should have come days ago. I had something special for you, but. . . .” Searching his robe, he exclaimed, “Where is that little qilin? Did you put it away?” Xi Ren shook her head, “You carry it everywhere—why ask me?” Baoyu gasped, “Then it’s lost! When did I drop it? That jade I acquired after so much trouble—gone. I’d best look for it.” Xiangyun realized the lost gold qilin was his, so she quipped, “It’s only a trinket. Why get all flustered?” Baoyu insisted, “But I’ve treasured it so—I must find it.” Just then Xiangyun teased, “Is this it?” and produced the golden qilin from her sash. Baoyu’s eyes lit with relief. What follows we shall learn in the next chapter. Chapter 32 Voicing an Inner Torment, the Bewildered Precious Jade; Swallowing Shame and Rage, the Fierce Death of Jin Chuan’er  When Baoyu saw the qilin in Xiangyun’s hand, his delight was boundless. He stretched out to take it, smiling as he asked, “Thank goodness you found it. Where did you come across it?”  Xiangyun teased, “Lucky it was this you dropped.
Tell me, aren’t these four gifts exceedingly rare? The fish and the pig are prized for their costliness, but as for the lotus roots and melons, how on earth did they manage to grow them? I have already respectfully offered some to my mother and hastened to send some to our Old Lady and Aunt. I have kept a few for myself; if I were to eat them, I’d fear it would squander my blessings. After much deliberation, I found that aside from me, only you deserve to partake. So I have specially invited you. And wouldn’t it be delightful if a young singer joined us, so that we might revel for an entire day?” As he spoke, they went into his study, where Zhan Guang, Cheng Rixing, Hu Silai, Shan Pingren, and a troupe of young singing boys were gathered. Upon his entrance, everyone greeted him cordially. After tea, Xue Bo ordered, “Prepare a feast.” Even before he finished speaking, the servants bustled about for a long while until everything was arranged and the guests were seated. Baoyu, seeing the unusual lotus roots and melons, laughed and said, “My birthday gift has not yet arrived—it seems I’ve disturbed things instead.” Xue Pan asked, “But tell me, what new and fresh offerings do you plan to present tomorrow when you pay your respects for your birthday?” Baoyu replied, “I have nothing to present. When it comes to money and provisions, everything ultimately belongs to me; only a written word or a painted picture is truly mine.” Xue Pan laughed, “You mention painting—why, just yesterday I saw a book of erotic paintings that was exquisitely done. It even had many inscriptions, though I didn’t examine them closely; I only looked at the colophon, which turned out to be something like ‘Geng Huang.’ Remarkable, isn’t it?” Baoyu, intrigued, mused, “I’ve seen various calligraphies and paintings through the ages—where would one find a ‘Geng Huang’?” After pondering for a long moment, he couldn’t help but laugh, ordered someone to fetch a pen, and scribbled two characters on his palm. He then asked Xue Pan, “Do you really see it as ‘Geng Huang’?” Xue Pan replied, “How could I not?” Baoyu waved his hand for him to look, “It’s only these two characters—but they are not far from ‘Geng Huang’ in meaning.” When everyone looked, they saw the two characters read “Tang Yin,” and all laughed, “Surely the young master must have had a momentary lapse of vision—it can’t be helped.” Xue Pan, feeling somewhat embarrassed, joked, “Who would have thought he meant ‘sugar silver’ or ‘fruit silver’ instead!” Just then, a servant announced, “Lord Feng has arrived.” Baoyu immediately recognized that this was Feng Ziying, the son of General Shenwu Feng Tang. Xue Pan and the others all called out, “Quick, welcome him!” Before they could finish speaking, Feng Ziying entered amid much laughter, and everyone hastily arranged seats for him. Feng Ziying said with a smile, “Splendid—why not stay at home and enjoy yourself?” Baoyu and Xue Pan both laughed, “We seldom meet—how is our old patriarch doing?” Feng Ziying replied, “My father is keeping well under the protection of good fortune. However, my mother has caught a slight chill recently and wasn’t well for a couple of days.” Xue Pan, noticing a bruise on his face, laughed, “Did you get punched by someone? Your face seems marked!” Feng Ziying laughed, “Ever since I injured the son of Commander Douyu, I’ve held a grudge. If I don’t hold it in, how could I ever refrain from throwing another punch? This mark on my face is from the skirmish a few days ago on Iron Net Hill, when I got my wing clipped by a falcon.” Baoyu asked, “When did this happen?” Feng Ziying replied, “On the 28th of March; I returned just the other day.” Baoyu said, “No wonder I didn’t see you when I attended Shen Shixiong’s banquet on the third or fourth—how could I have forgotten?
Listen then: Daughter, delight—may you lazily rise on your wedding day!” Everyone marveled, “How elegant this line is!” Xue Pan said, “Daughter, joy—when one thrusts a cock’s member inward.” Everyone turned and shouted, “That’s dreadful! Come on, sing it already!” Xue Pan then sang, “A tiny mosquito goes ‘hmm, hmm, hmm’…” The guests were all taken aback, “What sort of tune is that?” Xue Pan continued, “And two flies buzz ‘buzzz, buzzz, buzzz’…” The others cried, “Enough, enough, enough!” Xue Pan declared, “Whether you like it or not, this is a new tune called ‘Humming Rhyme.’ If you are too lazy to listen, then you can forgo the wine base—I shall not sing it.” The guests all said, “Let it be, don’t delay others!”  Then Jiang Yuhan said, “Daughter, sorrow—when your husband goes away and never returns. Daughter, melancholy—when you have no money to buy osmanthus oil. Daughter, delight—the lamp flowers and entwined buds blossom as one. Daughter, joy—when husband and wife sing in perfect harmony.” With that, she sang:    “Joyfully, you were born with endless grace,   As if a living fairy descended from the blue heavens. Youth is fleeting, your age but tender;   As if perfectly paired like phoenix and dragon. Ah, behold the Milky Way in its lofty arc,   Hear the drum of the tower, the silver lamp quietly joining the mandarin duck’s chamber.”  After finishing her song, she drank her cup and smiled, “I have little in the way of verse myself; fortunately, yesterday I saw a couplet that I’ve only remembered this line—and coincidentally, there is also an item here.” She then set down her wine, picked up an osmanthus flower, and recited, “‘The fragrance of flowers assails the senses, heralding the warmth of day.’” The guests all finished their toasts. Xue Pan then leaped up, exclaiming, “Remarkable, remarkable! That is, indeed, a fine line—but where is the treasure? How can you speak of treasure when there is none?” Jiang Yuhan hurriedly said, “There has never been any treasure!” Xue Pan retorted, “Isn’t Xi Ren regarded as treasure? If you don’t believe it, just ask her!” Upon hearing this, Baoyu, feeling too embarrassed to rise, said, “Brother Xue, how much should you be fined?” Xue Pan declared, “You must be fined, you must be fined!” He then picked up his wine and downed it in one gulp. Feng Ziying and Jiang Yuhan asked him his reason; Yun’er then explained the matter. Jiang Yuhan quickly rose to make amends. Everyone said, “Those who do not know are not guilty.”  A short while later, Baoyu excused himself to relieve himself, and Jiang Yuhan followed him out. Standing in the corridor, Jiang Yuhan again apologized. Baoyu, seeing his gentle, charming manner, felt deeply attached, and clutched his hand tightly, saying, “When you have time, come with us to our place. I have one more thing to ask of you—among your distinguished company there is a young fellow called Qi Guan, whose reputation now stretches across the land; alas, I have never had the chance to meet him.” Jiang Yuhan laughed, “That is my little name indeed.” Baoyu, delighted, stamped his foot and exclaimed, “How fortunate! Truly, your fame is well-deserved. Now that we have met for the first time, what do you say?” After a moment’s thought, he withdrew a fan from his sleeve, detached a jade pendant from it, and handed it to Qi Guan, saying, “This trifle is offered as a token of today’s friendship.” Qi Guan accepted with a smile, “I have received a token without merit—what can I do to repay it? Well, I too have a curious treasure; I only managed to fasten it this morning.
Bells tolled, drums echoed, and Priest Zhang, carrying incense in ceremonial robes, led a band of Taoists to greet them by the roadside. Baoyu dismounted, while Jia Mu’s sedan approached the main temple gate. She spotted the clay effigies of the City God and various guardian deities, then ordered someone to stop her chair. Jia Zhen arrived with the younger men to welcome them. Xifeng’s sedan had arrived first, her maids Yuanyang and others present. Seeing Jia Mu descend, they hurried to support her. Just then, a twelve- or thirteen-year-old Taoist boy, carrying a metal cylinder of candles and snips for cutting candle-wicks, tried to slip away unnoticed and ended up colliding headlong with Wang Xifeng. She snapped her hand out and slapped him across the face, sending him tumbling, scolding, “You little stray! Where do you think you’re going?” The young Taoist, ignoring his candle-snips, scrambled to flee. At that moment, Baochai and the others were disembarking, and seeing a small Taoist tumble out, they shouted, “Seize him! Beat him!”  Alarmed, Jia Mu asked, “What’s the matter?” Jia Zhen came to inquire. Xifeng grasped Jia Mu’s arm for support and replied, “It’s just a young Taoist trimming candle wicks; it seems he didn’t manage to slip out and was now trying to dodge his way through.” Hearing this, Jia Mu quickly said, “Bring the child here—no need to frighten him. He’s just a small child from a poor family, unaccustomed to such pomp. If we scare him, what a pity for his parents!” She asked Jia Zhen to retrieve him. Jia Zhen obliged, fetching the boy, who knelt, trembling all over, snips still in hand. Jia Mu called, “Help him up—there’s nothing to fear.” She asked how old he was, but he was too terrified to speak. Jia Mu pitied him and told Jia Zhen, “Lead him away; give him a bit of money for candy. Don’t let anyone bully him.” Jia Zhen assented and escorted the boy out. Jia Mu then continued, accompanied by the group, moving from hall to hall to pay their respects and admire the surroundings. Outside, the servants noticed that Jia Mu and her companions had gone inside the second temple gate, when Jia Zhen emerged again with the little Taoist, instructing them, “Take him away, give him a few hundred coins, and don’t trouble him.” The household men complied. Jia Zhen, standing on the steps, asked, “Where’s the steward?” The younger servants below cried out, “Calling the steward!” In no time, Lin Zhixiao, adjusting his cap, ran forward. Jia Zhen ordered, “Though this place is large, we have many people here today. Of those you’re responsible for, keep them in this courtyard. Anyone we don’t need, dismiss them to another courtyard. Assign more of the younger servants at this second gate and the side gates, ready to fetch items or pass along messages. Understand? Not a single idle person may enter—our young ladies and mistresses have come out.” Lin Zhixiao repeatedly affirmed, “Yes, yes, I understand.” Jia Zhen then asked, “Well, then—where is Rong’er?”  Even as he spoke, they all saw Jia Rong come running out of the bell tower. “You see how cool he’s been in there, while we roast in the heat?” Jia Zhen barked, ordering the household men, “Spit on him!” They knew his temper and obeyed without hesitation; one servant spat in Jia Rong’s face. Jia Zhen glared at him, while that same servant asked Jia Rong, “Aren’t you feeling the heat, Master? Why do you get to be cool?” Jia Rong, with head bowed, dared not speak. Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia Qin, and the rest were all petrified; even Jia Lian, Jia, Jia Qiong, and others hurriedly crept away along the wall. Jia Zhen snapped, “What are you standing here for?
In a side room, Baochai sat on a couch while Daiyu perched on a cushion provided by Miao Yu. Miao Yu went to the fume burner to boil water and then prepared another pot of tea. Baoyu softly entered and joked, “You’re having your own personal tea, aren’t you?”  Both Baochai and Daiyu laughed, “You’ve come to snatch our tea again! There isn’t any left for you here.”  Just as Miao Yu was about to fetch cups, a tea maid collected the teacups on the table. Miao Yu quickly commanded, “Do not take away those fine kiln cups—set them aside outside instead.”  Baoyu understood immediately that Old Liu had taken his tea and, not wanting it to be wasted, noticed that Miao Yu had now produced two other cups. One cup, with a design of an ear on one side, bore three clerical script characters with a small line of fine script reading “Wáng Kǎizhēn’s Plaything”; it also had an inscription in small characters: “In the fourth month of the fifth year of the Song–Yuan Feng, from Meishan, Su Shi was received at the Secret Bureau.” Miao Yu poured a cup from this one for Baochai. Another cup, small and bowl-like with three drooping pearl patterns, bore an inscription in seal script stating “Diǎn Xī.” Miao Yu poured a cup from it for Daiyu, and then from the green jade cup she herself habitually used, she poured another for Baoyu. Baoyu laughed, “They say ‘all under heaven is equal’—yet these two use such antique rarities, while I’m left with an ordinary vessel?”  Miao Yu replied, “An ordinary vessel? Don’t be absurd—I dare say you won’t even find such an ordinary cup in your own home!”  Baoyu laughed, “As the saying goes, ‘When in one’s native place, one follows local customs.’ But here, you have turned all these precious treasures into mere common things!”  Miao Yu, delighted by his remark, then produced a large cup made from intricately carved, twisted bamboo roots with nine curves, ten rings, and one hundred twenty sections. With a smile she said, “This is the last one—can you drink an ocean from it?”  Baoyu cheerfully replied, “I can!”  Miao Yu laughed, “Even if you can, without this tea you’ll be in trouble. Have you not heard that one cup is for tasting, two cups for quenching one’s thirst like a simpleton, and three cups means you’re drinking like a donkey? If you drink an ocean, what will become of you?”  At this the three—Baochai, Daiyu, and Baoyu—all laughed. Miao Yu then held the pot and poured out roughly one cup for the “ocean” inside. Baoyu sipped slowly, finding the tea to be light, pure, and exceptionally delicate—he could not stop praising its taste. With a serious tone Miao Yu said, “You owe your tea-drinking today to these two; if only you had come alone, I could not have afforded you any.”  Baoyu laughed, “I understand perfectly—I won’t accept your favor. I only thank those two.”  Miao Yu, pleased, replied, “Very well spoken.”  Daiyu then inquired, “Is this also rainwater from an old year?”  Miao Yu snorted coldly, “You—a truly vulgar person—you can’t even distinguish water! This was water collected five years ago when I resided at Xuánmù Pánxiāng Temple. I gathered it from the snow on plum blossoms, all stored in a grotesque, face-painted blue flower urn. I couldn’t bear to use it then, so I buried it; only this summer did it emerge. I’ve tasted it once before—this is only the second time. How is it that you can’t tell the difference? Rainwater collected in the following year could never be this pure—how can one drink it?”  Baochai, aware of Miao Yu’s eccentric nature, said little more; not wishing to linger, after finishing the tea she and Daiyu quietly left.
Liu said. “Something fresh, that’s all. If we had our way, we’d enjoy fish and meat daily. But we can’t afford it.”  “All the same, it’s a pleasure,” the Dowager insisted. “Since we’re now acquainted, you mustn’t just go away empty-handed. If you don’t mind staying here, spend a day or two. Our place has a garden with fruit, too. Tomorrow you can have a taste, then bring some home, so your trip won’t be wasted.”  Seeing the Dowager so delighted, Lady Feng also urged, “We might not match your farmland for size, but we do have a couple of spare rooms. Stay a couple of days, share some stories from the country for our Old Dowager’s amusement.”  The Dowager smiled at Feng-lass. “Don’t tease her. She’s just a simple soul from the sticks, easily flustered by your jokes.” She signaled some maids to bring fruit for Ban’er, but the child, seeing so many strangers, dared not eat. The Dowager then had money given him, and some junior lads took him outside to play. Having finished her tea, Old Mrs. Liu started telling more stories from rural life, the trifling sights and wonders in the fields day by day, through all four seasons. The Dowager took great delight. Meanwhile, those assembled—Baoyu, the young ladies, and the rest— had never heard such talk, and found it more entertaining than a blind man’s novel performance. Though old, though rustic, Mrs. Liu possessed a streak of cleverness and had weathered many experiences. Observing how keen the Dowager was, and how much the young ones enjoyed her tales, she spared no detail. “You see,” she said, “we farm folk work fields and plant vegetables year in and year out, in spring, summer, autumn, winter, braving the elements—who has time to sit idle? Why, we set up wooden benches out there in the fields. You can’t imagine the strange incidents we witness! Take last winter, for instance, when it snowed for days and drifted three, four feet. I got up at dawn, hadn’t yet left the house, when I heard a rattle in the yard. I guessed someone was nicking our firewood. Sneaking to the window, I peeked out. Sure enough, it wasn’t from our own village, so I—”  “Must’ve been some traveler, caught in the cold, snatching a bit of wood to warm himself,” the Dowager said. “Not a traveler—here’s where it gets odd, Old Longevity Goddess!” Old Mrs. Liu exclaimed. “It turned out to be a girl, about seventeen or eighteen, extremely pretty, with a sleekly oiled hairstyle, all dressed in bright red jacket and a white silk skirt—”  She had just reached this point when a sudden commotion sounded outside, with someone calling, “Nothing serious—don’t alarm the Old Dowager!” Startled, the Dowager asked, “What’s happening?”  A maid answered, “Some water flooded from the stables in the southern courtyard. It’s all sorted out, nothing to worry about.”  Being so easily frightened, the Dowager stood at once, leaning on people as she went to the veranda. A rosy blaze was still visible in the southeast corner. Fearing a real hazard, she prayed under her breath and told them to get incense for the Fire God. Then Lady Wang and others arrived to reassure her, “All sorted out, Madame. Please, let us go back inside.”  The Dowager stood watch until the last flame died away, then finally led them all indoors again. Baoyu’s immediate thought was to find out more about that girl out in the snow, so once they sat down, he hastened to ask Old Mrs. Liu, “That young girl— why would she be collecting firewood on a snowy morning? She might have gotten ill from the cold.”  The Dowager scolded, “So it was talk of stolen firewood that caused this upset! Must you keep asking? Drop it. Have her tell other stories.”  Though disappointed, Baoyu had to yield. Old Mrs. Liu reflected, then switched to another topic:  “Our village, next over from ours, has this old granny of ninety-something.
Outside, several maids and little servants rushed to intercept and console her. In the midst of the chaos, Fengjie, seeing Ping’er attempting self-harm, collapsed into Jia Lian’s arms, crying out, “They—all these miserable folks—are making a fool of me! Go ahead, strangle me if you must!”  Jia Lian, so incensed that he pulled a sword from the wall and shouted, “There’s no need for you to seek death! I’m truly at my wits’ end—let’s kill them all! I’ll pay for this with my life, so that everything will be set right!”  Just then, as the fracas reached its climax, You and several others burst in and said, “What is the meaning of this? We were all well a moment ago, and now chaos has broken out!”  Jia Lian, now three parts drunk and displaying his authority with a dangerous air, seemed intent on taking his anger out on Fengjie. Seeing this, Madame Wang and Mrs. Xing rushed forward, scolding, “You vile scum! How can you behave in such a base manner in front of Grandmother? Remember, Grandmother is here!”  Jia Lian sneered, “It’s all Grandmother’s fault—she spoiled Feng! I’m even angry enough to curse out loud!”  Mrs. Xing, snatching the sword from him, cried, “Get out at once!”  Jia Lian began babbling nonsense, drooling as he stammered, “Oh, please, don’t… I’m not worth your anger…”  Grandmother Jia, fuming, declared, “I know very well that you are not to be taken lightly! Send for your father at once and let him see what you’ve done!”  Hearing this, Jia Lian staggered out in a daze. In his indignation, he refused to return home and instead went to the study. Meanwhile, Mrs. Xing and Madame Wang continued to discuss Fengjie. Grandmother Jia remarked, “What is there to fuss about? You young ones are as greedy as cats—how can you possibly be trusted to keep a secret? Ever since you were little, everyone has been treated like this. It’s all my fault for letting you drink too much and get all sour!”  This remark made everyone laugh. Grandmother Jia added, “Rest assured—tomorrow I’ll have your son-in-law apologize on your behalf, so do not let yourself be humiliated today.” She then scolded, “As for that Ping’er—her little feet—I always thought well of her. How can she behave so badly behind our backs?”  You and the others laughed, “It isn’t Ping’er’s fault; it is Feng who uses her as a scapegoat. When the couples quarrel, they always take it out on Ping’er. Poor thing!”  Grandmother Jia said, “That’s right. I always say, the child isn’t like that cunning enchantress. Seeing her suffer so undeservedly, I will have her master come tomorrow and personally apologize on her behalf. Today is his good day—he must not be allowed to be angry.”  It turned out that earlier, Ping’er had already been taken into the Grand View Garden by Li Wan. Ping’er wept bitterly, and Baochai consoled her, “You are sensible enough. Grandmother has always cared for you. Today, he only had one extra sip of wine—he won’t take his anger out on you. Others have already mocked him for being insincere.”  Just then, Hu Po came over with Grandmother’s message. Ping’er, noticing a certain brightness return to her face, slowly recovered and no longer advanced. After a while, after the guests had rested, they turned to see Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Bao Yu then made way for Ping’er to come into the Yíhóng Courtyard. Xiangren quickly helped, saying, “I had intended to give you your due, but since our eldest sister and the other girls all insist on you, I dared not refuse.”  Ping’er smiled and said, “Thank you very much.” She then added, “Really, I’ve suffered for no reason—being caught in all this aggravation for nothing!”  Xiangren teased, “Second Young Lady has always been kind to you.
We must consider his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never near the wine!”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt again and pleaded. Old Madam Lai then ordered, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I’ll have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse consented as she escorted them away. Later that evening, Li Wan and the others returned to the garden. At length, Fengjie had gathered many of the old, well-used painting tools and brought them out to the garden. Baochai and the others selected what they needed; of the assorted items, only half were usable. An inventory was drawn up so that Fengjie could later purchase replacements—details need not be repeated. Meanwhile, one day word came that the dye for the silk and preliminary sketches had arrived. Every day Bao Yu would help Xiangling with the work; Tan Chun, Li Wan, Yingchun, Baochai, and the others would then gather there—first to admire the paintings, then to hold meetings. Noticing that the weather had grown cool and the nights lengthened, Baochai went to Grandmother’s room to discuss arranging some needlework. By day she visited Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Wang twice, inevitably sitting with them; even in the garden the sisters would occasionally chat. Thus, daytime was scarcely free, and by night the girls worked under lamplight until about the third watch. Every year after the spring and autumn equinoxes, Daiyu’s old illness would flare up—and this autumn, having spent extra time with Grandmother, she felt overworked. Recently she began coughing again, feeling even worse than before. Consequently, she hardly left her room and confined herself to recuperation. Sometimes, feeling stifled, she longed for a sister’s company—but when Baochai and the others visited and exchanged a few words, she quickly grew weary. Everyone, mindful of her delicate condition, did not hold her lack of formal greetings against her. That day, Baochai visited Daiyu and broached the subject of her illness. Baochai said, “The doctors we’ve seen so far are fine, but the medicines you take never seem to work. Perhaps we should invite a master physician to examine you. If your illness could be cured, wouldn’t that be wonderful? Every year you suffer through spring and summer—though you’re neither old nor young, it just isn’t right.”  Daiyu replied, “It is hopeless. I know my illness is incurable. And besides, judging by how I look at my best, one can tell…”  Baochai nodded, “Exactly. The ancients said, ‘He who eats grains will live,’ but your diet fails to nourish your vital energy and blood—this is not good.”  Daiyu sighed, “‘Life and death are decreed by fate; wealth and honor belong to heaven.’ One cannot force these things by human effort. This year, I feel even worse than in previous years.” As she spoke, she coughed two or three times. Baochai said, “Yesterday I noticed that your prescription contained too much ginseng and cinnamon. Though they boost energy and supplement the spirit, they should not be too warming. In my opinion, we should first calm your liver and nurture your stomach. Once the liver fire is subdued, the stomach will be healthy and your diet will naturally restore you. Every morning, have a little premium bird’s nest—say, one tael—and five qian of rock sugar; cook a porridge in a silver pot. Once you are accustomed to it, it is even more effective than medicine—a wonderful way to nourish yin and replenish qi.”  Daiyu sighed, “You always treat others kindly—but I sometimes suspect you harbor hidden motives. The other day, when you advised me not to read miscellaneous books, I was so grateful. In hindsight, I must have been mistaken, for it has only harmed me. When my mother passed away, I had no siblings to guide me. I have now reached fifteen, and no one has ever taught me as you once did. No wonder Yun praises you so highly. In the past I resented your counsel, but now I see its truth. For instance, when you suggested I try bird’s nest porridge—though bird’s nest is easy enough to obtain, I, being so frail and afflicted with this recurring illness, have little recourse.
For example, I will split a set of three tiles, first describing the first tile, then the second, and so on. When finished, the combined name of this set—whether in verse, poetry, song, or a common saying—must be in rhyme with the previous line. Anyone who errs will be fined a cup.” Everyone laughed, “That’s a fine order—now go ahead and explain!”  Yuan Yang continued, “Here’s the first set. To the left is the ‘Heaven Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia said, “It has the blue sky above!”  The guests exclaimed in approval. Yuan Yang went on, “In the middle is a ‘Five-Six Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia responded, “The fragrant plum blossoms of the Six Bridges pervade to the bone!”  Yuan Yang added, “And what remains is the ‘Six-in-One Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia replied, “A red sun rises high in the clouds!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That altogether makes up a ‘Dishevelled Ghost’!”  Grandmother Jia quipped, “That ghost is clinging to Zhong Kui’s leg!”  At this, everyone laughed and cheered as Grandmother Jia downed a cup. Yuan Yang then said, “Now here’s another set. To the left is a ‘Big Long Five Tile.’”  Aunt Xue remarked, “Plum blossoms dance in the wind in full bloom!”  Yuan Yang said, “To the right is a ‘Big Five Long Tile.’”  Aunt Xue replied, “The fragrance of the plum blossoms fills the October hillside!”  Yuan Yang continued, “In the middle, the ‘Two-Five’ is the ‘Miscellaneous Seven Tile.’”  Aunt Xue said, “The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd meet on the Qixi!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “All together, it makes ‘Er Lang Touring the Five Mountains’.”  Aunt Xue added, “No mortal can compare with the joy of the immortals!” With that, everyone applauded and drank. Yuan Yang then said, “Here’s another set. To the left, a two-point ‘Bright Tile.’”  Xiangyun said, “Like the twin suns shining upon the universe!”  Yuan Yang said, “To the right, a two-point ‘Bright Tile.’”  Xiangyun replied, “Like idle blossoms falling silently to the ground!”  Yuan Yang added, “And in the middle, a four-point ‘Tile.’”  Xiangyun said, “Red apricots leaning against the clouds by the sun!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That together forms the ‘Nine-Ripened Cherry’.”  Xiangyun jested, “Yet even the imperial garden’s cherries are snatched away by birds!” Everyone laughed and took a sip. Yuan Yang then said, “Here’s another set. To the left is a ‘Long Three Tile.’”  Baochai remarked, “Twin swallows chatter in the beams!”  Yuan Yang continued, “To the right is a ‘Three-Long Tile.’”  Baochai said, “Water hyacinths, led by the breeze, form a green sash!”  Yuan Yang added, “In the middle, the ‘Three-Six-Nine’ points appear.”  Baochai replied, “Half of the three mountains sink beyond the blue sky!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That makes up the phrase ‘An Iron Chain Tethering a Lone Boat’.”  Baochai added, “Everywhere, the winds stir up waves and woes!” When finished, they all drank their cups. Yuan Yang then said, “Now, to the left we have a ‘Heaven Tile.’”  Dai Yu softly said, “What splendid times and scenery, alas, how cruel fate is!”  Baochai glanced at Old Liu; Dai Yu, too timid to risk a penalty, kept silent. Yuan Yang said, “In the middle, the brocaded screen shows lively colors.”  Dai Yu replied, “Yet the gauze window awaits no match from a red maid’s news.”  Yuan Yang said, “And what remains is the ‘Two-Six-Eight Tile.’”  Dai Yu murmured, “Twin gazes guide the jade throne to the morning court.”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That altogether makes ‘The Basket for Picking Flowers’.”  Dai Yu added, “And the fairy cane is fragrant as it selects the peony blossoms.” After this, she took a small sip.
Mrs. Xing, having dismissed everyone from the room, leaned in confidentially and said to Fengjie, “I called you here for one difficult matter. Lord Jia has set his heart on the mandarin duck from Grandmother’s room and now wants it to remain in the room. He has asked me to negotiate with Grandmother. I suspect such requests are not unusual—but I fear Grandmother might refuse. Do you have any ideas on how to handle this?”  Fengjie, laughing in a conciliatory tone, replied, “In my opinion, don’t even think about meddling with this matter. Without that ‘Yuan Yang’ in her room, Grandmother wouldn’t even eat properly—she wouldn’t part with something she so cherishes. Besides, in her idle chatter Grandmother often teases Lord Jia, saying, ‘Now that he’s grown old, why must he keep collecting one thing after another in the room? First, he endangers the girls by neglecting their upbringing; second, he lets his own health go to ruin by not taking proper care—drinking with his concubines every day!’ Don’t you think the madams would enjoy hearing that? Lord Jia, on the other hand, might try to hide it—but isn’t that like “sticking a stick in a tiger’s nose”? Madam, don’t be angry. I wouldn’t dare to interfere. Besides, if we leave it as is, it might even backfire and cause more trouble. Lord Jia, now in his advanced years, sometimes acts in ways that are less than proper; the madams should counsel him instead. Compared with the young, these matters are trivial. Yet now—with his brothers, nephews, sons, and grandsons numbering in the dozens—how can he continue such antics before everyone’s eyes?”  Mrs. Xing sneered, “Even in families with three or four concubines, they get away with it. Why, then, is it that our household can’t? I’ve tried advising him, but he won’t listen. Even if it is Grandmother’s beloved maid, look at her—so pale with worry, and he’s the eldest son of an official; when she’s called to serve inside the house, it isn’t easy to refuse. I’ve summoned you to discuss this. It seems you’re already on the hook. I must say, if I tried to advise him, he’d hardly heed a word. You see his temper; if I cannot persuade him, then things will only escalate.”  Fengjie knew well that Mrs. Xing’s character was weak—she only knew how to curry favor with Jia She in order to secure her own position and profit from the household’s wealth. Everything in the household—every financial matter—passed through Jia She’s hands, who would invariably make deductions and claim it was for “saving expenses” on his lavish spending. Every servant, every child, obeyed him without question. Now that I hear your request, I can tell he’s once again trying to bend things to his will. (I suppose he’s trying to persuade you to do what you originally offered to do—only, in reality, he wants to extract money from me.)  Fengjie quickly accompanied Mrs. Xing’s proposal with a laugh: “Madam, you speak truly. How long have I lived to know what is proper? When I was with my parents, even a single maid—if she were as lively as a precious treasure—was given by Lord Jia without question. And behind our backs, who would believe me if I said otherwise? I’d be a fool. Whenever Second Young Master is mentioned, I worry that one day he might incur disgrace from both Lord Jia and the madams. But since Grandmother adores him, they always reward him.”  Mrs. Xing smiled approvingly and then confided, “My idea is this: let’s not mention it to Grandmother at once. If Grandmother says no, then the matter is dead. I’m thinking of speaking quietly to Yuan Yang. Even if she is bashful, if I explain it to her thoroughly and she remains silent, then all will be settled. And even if Grandmother does not agree, if Yuan Yang is willing, as the saying goes ‘if a man leaves, he won’t be detained,’ then it will work out naturally.”  Fengjie laughed, “That is indeed a clever plan—absolutely foolproof.
But nowadays, not a single man seems to do so; if he reads, he only becomes worse. It is not that books have spoiled him; rather, he’s squandered them—so it hardly matters whether he reads or not. As for you and me, we should stick to needlework and spinning. Yet we do know a few characters. Once you know the characters, you might as well select a proper book to read—but I fear that encountering miscellaneous texts might change your disposition irretrievably.”  Hearing these words, Daiyu lowered her head while sipping tea, secretly agreeing with nothing more than a single “Yes.”  Just then, Sùyún entered and said, “Our Grandmother wishes to discuss an important matter with you two ladies. Second Sister, Third Sister, Fourth Sister, Miss Shi, and Second Young Master Bao are all waiting.”  Baochai asked, “What is it now?”  Daiyu replied, “We shall know once we get there.”  With that, she and Baochai went toward Dàoxiāng Village, where they found everyone assembled. Li Wan greeted them with a smile, “The society hasn’t yet started, and already there are such carefree fellows—four little maids are claiming a year’s leave!”  Daiyu laughed, “It’s all because of something Grandmother said yesterday—about having someone paint a picture of the garden—which caused him to take leave in delight.”  Tan Chun laughed, “Don’t blame Grandmother; it was all because of Old Liu’s words.”  Daiyu hastily laughed and added, “But indeed, it was his words—what kind of old fellow is he? He might as well be called a ‘mother locust’!”  At this the guests all burst into laughter. Baochai laughed, “In this world, once our Second Sister speaks, everything is settled. Fortunately, she is not well-versed in writing, so it’s all in good fun. And then there’s you, Pín’er, with your shrill tongue—using the methods of the Spring and Autumn Annals, you pick out the crude parts of common speech, prune away the excess, and polish it up. With that one phrase, ‘mother locust,’ you captured all the details of yesterday’s scene. I must say, your wit is remarkably swift!”  Everyone laughed, “Your commentary is nearly as good as theirs!”  Li Wan then said, “I propose that we decide together: how long a leave should we grant him? I offered him a month’s leave, but he complains it is too short—what do you all think?”  Daiyu said, “In theory, one year is not too much. The garden has only been built for a year, and now if he is to paint it, it will require at least two years’ work. There must be time spent grinding ink, dipping the brush, spreading the paper, applying colors, and so on…”  Just then, Daiyu couldn’t hold herself and laughed, “And if he must paint it slowly to match the model, wouldn’t that require two full years?”  At her words, everyone burst into applause and laughter. Baochai laughed, “How amusing—the perfect ending is ‘slowly painting.’ If he doesn’t go ahead and paint it, then how did all that come about? Those jests from yesterday, though funny at the time, in retrospect seem without substance. Think carefully—Pín’er’s few words, though they seem trivial, are full of flavor. I almost can’t help but laugh uncontrollably.”  Xīchūn said, “It’s all because our dear Baojie praises him and makes him show off, and now he’s taken a jab at me.”  Daiyu quickly pulled Xīchūn aside and said, “Tell me—will he paint only the garden, or will he include all of us in the picture?”  Xīchūn replied, “He should only paint the garden. Yesterday, Grandmother said, ‘If you paint only the garden, it will look like a house; but if you include people, it will resemble a pleasure scene.’ I don’t know much about painting architectural details or figures, so I find this rather difficult to decide.”  Daiyu said, “Figures are easier—can’t you just add a few insects on the grass?”  Li Wan interjected, “You’re not making sense again.
Everyone urged Ping’er to sit with them, but she demurred. Lady Li^1 noticed her reluctance, smiled, and said, “Oh no, you must sit!” She pulled her down beside herself, poured a cup of wine, and raised it to Ping’er’s lips. Ping’er quickly sipped it and was about to leave, but Li Wan insisted, “I won’t allow it. Apparently, you only obey Feng girl and not me.” So saying, she told the older women, “Take this box away for now and tell her I’ve kept Ping’er.”  Not long after, a maid returned with the box, saying, “Her Ladyship (Second Mistress) says: ‘Please don’t laugh at me for craving a few bites. Inside this box are some lotus-root-starch cakes and chicken-fat rolls from Aunt^2—do have some, ladies.’” She then turned to Ping’er: “And she said, ‘You ran off to gorge yourself, so don’t go overboard on the drinks.’”  Ping’er laughed, “What if I do overdo it? What could she do to me?” She went on drinking and eating crab as she spoke. Lady Li reached over to give her a playful hug, laughing, “Such a lovely face, such a fine figure, and yet you’re just a live-in maid! Anyone who didn’t know better would take you for a mistress.”  While Ping’er drank and chatted with Baochai, Xiangyun, and the others, she glanced back at Li Wan and joked, “Madam, please, this kind of touching is making me itch!”  Suddenly, Lady Li said, “Ah—what’s that stiff thing here?”  Ping’er replied, “It’s a key.”  “What can be so important you’re afraid someone will steal it, that you keep it on you?” Lady Li said. “All day long I tell people: for every Tang Monk traveling for scriptures, there’s a white horse to carry him; for every Liu Zhiyuan^3 founding a realm, there’s a melon sprite to present armor; for every Feng girl, there’s a you. You’re the master key to all her locks—why carry any other key at all?”  Ping’er laughed, “My lady’s had a bit of wine and is teasing me for fun.”  Baochai smiled, “But it’s true enough. We sometimes reflect on it when we’re idle: you girls—each of you is one in a hundred, each with her own unique merit.”  Li Wan said, “Indeed. Whether older or younger, there’s a certain principle at work. Let’s say, for instance, in the Old Dowager’s quarters—imagine if there were no Girl Yuanyang. How could that work? From Her Ladyship (Madam Wang) on down, no one dares contradict the Dowager’s decisions. But Yuanyang can! And the Dowager listens only to her. The old lady’s jewelry, accessories—others may not recall them, but she does. Without her management, who knows how many swindlers might have made off with half of it by now? And yet Yuanyang is fair-minded; she’ll intervene for people, never abusing her influence.”  Xichun inserted, “That’s what the Old Dowager said just yesterday—that Yuanyang is better than even we are.”  “Yes, she’s a wonderful one,” Ping’er nodded. “There’s no comparing ourselves to her.”  Suddenly Baoyu offered, “Madam Wang’s maid Caixia is quite an honest sort.”  “Honest indeed—,” Tan-chun said. “But she’s got her wits too. Lady Wang is that Buddha-like person who rarely keeps close watch on specifics, so Caixia handles them. She keeps track of absolutely everything: from Master (Jia Zheng) coming or going to each big or small matter. If Lady Wang forgets something, Caixia quietly reminds her.”  “All right, that’s enough,” Li Wan said.
Even if I died, my spirit would visit you a hundred times a day. How is Miss Lin feeling—better, I hope?”  Zijuan answered, “Her health is improving, but her mood has scarcely softened.”  “It’s fine,” Baoyu said, stepping inside with her. “Why should she remain angry?”  Soon he reached Daiyu’s bedside. She had begun to weep again upon hearing his voice. Approaching with a light smile, Baoyu murmured, “Sister, are you all right now?” Daiyu only dabbed her tears silently. Baoyu drew closer to the bed and continued, “I know you’re not truly upset with me, but if I avoided coming, folks might assume we had quarreled. Then, if they started meddling, we’d have to put on a show for them—wouldn’t that be worse? Better that you scold me directly or box my ears now, but please don’t refuse to see me!” With that, he softly called her “dear sister” multiple times. In truth, Daiyu had resolved not to engage with him at all, but hearing him mention how “others might think them at odds” she realized how close they remained. Tears rolled down as she said brokenly, “Stop coaxing me. From this moment forth, I dare not draw near you. Consider me gone!”  Baoyu asked, “Gone where?”  “Back home,” she said. Baoyu said lightly, “I’ll come with you.”  She pressed, “What if I die?”  He replied, “Then I’ll become a monk.”  At that, Daiyu abruptly straightened in displeasure. “Are you spouting nonsense about my death? You have several real sisters—if they died, would you become a monk for each of them too? I should tell others of this to let them judge your crazy talk!” Realizing his blunder, Baoyu flushed and fell silent in shame. Luckily, no one else was around. Daiyu glowered at him a good while, gave a sharp sigh, and resumed crying into her handkerchief. Baoyu’s heart was weighed with guilt and, seeing her tears, he, too, wept. Feeling around his sleeves for a handkerchief and finding none, he resorted to wiping his tears with the sleeve of his brand-new lotus-colored robe. Daiyu, through her sobs, caught sight of him using the fine cloth of his sleeve and, feeling a spark of sympathy, grabbed a small muslin kerchief from beside her pillow and flung it toward him, still covering her face with her other hand. Without speaking, she resumed weeping. Baoyu gratefully used it to dry his tears, moved nearer, and took her hand. Smiling, he said,  “I’m in such agony for you, yet you keep crying! Let’s go greet the Old Lady. If we hide away, people will talk. Please—scold me, hit me if you wish, but don’t avoid me.” Daiyu yanked her hand away. “Why must you grope at me? The older you get, the more shameless—have you no sense of propriety?”  She had scarcely finished when a mischievous voice called, “Aha! I knew you’d be fine!” Startled, they glanced up to see Wang Xifeng entering. She laughed and said,  “The Old Ancestor is fretting and fuming, so she sent me to see if you two had patched things up. I told her: ‘No need! Give them three days, they’ll be fine on their own.’ She refused to believe me. But look, sure enough, you’re each wiping the other’s tears—like two roosters with their talons locked together, fighting one minute, clinging the next. Come along now. Let’s set the Old Lady’s mind at rest.” With that, she grabbed Daiyu’s hand and led her outside. Daiyu called to her maids, but no one came. Wang Xifeng teased, “No need to call them—I’m more than enough,” and half-dragged her out, with Baoyu hurrying after them. Exiting the garden, they headed for Jia Mu’s rooms.
Soon Baochai and Wang Xifeng departed. Daiyu whispered to Baoyu, “Now you’ve found a better sparring partner—I can’t hold my own. Not everyone is as soft as I am, letting you say what you please.”  Baoyu, still feeling abashed from his exchange with Baochai, grew even more dejected. He longed to answer Daiyu but feared stoking her indignation, so he suppressed his anger and slinked away. That day was the Dragon Boat Festival (端阳佳节). Everywhere, people wore protective herbs, pinned mugwort on their doors, and tied decorative charms on their arms. By midday, Lady Wang hosted a small banquet with Aunt Xue and the others. Baoyu, out of sorts, spoke little. Lady Wang, guessing he felt awkward about “yesterday’s business with Jin Chuan’er,” barely acknowledged him. Daiyu, for her part, assumed Baoyu was glum over how he’d offended Baochai, so she herself kept aloof; her manner, too, was listless. Wang Xifeng, aware of how Lady Wang disliked any mention of the matter, likewise avoided jokes and kept quiet. Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun, seeing everyone so subdued, also lost interest, and they all dispersed early. Daiyu, by nature, disliked gatherings. As she often reasoned:  “If there’s an assembly, it must at some point disperse. You enjoy the bustle for a time, but then the quiet after everyone leaves can be so desolate—why not avoid these gatherings altogether? It’s like a blossom: lovely while in bloom, yet withers to become a source of sorrow. Better if it had never bloomed.” And so, she remained indifferent. But Baoyu, who liked constant gatherings and lamented the inevitable dispersal, felt especially morose as the party ended so soon. He went back to his room, sighing deeply. Happening to see him in one of his pensive moods, the maid Qingwen came in to change clothes. By chance, she fumbled and dropped a fan, snapping one of its ribs. Baoyu, startled, blurted:  “How careless—just as I was lamenting, you go and break that fan. Someday, if you have a household of your own, will you manage it so carelessly?” Qingwen, feeling stung, gave a cold laugh, “You’ve grown quite harsh lately—always scolding. Just the other day, you even struck Xi Ren. Now, over a broken fan, you blow up again. Why the fuss? It’s only a fan. Far bigger things have been broken before—porcelain jars or glass bowls—and you never gave a second thought. So why erupt now? Maybe you’re tired of us—fine, then dismiss us kindly. No need for a tantrum!”  Her words angered Baoyu so much he shook all over. “Then you had better leave soon enough,” he seethed. “If you despise me that badly, tomorrow I’ll see you’re thrown out.” Xi Ren, overhearing from the next room, rushed in:  “What’s going on, for heaven’s sake? I step away a moment and it’s all raised voices.” Qingwen sneered, “Oh, Sister Xi Ren, how convenient you show up—everyone praises your skill at waiting upon him! Yet you got kicked the other day. Now it’s my turn for scolding. If he’s so fed up with me, let him strike me or dismiss me. Just do it properly and be done!”  Hearing Xi Ren’s name, Baoyu realized how his ill-temper with Xi Ren might re-emerge. Furious at the tumult, he snapped:  “If you’re so unhappy, then indeed, I’ll speak to Mistress tomorrow and send you away. Might that suit you? I cannot stand this endless quarreling—life was never this full of bickering!” Xi Ren tried restraining him:  “You mustn’t bring the Mistress into it. With strangers listening, you’ll only upset her, and it does neither you nor Qingwen any good. Let’s solve it quietly, or you’ll only make everything worse.” Qingwen choked back tears:  “I never said I wanted to go.
When it was time to disperse, Baoyu stole away with Old Mrs. Liu and coaxed her into continuing that first story. Cornered, she had to improvise:  “Well… it’s a deserted shrine near the northern edge of our farmland. Not for gods or buddhas, but for some old lord… oh, I forget the name,” she said, flustered. “No matter the name or who it was—just the basic circumstances,” Baoyu pressed. “That old lord had no sons—only a daughter, named something like Ruoyu, who was educated and read. The parents doted on her like a priceless pearl. Alas, the girl took ill at seventeen and died.”  Baoyu stomped in regret. “So tragic. Then what?”  “Overcome by grief, the parents built that shrine and had a statue of her made. They hired caretakers to supply incense and stoke the fires. But many years have passed. The family died off; the shrine fell to ruin; the statue all but decayed… folks claim it’s turned into a spirit.”  “No, not a spirit,” Baoyu corrected. “Certainly such a person can’t truly die.”  Old Mrs. Liu invoked the Buddha: “So that’s how it is? We took it for a ghost. Folks say she roams around at night sometimes, and some want to smash her with mallets.”  Baoyu gasped, “They mustn’t! Leveling that shrine would be a grievous sin!”  “Your word, Master, sets me straight,” the old woman said. “Once I’m back, I’ll hold them off.”  Baoyu enthusiastically went on, “In fact, our Old Ancestress, our Lady, and everyone here are devout. We love building shrines and erecting images. Tomorrow I’ll write a donation request, so you can gather funds to rebuild that shrine and repair the statue, paying a caretaker to burn incense monthly. How’s that?”  “Well, thanks to that young lady, I’d get some funds for myself, too,” Old Mrs. Liu chuckled. Baoyu asked about the location and distance, which the old woman just made up. He took it at face value. That night, he weighed plans thoroughly, and by next morning sought out Huaijing^4, gave him a few hundred copper coins, and sent him forth in search of the location. “Bring me news, and I’ll decide on the next step.”  But as evening neared, Baoyu grew anxious. Finally at sunset, Huaijing returned triumphant. “Master, you explained it poorly. I spent the whole day trudging about, for the place names you gave me didn’t match anywhere. Finally, near the northeast corner, by some farmland ridges, I came across a battered shrine. That must be it.”  Excited, Baoyu pressed, “Good! The old woman’s memory might have been off. So, go on—did you find the statue?”  “Indeed, the shrine faces south and is indeed falling apart. I was tired and cross but decided to look inside. The statue nearly frightened me off. It looked so lifelike.”  “You see?” Baoyu cried. “It does have supernatural power and transforms into human form sometimes.”  Huaijing slapped his knees. “Human form? Master, it was no girl’s effigy at all— just a green-faced, red-haired plague deity!”  Baoyu spat in frustration, “Useless dolt, can’t handle even this simple business. Off you go, useless scum!”  “It’s not me who’s muddled,” retorted Huaijing. “You must have gleaned nonsense from some book or idle talk and believed it. So you sent me on a fool’s errand. Now you blame me—what’s it got to do with my competence?”  Seeing him offended, Baoyu softened his tone. “Calm down, no need to argue. Another day, when you’re free, look again. If it’s a hoax, that’s that. But if indeed there’s something real, and you can help preserve it, you’d earn some spiritual merit.
Xing also came out. Jia Lian said, “It’s all because of our master’s antics—now it’s all being pinned on me and Madam.”  Mrs. Xing retorted, “You unfilial wretch! Others would even risk their lives for their fathers, yet you complain about me. You haven’t behaved yourself these few days—if I were in your shoes, I’d be beaten raw.”  Jia Lian replied, “Madam, please hurry; I’ve been sent to fetch her for half a day already.” With that, he escorted his mother out to the other side. Mrs. Xing briefly recounted her side of the matter, and then, unable to do more, Jia She (Jia Zhen) himself—feeling both ashamed and helpless—soon fell ill and thereafter dared not see Grandmother. Instead, he sent Mrs. Xing and Jia Lian to pay their respects every day. In the meantime, various people were sent out to purchase and search until, at last, after spending 500 taels, a seventeen‑year‑old girl was bought and named Yanhong, to be kept in the house. For the next couple of days there was little more to report. Before long the fourteenth day arrived. It was dark early, and soon the wife of Mr. Lai arrived with invitations. Grandmother, delighted, led Mrs. Wang, Aunt Xue, Baochai, and the other sisters out to the Grand Flower Garden, where they sat for half a day. Although the Flower Garden was not as grand as the Grand View Garden, it was neat and spacious—with springs, rocks, groves, pavilions, and several charming spots. In the great hall outside, Xue Pan, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, and several close relatives were present. Mr. Lai’s household also invited several current officials and well-to-do young men as guests. Among them was Liu Xianglian—whom Xue Pan had met once before and could not get out of his mind. He learned that Liu Xianglian was especially fond of performing comic “sheng‑dan” (boy roles in opera) in folk plays, and often recited such “love and lust” pieces; misunderstanding his performance, some even took him to be one of the “romantic youths” of the theatre. Being young and handsome, his identity was misunderstood by many. Mr. Lai’s son, Lai Shangrong, who was a longtime friend of his, thus invited him as company. Yet after drinking, others managed their intoxication, except for Xue Pan—who relapsed into his old bad habits. In his sour mood, he wished to leave at once. But Lai Shangrong insisted, “Just now, Second Young Master Bao reminded me—although he saw you, with so many people around it’s hard to converse, so he told me to ask you not to leave when you’re dismissed; he still has words for you. If you insist on leaving, then I’ll have him called out so that you two may settle your differences—it doesn’t concern me.” With that he ordered the little servants, “Go inside and discreetly find an old maid to inform him. Tell him to come out quickly.” The servant obeyed. Before a cup of tea had been finished, Second Young Master Bao appeared. Lai Shangrong smiled at him, “Good uncle, leave him with you; I’ll arrange the rest,” and then departed. Bao Yu then took Liu Xianglian aside to the side-room and asked, “Have you been to Qin Zhong’s grave these past days?”  Xianglian replied, “Why wouldn’t I? The other day a few of us went falconing. His grave is about two li away; I thought that with the diligent summer rains his grave might be in disrepair. I even snuck away with the others to take a look—and spent a few hundred taels on repairs the very next morning.”  Bao Yu said, “That explains it. Last month, in our Grand View Garden, the lotus pods had ripened; I picked ten and sent Bei Mei out to offer them at his grave. When I asked him if the rain had damaged them, he said ‘Not only were they undamaged, but they look even fresher than before.’ I believe our friends have tidied up well. I only regret that I spend all my time confined at home—any movement is immediately noticed.
Why so late to bloom?’—that question to the chrysanthemum leaves it speechless indeed!” Li Wan grinned, “Hence lines like ‘hair unbound, sitting bareheaded, hugging knees as you chant in the cold fragrance’— presumably the flower might get bored of your presence if it had feelings!” Everyone laughed. Baoyu said, “So I fail again. Could my references to ‘Who cultivates them, where’s the autumn, wax sandals from afar’ etc. not suffice for ‘Visiting’? Or ‘Last night’s rain, this morning’s frost’ for ‘Planting’? They’re just overshadowed by lines like ‘mouth corners with fragrance at the moon’ or ‘holding knees in the cold fragrance’ or ‘short hair in triple-path dew, coarse cap steeped in Nine Autumn frosts, gold modestly pure, jade with subtle flaws, the dream bearing knowledge’— that’s all.” He concluded, “Tomorrow I’ll try my own set of twelve.” Li Wan said, “Yours is good. Just not quite as new in parts.”  They spent a while longer reviewing, then requested more hot crabs, gathering around the big round table to eat. Baoyu jested, “Today, brandishing claws under the cassia, we can’t be without a poem. I already made one—who dares to follow?” He set aside his chopsticks, washed his hands, took up a brush, and wrote:  Enjoying Crabs Under Osmanthus Shade by the Yihong Master “Clutching the claws, I rejoice in the cassia's shade, Splashing vinegar, pounding ginger—my craving runs wild! A gluttonous prince must have wine at hand; The swaggering ‘gentleman’ truly has no guts. Chilled brine collects inside the belly—I forget all caution; My fingers reek of fish, yet water rinses them sweet. The world exalts them for pleasing the palate— But Su Dongpo once ridiculed such a life, all hustle.” Daiyu said, “Such a poem—someone could dash off a hundred like it in a wink.” Baoyu teased, “You said earlier you were drained, that you couldn’t possibly do more, yet you’re quick to pick at me.” Daiyu said nothing, only tilted her head in brief reverie, then swiftly wrote a poem. Everyone read it:  “Steel armor, long lances—though dead, they remain, Heaped in a platter, eye-catching delight. Twin lumps sealed with tender jade, Bulging shells shining with lumps of red cream. So meaty, how I pity your eight legs; So rousing, who might prompt me to a thousand toasts? Face these fine morsels to match a fine festival, Cassia swaying in a crisp breeze, chrysanthemums graced with frost.” Baoyu was about to cheer but Daiyu grabbed the page, tore it up, and ordered it burned. She smiled, “Not as good as yours, so never mind— I’ll burn it. Yours is far better, keep it for folks to see.”  Baochai said, “I’ll produce a forced piece, likely no good, but for a laugh.” She wrote:  **Seated amid cassia haze, beneath the phoenix-trees, I raise the cup; In Chang’an, drooling mouth awaits Double Ninth. Right before us, no clear lines or angles can be traced in the road— Within the shell, layered spring-autumn illusions, all emptily black and yellow. Wine hardly washes away the fishy stink, so we add chrysanthemum; We guard against chill by strong ginger. Now tossed into the pot, what use is that? The moonlit shores remain behind—where the millet and wheat still wave.” At this, everyone exclaimed, “This is the ultimate crab ode— these lines are meaningful indeed, though the satire is quite scathing.” They were discussing further when Ping’er re-entered the Garden. What was her errand? The next chapter shall disclose. Chapter 39:  The Old Village Woman Speaks Off the Cuff; The Young Gentleman Insists on Getting to the Bottom  Seeing that Ping’er had arrived, everyone asked, “What’s your mistress up to that she hasn’t come herself?”  Ping’er smiled.
A junior servant was sent to call the ladies from the boat wharf to prepare two boats. Amid all the bustle, Grandmother Jia herself entered with a small entourage. Li Wan hurried forward to greet her with a smile, “Madam, you seem so delighted that you’ve come in—I had thought your hair was not even combed yet. I had even pinned a chrysanthemum to send you off!” At the same time, Bi Yue had already brought a large jade-green plate in the shape of a lotus leaf, on which were arranged chrysanthemums of various hues. Grandmother Jia then picked a big red one and tucked it behind her ear. Noticing Old Liu Laolao, she quickly smiled and said, “Come over and get a flower.” No sooner had she finished speaking than Fengjie pulled Old Liu over with a laugh, “Let me help you get dressed up!” As she did so, she arranged a plate of flowers all haphazardly on his head. Grandmother Jia and the assembled guests burst into hearty laughter. Old Liu himself laughed and said, “I never imagined that in my old age I’d be made to look so presentable!” The others joked, “You should have that flower plucked and thrown in his face—look at you, you old enchantress!” Old Liu laughed, “Though I’m old, I was quite the flirt in my youth, and I always adored the elegant and pretty. Today, I’ve decided to be an old flirt!”  While the conversation continued, the party moved to the Qin Fang Pavilion. Soon, the maidservants brought in a large brocaded mat and spread it on the railing and bench boards. Grandmother Jia leaned on the balustrade and invited Old Liu to sit beside her. Then she asked, “How do you find this garden?”  Old Liu, murmuring Buddhist chants, replied, “We country folk—even when we come to the city, we buy pictures to hang up at home. In our leisure hours we all say, ‘How wonderful it would be to stroll in a painting!’ Yet paintings are mere imitations—what place can compare with the real thing? Who would have thought that upon entering this garden today, it surpasses any picture by tenfold! I must insist someone make a painting of this garden so that I may show it to my family. Even if it costs my life, it will surely bring good fortune.”  Hearing this, Grandmother Jia pointed at Xi Chun and said, “Just look at my little granddaughter—she is so skilled at painting. Why don’t you have her paint one tomorrow?” At this, Old Liu, overjoyed, ran over to pull Xi Chun aside, exclaiming, “My dear, at your age—with such fine looks and talent—you must surely be the incarnation of a celestial being!” Grandmother Jia and the others all laughed merrily. After a brief rest, they led Old Liu to further sights. Their first stop was the Xiao Xiang Pavilion. As soon as they stepped in, they found that the path was flanked by clusters of green bamboo, and the ground beneath was carpeted with moss. A narrow, winding stone-paved lane ran down the center. Old Liu stepped aside to let Grandmother Jia and her party pass, choosing instead to stroll along the mossy path. Hu Po called after him, “Old Liu, come along upstairs—you might slip on the moss!”  Old Liu replied, “It matters not; we know the way well. You all carry on. Just take care your shoes don’t get muddy.” Engrossed in chatting with the others above, he failed to notice that his foot had indeed slipped on the moss. With a “thud,” he tumbled, and the onlookers burst into raucous laughter. Grandmother Jia chided, “You little clumsy fellows—lend him a hand instead of merely standing there laughing!” As she spoke, Old Liu had already clambered up again, laughing, “I only got a talking tongue and now it’s my face’s turn to get hit!” Grandmother Jia then inquired, “Did you twist your waist? Get the maidservants to give you a little massage.”  Old Liu replied, “Who says I’m delicate? Do you think I never stumble a couple of times a day? If they all hit me, what would become of me?”  At that moment, Zi Juan had already drawn aside the Xianglian Curtain and invited Grandmother Jia and her party to sit.
The Second Master ordered that no one be admitted!” Hearing this, Lin Daiyu was stunned with anger as she stood outside the door. She wanted to shout back but then hesitated, thinking, “Though my aunt’s house is as good as my own, I am still but a guest. Now that both my parents are gone and I have no one to rely on, even if I resided with them, if I let my anger show too openly, it would be unseemly.” As she pondered, tears welled in her eyes. Caught between leaving and staying, she felt utterly helpless. Just then, she heard laughter from inside—a soft murmur. Listening closely, she recognized the voices of Baoyu and Baochai. The more she thought, the angrier she became. Suddenly she recalled what had transpired earlier: “Surely Baoyu must be angry at me for telling on him—yet when have I ever told you?” she wondered bitterly. “If you don’t let me in today, does that mean we’ll never meet again?” Overwhelmed with sorrow, she could no longer stand; braving the cold dew and the biting wind along the flowered paths, she stood alone in the shadow of a wall beneath flowering trees, weeping bitterly. For Lin Daiyu, whose beauty was peerless and whose grace was rare in the world, her tears so moved even the birds resting in the nearby willow branches and blossoms took flight in alarm, unwilling to hear her sorrow. As one might say:    “Flower spirits, tear by tear, show no emotion;   In the dreams of birds, where does the madness begin?”  Another poem came to mind:   “Qin’er, with beauty rare as it may be,   Clutches her fragrance deep within her embroidered boudoir. One wail, and yet it is never enough—   Fallen petals litter the ground as startled birds take wing.”  As Lin Daiyu wept, she suddenly heard a creak at the gate. Someone was coming out—but who? (To be continued…)  Chapter 27 At Di Cui Pavilion, Yang Fei Teases Colorful Butterflies; At the Fragrant Burial Mound, Flying Swallows Weep Over Faded Crimson  Lin Daiyu was in the midst of her sorrowful tears when she suddenly heard a noise at the courtyard gate. Looking out, she saw Baochai coming out, escorted by Baoyu, Xi Ren, and a group of others. Just as someone was about to ask Baoyu about something, they feared that questioning him in front of everyone might embarrass him. So they stepped aside and allowed Baochai to approach. Baoyu and the others went inside and closed the door. Then Baochai turned back; as she gazed toward the door, a few tears fell from her eyes. Feeling that life had lost its flavor, she turned and returned, her makeup carelessly removed. Ever since long ago, Zijuan and Xueyan—who had long understood Daiyu’s sensitive nature—had habitually sat in silence. They were either lost in frowns or deep in sighs, and for reasons unknown they would often weep without drying their tears. In the past, people had attempted to comfort her with kind words—fearing that thoughts of her parents and home might cause her further distress—but over the course of a year, such scenes had become so familiar that no one bothered to offer consolation any longer. They left her to sit alone in silence while they went off to do their own business. Daiyu, leaning against the bed’s railing with her arms wrapped around her knees and tears brimming in her eyes—as if she were a carved figure of wood or molded clay—remained seated until well past the second watch of the night before finally falling asleep. Not a word was spoken throughout that long, silent night. The next day turned out to be April 26th—by tradition, the end of the Grain in Ear (Mangzhong) season. According to ancient custom, on the day marking the close of Mangzhong, one must arrange an array of gifts and hold a farewell ceremony for the Flower God; for once Mangzhong passes, summer begins, all the blossoms wilt, and the Flower God abdicates his throne. In the inner chambers, this custom was especially popular, so everyone in the Grand View Garden rose early. The young ladies, some having fashioned sedan chairs from flower petals and willow twigs, others having assembled banners from layers of woven brocade and gauze, all tied these items with colored strings. Every treetop and every flower branch was adorned with these festive ornaments.
Daiyu glowered at him a good while, gave a sharp sigh, and resumed crying into her handkerchief. Baoyu’s heart was weighed with guilt and, seeing her tears, he, too, wept. Feeling around his sleeves for a handkerchief and finding none, he resorted to wiping his tears with the sleeve of his brand-new lotus-colored robe. Daiyu, through her sobs, caught sight of him using the fine cloth of his sleeve and, feeling a spark of sympathy, grabbed a small muslin kerchief from beside her pillow and flung it toward him, still covering her face with her other hand. Without speaking, she resumed weeping. Baoyu gratefully used it to dry his tears, moved nearer, and took her hand. Smiling, he said,  “I’m in such agony for you, yet you keep crying! Let’s go greet the Old Lady. If we hide away, people will talk. Please—scold me, hit me if you wish, but don’t avoid me.” Daiyu yanked her hand away. “Why must you grope at me? The older you get, the more shameless—have you no sense of propriety?”  She had scarcely finished when a mischievous voice called, “Aha! I knew you’d be fine!” Startled, they glanced up to see Wang Xifeng entering. She laughed and said,  “The Old Ancestor is fretting and fuming, so she sent me to see if you two had patched things up. I told her: ‘No need! Give them three days, they’ll be fine on their own.’ She refused to believe me. But look, sure enough, you’re each wiping the other’s tears—like two roosters with their talons locked together, fighting one minute, clinging the next. Come along now. Let’s set the Old Lady’s mind at rest.” With that, she grabbed Daiyu’s hand and led her outside. Daiyu called to her maids, but no one came. Wang Xifeng teased, “No need to call them—I’m more than enough,” and half-dragged her out, with Baoyu hurrying after them. Exiting the garden, they headed for Jia Mu’s rooms. Once inside, Xifeng said with a grin, “I told the Old Lady you’d sort it out. She called me lazy and scolded me, so I came in a rush, only to find you already back to being good friends—like ‘a hawk clutching a sparrow’s foot!’ Hah, I guess I was right after all.” Everyone present had a good laugh. Baochai happened to be there. Daiyu said nothing, taking a seat next to Jia Mu. Baoyu, unsure how to proceed, turned to Baochai and said, “It’s Brother Xue Pan’s birthday, yet I’m under the weather and can’t attend. He might misunderstand, thinking I’m being rude. Sister, would you explain things on my behalf?”  Baochai replied, “Why fret about that? If you weren’t ill, you’d go or not go as you please—brothers don’t stand on ceremony like that. There’s no need to worry.”  Baoyu said, “As long as you see my point.” Then, “Sister, why didn’t you stay to watch the performance?”  Baochai answered, “It’s so hot. I managed two scenes before nearly fainting, but the guests were still there, so I feigned illness and escaped. Please, do excuse me.”  Realizing she was still vexed about yesterday, Baoyu reddened slightly. He forced a chuckle and ventured, “They often compare you to Imperial Consort Yang; indeed, you’re blessed with a well-pampered constitution.” Baochai’s cheeks flushed at the remark. She wanted to lash out but held back, yet her face grew darker. At length, controlling herself, she gave a cold laugh:  “Yes, I must be the next Yang Guifei. Too bad I haven’t any decent brother or cousin to play the part of Yang Guozhong, have I?” While she was speaking, a little maid named Liang’er ran in, searching for her missing fan.
In the Yíhóng Courtyard, Bao Yu quietly urged the servants to gather tea and even helped reapply makeup to Ping’er with gentle instructions. Amid all this, the conversation turned toward the impending prospects of future marriages, the fate of servants, and the burdens of family honor. In a final scene, as night deepened, Yuan Yang remained awake all night, tormented by her feelings and by the accusations leveled against her. The next day, her elder brother returned from Grandmother Jia’s and, after much coaxing, brought her along to see Grandmother. Despite her reluctance and tearful protests, her brother recounted Lord Jia’s words—how he had claimed that if she did not comply, he would be forced to arrange a marriage for her against her will. Yuan Yang, red with shame and indignation, tearfully knelt before Grandmother Jia and recited everything—from Mrs. Xing’s harsh words to the bitter accusations made by her relatives—vowing that she would never marry, not even to Lord Bao Yu, even if it meant that she would remain single all her life. In a moment of desperate anger, she even produced a pair of scissors and began cutting her hair. The maids rushed in to stop her; though several strands were snipped, most of her long hair remained, and her friends quickly gathered to bind it up. Grandmother Jia, incensed by the turn of events, raged, “I have trusted you with all my heart, and now you conspire against me! They come to take away my best possessions—and when I treat them well, you all scheme behind my back! You dare take what is mine, and when I try to protect it, you turn on me!” She then scolded Mrs. Wang, and soon the entire room erupted in a cacophony of exasperated voices and bitter laughter. Mrs. Wang and others attempted to interject, but Grandmother Jia’s anger only grew as she accused everyone of deceit and of undermining her authority. Jia Lian, still drunk and blustering, was forced to kneel and apologize. Grandmother Jia berated him for his behavior—blaming him for provoking both her and the madams by mistreating Fengjie and Ping’er. In the end, Jia Lian meekly admitted his guilt, and Grandmother Jia ordered Fengjie and Jia Lian to go comfort Ping’er. As the room buzzed with commotion, servants and young maids alike joined in the cacophony. After much haggling and reconciliatory talk—and after news came in that Bao Er’s wife had hanged herself, which only added fuel to the fire—the family was in a state of disarray. Finally, Fengjie was forced to report the entire scandal to Grandmother Jia, while Jia Lian and others could only apologize profusely. Grandmother Jia, exasperated, declared that if any of them mentioned the matter again, she would personally administer a severe punishment. In the end, as the household slowly calmed, Fengjie remarked bitterly that perhaps all these troubles were ultimately caused by Bao Yu’s actions. Li Wan then scolded, “It is all because of Bao Yu—he ruined our first gathering and now continues to cause strife. Who can truly be blamed?”  Fengjie laughed wryly and said, “I suppose I’ll have to endure it for the rest of my life—if I must be treated like a ‘burnt-out child,’ so be it.”  The assembled crowd burst into laughter once more. Later that evening…  A maid announced, “Big Madam has arrived!” and Mrs. Wang hurried out to greet her. To be continued in the next installment… Chapter 47 When the Blundering Tyrant Flirts, He Gets Beaten; The Cold Gentleman, Fearing Trouble, Flees to Another Land  It happened that as soon as Mrs. Wang heard Mrs. Xing arrive, she hastily went out to meet her. Mrs. Xing, not yet aware that Grandmother had learned about the “Yuan Yang incident,” was still trying to gather further details. When she entered the courtyard, a few old maids whispered something to her, and only then did she understand. Just as she was about to leave, she saw that Mrs. Wang had brought someone out, so she had no choice but to step back inside. After first offering her respects to Grandmother, who said nothing but made her own self feel ashamed, Fengjie soon managed to dodge discussing one particular matter. Meanwhile, Yuan Yang stormed off to her room in anger.
His grave is about two li away; I thought that with the diligent summer rains his grave might be in disrepair. I even snuck away with the others to take a look—and spent a few hundred taels on repairs the very next morning.”  Bao Yu said, “That explains it. Last month, in our Grand View Garden, the lotus pods had ripened; I picked ten and sent Bei Mei out to offer them at his grave. When I asked him if the rain had damaged them, he said ‘Not only were they undamaged, but they look even fresher than before.’ I believe our friends have tidied up well. I only regret that I spend all my time confined at home—any movement is immediately noticed. Every time, someone stops me or advises me; even if I have money, I can never use it.”  Xianglian replied, “That matter is nothing for you to worry about. I shall see to it. Today is the first day of the tenth month—I’ve already arranged the expenses for the grave visit. You know, I am poor and have nothing to accumulate; even if I receive a few coins, they vanish in an instant. Why not save a little for yourself so you won’t be burdened later?”  Bao Yu said, “That’s precisely why I was going to send Bei Mei to fetch you. You don’t spend much time at home—always drifting about without a fixed place.”  Xianglian replied, “There’s no need to fetch me; every man must mind his own business. Today, I must go out for a walk. Perhaps later, when I return, I can update you on my situation.”  Bao Yu asked, “And why is that?”  Xianglian coldly smiled, “My own affairs—you’ll know soon enough. I must take my leave now.”  Bao Yu said, “Very well, let’s all part ways this evening—wouldn’t that be nice?”  Xianglian added, “If you really intend to leave permanently, you must tell me in advance. Don’t slip away without a word.” Tears fell from Bao Yu’s eyes as he replied, “I understand.”  Xianglian then rose and left; shortly afterward, as he approached the main gate, he encountered Sè Pan shouting, “Who let little Liu (a nickname for Xianglian) run off?”  Xianglian’s anger flared—he nearly wanted to punch Sè Pan to death. Yet remembering that he was not one to be rough, especially in front of Lai Shangrong’s face, he bit his tongue. Sè Pan, however, upon seeing him coming out as if he were a treasure, clumsily grabbed him and said with a laugh, “My brother, where are you off to?”  Xianglian replied, “I’m just going for a walk.”  Sè Pan laughed, “Don’t you want to sit a while? You seem to have lost all your fun. Surely, if you have something important, leave it to your brother—don’t rush.”  Xianglian saw that Sè Pan was in no condition, and his heart was filled with both resentment and anger. He devised a plan and pulled Sè Pan aside to a secluded spot, asking with a smile, “Do you truly care for me, or is it feigned?”  Sè Pan, delighted beyond measure, squinted and said, “My good brother, how can you ask such a thing? If I were insincere, I’d die on the spot!”  Xianglian replied, “In that case, this isn’t the place for such matters. Sit for a moment; then when you come out, follow me quietly. We shall drink through the night. I have two excellent bottles that have never been taken out before. You needn’t bring a retinue—once we’re there, all will be provided.”  Sè Pan, emboldened by these words, cheered and said, “Indeed?”  Xianglian smiled, “Of course—if someone treats you with genuine care, you should believe it.”  Sè Pan quickly laughed, “I’m no fool; I wouldn’t not believe you. Since you say so, you go ahead; I’ll catch up later.”  Xianglian said, “I’m heading out beyond the north gate; would you be willing to spend the night outside the city?”  Sè Pan replied, “With you by my side, what need have I for a home?”  Xianglian said, “Very well, then I’ll wait for you on the bridge outside the north gate.
Best not alert the others, or trouble might follow.” Then she departed. Inside, Xi Ren said to Baoyu: “If you want anything, do be careful. . . .” But at that moment, word came from Aunt Xing’s side. Two maids arrived bringing fruit for Baoyu, also delivering messages about how the family missed him. Baoyu asked them to stay, chatted briefly, then told Qiuwen to split some fruit to send to “Miss Lin.” She had just taken it when they heard Daiyu’s voice at the door. Baoyu brightened:  “Quick, please invite her in.” What happens next must await the next chapter’s telling. Chapter 36 Embroidered Mandarin Ducks: An Ominous Dream in the Fragrant Pavilion; Recognizing Each Person’s Destiny, Baoyu Awakens to Truth in the Pear-Scented Lodge  When Grandmother Jia returned from Lady Wang’s quarters and saw that Baoyu was improving day by day, she was quite pleased. Lest Jia Zheng again summon Baoyu, she called in the head page who served Jia Zheng and instructed him:  “If there’s any guest or matter requiring someone to accompany your master, and he calls for Baoyu, do not come relaying that summons. Just say I told you this: First, Baoyu was severely injured and needs several months of proper recuperation before he can walk about; and second, his birth star is inauspicious at present—he must stay out of public view, even beyond the second gate, until after the eighth lunar month.” The page accepted this charge and left. Grandmother Jia then sent for Li Mama, Xi Ren, and the others, and relayed the same directive to Baoyu so he could be at ease. Baoyu—already averse to mingling with official-scholarly men—now took even greater delight in such a restriction. Not only did he refuse all outside visitors, he also grew lax about his usual morning and evening formalities within the household. Each morning, after a quick stroll to pay respects to Grandmother and Lady Wang, he would slip back, preferring to let the maids lead him about the garden, or, as he put it, to be a minor help to them. This carefree idling was precisely to his taste. Occasionally, if someone like Baochai tried to counsel him gently—encouraging him to be mindful of studies and official ways—he became irritated, declaring:  “Such a fine, pure young lady stooping to fish for worldly fame and repute, falling into the ‘national traitor and salary-seeking devils’ crowd—just as some ancient texts urged. That’s all empty contrivance, invented by earlier folk to trap future generations of men. I was merely born unlucky enough to see even you all in this once-sheltered boudoir succumb to such nonsense, thereby betraying the endowment of Heaven and Earth’s pure essence.” Hearing him rant this way, no one bothered him with “serious talk” anymore—only Lin Daiyu, since she had never urged him to chase fame. Thus Baoyu held Lin Daiyu in special regard. But let us set aside these trivialities. Now, we turn to Wang Xifeng. Ever since Jin Chuan’er’s death, she noticed that certain stewards and maids from the outer quarters repeatedly came with gifts for her or dropped by with flattering greetings. She grew suspicious, not knowing their motive. One day, upon receiving yet another gift from them, she confided in Ping’er after suppertime:  “Sister, can you guess why they keep bringing me presents? I can’t figure it out.” Ping’er gave a wry chuckle: “Madam, do you truly not remember? My guess: each of them likely wants the opening left by Jin Chuan’er’s death. Over at Lady Wang’s side, there are four main serving girls, each drawing a monthly allowance of one tael of silver. The rest get only a few hundred copper coins each month. Now that Jin Chuan’er’s gone, that ‘one tael a month’ slot is open, so all those families are vying for it.”  Wang Xifeng, hearing that, brightened: “Ah—yes, that must be it. They’re not satisfied with the money they earn by other means, or the easy tasks they already enjoy. They want that special slot for their daughter.
Immediately, Baochai entered with a pill in her hand. She addressed Xi Ren:  “Tonight, dissolve this medication in a bit of wine and apply it where the bruises are. That’ll dissipate the hot toxins beneath his blood. He should recover soon.”  She passed the pill to Xi Ren, then turned to Baoyu: “How are you feeling now?” Baoyu thanked her, saying, “A bit better.” He motioned her to sit. Baochai, seeing him able to speak with open eyes—unlike before—felt somewhat relieved. She gently nodded and sighed:  “Had you just listened to good advice, none of this would have happened. Think how it pains not only Grandmother and Aunt Wang, but all of us who care about you. . . .” Half through her remark, she fell quiet, as though swallowing her words. A faint redness tinged her cheeks; her eyes glistened with an unspoken sympathy. Lowering her gaze, she fussed with her sash. Her expression carried that delicate mixture of tender pity and anxious concern, so poignant that Baoyu, seeing it, forgot his pain entirely. He marveled, They each show me such care. If so, how might they grieve if I truly died? He was lost in these thoughts when Baochai turned to Xi Ren:  “So how exactly did this flare up, causing such a beating?” Xi Ren quietly repeated what she had heard from Bei Ming—that it was tied to the matter of Qiguan and Jin Chuan’er. Baoyu had not known about Jia Huan’s role, but now Xi Ren revealed it. Hearing her mention Xue Pan as well, he quickly cut her off:  “My Elder Brother Xue would never do such a thing—don’t assume so.” Baochai, perceiving he was anxious to shield her from suspicion, gave a half-smile. Then she said,  “No use blaming this person or that. In my opinion, it’s that you keep bad company and your father took offense. As for my brother, even if he did speak ill-advisedly, it’s typically just random talk—he wouldn’t realize the harm of repeating things that others keep quiet. Xi Ren, you’ve only known Baoyu’s careful style; my brother’s the opposite, fearless, blurting out whatever crosses his mind. So don’t think he was purposely stirring trouble.” Hearing herself named, Xi Ren recalled that Baoyu had cut her off, likely fearing it would embarrass Baochai. She felt self-conscious; Baoyu, for his part, found Baochai’s frankness half upright, half protective, further moving him. Just then, Baochai said:  “I’ll let you rest. Don’t dwell on things. Tonight, remember to apply that remedy. Tomorrow I’ll come check on you again.” With that, she got up to leave. Xi Ren followed her to the courtyard, softly saying, “Miss, you’ve taken so much trouble. When our young master is better, he will come thank you himself.” Baochai replied,  “It’s nothing. Just make sure he rests, not fretting or fussing. If he wants anything to eat or play with, just ask me quietly—I’ll send it. No need to bother Grandmother or Aunt. Letting the Master hear about it would only spark more wrath, even if in the moment it seems fine. One slip, he suffers again.” So saying, Baochai departed. Watching her go, Xi Ren felt a deep gratitude. Returning inside, she found Baoyu lying there with a pensive air, half dozing, half awake. So she stepped out to wash and refresh herself. Baoyu lay silent in his bed. Yet his lower body burned and stabbed with pain, as though pierced by needles or incised with knives, and the heat felt like open flame. Each time he shifted, he involuntarily groaned “Aiyo!” By now twilight had fallen, and Xi Ren was still out. Two or three other maids hovered in attendance, but he told them,  “You may go wash up. I’ll call if I need anything.” They obeyed, leaving him alone. He dozed fitfully, drifting into a half-sleep, in which Qiguan seemed to appear, lamenting about the men from Prince Zhongshun’s house; then Jin Chuan’er emerged, weeping over her fate in the well.
Ever since Baoyu had fallen ill, Jia Yun had memorized the names of the notable maids in the household. Seeing that this maid was serving tea in Baoyu’s room, and with Baoyu sitting nearby, he quickly rose and laughed, “Sister, why are you serving me tea? I’m here at Uncle’s house—not as a guest. Let me pour my own tea.” Baoyu said, “Just sit; the maids are handling it as always.” Jia Yun replied, “Even so, how could I dare be impertinent in the presence of the elder sisters in this house?” He then sat down to enjoy his tea. Baoyu and Jia Yun exchanged idle chatter about which troupe’s actors were the best, which gardens were loveliest, which maids were most attractive, whose banquets were lavish, who had exotic goods and curiosities, and so on. Jia Yun merely went along with Baoyu’s words. After a while, noticing that Baoyu was becoming listless, Jia Yun got up to take his leave. Baoyu did not insist; he said, “If you have free time tomorrow, do come again,” and then ordered the little maid Kui’er to see him out. Once outside Yihong Court, seeing that no one else was around, Jia Yun strolled slowly while chatting with Kui’er. He first asked, “How old are you? What’s your name? What do your parents do? How many years have you been in Uncle Bao’s household? And how much is your monthly allowance? Also, how many girls are there in Uncle Bao’s house altogether?” Kui’er answered each question in turn. Then Jia Yun said, “That little maid who just spoke—is her name Xiao Hong?” Kui’er laughed, “Yes, that’s her. What did you ask her for?” Jia Yun replied, “Earlier she asked about some silk; I happened to find a piece and selected it.” Kui’er laughed and said, “She asked me several times, but did you see her silk? I don’t have the time for such things. Today she asked me again, saying that if I found it, she’d thank me. We were just talking at the gate of Hengwu Court; even Second Master heard it—it wasn’t me fibbing. Ah, Second Master, since you’ve chosen it, give it to me. Let’s see what she will use as a token of thanks.” It turned out that last month when Jia Yun had come in to plant trees, he had found a piece of embroidered silk, knowing it had been lost by someone in the garden—but not knowing who, he hadn’t dared to ask. Now, hearing Kui’er mention Xiao Hong, his heart leaped with joy. Seeing Kui’er press him for an answer, he secretly retrieved a piece from his sleeve, smiled at Kui’er, and said, “I’m giving this to you. If she wishes to thank me, don’t you dare keep it secret!” Kui’er readily agreed, took the silk, and delivered it to Jia Yun before returning to find Xiao Hong—this part need not be recounted further. Now, after Baoyu had seen off Jia Yun, he lay in the garden feeling languid, as if still in a hazy daze. Xi Ren then came over, sitting at the edge of his bed and chiding, “Why are you about to sleep again? You look so listless—wouldn’t it be better to go out for a stroll?” Baoyu, smiling and taking her hand, replied, “I do want to go—but I’m reluctant to leave you behind.” Xi Ren laughed, “You never have any other excuse!” As she spoke, she pulled him up. Baoyu said, “But where should we go? Everything feels so tedious and wearisome.” Xi Ren replied, “Once you step outside, all will be well. Continue moping like this, and your heart will only grow more weary.” Resigned, Baoyu allowed her to lead him. He staggered out of his room, played with a sparrow on the corridor, then stepped out into the courtyard. Following the course of the Qinfang Creek, he admired the goldfish swimming about.
Fengjie demanded, “I’m not a ghost! Why, when you see me, do you not stand still but instead run forward?”  The maid sobbed, “I didn’t see Grandmother coming. I thought the house was empty, so I ran off.”  Fengjie roared, “Since the house is empty, who told you to come? Didn’t you hear me and Ping’er calling your name over and over? You ran so fast that I had to shout at you repeatedly! You’re not far away—are you deaf? And you still try to contradict me!”  With that, Fengjie raised her hand and struck the maid sharply. The blow sent the little maid staggering and, with another slap to the face, her cheeks turned purple with the force. Ping’er quickly interceded, “Madam, be careful—your hand!”  Fengjie, incensed, said, “Ask her again why she ran off. If she won’t speak, I’ll tear her mouth to shreds!”  At first the maid tried to hold her tongue, but when Fengjie threatened to brand her with a red-hot iron, she finally burst out, “Second Young Master sent me here to keep an eye on you—he was to see you off when Grandmother left! I wasn’t expecting Grandmother to come back so soon!”  Fengjie, seeing there was more to the story, pressed further, “So, why were you keeping an eye on me? Didn’t he order you to escort me home? There must be another reason—tell me quickly, so that from now on I may take care of you properly. If you do not tell the truth, I’ll have no hesitation using a knife to cut your flesh!”  In her anger, Fengjie snatched a hairpin from her hair and began to jab it wildly at the maid’s mouth. Terrified, the maid dodged and cried, “I’ll tell you, please don’t say I told on you!”  Ping’er urged her to speak, and the maid, between sobs, managed to say, “Second Young Master has just arrived—he opened his treasure box and took two pieces of silver, along with two hairpins and two bolts of satin—and told me to secretly deliver them to Bao Er’s wife. After he collected the items, he then returned to the house. Second Young Master ordered me to keep an eye on you. As for the rest, I don’t know anything.”  Fengjie’s face paled with anger. She abruptly rose and stormed toward the house. At the door, a little maid peeked out; upon seeing Fengjie, she shrank back and ran off. Fengjie shouted after her, “What were you going to tell me?”  The little maid cried out, “Second Young Master is at home…” and repeated everything she had heard. Fengjie spat, “Why didn’t you say so sooner? Now that I’ve seen you, get out and clear yourself off!” With that, she smacked the maid again so forcefully that the maid stumbled and scurried away on tiptoe. Fengjie then went to the window to listen. Inside, she heard voices teasing, “It would be better if your ‘Yama wife’ were dead!”  Jia Lian retorted, “If she dies, you can always remarry—what’s the big deal?”  Another voice added, “If she dies, at least you’d have Ping’er properly set; that might be better.”  Jia Lian grumbled, “Now even Ping’er won’t let me have a word. Ping’er’s full of grievances but dares not say a thing. I must have been born under a cursed star!”  Fengjie, furious and overwhelmed by the escalating teasing, suddenly turned and struck Ping’er twice. Then, kicking open a door, she barged in without waiting, seizing a servant from the Bao household and starting to beat him. Fearing that Jia Lian might leave, she roared at the door, “You harlot! How dare you steal your master’s man and then even use his wife to cover it up! Ping’er, come here—if these harlots keep mocking me, I’ll have none of it!” She then struck Ping’er several more times.
It’s not the way things should be.”  Daiyu replied, “It’s hopeless. I know my illness is incurable. And besides, judging by how I look at my best, one can tell…”  Baochai nodded, “Exactly. The ancients said, ‘One who eats grains will live,’ but your diet fails to nourish your vital energy and blood. That is no good.”  Daiyu sighed, “‘Life and death are decreed by fate, and wealth and honor belong to heaven’—one cannot force it. This year, I feel even worse than in previous years.” As she spoke, she coughed two or three times. Baochai said, “Yesterday I noticed that your prescription had too much ginseng and cinnamon. Although they boost energy and replenish the spirit, they shouldn’t be so warming. In my opinion, we should first focus on soothing the liver and nourishing the stomach. Once the liver fire is subdued, it can’t overcome the earth; the stomach will recover, and your diet will naturally restore you. Every morning, take a little high-grade bird’s nest—say, one tael—and five qian of rock sugar, and cook a porridge in a silver pot. Once accustomed to it, it is even more efficacious than medicine—it is most nourishing and yin-restorative.”  Daiyu sighed, “You always treat others kindly—but I sometimes suspect you hide ulterior motives. The other day you advised me against reading miscellaneous books, and I was so grateful to you. In hindsight, I must have been mistaken, for I’ve only harmed myself. Now that I reflect, when my mother passed away, I had no siblings. I’ve reached fifteen years of age without anyone to guide me as you once did. No wonder Yun often praises you. In the past I resented your admonitions, but now I see their truth. For instance, when you suggested that I eat bird’s nest porridge—though bird’s nest is easy to come by, I, being so frail and afflicted by this recurring illness, have little recourse. The doctors and decoctions, with all that ginseng and cinnamon, have turned my world upside down. Now I’m writing new verses about it—why, then, should I trouble myself with bird’s nest porridge? Grandmother, Madam Wang, and Fengjie will have nothing more to say, and the maids below will surely think me too meddlesome. You know how everyone gossips behind my back…”  Baochai smiled, “In that case, I am just as you are.”  Daiyu replied, “How can you compare? You have a mother and a brother; your family still owns property, houses, and land. You simply live off family connections without truly contributing to household affairs, while I have nothing—my every possession, every blade of grass, is like that of the other maidens. What do you expect? I’m bound to be the subject of endless scorn!”  Baochai laughed, “In the end, it will only amount to a modest dowry someday; you needn’t worry too much.”  Hearing this, Daiyu blushed and said, “Others regard you as a proper person and confide their troubles in you, yet you laugh at me!”  Baochai smiled, “Even if it is in jest, it is the honest truth. Don’t worry—if you stay with me for a day, I will help pass the time. Tell me your grievances; I’ll see to it that they’re resolved. I have a brother, as you know; though he is superior to you in some respects, we share similar fates. We are, in effect, fellow sufferers. You are an understanding person—why should you recite some ‘lament of Sima Niu’ about your woes? Sometimes, less is more. Tomorrow, I’ll speak with my mother; I suspect we have some bird’s nest left over that I can give you. Then, have the maids cook it up—cheap and quiet—and you’ll be well.”  Daiyu laughed and said, “It’s a trifle, but I’m touched by your kindness.”  After this, Daiyu sipped a bowl of thin porridge while reclining on her bed. As dusk approached, the sky darkened and a steady rain began.
Beside him, Bao Yu laughed and advised, “Dear sister, you should put on some powder—otherwise you look as if you’re sulking against Fengjie. Besides, today is your good day; Grandmother herself sent someone to comfort you.”  Ping’er agreed and went to fetch some powder—but none could be found. Bao Yu hurried to a dressing table and opened a Xuanyao porcelain box. Inside lay ten jade hairpin-like flower sticks. He picked one up and handed it to Ping’er, laughing, “This isn’t lead powder—it’s ground purple jasmine seeds prepared with proper recipe.”  Ping’er examined it carefully in her palm. It was light, with a subtle rosy fragrance and a delicate, balanced texture that, when applied, spread easily and imparted a gentle glow—unlike any coarse powder she’d known before. Then she saw a packet of rouge—not merely a sheet, but a small white jade box containing a paste resembling rose petal jelly. Bao Yu explained with a smile, “The rouge sold in the market is impure and faint in color. This is the best quality—extracted from the finest rouge, clarified, and steamed with floral dew. Just a small dab on the lips will do; dissolve a little in water and apply it on the palm, and it is enough to refresh your face.”  Following his instructions, Ping’er carefully applied the cosmetics. Instantly, her face became beautifully radiant and fragrant. Bao Yu then took a blossoming autumn herb with twin blooms, snipped it with bamboo scissors, and pinned it in her hair. Just then, Li Wan sent for him, and he hurried away. Bao Yu, who had never before fully revealed his heart to Ping’er—and who regarded her as an exceptionally bright and graceful beauty, far surpassing the crude common folk—felt deep resentment. Today, on Jin Chuan’s birthday, he spent the entire day in gloom. Yet later, when the incident unfolded, he found that in Ping’er’s presence he was able to show a small measure of care—a rare pleasure in this life—and lay in bed, his heart quietly content. But soon his thoughts turned to Jia Lian. He knew that Jia Lian indulged in sensual pleasures without a care for proper refinement; and that Ping’er, having no parents or siblings of her own, was entirely responsible for serving Jia Lian and his wife. That she managed everything so meticulously, even under Jia Lian’s vulgar and Fengjie’s domineering manner, moved him deeply—and he bitterly thought how ill-fated she was. With such thoughts, his heart ached anew. After a while he got up; noticing that the wine had nearly been finished, he retrieved an iron and pressed his clothes, then discovered that his silk garment still bore traces of tears. He washed it in a basin and hung it to dry. With a mix of joy and sorrow, he lingered in silence for a long time before returning to Dàoxiāng Village. After some idle chatter and lighting of the lanterns, the gathering dispersed. That night, Ping’er stayed with Li Wan while Fengjie slept with Grandmother Jia. Jia Lian returned to his room late, cold and solitary; too disconsolate to call for anyone, he ended up sleeping roughly through the night. The next morning, he awoke thinking of the previous day’s events and found them utterly meaningless—he regretted having come at all. Mrs. Xing, recalling that Jia Lian had gotten drunk the previous day, hurried over early and summoned him to Grandmother Jia’s side. With a heavy heart, Jia Lian had no choice but to go before Grandmother Jia and kneel. Grandmother Jia asked, “What has happened?”  Jia Lian, forcing a smile, replied, “I was, you see, overcome by drink yesterday and frightened Grandmother’s carriage; today I have come to atone.”  Grandmother Jia spat, “You scoundrel! After drinking cheap wine, instead of remaining quiet like a proper corpse, you end up beating your own wife! Feng, you constantly run your mouth like a tyrant—yesterday you scared everyone. Were it not for me, you might have ruined his life! What will become of you?”  Jia Lian, filled with indignation yet too ashamed to argue, only admitted his guilt. Grandmother Jia continued, “And yet Feng and Ping’er are both beautiful – surely that is no excuse!
He thought, “Can there be another melancholy girl, burying flowers like Daiyu?” Then he mused: “If she really is burying flowers, that’d just be a pale imitation—nothing new, but rather tiresome.” He intended to say, “You needn’t mimic Miss Lin.” But before he spoke, he took a look through a gap in the vines and saw a girl he barely recognized: seemingly one of the twelve young performers learning to act in the mansion’s small troupe. He couldn’t make out if she played the “sheng, dan, jing, or chou” roles, nor did he recall her name. Baoyu stuck out his tongue, thankful he hadn’t blurted some rebuke—he recalled how his previous rash remarks had offended both Daiyu and Baochai. He watched more closely. The girl—her brows arched like spring hills, her eyes glimmering with autumn’s depths, her figure slender, possessed a fragile grace reminiscent of Lin Daiyu. Baoyu felt pity and could not turn away, but lingered, entranced. He saw that, though she clutched a gold hairpin, she was not digging ground to bury blossoms. Rather, she traced characters in the dirt. Baoyu peered at each stroke. The brush-like hairpin made eighteen strokes in total. Using his finger on his palm, he mimicked them and thought, “What might this be?” Concluding it was a single character, he wrote it in full: “蔷” (qiáng), part of “蔷薇” (rose). “So perhaps she’s inspired to compose lines about roses,” he surmised. “Or maybe she jotted down a phrase and is reflecting on it. Let me see what else she writes.”  But the girl continued to write the same character “蔷” over and over, dozens of times. Baoyu, transfixed, watched as her hairpin kept etching “蔷” repeatedly. “Surely she must have some untold sorrow if she carries on like this,” he thought. “From her frail form, how might she endure such inner torment? If only I could bear some of her sorrow for her.”  Just then, fickle summer weather delivered a sudden gust of cool wind and a quick shower. Raindrops fell, spattering her head, and quickly dampened her clothing. “She can’t possibly bear this rain—she’ll catch cold,” Baoyu thought. Overcome by concern, he called out, “Stop writing—your clothes are all wet!”  Startled, the young actress looked up, seeing only half a figure behind the vines, exclaiming, “Thank you, sister, for the warning. Do you have some shelter out there?” She took Baoyu for another maid. Baoyu gasped, “Oh dear!” as he realized he himself was getting soaked. He yelled, “This is no good!” and bolted back toward his own Yihong Court. He reached the courtyard gates to find them locked, for the midday heat had prompted a game: Xiao Sheng Baoguan and Dan-role Yuguan, two of the acting-girls, were inside chatting with Xi Ren. When the rains came, they diverted themselves by blocking off the courtyard’s drains to flood the pavement, letting ducks and small toy boats float around. Laughing, they locked the gate for privacy. Xi Ren and the rest made merry under the eaves. Outside, Baoyu knocked, but inside they were busy giggling and didn’t hear at first. He pounded harder. Eventually, Xi Ren said, “Someone’s knocking—go check.” Another called, “We’re all here. Who is it?” Baoyu shouted, “It’s me!” Some teased, “That sounds like Sister Bao’s voice,” but Xi Ren laughed, “Don’t be silly—why would Sister Bao be here?” Xi Ren added, “Let me peep through the door gap. If it’s someone we know, we’ll let them in, else we won’t.” With that, she approached, saw Baoyu drenched like a drowned rat, and exclaimed, “Heavens! It’s Master Baoyu!” Hastily, she opened the door, stifling her laughter.
So I have specially invited you. And wouldn’t it be delightful if a young singer joined us, so that we might revel for an entire day?” As he spoke, they went into his study, where Zhan Guang, Cheng Rixing, Hu Silai, Shan Pingren, and a troupe of young singing boys were gathered. Upon his entrance, everyone greeted him cordially. After tea, Xue Bo ordered, “Prepare a feast.” Even before he finished speaking, the servants bustled about for a long while until everything was arranged and the guests were seated. Baoyu, seeing the unusual lotus roots and melons, laughed and said, “My birthday gift has not yet arrived—it seems I’ve disturbed things instead.” Xue Pan asked, “But tell me, what new and fresh offerings do you plan to present tomorrow when you pay your respects for your birthday?” Baoyu replied, “I have nothing to present. When it comes to money and provisions, everything ultimately belongs to me; only a written word or a painted picture is truly mine.” Xue Pan laughed, “You mention painting—why, just yesterday I saw a book of erotic paintings that was exquisitely done. It even had many inscriptions, though I didn’t examine them closely; I only looked at the colophon, which turned out to be something like ‘Geng Huang.’ Remarkable, isn’t it?” Baoyu, intrigued, mused, “I’ve seen various calligraphies and paintings through the ages—where would one find a ‘Geng Huang’?” After pondering for a long moment, he couldn’t help but laugh, ordered someone to fetch a pen, and scribbled two characters on his palm. He then asked Xue Pan, “Do you really see it as ‘Geng Huang’?” Xue Pan replied, “How could I not?” Baoyu waved his hand for him to look, “It’s only these two characters—but they are not far from ‘Geng Huang’ in meaning.” When everyone looked, they saw the two characters read “Tang Yin,” and all laughed, “Surely the young master must have had a momentary lapse of vision—it can’t be helped.” Xue Pan, feeling somewhat embarrassed, joked, “Who would have thought he meant ‘sugar silver’ or ‘fruit silver’ instead!” Just then, a servant announced, “Lord Feng has arrived.” Baoyu immediately recognized that this was Feng Ziying, the son of General Shenwu Feng Tang. Xue Pan and the others all called out, “Quick, welcome him!” Before they could finish speaking, Feng Ziying entered amid much laughter, and everyone hastily arranged seats for him. Feng Ziying said with a smile, “Splendid—why not stay at home and enjoy yourself?” Baoyu and Xue Pan both laughed, “We seldom meet—how is our old patriarch doing?” Feng Ziying replied, “My father is keeping well under the protection of good fortune. However, my mother has caught a slight chill recently and wasn’t well for a couple of days.” Xue Pan, noticing a bruise on his face, laughed, “Did you get punched by someone? Your face seems marked!” Feng Ziying laughed, “Ever since I injured the son of Commander Douyu, I’ve held a grudge. If I don’t hold it in, how could I ever refrain from throwing another punch? This mark on my face is from the skirmish a few days ago on Iron Net Hill, when I got my wing clipped by a falcon.” Baoyu asked, “When did this happen?” Feng Ziying replied, “On the 28th of March; I returned just the other day.” Baoyu said, “No wonder I didn’t see you when I attended Shen Shixiong’s banquet on the third or fourth—how could I have forgotten? But you went, didn’t you? Or did our old patriarch also go?” Feng Ziying answered, “Indeed, my father went, and I had no choice but to follow. Am I to be idle and mad, while we few gather to drink and listen to music in merriment? In this misfortune there is a blessing.” Xue Pan and the others, having finished their tea, said, “Come, let us take our seats and speak at leisure.” Feng Ziying stood and said, “By all rights, I should have a few drinks with you, but today I have an urgent matter—I must return to see my father.
Xi-ren and Ping’er left together, heading out of the garden. Xi-ren invited Ping’er to come in for some tea, but Ping’er shook her head. “No thanks, maybe next time.” She was just about to head on when Xi-ren called after her:  “Wait—you know, neither the Old Dowager’s place nor Lady Wang’s has given out monthly wages yet this month. Why is that?”  Ping’er paused, glanced around to make sure no one else was within earshot, then whispered, “Don’t let it worry you—it’ll only be delayed a couple of days.”  Xi-ren arched an eyebrow, amused and slightly perplexed. “Why the secrecy? You look on edge.”  Ping’er lowered her voice further. “Here’s the truth: Our mistress has already taken this month’s wages and lent it out at interest. Until she collects from somewhere else, she can’t distribute the pay. But I’m trusting you with this secret because you asked. Don’t mention it to a single soul!”  Xi-ren smiled. “I can’t believe she’s short of money. You’d think she’d have enough by now, so why the hassle?”  Ping’er sighed, “As if! Over these few years, she’s rolled over just the wages alone to make a few hundred taels profit. Plus, she never has to spend her official allowances on herself; every ten or eight taels she squirrels away, invests again. Before long, her personal interest alone brings in well over a thousand taels each year.”  “She's using our money to generate her own interest,” Xi-ren teased, “leaving us waiting around like idiots!”  “That’s an ungrateful way to put it,” Ping’er said. “Haven’t you enough silver?”  “I have enough, sure—but no place to spend it,” Xi-ren replied. “All I do is save for that certain someone, you know.”  Ping’er said, “If at any time you need a big sum—some emergency— just come to me, I do have a little. Take it, and I’ll just deduct it from your future pay.”  “Not needed right now. If some crisis does arise, I can send for it.”  Ping’er nodded, took her leave, and walked out the garden gate, where a maid from Feng-jie’s side had come. “My mistress wants you—she’s waiting.”  “What pressing matter could there be?” Ping’er muttered. “I was just chatting with Lady Li. I’m hardly running away! But it’s always one lackey after another.”  “That’s not up to me,” the maid said. “You’ll have to discuss with the mistress.”  “You’re all getting too big for your boots,” Ping’er huffed but hurried along regardless. Arriving at Feng-jie’s place, Ping’er didn’t see her mistress in the front room. Instead, there sat none other than that old Mrs. Liu who had once come scrounging for gifts, with her grandson Ban’er in tow, accompanied by Zhang-cai’s wife and Zhou Rui’s wife. A few maids were there too, pouring out pouches of jujubes, squashes, and other produce. As soon as they saw Ping’er, they all stood respectfully. Old Mrs. Liu, remembering from her previous visit that Ping’er was no ordinary maid, jumped up first to greet her. “Greetings, Miss! Everyone back home sends you their best. I’ve been wanting to come offer respects to the Second Mistress and see you again, but the farm keeps us so busy. At last this year we had a good harvest—two more stone of grain than usual, and the melons and vegetables also yielded well. These first pickings we’ve brought aren’t even for sale. We kept the best for the Second Mistress and Misses to have a taste. I know you eat all sorts of delicacies each day, so you might be tired of them.
After my second aunt passed away, I returned home for a while, only to find you were sent here and made… well, his maid. When I do come for a visit, you don’t treat me as warmly.”  Xi Ren herself colored a bit and smiled back, “Nonsense—back then, you’d charm me with ‘Sister dear’ this, ‘Sister dear’ that, coaxing me to wash your face and brush your hair and do this or that. But now you adopt the airs of a proper young mistress. If you keep your distance, how dare I be familiar?”  Xiangyun sighed, her face still red. “Bless me, that’s so unfair! If I really had such airs, let me be struck dead right now. Look, is it not true that in all this hot weather, I came here first of all to see you? If you don’t believe me, ask Lü’er. At home, hardly an hour passes that I don’t think of you. Actually, that’s the truth!”  Baoyu and Xi Ren both laughed, urging, “Calm down, calm down. We’re only joking, but you’re taking it to heart. Still that same quick temper, we see.”  Xiangyun retorted, “He’s the one who needles me. You call me quick-tempered?”  As she spoke, she untied the silk cloth and handed a ring to Xi Ren. Xi Ren thanked her repeatedly, smiling: “So you remember me, after all. The other day, you gave rings to the other girls, and I received one from them, but now you’ve brought me one in person—I see how thoughtful you are. A trinket is a trinket, but it shows your sincere heart.”  Xiangyun asked, “Who gave it to you previously?”  Xi Ren said, “Miss Bao (Baochai) did.”  Xiangyun sighed, “So she’s the one who gave it. I was sure it was Miss Lin (Daiyu). Day in and day out, I keep telling people there’s truly no one kinder than Sister Bao. How sad we aren’t real sisters! If I only had a sister like that, no parents in the world wouldn’t matter.” Her eyes were reddening again. Baoyu interjected, “All right, no more talk about that.”  Xiangyun eyed him and teased, “I get it: you’re worried your dear Lin cousin might overhear me praising Bao sister. Are you afraid she’ll be displeased?”  Xi Ren, chuckling at Xiangyun’s frankness, said, “Miss Xiang, you’re older now, yet still so direct.”  Baoyu chimed in, “I always say trying to converse with you all is precarious.”  Xiangyun cut him short, “Dear older brother, spare me your words that give me gooseflesh. You only talk big in front of me, but with your Lin cousin—goodness knows how you sweet-talk her.”  Laughing, Xi Ren spoke up, “Let’s not banter. I do have a favor to ask of you, Miss Xiang. There’s a pair of shoes, and the insole has come loose. I’ve been under the weather and can’t manage the sewing. Could you find a moment to fix them?”  Xiangyun asked, “Why me? You have so many skilled seamstresses in your household. Why ask me to do your needlework?”  Xi Ren clarified with a smile, “You must know, in this room, Master Baoyu’s personal items are not made by outside needleworkers.”  Realizing these were for Baoyu, Xiangyun grinned, “Oh—so they’re his shoes, are they? Fine, I’ll do them for you, on one condition: that it’s your request. I can’t be saddled with tasks from everyone.”  Xi Ren laughed, “Where do you get your ideas? As if I’d trouble you for something of mine. Let me say plainly, yes, they are for him, but just accept my thanks, and never mind whose they are.”  Xiangyun teased, “I recall how much sewing I’ve done for you in the past.
When our young master is better, he will come thank you himself.” Baochai replied,  “It’s nothing. Just make sure he rests, not fretting or fussing. If he wants anything to eat or play with, just ask me quietly—I’ll send it. No need to bother Grandmother or Aunt. Letting the Master hear about it would only spark more wrath, even if in the moment it seems fine. One slip, he suffers again.” So saying, Baochai departed. Watching her go, Xi Ren felt a deep gratitude. Returning inside, she found Baoyu lying there with a pensive air, half dozing, half awake. So she stepped out to wash and refresh herself. Baoyu lay silent in his bed. Yet his lower body burned and stabbed with pain, as though pierced by needles or incised with knives, and the heat felt like open flame. Each time he shifted, he involuntarily groaned “Aiyo!” By now twilight had fallen, and Xi Ren was still out. Two or three other maids hovered in attendance, but he told them,  “You may go wash up. I’ll call if I need anything.” They obeyed, leaving him alone. He dozed fitfully, drifting into a half-sleep, in which Qiguan seemed to appear, lamenting about the men from Prince Zhongshun’s house; then Jin Chuan’er emerged, weeping over her fate in the well. Baoyu, half-conscious, tried to console them, but felt someone jostling him. Through his blurred senses, he heard sorrowful sobbing. Startled awake, he saw Lin Daiyu at his bedside. He doubted his own eyes, so he rose on an elbow for a closer look, but the stabbing pain in his hips overwhelmed him and forced him back with a cry. Weakly, he asked:  “Why have you come? The sun has barely set, the ground is still sweltering. If you catch a chill or heatstroke, what then? Though I’ve been beaten, I actually barely feel any pain. This is all for show—to trick them, letting word filter to my father’s ears. Truthfully, none of it hurts—don’t worry about me.” Daiyu, though not wailing, was silently shedding tears. That kind of wordless sobbing, choking up her throat, was even more heart-wrenching. Hearing Baoyu’s feigned nonchalance, she choked out:  “Won’t you just reform?” Baoyu sighed, “Don’t fret over me. Even if I died for their sake, I’d accept it gladly.”  He had barely spoken when they heard a maid call from the courtyard, “Second Madam (Feng Jie) is here!” At that, Daiyu realized it was Wang Xifeng. She scrambled upright:  “I’ll go out through the back—returning later.” Baoyu grabbed her hand: “Why shy away from her?” Daiyu, anxious, stamped her foot and whispered:  “Look at my swollen eyes. They’ll see and mock us!” Only then he released her. She fled out the rear just as Feng Jie entered from the front, inquiring:  “Are you feeling better? Craving anything? I can have it fetched from my quarters.” Moments later, Aunt Xue arrived. Then Grandmother Jia sent word again. Come nightfall, Baoyu took only a few sips of broth before drifting into a heavy slumber. Presently, a few older household women—Madam Zhou Rui, Madam Wu Xindeng, Madam Zheng Haoshi, all well-known and of more senior rank—came in. Having heard he was beaten, they wished to visit. Xi Ren greeted them politely, explaining in a low voice:  “He’s just nodded off. It’s best not to disturb him.” They accompanied Xi Ren to an adjacent room, sat quietly a few minutes, and told her:  “When he wakes, please let him know we came.” Xi Ren agreed, walked them to the gate, and was about to return when a servant woman approached:  “Lady Wang wants one of Young Master’s maids to come speak with her.” After a brief thought, Xi Ren told the others:  “Stay here and watch Master Baoyu. I’ll go see what Lady Wang wants.” With that, she left the garden.
In that moment, she felt disinclined to enter the room, so she wiped her tears and withdrew. Baoyu, now dressed to meet Jia Yucun, spotted Daiyu heading off, apparently dabbing tears from her eyes. Rushing forward, he called, “Where are you going? Why are you crying again? Who offended you?” Daiyu turned and forced a tight smile: “Why talk nonsense? I’m not crying.”  Baoyu teased, “Come on—your tears haven’t even dried.” He reached out as if to wipe them away, but she stepped back: “You want to bring calamity on yourself, groping at me like that!”  Baoyu laughed, “I forgot myself for a moment. Whether I live or die hardly matters when I see you crying.”  She responded archly, “If you died, that means I’ll lose your precious golden qilin, or ‘gold and jade’—whatever shall I do?” This pricked Baoyu deeply: “Are you cursing me? Or are you angry at me?” Realizing she’d again spoken heedlessly, Daiyu hurriedly softened: “All right, all right—I said the wrong words, no need to blow a fuse. Look how anxious you’ve gotten, sweating like that.” So saying, she stepped closer to blot his brow with her handkerchief. Baoyu gazed at her. “You needn’t worry.” Daiyu gave him an odd look. “What do you mean by ‘I needn’t worry’? I don’t follow.” Baoyu sighed: “Truly you don’t see? If so, all the devotion I’ve shown day by day is wasted. Our constant misunderstandings prove you can’t understand me. You’re always uneasy at heart. That’s why you’re daily ill. If you felt more at ease, you wouldn’t be so sick.”  Daiyu felt as if thunder had struck. She realized how precisely his words mirrored her own hidden thoughts. She wanted to speak a thousand sentences, but not a syllable escaped her lips. Baoyu likewise had countless more confessions, uncertain where to begin, so they both stared, speechless. After a long pause, Daiyu sobbed once, tears streaming, and turned to go. Baoyu tried to pull her back: “Don’t leave yet—hear me out.” Daiyu, wiping her tears, brushed his hand aside: “No need. I know what’s on your mind.” Without a backward glance, she was gone. Baoyu stood gazing after her in a daze. He had hurried out earlier and forgot his fan. Xi Ren, mindful of the heat, grabbed a fan to bring him. Seeing him standing there foolishly, she joked, “I noticed you left without a fan—I’ve brought it. Why stand there like a statue?” Lost in thought, Baoyu murmured, “My dear sister, I’ve never dared speak my heart, but now that I have, even death holds no fear! On your account, I’ve developed this illness, which I hide from all. Only when your own illness abates will my suffering ease. Awake or asleep, I cannot forget you!”  Xi Ren froze, alarmed, “What on earth are you talking about? We must hurry in—someone might hear!” Startled by her voice, Baoyu realized that in his stupor, he’d mistaken Xi Ren for Daiyu. Overcome by embarrassment, he mumbled, “Oh! . . . it’s you.” Accepting the fan, he slunk off wordlessly. Xi Ren stood there, deeply unsettled. He must have meant that speech for Lin Daiyu, she realized. It implies a dangerous entanglement—if they transgress in some way . . . oh dear, how can we prevent trouble? She was still pondering this when Baochai arrived from another path, calling cheerily, “Why are you daydreaming in the blazing sun?” Xi Ren quickly steadied herself: “I was watching two birds fight, amusements of nature.” Baochai laughed, “So that’s it. I saw Baoyu rush out in a hurry—I tried calling him, but he looked so preoccupied he didn’t respond.
First, he endangers the girls by neglecting their upbringing; second, he lets his own health go to ruin by not taking proper care—drinking with his concubines every day!’ Don’t you think the madams would enjoy hearing that? Lord Jia, on the other hand, might try to hide it—but isn’t that like “sticking a stick in a tiger’s nose”? Madam, don’t be angry. I wouldn’t dare to interfere. Besides, if we leave it as is, it might even backfire and cause more trouble. Lord Jia, now in his advanced years, sometimes acts in ways that are less than proper; the madams should counsel him instead. Compared with the young, these matters are trivial. Yet now—with his brothers, nephews, sons, and grandsons numbering in the dozens—how can he continue such antics before everyone’s eyes?”  Mrs. Xing sneered, “Even in families with three or four concubines, they get away with it. Why, then, is it that our household can’t? I’ve tried advising him, but he won’t listen. Even if it is Grandmother’s beloved maid, look at her—so pale with worry, and he’s the eldest son of an official; when she’s called to serve inside the house, it isn’t easy to refuse. I’ve summoned you to discuss this. It seems you’re already on the hook. I must say, if I tried to advise him, he’d hardly heed a word. You see his temper; if I cannot persuade him, then things will only escalate.”  Fengjie knew well that Mrs. Xing’s character was weak—she only knew how to curry favor with Jia She in order to secure her own position and profit from the household’s wealth. Everything in the household—every financial matter—passed through Jia She’s hands, who would invariably make deductions and claim it was for “saving expenses” on his lavish spending. Every servant, every child, obeyed him without question. Now that I hear your request, I can tell he’s once again trying to bend things to his will. (I suppose he’s trying to persuade you to do what you originally offered to do—only, in reality, he wants to extract money from me.)  Fengjie quickly accompanied Mrs. Xing’s proposal with a laugh: “Madam, you speak truly. How long have I lived to know what is proper? When I was with my parents, even a single maid—if she were as lively as a precious treasure—was given by Lord Jia without question. And behind our backs, who would believe me if I said otherwise? I’d be a fool. Whenever Second Young Master is mentioned, I worry that one day he might incur disgrace from both Lord Jia and the madams. But since Grandmother adores him, they always reward him.”  Mrs. Xing smiled approvingly and then confided, “My idea is this: let’s not mention it to Grandmother at once. If Grandmother says no, then the matter is dead. I’m thinking of speaking quietly to Yuan Yang. Even if she is bashful, if I explain it to her thoroughly and she remains silent, then all will be settled. And even if Grandmother does not agree, if Yuan Yang is willing, as the saying goes ‘if a man leaves, he won’t be detained,’ then it will work out naturally.”  Fengjie laughed, “That is indeed a clever plan—absolutely foolproof. Not to mention Yuan Yang herself: who in this household doesn’t secretly wish to rise in rank? If a maid can be promoted to a position typically reserved for a mistress, then that would be most agreeable.”  Mrs. Xing added, “Exactly so. Now, go ahead—don’t let even a whisper get out. I’ll have my dinner and then come over.”  Fengjie, inwardly pondering, thought, “Yuan Yang has always been a magnanimous maid. But now that I propose this plan, will she agree? I must go over first and coax Grandmother; then when the madams arrive, I can slip away with the others. If Yuan Yang agrees, then no harm is done; if not, Mrs. Xing, who is so suspicious, might later become furious with me. I should act quickly.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just as I arrived, my maternal aunt sent over two cages of quail.
This year, I feel even worse than in previous years.” As she spoke, she coughed two or three times. Baochai said, “Yesterday I noticed that your prescription had too much ginseng and cinnamon. Although they boost energy and replenish the spirit, they shouldn’t be so warming. In my opinion, we should first focus on soothing the liver and nourishing the stomach. Once the liver fire is subdued, it can’t overcome the earth; the stomach will recover, and your diet will naturally restore you. Every morning, take a little high-grade bird’s nest—say, one tael—and five qian of rock sugar, and cook a porridge in a silver pot. Once accustomed to it, it is even more efficacious than medicine—it is most nourishing and yin-restorative.”  Daiyu sighed, “You always treat others kindly—but I sometimes suspect you hide ulterior motives. The other day you advised me against reading miscellaneous books, and I was so grateful to you. In hindsight, I must have been mistaken, for I’ve only harmed myself. Now that I reflect, when my mother passed away, I had no siblings. I’ve reached fifteen years of age without anyone to guide me as you once did. No wonder Yun often praises you. In the past I resented your admonitions, but now I see their truth. For instance, when you suggested that I eat bird’s nest porridge—though bird’s nest is easy to come by, I, being so frail and afflicted by this recurring illness, have little recourse. The doctors and decoctions, with all that ginseng and cinnamon, have turned my world upside down. Now I’m writing new verses about it—why, then, should I trouble myself with bird’s nest porridge? Grandmother, Madam Wang, and Fengjie will have nothing more to say, and the maids below will surely think me too meddlesome. You know how everyone gossips behind my back…”  Baochai smiled, “In that case, I am just as you are.”  Daiyu replied, “How can you compare? You have a mother and a brother; your family still owns property, houses, and land. You simply live off family connections without truly contributing to household affairs, while I have nothing—my every possession, every blade of grass, is like that of the other maidens. What do you expect? I’m bound to be the subject of endless scorn!”  Baochai laughed, “In the end, it will only amount to a modest dowry someday; you needn’t worry too much.”  Hearing this, Daiyu blushed and said, “Others regard you as a proper person and confide their troubles in you, yet you laugh at me!”  Baochai smiled, “Even if it is in jest, it is the honest truth. Don’t worry—if you stay with me for a day, I will help pass the time. Tell me your grievances; I’ll see to it that they’re resolved. I have a brother, as you know; though he is superior to you in some respects, we share similar fates. We are, in effect, fellow sufferers. You are an understanding person—why should you recite some ‘lament of Sima Niu’ about your woes? Sometimes, less is more. Tomorrow, I’ll speak with my mother; I suspect we have some bird’s nest left over that I can give you. Then, have the maids cook it up—cheap and quiet—and you’ll be well.”  Daiyu laughed and said, “It’s a trifle, but I’m touched by your kindness.”  After this, Daiyu sipped a bowl of thin porridge while reclining on her bed. As dusk approached, the sky darkened and a steady rain began. The autumn drizzle fell softly on the bamboo and banana leaves, deepening the melancholy. Knowing Baochai would not come, Daiyu, by lamplight, picked up a book of miscellaneous tunes from the Music Bureau, including “Autumn Chamber Lament” and “Farewell Lament.” Moved by the rain and her emotions, she began composing a poem reminiscent of “A Moonlit Night on the Spring River,” titling it “Evening Wind and Rain at the Autumn Window.” The verses read:    Autumn flowers are bleak, autumn grasses turn yellow,   A lonely autumn lamp burns as the autumn night drags on.
Xi Ren yelped as his foot struck her in the ribs. He snarled, “You wretched lot! I treat you all kindly, and you mock me in return—are you not afraid?” He spoke through clenched teeth, then glanced down, realizing he’d struck Xi Ren. She stumbled back, stunned and in pain, tears sprang to her eyes. Baoyu, chagrined, stammered, “Oh no, I didn’t realize it was you. Did I hurt you?”  From childhood to now, Xi Ren had never been struck nor even scolded by Baoyu. This sudden blow in front of others mortified her. Yet, mindful that Baoyu hadn’t truly meant it, she forced a shaky smile. “No harm done. You’re soaked—go change quickly.”  Baoyu, sheepish, ambled inside to switch out of his wet clothes. “That was the first time I ever lashed out at someone, and look how it turned out—I happened to strike you of all people,” he said. Still suppressing her pain, Xi Ren said, “As your leading maid, I’m expected to bear blame for big or small mishaps. You can thrash me if you like—but I hope this doesn’t make you start thrashing others at the slightest provocation. When you’re angry, scaring them might be fine. But me, I admitted it was my fault for not opening the gate.”  By then, the rain had passed, and Baoguan, Yuguan, and the others had dispersed. Xi Ren, ribs aching, skipped supper. At bedtime, when she disrobed, she found a bruise about the size of a bowl on her side. Startled and uncertain, she kept silent so as not to worry others. But lying down, she felt throbbing pain that made her moan in her sleep. Baoyu, lying awake, sensed Xi Ren’s restlessness and guessed she must be hurt indeed. In the middle of the night, he rose quietly, lit a small lamp, and tiptoed over. As he neared the bed, Xi Ren coughed twice, spat up phlegm, and let out a weak moan. She opened her eyes in surprise to see Baoyu, “What are you doing?”  Baoyu said softly, “You moaned in your sleep—it must be that my kick was too forceful. Let me have a look.”  Xi Ren replied, “My head swims, and my throat feels both foul and sweet. Perhaps there’s something on the floor.”  Baoyu lifted the lamp, peering around, only to see a small puddle of fresh blood. Alarmed, he cried out, “Oh no!”  Xi Ren, seeing his reaction, was equally frightened. What happens next? We shall see in the next chapter’s telling. Chapter 31 Tearing a Fan to Elicit a Priceless Smile; The Golden Qilin Ensures a Lifelong Bond  This chapter continues immediately after the events of the previous one:  Lin Daiyu, ever since her quarrel with Baoyu, had come to regret her actions but had no avenue to approach and reconcile with him. Consequently, she spent her days feeling gloomy, as though she had lost something dear. Zijuan, noticing her mistress’s melancholy, attempted to console her:  “Really, Miss, you were a bit too hot-tempered that day. Others may not understand Master Baoyu’s nature, but how could we not? Isn’t it true that quarrels over that jade of his have happened more than once or twice?” Daiyu spat softly in mock annoyance, “Pah! You side with him and blame me for being rash. How was I rash?”  Zijuan gently explained with a smile, “Why did you have to cut off the tassel? If Baoyu was three parts at fault, you must have been seven. He’s always so considerate of you. But you, given to these little jealous tiffs, keep prodding him. That’s how it escalates.”  Daiyu was about to retort when, from outside the courtyard gate, they heard someone calling. Zijuan listened, recognized Baoyu’s voice, and broke into a laugh:  “He must be here to make amends. He never can stay away long.” Daiyu straightaway declared, “Do not open that gate!”  Zijuan, however, demurred, “Miss, it’s scorching hot—would you have him broil out there?
When finished, the combined name of this set—whether in verse, poetry, song, or a common saying—must be in rhyme with the previous line. Anyone who errs will be fined a cup.” Everyone laughed, “That’s a fine order—now go ahead and explain!”  Yuan Yang continued, “Here’s the first set. To the left is the ‘Heaven Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia said, “It has the blue sky above!”  The guests exclaimed in approval. Yuan Yang went on, “In the middle is a ‘Five-Six Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia responded, “The fragrant plum blossoms of the Six Bridges pervade to the bone!”  Yuan Yang added, “And what remains is the ‘Six-in-One Tile.’”  Grandmother Jia replied, “A red sun rises high in the clouds!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That altogether makes up a ‘Dishevelled Ghost’!”  Grandmother Jia quipped, “That ghost is clinging to Zhong Kui’s leg!”  At this, everyone laughed and cheered as Grandmother Jia downed a cup. Yuan Yang then said, “Now here’s another set. To the left is a ‘Big Long Five Tile.’”  Aunt Xue remarked, “Plum blossoms dance in the wind in full bloom!”  Yuan Yang said, “To the right is a ‘Big Five Long Tile.’”  Aunt Xue replied, “The fragrance of the plum blossoms fills the October hillside!”  Yuan Yang continued, “In the middle, the ‘Two-Five’ is the ‘Miscellaneous Seven Tile.’”  Aunt Xue said, “The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd meet on the Qixi!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “All together, it makes ‘Er Lang Touring the Five Mountains’.”  Aunt Xue added, “No mortal can compare with the joy of the immortals!” With that, everyone applauded and drank. Yuan Yang then said, “Here’s another set. To the left, a two-point ‘Bright Tile.’”  Xiangyun said, “Like the twin suns shining upon the universe!”  Yuan Yang said, “To the right, a two-point ‘Bright Tile.’”  Xiangyun replied, “Like idle blossoms falling silently to the ground!”  Yuan Yang added, “And in the middle, a four-point ‘Tile.’”  Xiangyun said, “Red apricots leaning against the clouds by the sun!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That together forms the ‘Nine-Ripened Cherry’.”  Xiangyun jested, “Yet even the imperial garden’s cherries are snatched away by birds!” Everyone laughed and took a sip. Yuan Yang then said, “Here’s another set. To the left is a ‘Long Three Tile.’”  Baochai remarked, “Twin swallows chatter in the beams!”  Yuan Yang continued, “To the right is a ‘Three-Long Tile.’”  Baochai said, “Water hyacinths, led by the breeze, form a green sash!”  Yuan Yang added, “In the middle, the ‘Three-Six-Nine’ points appear.”  Baochai replied, “Half of the three mountains sink beyond the blue sky!”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That makes up the phrase ‘An Iron Chain Tethering a Lone Boat’.”  Baochai added, “Everywhere, the winds stir up waves and woes!” When finished, they all drank their cups. Yuan Yang then said, “Now, to the left we have a ‘Heaven Tile.’”  Dai Yu softly said, “What splendid times and scenery, alas, how cruel fate is!”  Baochai glanced at Old Liu; Dai Yu, too timid to risk a penalty, kept silent. Yuan Yang said, “In the middle, the brocaded screen shows lively colors.”  Dai Yu replied, “Yet the gauze window awaits no match from a red maid’s news.”  Yuan Yang said, “And what remains is the ‘Two-Six-Eight Tile.’”  Dai Yu murmured, “Twin gazes guide the jade throne to the morning court.”  Yuan Yang concluded, “That altogether makes ‘The Basket for Picking Flowers’.”  Dai Yu added, “And the fairy cane is fragrant as it selects the peony blossoms.” After this, she took a small sip.
She laughed, “Indeed, your mansion thinks of everything: even soup needs shaped flour bits! If one hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t guess these were for soup.” Fengjie said:  “Yes, from years ago. They shape lumps of dough or watery flour, to soak in fresh lotus-leaf essence. We did it once, and I found it unremarkable. Who daily fusses with that? But if our Master Baoyu craves it . . .” Grandmother Jia, enjoying the novelty, arranged a big pot of the soup for them all. Xifeng’s lively banter amused the old lady, who teased that she used the public accounts to buy everyone’s favor. They all laughed. Baochai, from the side, quipped, “I’ve watched for years, and no matter how clever you are, it can’t rival Grandmother’s craft.” The old lady retorted with a chuckle, “Ha, child, I’m so old I can’t even be crafty. Xifeng is decent enough, better than your timid Aunt—ha!” Baoyu interjected, “But Sister-in-Law is as dear to you as Sister Lin, since you always say those who can talk well are favored.” Old Madam commented, “Oh, talkative sorts have one set of charms, while quiet ones have another. They each can be dear. If it’s all chatter, it can be wearisome, but silence can be tiresome too.” Baoyu joked, “Then which is correct? Like Sister-in-Law or Sister Lin or not? We also have these other girls—” Grandmother Jia cut him off: “Now, dear child, I’ll say this plainly: among all, including my own four granddaughters, the one I prize most is your cousin Bao (Baochai).” Aunt Xue, hearing that, quickly demurred. Lady Wang nodded, “But truly, she frequently praises Miss Bao behind your back.” Baoyu, wanting to steer the praise to Lin Daiyu, was surprised that the conversation turned entirely to Baochai. He shot her a grin; she merely turned to talk with Xi Ren. Just then, a servant arrived to escort them to dinner. They all rose, and Grandmother Jia gently told Baoyu, “Rest up, child.” Then she urged the maids, “Look after him carefully.” With that, leaning on Xifeng, she led Aunt Xue, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and the others out. The old lady demanded, “When’s that soup ready?” She asked Aunt Xue too, “What do you fancy? Our dear Feng can arrange it for you!” Aunt Xue laughed, “You do love to amuse yourself. But these fusses often go to waste.” Xifeng joked, “Ha, if the Old Ancestor didn’t despise me for being ‘tasty’ (i.e., in jest), I’d have been devoured by now!” Everyone roared. Baoyu, listening inside, also had to laugh. Xi Ren murmured, “That sister-in-law’s tongue could kill us all.”  After they went off, Baoyu beckoned Xi Ren closer: “You’ve been standing so long; you must be exhausted. Sit with me.” Laughing, Xi Ren complied. Then Xi Ren recalled: “Now that Miss Bao is outside, say if you want her to ask her maid Yinger to tie up some decorative cords.” Baoyu smacked his forehead: “I’d forgotten—thank heavens you reminded me.” He raised his voice toward the window, “Bao sister, after supper, could you have Yinger come tie some cords if she’s free?” Baochai answered from outside, “Sure. I’ll have her come.” Grandmother Jia overheard some snippet. She turned to Aunt Xue, “What’s that about?” Baochai explained, and the old lady teased, “Such a good child—he can get your girl to do bits of craft. If you need maids yourself, I have plenty. I love you so, after all.” Aunt Xue and Baochai laughed, saying Yinger was idle anyway. Laughing, they continued on. Soon Xiangyun, Ping’er, Xiangling, and others were spotted plucking balsam flowers among the rocks.
Baoyu lay turning over the possibilities. One day, Baoyu got bored wandering the same spots in the garden, so he recalled a scene from The Peony Pavilion and yearned to read it again. But even reading it twice didn’t satisfy him. He’d heard that among the twelve budding actresses in the Pear-Fragrance Lodge, a girl named Ling Guan was the best at singing. He slipped out of the corner gate to find them. Encountering some young performers—Kui Guan and Yao Guan—he asked, “Where’s Ling Guan?” They said, “She’s in her room.” He hurried to see her. She lay on a pillow, barely turning at his arrival. Having always jested easily with the other maids, Baoyu approached with a grin: “Sister, do sing the Nieao Qing Si number (the Peony Pavilion snippet).” But Ling Guan just got up and stiffly said, “My throat is hoarse. The other day, I was supposed to sing for Her Highness, and I still can’t. Why come ask me?” This left Baoyu red-faced, not used to being brushed off. He retreated. The other girls suggested, “Wait for Master Qiang (Jia Qiang). If he wants it, she’ll do it.” Baoyu asked, “Is Qiang out?” “Yes, presumably Ling Guan needed something, so he’s off to procure it.”  Soon, Jia Qiang arrived with a birdcage. He had a fancy mincing bird that performed little stunts in a model stage inside the cage. He came in, saw Baoyu, politely greeted him, and approached Ling Guan:  “Look, a new toy for you—this finch will amuse you so you won’t be bored.” But Ling Guan gave him only a frosty laugh:  “Your family tears us from our normal lives, caging us in here to learn these worthless songs, and now you bring me a caged bird for further mockery? I want none of it.” Jia Qiang tried pledging innocence, but seeing her unwavering hostility, he ended up dismantling the cage and freeing the bird. Then she moaned that she’d coughed blood, and no one truly cared for her. Jia Qiang nervously insisted he had asked a doctor who said it was minor, but she dismissed him. Baoyu, witnessing their exchange, realized that the one painting “蔷” in the rose arbor was precisely Ling Guan, so he quietly left. Jia Qiang, too absorbed with Ling Guan, paid him no mind. Baoyu returned to his room, quite shaken. Understanding now the significance of “蔷,” he felt a new pang. Arriving at the Garden, he found Lin Daiyu and Xi Ren conversing. The moment he stepped in, he exclaimed:  “Last night I said something flawed, no wonder Father calls me ignorant and shallow. I spoke of wanting only your tears to bury me, but I realize now, that was foolish. I see I cannot have them all. Everyone will have their own tears for their own destinies.” Xi Ren, recalling his earlier talk, merely said with a laugh, “You truly are half-crazed.” Baoyu fell silent, pondering how each personal bond might be foreordained, gloomily wondering, “In the end, who shall weep for me upon my grave?”  Seeing Baoyu in such a mystic mood, Daiyu guessed he had confronted yet another heartbreak but asked no details. She only said, “I was just at Aunt Wang’s, who said tomorrow is Aunt Xue’s birthday. Are you going or not? She told me to ask if you’ll send word in advance.” Baoyu replied, “I refused to attend even Uncle’s birthday last time, how can I go to Aunt Xue’s? Suppose I run into some official or dignitary—my father might hear. And I can’t bear wearing the formal clothes in this stifling heat. Aunt Xue won’t be upset, I suppose.” Xi Ren hurriedly countered, “That’s nonsense. She’s no random official; she’s your aunt living right next door—how could you skip her birthday? Just get up early, pay respects, have a cup of tea, then come back. That at least looks polite.”  Before Baoyu could respond, Daiyu teased:  “Consider all the trouble Miss Bao took fanning away your mosquitoes— if only to encourage you to make an appearance.” Baoyu, puzzled, asked, “Fanning mosquitoes?” Xi Ren explained how Baochai had once guarded him with the whisk while he napped, and he had not even realized.
She couldn’t guess who was who. On a couch, half-reclined an aged woman, behind whom stood a stunning maid, robed in gauze, gently massaging her legs. Next to them was none other than Lady Feng. Old Mrs. Liu recognized the couch-bound matriarch must be the Old Dowager, so she quickly approached with a respectful smile, bowed low, and called out: “Many greetings, old dear goddess of longevity!”  The Dowager promptly straightened and returned the greeting, ordering Zhou Rui’s wife to bring a seat for the visitor. Liu’s grandson Ban’er stood there shyly, forgetting to offer any proper greeting. “How old are you now, dear old friend?” the Dowager asked. The old woman rose from her seat. “Seventy-five this year, ma’am.”  Addressing the assembled ladies, the Dowager said, “So advanced and still so vigorous, older than me by several years. Were I to reach that age, I fear I’d hardly be able to move!”  Old Mrs. Liu replied, “We common folk have had to toil from birth. The Old Dowager was born to fortune. If we all could live so comfortably, who’d do the fieldwork?”  “Ah, how are your eyes and teeth?” the Dowager inquired. “All good, except for a loose molar on the left side that started acting up this year,” the old woman answered. “While I’m old, I’m useless,” the Dowager said. “My vision is blurred, my hearing dull, my memory gone. Half these old kinfolks, I don’t recall them. I get anxious at the idea of entertaining them, so I avoid them. I can just manage to chew a bite or two, take a nap, and amuse myself with these grandchildren when bored, that’s all.”  Old Mrs. Liu chuckled, “That’s truly your good fortune, ma’am. We can’t afford such ease.”  “Fortune, indeed, or just a worthless old carcass,” the Dowager teased, eliciting laughter from all. She went on: “I heard from Feng-lass you’ve brought a big load of melons and vegetables. I’ve had her put them away quickly. I’ve been craving some fresh produce from the field. The stuff in town markets is never as good.”  “These are just rustic trifles,” Old Mrs. Liu said. “Something fresh, that’s all. If we had our way, we’d enjoy fish and meat daily. But we can’t afford it.”  “All the same, it’s a pleasure,” the Dowager insisted. “Since we’re now acquainted, you mustn’t just go away empty-handed. If you don’t mind staying here, spend a day or two. Our place has a garden with fruit, too. Tomorrow you can have a taste, then bring some home, so your trip won’t be wasted.”  Seeing the Dowager so delighted, Lady Feng also urged, “We might not match your farmland for size, but we do have a couple of spare rooms. Stay a couple of days, share some stories from the country for our Old Dowager’s amusement.”  The Dowager smiled at Feng-lass. “Don’t tease her. She’s just a simple soul from the sticks, easily flustered by your jokes.” She signaled some maids to bring fruit for Ban’er, but the child, seeing so many strangers, dared not eat. The Dowager then had money given him, and some junior lads took him outside to play. Having finished her tea, Old Mrs. Liu started telling more stories from rural life, the trifling sights and wonders in the fields day by day, through all four seasons. The Dowager took great delight. Meanwhile, those assembled—Baoyu, the young ladies, and the rest— had never heard such talk, and found it more entertaining than a blind man’s novel performance. Though old, though rustic, Mrs. Liu possessed a streak of cleverness and had weathered many experiences. Observing how keen the Dowager was, and how much the young ones enjoyed her tales, she spared no detail. “You see,” she said, “we farm folk work fields and plant vegetables year in and year out, in spring, summer, autumn, winter, braving the elements—who has time to sit idle?
Or I might as well just die. We all have to die anyway. Then I wouldn’t hear or see . . . .” Alarmed, Baoyu covered her mouth:  “Stop—stop saying that.” Yet Baoyu’s contradictory mind was drawn by her direct sincerity. He apologized softly, and Xi Ren changed the topic, speaking of romantic trifles and ladies’ charms. Then they veered into talk of how maids might nobly die. Xi Ren realized she’d gone too far, so she quickly shut up. Baoyu lay turning over the possibilities. One day, Baoyu got bored wandering the same spots in the garden, so he recalled a scene from The Peony Pavilion and yearned to read it again. But even reading it twice didn’t satisfy him. He’d heard that among the twelve budding actresses in the Pear-Fragrance Lodge, a girl named Ling Guan was the best at singing. He slipped out of the corner gate to find them. Encountering some young performers—Kui Guan and Yao Guan—he asked, “Where’s Ling Guan?” They said, “She’s in her room.” He hurried to see her. She lay on a pillow, barely turning at his arrival. Having always jested easily with the other maids, Baoyu approached with a grin: “Sister, do sing the Nieao Qing Si number (the Peony Pavilion snippet).” But Ling Guan just got up and stiffly said, “My throat is hoarse. The other day, I was supposed to sing for Her Highness, and I still can’t. Why come ask me?” This left Baoyu red-faced, not used to being brushed off. He retreated. The other girls suggested, “Wait for Master Qiang (Jia Qiang).

The moment he stepped in, he exclaimed:  “Last night I said something flawed, no wonder Father calls me ignorant and shallow. I spoke of wanting only your tears to bury me, but I realize now, that was foolish. I see I cannot have them all.

She told me to ask if you’ll send word in advance.” Baoyu replied, “I refused to attend even Uncle’s birthday last time, how can I go to Aunt Xue’s?
Bei Mei, now at a loss, rode tightly behind. After traveling seven or eight li, as the human presence dwindled, Bao Yu reined his horse in and turned to ask Bei Mei, “Is there anyone here who sells incense?”  Bei Mei replied, “There is incense, but which type do you desire?”  Bao Yu thought about it. He needed not just any incense but specifically sandalwood, agarwood, and a third variety (often known as ‘降香’). Bei Mei laughed, “Those three are hard to come by.”  Seeing Bao Yu hesitate, Bei Mei asked, “What do you need the incense for? I recall that Second Young Master always carries a little pouch of scattered incense. Why not look there?”  This reminder struck Bao Yu. He reached to feel the little pouch hanging on his robe and discovered it already held two small incense stones. His heart leapt with pleasure. “They’re not very fancy,” he murmured. Then he reasoned, “Yet it is my own that I carry—it must be better than buying them.”  He then inquired about the charcoal. Bei Mei replied, “That won’t do at all—out here in the wilderness, where can one find them? If you need these, you should have said so earlier so that we could have brought them along at a lower price.”  Bao Yu said, “Nonsense! I am not so foolish as to run off risking my life for nothing.”  After a while, Bei Mei grinned and said, “I have an idea. I suspect that you, Second Young Master, will not only use these incense items—you will likely need others as well. Why not ride on for another two li? There is a Water-Narcissus Nunnery (Shuixian An) just ahead.”  Bao Yu asked eagerly, “The Water-Narcissus Nunnery is right here? Splendid! Then let’s go there.”  Without delay, he spurred his horse on, and while glancing back at Bei Mei he said, “The lady of the Water-Narcissus Nunnery is related to our family. Once we get there, we can borrow her incense burner; surely she will be agreeable.”  Bei Mei replied, “Even if it isn’t from our own family, any temple you are unfamiliar with would be too timid to refuse. But one thing—I’ve always seen you disdain this Water-Narcissus Nunnery. Why, then, do you now show such delight in it?”  Bao Yu answered, “I have long detested the vulgar practice of shamelessly worshipping deities and erecting temples without understanding the true origin. In days of old, rich men and foolish wives would hear of a deity and hastily build a temple, never knowing who the god really was—believing in wild legends as truth. For example, in the Water-Narcissus Nunnery they worship a ‘Luoshen’ and thus call it the Water-Narcissus Nunnery. Little do they know that there has never been any true Luoshen; it was merely the invention of Cao Zijian. Today, however, it suits my purpose perfectly, so I shall borrow their incense burner.”  Before long Bao Yu reached the gate. The elderly nun there, surprised to see him—as if a living dragon had fallen from the sky—rushed forward to greet him and ordered the old Taoist to come and take his horse. Bao Yu entered but did not bow before the Luoshen statue; he only took his time admiring it. Although it was a clay sculpture, it possessed the graceful mien of “fluttering as if startled, graceful as if swimming like a dragon; like a lotus emerging from clear waves, or the sun shining on rosy clouds.” Bao Yu was moved to tears. The elderly nun offered him tea, and Bao Yu then borrowed her incense burner to burn incense. After she had been gone for a while, she even prepared incense, ritual paper, and a paper horse. Bao Yu said, “I won’t use any of that,” and ordered Bei Mei to carry the burner to the back garden. They searched for a clean spot but could find none. Bei Mei suggested, “How about on the platform by the well?”  Bao Yu nodded. Together they went to the well platform, set the burner down, and Bei Mei stood aside.
Ping’er prepared a crab’s roe morsel; Xifeng said, “Stir in more ginger-vinegar.” After finishing it, she said, “Okay, you carry on—I must get back.” Yúanyāng teased, “Shameless thing, sneaking a share from us.” Xifeng retorted, “Don’t provoke me. I know your Master (Lian) fancies you and is about to ask Old Ancestress to let him take you as a concubine.” Yúanyāng reddened, half-laughing, “Shame on you! You’re the Mistress and you say such stuff! If I weren’t worried about dirtying you with fishy fingers, I’d wipe them all over your face!” She stepped up, hand raised. Xifeng squealed, “Good Sister, spare me this once!” Amber teased, “Now that Yúanyāng is going, can Ping’er resist? She’s only eaten two crabs but has drunk an entire dish of vinegar.” Ping’er, holding a roe-laden crab, turned to smear it on Amber’s face. “You wagging-tongue minx!” Amber giggled and dodged; Ping’er missed and lurched forward, smearing it square on Xifeng’s cheek. Xifeng, in mid-banter with Yúanyāng, was startled, crying “Ay!” so that all roared with laughter. Xifeng, too, had to laugh while scolding, “You little whore, messing up your mistress’s face as you feed your jealousy!” Ping’er quickly fetched water to rinse her off. Yúanyāng teased, “Ah, retribution in the moment!” The noise reached Grandmother Jia’s side, who asked repeatedly, “What’s so funny? Let us in on it!” Yúanyāng hollered back, “Second Mistress was vying for our crabs. Ping’er got annoyed and slapped crab roe on her face—Master and servant are brawling!” Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the rest were all amused. Grandmother Jia said, “Pity her. Give her the best bits—legs, or the belly. Let her enjoy.” Yúanyāng announced, “Plenty of crab legs here for Mistress to have.” Xifeng, having washed, returned to serve a bit more for the older folks. Lin Daiyu, wary of eating too much, had only nibbled half a crab’s claw before stepping away from the table. Grandmother Jia soon felt enough, and everyone washed their hands. Some strolled among the flowers, others watched fish in the pond. After a while, Lady Wang commented to Grandmother Jia:  “There’s a breeze here, plus we’ve eaten crab. Perhaps best to go rest inside. If you’d like more enjoyment, we can come back tomorrow.” Grandmother Jia, nodding, said, “So it shall be. I’d hate to break up your fun, but yes, let’s all withdraw.” Then she turned to Xiangyun, “Don’t let your Cousin Baoyu overindulge in these crabs.” Xiangyun assented. She also reminded Xiangyun and Baochai, “And you two, mind not to eat too much. Lovely as it is, that stuff can upset your stomach.” The two curtsied, seeing them off. Then, with the seniors gone, they told the maids to clear the remainders, setting up a fresh arrangement. Baoyu said, “No need to rearrange—let’s do some poetry. Move that big round table to the center, keep the dishes and wine on it, let folks snack at will. No assigned seats—anyone wanting to nibble can do so.” Baochai praised that suggestion. Xiangyun added, “But remember others are here.” So she prepared a second table with hot crabs for Xi Ren, Zǐjuan, Siqi, Shishu, Ruhua, Ying’er, Cuimo, etc. In the glade beneath the laurel trees, they laid two flower-embroidered rugs for the older serving-women and junior maids. They too could enjoy themselves—only needing to be on call for errands.
Though the soup is good, it just doesn’t go with plain porridge.”  At these words, Fengjie promptly agreed and sent orders down to the great kitchen. Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia confided to Madame Wang with a twinkle in her eye, “The reason I sent for you today is not for any other matter—the second day of the lunar month is Feng’s birthday. For the past two years I had planned to celebrate her birthday, but with other matters always arising the celebration was put off. Now that everyone is here and there seems to be no pressing business, we can all enjoy a fine day together.”  Madame Wang smiled, “I had been thinking the same. Since Grandmother is pleased, why not settle on a plan?”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “You know, in past years it did not matter who celebrated their birthday—the gifts were given separately. That has become too formal and standoffish. This year, I intend to try something new—something that is both informal and fun.”  Madame Wang eagerly added, “Tell me, Grandmother, what do you have in mind?”  Grandmother Jia explained, “I was thinking we might follow the custom of a small family, pooling our money together so that everyone contributes a share. Don’t you think that’s a fine idea?”  Madame Wang replied, “That sounds excellent—but how exactly are we to pool it?”  Upon hearing this, Grandmother Jia’s delight grew. She immediately sent for Aunt Xue, Aunt Xue’s husband’s sister (Xing’s wife), and others—including the young ladies, Bao Yu, as well as the Youshi and the Lài family members, and even some of the respectable ladies in charge. Before long—within the span of one meal—all the elders and youngsters, from the highest to the lowest, crowded into one room. (In the customs of the Jia household the elders who serve their parents are held in higher esteem than the younger masters, so while You and Feng and others remained standing on the floor, the senior matron of the Lài family and three or four other elderly nurses had been provided with small stools to sit upon.)  Grandmother Jia cheerfully recounted the previous evening’s conversation to everyone, and all joined in the merriment. Some were pleased to see Fengjie doing so well, while others, even anxious to curry favor with her, practically clamored for the chance. Since everyone was eager to offer their share, the idea was met with unanimous approval. Grandmother Jia began, “I will contribute 20 taels.”  Aunt Xue (Suo Xie, known as Xue Yima) laughed, “I, following Grandmother’s lead, will also give 20 taels.”  Madame Wang and Xing’s wife then said, “We dare not equal Grandmother; naturally, we are a step lower—each giving 16 taels.”  You (Youshi) and Li Wan laughed, “We, too, are lower in status, so let us each give 12 taels.”  Grandmother Jia quickly chided Li Wan, “You poor widow—you need not worry about coming up with the money; I will pay your share for you.”  Fengjie interjected with a laugh, “Grandmother, don’t get too excited. Let’s tally up the accounts before taking on the task. Grandmother already has two shares in your account. But if you then pay 12 taels for our eldest sister, you may feel your heart soften upon reflection later—and then say, ‘It was all spent on Feng’s sake.’ Perhaps you might contrive a clever scheme to coax me into producing three or four times that amount secretly, and I might even dream about it!”  At this, everyone burst into laughter. Grandmother Jia asked, “And what do you propose?”  Fengjie smiled, “Since the birthday hasn’t arrived yet, I have already suffered enough. I won’t contribute a single penny myself. To stir up all these people would truly unsettle me. It’s best if I let our eldest sister’s share cover it—so that on the day she gets more food, she may truly enjoy her fortune.”  Xing’s wife and the others concurred, and Grandmother Jia assented. Fengjie then continued with a laugh, “I have one more thought. I propose that the Old Ancestor himself contributes 20 taels, along with 2 shares from Lin (our younger sister Bao’s family); while Aunt Xue contributes 20 taels along with 1 share from Bao’s side.
There’s nothing you could have done. Her passing is sad, but a fleeting matter.”  Lady Wang sighed, “Nevertheless, I can’t rest easy. I’ve already given her mother fifty taels of silver. I wanted to provide some new clothes from the girls’ wardrobes to wrap her in. But only Lin Daiyu’s birthday outfits were finished, and that child is so sensitive—how could I use her clothes for a burial? So I’ve ordered tailors to hurry up a new set. If it had been some ordinary maid, I’d just give silver. But Jin Chuan’er, serving me intimately, was almost like a daughter…” She broke into tears again. Baochai gently said, “Aunt, no need to strain yourself further. I have two sets of new garments that might be suitable. We can use those—why trouble to have new ones made this instant? She often wore my hand-me-downs, so presumably they’ll fit.”  Lady Wang asked, “But wouldn’t you mind the bad omen?”  Baochai smiled, “I never bother with such superstitions.” She left to fetch them, accompanied by two serving women Lady Wang had assigned. Returning, they found Baoyu seated near Lady Wang, tears brimming. Lady Wang had evidently been scolding him but fell silent when Baochai arrived. Perceiving the tension, Baochai said nothing further, handing over the clothes, which Lady Wang then sent off with Jin Chuan’er’s mother. Chapter 33 Hostile Glances Among Kin Over a Few Words; Various Misdeeds Lead to a Harsh Paternal Reprimand  Lady Wang summoned Jin Chuan’er’s mother, handed her a few pieces of hair ornaments before her very eyes, and instructed, “Invite a few Buddhist monks to recite prayers, releasing her soul from suffering.” Jin Chuan’er’s mother kowtowed, expressed gratitude, and departed. Baoyu, returning from his meeting with Yu Cun (Jia Yucun), heard that Jin Chuan’er had taken her own life out of shame. The news rent his heart in two. Then, after he came inside, Lady Wang had stern words of reproach for him, to which he had no real reply. Spotting Baochai entering, he quickly seized the moment to slip away. Uncertain of where to go, he wandered aimlessly, hands clasped behind his back, head bowed. Sighing to himself, he ambled into the front hall. Just as he rounded the painted screen, he collided head-on with someone coming the other way. That person barked, “Stop there!” Startled, Baoyu lifted his eyes and, seeing it was none other than his father Jia Zheng, he instantly sucked in a sharp breath and silently stood off to one side, hands lowered. Jia Zheng demanded, “What is this forlorn look? A moment ago Yu Cun wanted to see you, and you took an age to appear. Once you finally did, you scarcely uttered a single confident or lively word, just mumbled away in disarray. Even now, you’re sighing like your heart’s full of private discontent. With everything you have, what can be lacking, and why such a show? Come, give me a proper explanation!”  Though Baoyu ordinarily possessed a quick tongue, his mind now was wholly consumed with grief over Jin Chuan’er—he felt he wanted to die alongside her. So he barely registered his father’s words, standing there dumbstruck and lost. Jia Zheng observed his son’s panic and speechlessness, which was uncharacteristic, and his displeasure grew. He was about to scold him when a gate attendant arrived, announcing, “There is a messenger from Prince Zhongshun’s household here to see Master.” Hearing that, Jia Zheng began to wonder: “We hardly have dealings with Prince Zhongshun’s estate—why send someone today?” Nonetheless, he ordered, “Bring him to the reception hall,” and hurried inside to change attire. When he emerged, he greeted the visitor with polite ceremony, had tea served, and they had scarcely begun exchanging pleasantries when that official from Zhongshun’s mansion took the lead:  “Sir, I do not come uninvited of my own accord. I arrive under orders and must ask a favor of you. On account of the Prince, I respectfully beg you to intervene.
If we don’t gamble, it’s no good—so let’s have a night session. Today, since I’m the head of our household, now that the garden gate is closed, it’s time to perform!”  Daiyu laughed, “Poor things, I’m sorry if I’ve delayed your prospering by braving the rain to deliver these things.” She then ordered, “Give them a few hundred taels to buy wine, so they can ward off the chill of the rain.”  The two old maids laughed, “You’re spoiling us by buying wine for us!” They then kowtowed, left to fetch the money, and went off under umbrella. Afterwards, Ziyuan collected the bird’s nest, then drew the curtains lower beneath the lantern so that she might attend to Daiyu and see her off to sleep. Daiyu, lying on her pillow, thought of Baochai with fondness—envying that she had a mother and a brother—then recalled Bao Yu’s long-standing amicable relations, though sometimes tinged with unspoken resentment. As she listened to the rain pattering on the bamboo and banana leaves outside, the chill seeped through the window, and tears began to fall. Before long, she finally drifted off to sleep around the fourth watch. For now, there is nothing more to say. How it all ultimately unfolds… we shall continue in the next installment. Chapter 46 Unavoidable Embarrassments for the Embarrassed; Yuan Yang’s Maid Vows to Sever Ties with Her “Yuan Yang” Companion  Note: “Yuan Yang” here is a character’s name (alluding to the mandarin duck), not the literal “mandarin duck.”  Daiyu did not finally drift off to sleep until around the fourth watch, and for a while nothing further was said. Now, we turn to Fengjie. Shortly after, she was summoned by Mrs. Xing—but unaware of the reason, she quickly changed and dressed herself before taking a carriage over. Mrs. Xing, having dismissed everyone from the room, leaned in confidentially and said to Fengjie, “I called you here for one difficult matter. Lord Jia has set his heart on the mandarin duck from Grandmother’s room and now wants it to remain in the room. He has asked me to negotiate with Grandmother. I suspect such requests are not unusual—but I fear Grandmother might refuse. Do you have any ideas on how to handle this?”  Fengjie, laughing in a conciliatory tone, replied, “In my opinion, don’t even think about meddling with this matter. Without that ‘Yuan Yang’ in her room, Grandmother wouldn’t even eat properly—she wouldn’t part with something she so cherishes. Besides, in her idle chatter Grandmother often teases Lord Jia, saying, ‘Now that he’s grown old, why must he keep collecting one thing after another in the room? First, he endangers the girls by neglecting their upbringing; second, he lets his own health go to ruin by not taking proper care—drinking with his concubines every day!’ Don’t you think the madams would enjoy hearing that? Lord Jia, on the other hand, might try to hide it—but isn’t that like “sticking a stick in a tiger’s nose”? Madam, don’t be angry. I wouldn’t dare to interfere. Besides, if we leave it as is, it might even backfire and cause more trouble. Lord Jia, now in his advanced years, sometimes acts in ways that are less than proper; the madams should counsel him instead. Compared with the young, these matters are trivial. Yet now—with his brothers, nephews, sons, and grandsons numbering in the dozens—how can he continue such antics before everyone’s eyes?”  Mrs. Xing sneered, “Even in families with three or four concubines, they get away with it. Why, then, is it that our household can’t? I’ve tried advising him, but he won’t listen. Even if it is Grandmother’s beloved maid, look at her—so pale with worry, and he’s the eldest son of an official; when she’s called to serve inside the house, it isn’t easy to refuse. I’ve summoned you to discuss this.
In the great hall outside, Xue Pan, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, and several close relatives were present. Mr. Lai’s household also invited several current officials and well-to-do young men as guests. Among them was Liu Xianglian—whom Xue Pan had met once before and could not get out of his mind. He learned that Liu Xianglian was especially fond of performing comic “sheng‑dan” (boy roles in opera) in folk plays, and often recited such “love and lust” pieces; misunderstanding his performance, some even took him to be one of the “romantic youths” of the theatre. Being young and handsome, his identity was misunderstood by many. Mr. Lai’s son, Lai Shangrong, who was a longtime friend of his, thus invited him as company. Yet after drinking, others managed their intoxication, except for Xue Pan—who relapsed into his old bad habits. In his sour mood, he wished to leave at once. But Lai Shangrong insisted, “Just now, Second Young Master Bao reminded me—although he saw you, with so many people around it’s hard to converse, so he told me to ask you not to leave when you’re dismissed; he still has words for you. If you insist on leaving, then I’ll have him called out so that you two may settle your differences—it doesn’t concern me.” With that he ordered the little servants, “Go inside and discreetly find an old maid to inform him. Tell him to come out quickly.” The servant obeyed. Before a cup of tea had been finished, Second Young Master Bao appeared. Lai Shangrong smiled at him, “Good uncle, leave him with you; I’ll arrange the rest,” and then departed. Bao Yu then took Liu Xianglian aside to the side-room and asked, “Have you been to Qin Zhong’s grave these past days?”  Xianglian replied, “Why wouldn’t I? The other day a few of us went falconing. His grave is about two li away; I thought that with the diligent summer rains his grave might be in disrepair. I even snuck away with the others to take a look—and spent a few hundred taels on repairs the very next morning.”  Bao Yu said, “That explains it. Last month, in our Grand View Garden, the lotus pods had ripened; I picked ten and sent Bei Mei out to offer them at his grave. When I asked him if the rain had damaged them, he said ‘Not only were they undamaged, but they look even fresher than before.’ I believe our friends have tidied up well. I only regret that I spend all my time confined at home—any movement is immediately noticed. Every time, someone stops me or advises me; even if I have money, I can never use it.”  Xianglian replied, “That matter is nothing for you to worry about. I shall see to it. Today is the first day of the tenth month—I’ve already arranged the expenses for the grave visit. You know, I am poor and have nothing to accumulate; even if I receive a few coins, they vanish in an instant. Why not save a little for yourself so you won’t be burdened later?”  Bao Yu said, “That’s precisely why I was going to send Bei Mei to fetch you. You don’t spend much time at home—always drifting about without a fixed place.”  Xianglian replied, “There’s no need to fetch me; every man must mind his own business. Today, I must go out for a walk. Perhaps later, when I return, I can update you on my situation.”  Bao Yu asked, “And why is that?”  Xianglian coldly smiled, “My own affairs—you’ll know soon enough. I must take my leave now.”  Bao Yu said, “Very well, let’s all part ways this evening—wouldn’t that be nice?”  Xianglian added, “If you really intend to leave permanently, you must tell me in advance. Don’t slip away without a word.” Tears fell from Bao Yu’s eyes as he replied, “I understand.”  Xianglian then rose and left; shortly afterward, as he approached the main gate, he encountered Sè Pan shouting, “Who let little Liu (a nickname for Xianglian) run off?”  Xianglian’s anger flared—he nearly wanted to punch Sè Pan to death.
Jia Lian then instructed Lin Zhixiao to record the 200 taels on the ledger and distribute it accordingly, so that the matter could be finally settled. He even arranged for additional silver to be given to Bao Er’s family, assuring them, “Someday I will find you a fine wife.” Bao Er’s family, pleased to retain both honor and funds, had nothing more to say. Inside, Fengjie, though troubled, kept her composure outwardly. With the house now empty, she turned to Ping’er and said, “I only drank one extra cup of wine yesterday—don’t hold it against me. Where did I hit you? Let me see.”  Ping’er, blushing, quickly stifled her tears and replied, “I wasn’t struck at all.”  Outside, voices could be heard saying, “Soon all the young ladies will be back inside!”  Later, after some more idle conversation, the guests again went to pay their respects to Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia, though not gravely ill—only tired and slightly chilled—had taken a couple of doses of medicine and, after some rest, felt well by evening. It is not clear what happened the next day—details to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 45 Bonded by a Golden Orchid Pact: Exchanging Oaths as True Friends; A Melancholy Evening Amid Wind and Rain Conjures Poetic Sentiments  It happened that while Fengjie was busy consoling Ping’er, the other sisters entered the room. Quickly she made room for them, and Ping’er poured tea. Fengjie laughed and remarked, “The people coming today seem as if they were summoned by a notice posted on the wall.”  Tan Chun was the first to laugh and said, “We have two matters to discuss—one concerning me and one concerning Fourth Sister—and even Grandmother’s words are included.”  Fengjie asked with a smile, “What could be so important?”  Tan Chun laughed, “We’ve set up a little poetry society—but our very first gathering is incomplete. Everyone’s too soft-hearted, so things got out of hand. I believe I must appoint you as our ‘Inspector of the Society’—one with an iron, impartial face. And Fourth Sister, who is in charge of painting the garden, found that many of the supplies were missing. When she reported to Grandmother, Grandmother said, ‘I’m afraid there may be some leftover materials hidden in the back under the stairs. If you find any, set them aside; if not, have someone buy them.’”  Fengjie laughed, “I’m not skilled in handling ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ matters. If you ask me to cook, I’d rather eat!”  Tan Chun replied with a laugh, “You need not cook anything yourself. Simply keep watch for any mischief or laziness among us. When someone shirks, you know how to penalize them.”  Fengjie grinned, “You don’t have to flatter me—I suspected all along that they meant for me to be their ‘Inspector.’ In truth, they’ve practically roped me in as a money-collector, coaxing money out of me. Is that your idea?”  All the others burst into laughter. Li Wan teased, “Really, you’re as delicate as a crystal heart and as fragile as glass!”  Fengjie retorted, “Oh, you dear big sister! Weren’t you the one who was supposed to teach us girls to study, to learn proper etiquette and needlework? And now when it comes to this poetry society you expect me to cough up money? Even if it were only for Grandmother and the madams—after all, you, our venerable ‘Old Fengjun,’ receive a monthly allowance of ten taels (twice as much as we do), yet they still say you’re ‘a helpless widow’—pity that, you’re short, and with that little fellow adding another ten taels, you’d be even more flush. Besides, with the rents from the garden lands, by year’s end you’d end up with a tidy sum. Out of all our household’s servants—fewer than ten in all—your share amounts to nearly four or five hundred taels in total.
Ping’er, hurrying forward, knelt and said, “Forgive me, Grandmother—I have upset you; it is entirely my fault.”  Fengjie’s indignation turned to self-reproach as she wept bitterly, “How could I, having drunk too much yesterday and disregarded our usual kindness, now disgrace myself by shaming Ping’er? I have no face left to live with!”  Jia Lian interjected, “Not at all! Think carefully—whose fault was it yesterday? Today, in front of everyone, I have knelt and apologized on your behalf; you have done your duty. There is no need for you to continue lamenting—must I also kneel for you?”  This provoked laughter from Ping’er, and Jia Lian himself chuckled, “I am truly at my wit’s end.”  At that moment, a servant’s wife came running with the news, “Bao Er’s wife has hanged herself!” Both Jia Lian and Fengjie were stunned. Fengjie quickly recovered her composure and retorted, “She’s dead—what is there to make a fuss about?”  Soon, Lin Zhixiao’s family came in quietly and informed Fengjie, “They say that Bao Er’s wife’s relatives are threatening legal action.”  Fengjie sneered, “Splendid! I was just thinking of taking legal action myself!”  Lin Zhixiao explained, “I had tried to calm everyone down and even intimidated them for a while, and even offered him some money—but he eventually relented.”  Fengjie declared, “I won’t pay a single penny! If he wishes to sue, let him sue. I shall not persuade him otherwise. And if his lawsuit fails, I might just have him charged with ‘exploiting a corpse for extortion’!”  Lin Zhixiao was at a loss, and noticing Jia Lian’s and Fengjie’s knowing looks, he understood and waited silently. Jia Lian said, “I’ll go out and see what’s happening.”  Fengjie, meanwhile, declared firmly, “Do not give him any money!”  Jia Lian went out and conferred with Lin Zhixiao. After some deliberation and arrangements—promising 200 taels in compensation—they set about hiring several funeral agents and forensic examiners to handle the matter. Those officials, though tempted to protest, dared not raise objections and swallowed their grievances. Jia Lian then instructed Lin Zhixiao to record the 200 taels on the ledger and distribute it accordingly, so that the matter could be finally settled. He even arranged for additional silver to be given to Bao Er’s family, assuring them, “Someday I will find you a fine wife.” Bao Er’s family, pleased to retain both honor and funds, had nothing more to say. Inside, Fengjie, though troubled, kept her composure outwardly. With the house now empty, she turned to Ping’er and said, “I only drank one extra cup of wine yesterday—don’t hold it against me. Where did I hit you? Let me see.”  Ping’er, blushing, quickly stifled her tears and replied, “I wasn’t struck at all.”  Outside, voices could be heard saying, “Soon all the young ladies will be back inside!”  Later, after some more idle conversation, the guests again went to pay their respects to Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia, though not gravely ill—only tired and slightly chilled—had taken a couple of doses of medicine and, after some rest, felt well by evening. It is not clear what happened the next day—details to be revealed in the next installment. Chapter 45 Bonded by a Golden Orchid Pact: Exchanging Oaths as True Friends; A Melancholy Evening Amid Wind and Rain Conjures Poetic Sentiments  It happened that while Fengjie was busy consoling Ping’er, the other sisters entered the room. Quickly she made room for them, and Ping’er poured tea. Fengjie laughed and remarked, “The people coming today seem as if they were summoned by a notice posted on the wall.”  Tan Chun was the first to laugh and said, “We have two matters to discuss—one concerning me and one concerning Fourth Sister—and even Grandmother’s words are included.”  Fengjie asked with a smile, “What could be so important?”  Tan Chun laughed, “We’ve set up a little poetry society—but our very first gathering is incomplete.
Were it not for you, I would have been coaxed otherwise.”  Fengjie replied, “Grandmother simply leaves the two brothers in charge of the ladies; let each take one share, and each lady will contribute one share on their behalf.”  Grandmother Jia quickly agreed, “That is very equitable—so be it.”  At this moment, the matron of the Lài household jumped up laughing, “This is completely reversed! I would be indignant if I had to pay for you ladies! Over there your sons and daughters-in-law, and here your niece’s come to mind—it would seem as if you were favoring others over your own aunts! The daughters-in-law would become strangers, while the ‘inner’ nieces become ‘outer’ nieces!”  This remark sent Grandmother Jia and the others into another round of uproarious laughter. The Lài matron then inquired, “If the young ladies are giving 12 taels, must we naturally be lower and give less as well?”  Grandmother Jia replied, “That won’t do. Though you may be a rank lower, I know that you are all wealthy—the amount of money you have exceeds theirs. Your share should be counted on par with theirs.”  The elderly maids all assented quickly. Grandmother Jia added, “As for the young ladies, each should contribute the equivalent of one month’s customary allowance.” She then turned to call Yuan Yang, “Gather a few more people so that we may settle this together.”  Yuan Yang agreed and soon returned with Ping’er, Xiangren, Cai Xia, and several other maidservants; some offered 2 taels, others 1 tael. Grandmother Jia then asked Ping’er, “Aren’t you helping your mistress celebrate her birthday? Why are you still here?”  Ping’er laughed, “I have another private celebration aside from this public one—I must contribute my share as well.”  Grandmother Jia smiled, “That is the proper spirit, my dear.”  Fengjie laughed, “Not only have the high and low contributed, but we must also ask the two aunts whether they wish to contribute. They deserve proper respect; otherwise, they might feel slighted.”  Grandmother Jia replied, “Indeed—but I almost forgot about them. I worry they may be too busy; I’ll send a maid to inquire.”  After a while a maid returned saying, “Each of the two aunts will contribute 2 taels.”  Grandmother Jia then called for brushes and inkstones so that the total might be tallied. You (Youshi) muttered under her breath to Fengjie, “I’ll have you know, you little nimble-footed one—putting together all these contributions for your birthday, and then adding two more from those miserable wretches!”  Fengjie whispered back, “Don’t talk nonsense. When we leave this place, I’ll have my reckoning with you! Besides, why should those two be considered miserable? Money given is money given—and it’s better than leaving empty-handed.”  Before long the total was calculated at 150 taels (with some extra coins thrown in). Grandmother Jia said, “A single day of revelry will not use up all this money.”  You (Youshi) remarked, “Since no banquet is planned and the expenses for a two- or three-day gathering would suffice, the primary cost of our amusement is nil—saving that money here.”  Grandmother Jia replied, “Then Feng, you just pass on your group’s order as usual.”  Fengjie said, “Our household’s group is well known—if we have to pay a few extra taels to invite a band to perform, that’s fine.”  Grandmother Jia added, “I will leave this matter to Brother Zhen’s wife. Feng, do not worry too much—if the festivities last only one day, that is plenty.”  You (Youshi) agreed. After further discussion it became clear that Grandmother Jia was feeling rather worn out, and soon the gathering dispersed. After escorting away Xing’s wife and Madame Wang, You (Youshi) came into Fengjie’s room to discuss how to proceed with the birthday arrangements.
As for the others, they never understood their cryptic exchange and simply laughed it off. Soon, Baochai and Wang Xifeng left. Daiyu turned to Baoyu: “You’ve tested your strength against someone stronger than me—who else would let you speak so recklessly? Do you think everyone is like me, tongue-tied, letting you do as you please?”  Baoyu, still reeling from Baochai’s reproof, felt awkward. Hearing Daiyu’s words now only intensified his unease. Though inclined to rebut, he feared Daiyu might overreact, so he swallowed his anger, said nothing, and slipped away gloomily. At the height of midday, during the scorching fifth lunar month, most in the house—masters and servants alike—were dozing away the lengthy hours. Baoyu, hands clasped behind his back, wandered aimlessly. Everywhere was silent: no voices, only the buzzing of cicadas. He came upon the rose arbor and heard faint sobs within. Curious, he paused to listen closely and realized that indeed someone was quietly crying beneath the vines. He thought, “Can there be another melancholy girl, burying flowers like Daiyu?” Then he mused: “If she really is burying flowers, that’d just be a pale imitation—nothing new, but rather tiresome.” He intended to say, “You needn’t mimic Miss Lin.” But before he spoke, he took a look through a gap in the vines and saw a girl he barely recognized: seemingly one of the twelve young performers learning to act in the mansion’s small troupe. He couldn’t make out if she played the “sheng, dan, jing, or chou” roles, nor did he recall her name. Baoyu stuck out his tongue, thankful he hadn’t blurted some rebuke—he recalled how his previous rash remarks had offended both Daiyu and Baochai. He watched more closely. The girl—her brows arched like spring hills, her eyes glimmering with autumn’s depths, her figure slender, possessed a fragile grace reminiscent of Lin Daiyu. Baoyu felt pity and could not turn away, but lingered, entranced. He saw that, though she clutched a gold hairpin, she was not digging ground to bury blossoms. Rather, she traced characters in the dirt. Baoyu peered at each stroke. The brush-like hairpin made eighteen strokes in total. Using his finger on his palm, he mimicked them and thought, “What might this be?” Concluding it was a single character, he wrote it in full: “蔷” (qiáng), part of “蔷薇” (rose). “So perhaps she’s inspired to compose lines about roses,” he surmised. “Or maybe she jotted down a phrase and is reflecting on it. Let me see what else she writes.”  But the girl continued to write the same character “蔷” over and over, dozens of times. Baoyu, transfixed, watched as her hairpin kept etching “蔷” repeatedly. “Surely she must have some untold sorrow if she carries on like this,” he thought. “From her frail form, how might she endure such inner torment? If only I could bear some of her sorrow for her.”  Just then, fickle summer weather delivered a sudden gust of cool wind and a quick shower. Raindrops fell, spattering her head, and quickly dampened her clothing. “She can’t possibly bear this rain—she’ll catch cold,” Baoyu thought. Overcome by concern, he called out, “Stop writing—your clothes are all wet!”  Startled, the young actress looked up, seeing only half a figure behind the vines, exclaiming, “Thank you, sister, for the warning. Do you have some shelter out there?” She took Baoyu for another maid. Baoyu gasped, “Oh dear!” as he realized he himself was getting soaked. He yelled, “This is no good!” and bolted back toward his own Yihong Court. He reached the courtyard gates to find them locked, for the midday heat had prompted a game: Xiao Sheng Baoguan and Dan-role Yuguan, two of the acting-girls, were inside chatting with Xi Ren. When the rains came, they diverted themselves by blocking off the courtyard’s drains to flood the pavement, letting ducks and small toy boats float around.
Just bring it along to see, then return it.” Zhang Taoist said, “Old Lady does not realize that, though I’m eighty, I’m still spry under your blessings. But in this crowded place with all sorts of aromas in the summer heat, Master Bao might not bear it well. Suppose he got a whiff of something unpleasant? That wouldn’t do him any good.”  Jia Mu listened and instructed Baoyu to remove his jade and place it on the tray. Zhang Taoist carefully laid a brocade cloth beneath it, then carried it out. Meanwhile, Jia Mu and the rest strolled about, taking in the sights, only heading upstairs later. Soon, Jia Zhen returned, saying, “Grandfather Zhang is bringing Master Baoyu’s jade.” Moments later, Zhang Taoist arrived with his tray and addressed Jia Mu with a laugh: “Because of your grace, many have now seen Master Baoyu’s jade—indeed, they found it wonderful. They wanted to express their congratulations but had little to offer. They gave whatever they had—various small artifacts—begging that Master Bao keep them as trifles, or share them as he sees fit.” Jia Mu looked in the tray and saw small gold ornaments, bits of jade, some reading “All Wishes Fulfilled,” or “Peace throughout the years,” all inlaid with pearls and gems, delicately carved—some fifty-odd pieces in total. She said, “You silly man, how could these humble Taoists have such things? We can’t accept this.”  Zhang Taoist replied, “It’s just a token of their respect. I can’t refuse on their behalf. If you deny them, you make me look unworthy, as if I scorned my own subordinates.” Hearing this, Jia Mu relented, and the items were taken. Baoyu said, “Old Ancestor, since Grandfather Zhang insists, we can’t decline. But what good is this stuff to me? Why don’t I have a servant carry them and distribute them to the poor outside?” Jia Mu smiled, “You make a fair point.” Zhang Taoist quickly objected, “Master Baoyu, though you wish to do good, these items—trifling though they may be—are still accessories. If you hand them to the poor, they won’t do any real good, and they might just get lost or wasted. If you want to help the poor, best distribute coin.” Baoyu nodded, “Very well. Then we shall keep them and hand out silver tonight.” With that, Zhang Taoist took his leave. Jia Mu and her companions proceeded upstairs; Jia Mu occupied the main balcony, Feng Jie and others the eastern one, while the maids were to watch from the western balcony in rotating shifts. After a while, Jia Zhen came by to report, “We drew lots for the performance at the altar—the first play is The Legend of the White Serpent.” Jia Mu asked, “What’s that about?” Jia Zhen replied, “It tells of how Emperor Gaozu of Han slew the white serpent, starting his great cause.” Jia Mu murmured in mild approval, “Well then, it seems the gods have arranged it so; we’ll just accept it.” She asked, “And the second?” Jia Zhen said, “That is Full of Court Officials.” Jia Mu nodded, “That one might do.” She asked, “And the third?” He replied, “The Dream of Nanke.” At that, Jia Mu did not speak further. JZ withdrew to prepare offerings, burn symbolic money, and commence the performances. Meanwhile, Baoyu sat beside Jia Mu upstairs. He told a small maid to bring the tray of items, having already reattached his jade. He began rifling through them, picking out pieces for Jia Mu to see. Suddenly noticing a bright gold-and-kingfisher-feather qilin, Jia Mu took an interest and remarked, “I recall seeing a child wearing something like this.” Baochai said, “Cousin Xiangyun (Shi Xiangyun) has one, only a bit smaller.” Jia Mu said, “So that must be Yun’er’s.” Baoyu muttered, “She’s come to stay with us so often, but I never noticed it.” Tanchun teased, “Sister Bao truly has an attentive mind—she remembers every little detail.” Daiyu gave a sardonic laugh, “He shows little interest in other things, but he’s very keen on these ornaments people wear.” Baochai, hearing this, pretended not to notice, and Baoyu—upon learning Xiangyun owned such a qilin—hurriedly stashed the piece in his bosom, fearing the others might wonder why he kept it upon hearing Xiangyun had one.
“No harm done. You’re soaked—go change quickly.”  Baoyu, sheepish, ambled inside to switch out of his wet clothes. “That was the first time I ever lashed out at someone, and look how it turned out—I happened to strike you of all people,” he said. Still suppressing her pain, Xi Ren said, “As your leading maid, I’m expected to bear blame for big or small mishaps. You can thrash me if you like—but I hope this doesn’t make you start thrashing others at the slightest provocation. When you’re angry, scaring them might be fine. But me, I admitted it was my fault for not opening the gate.”  By then, the rain had passed, and Baoguan, Yuguan, and the others had dispersed. Xi Ren, ribs aching, skipped supper. At bedtime, when she disrobed, she found a bruise about the size of a bowl on her side. Startled and uncertain, she kept silent so as not to worry others. But lying down, she felt throbbing pain that made her moan in her sleep. Baoyu, lying awake, sensed Xi Ren’s restlessness and guessed she must be hurt indeed. In the middle of the night, he rose quietly, lit a small lamp, and tiptoed over. As he neared the bed, Xi Ren coughed twice, spat up phlegm, and let out a weak moan. She opened her eyes in surprise to see Baoyu, “What are you doing?”  Baoyu said softly, “You moaned in your sleep—it must be that my kick was too forceful. Let me have a look.”  Xi Ren replied, “My head swims, and my throat feels both foul and sweet. Perhaps there’s something on the floor.”  Baoyu lifted the lamp, peering around, only to see a small puddle of fresh blood. Alarmed, he cried out, “Oh no!”  Xi Ren, seeing his reaction, was equally frightened. What happens next? We shall see in the next chapter’s telling. Chapter 31 Tearing a Fan to Elicit a Priceless Smile; The Golden Qilin Ensures a Lifelong Bond  This chapter continues immediately after the events of the previous one:  Lin Daiyu, ever since her quarrel with Baoyu, had come to regret her actions but had no avenue to approach and reconcile with him. Consequently, she spent her days feeling gloomy, as though she had lost something dear. Zijuan, noticing her mistress’s melancholy, attempted to console her:  “Really, Miss, you were a bit too hot-tempered that day. Others may not understand Master Baoyu’s nature, but how could we not? Isn’t it true that quarrels over that jade of his have happened more than once or twice?” Daiyu spat softly in mock annoyance, “Pah! You side with him and blame me for being rash. How was I rash?”  Zijuan gently explained with a smile, “Why did you have to cut off the tassel? If Baoyu was three parts at fault, you must have been seven. He’s always so considerate of you. But you, given to these little jealous tiffs, keep prodding him. That’s how it escalates.”  Daiyu was about to retort when, from outside the courtyard gate, they heard someone calling. Zijuan listened, recognized Baoyu’s voice, and broke into a laugh:  “He must be here to make amends. He never can stay away long.” Daiyu straightaway declared, “Do not open that gate!”  Zijuan, however, demurred, “Miss, it’s scorching hot—would you have him broil out there? That’s hardly kind.” And, ignoring Daiyu’s protest, she went to let him in. Sure enough, it was Baoyu. She greeted him teasingly,  “I assumed, Master Baoyu, you’d not be knocking at our door again. Who’d have thought you’d appear at this hour?” Baoyu laughed, “Why stay away? You blow trivial matters out of proportion. Even if I died, my spirit would visit you a hundred times a day. How is Miss Lin feeling—better, I hope?”  Zijuan answered, “Her health is improving, but her mood has scarcely softened.”  “It’s fine,” Baoyu said, stepping inside with her.
He apologized softly, and Xi Ren changed the topic, speaking of romantic trifles and ladies’ charms. Then they veered into talk of how maids might nobly die. Xi Ren realized she’d gone too far, so she quickly shut up. Baoyu lay turning over the possibilities. One day, Baoyu got bored wandering the same spots in the garden, so he recalled a scene from The Peony Pavilion and yearned to read it again. But even reading it twice didn’t satisfy him. He’d heard that among the twelve budding actresses in the Pear-Fragrance Lodge, a girl named Ling Guan was the best at singing. He slipped out of the corner gate to find them. Encountering some young performers—Kui Guan and Yao Guan—he asked, “Where’s Ling Guan?” They said, “She’s in her room.” He hurried to see her. She lay on a pillow, barely turning at his arrival. Having always jested easily with the other maids, Baoyu approached with a grin: “Sister, do sing the Nieao Qing Si number (the Peony Pavilion snippet).” But Ling Guan just got up and stiffly said, “My throat is hoarse. The other day, I was supposed to sing for Her Highness, and I still can’t. Why come ask me?” This left Baoyu red-faced, not used to being brushed off. He retreated. The other girls suggested, “Wait for Master Qiang (Jia Qiang). If he wants it, she’ll do it.” Baoyu asked, “Is Qiang out?” “Yes, presumably Ling Guan needed something, so he’s off to procure it.”  Soon, Jia Qiang arrived with a birdcage. He had a fancy mincing bird that performed little stunts in a model stage inside the cage. He came in, saw Baoyu, politely greeted him, and approached Ling Guan:  “Look, a new toy for you—this finch will amuse you so you won’t be bored.” But Ling Guan gave him only a frosty laugh:  “Your family tears us from our normal lives, caging us in here to learn these worthless songs, and now you bring me a caged bird for further mockery? I want none of it.” Jia Qiang tried pledging innocence, but seeing her unwavering hostility, he ended up dismantling the cage and freeing the bird. Then she moaned that she’d coughed blood, and no one truly cared for her. Jia Qiang nervously insisted he had asked a doctor who said it was minor, but she dismissed him. Baoyu, witnessing their exchange, realized that the one painting “蔷” in the rose arbor was precisely Ling Guan, so he quietly left. Jia Qiang, too absorbed with Ling Guan, paid him no mind. Baoyu returned to his room, quite shaken. Understanding now the significance of “蔷,” he felt a new pang. Arriving at the Garden, he found Lin Daiyu and Xi Ren conversing. The moment he stepped in, he exclaimed:  “Last night I said something flawed, no wonder Father calls me ignorant and shallow. I spoke of wanting only your tears to bury me, but I realize now, that was foolish. I see I cannot have them all. Everyone will have their own tears for their own destinies.” Xi Ren, recalling his earlier talk, merely said with a laugh, “You truly are half-crazed.” Baoyu fell silent, pondering how each personal bond might be foreordained, gloomily wondering, “In the end, who shall weep for me upon my grave?”  Seeing Baoyu in such a mystic mood, Daiyu guessed he had confronted yet another heartbreak but asked no details. She only said, “I was just at Aunt Wang’s, who said tomorrow is Aunt Xue’s birthday. Are you going or not? She told me to ask if you’ll send word in advance.” Baoyu replied, “I refused to attend even Uncle’s birthday last time, how can I go to Aunt Xue’s? Suppose I run into some official or dignitary—my father might hear. And I can’t bear wearing the formal clothes in this stifling heat. Aunt Xue won’t be upset, I suppose.” Xi Ren hurriedly countered, “That’s nonsense. She’s no random official; she’s your aunt living right next door—how could you skip her birthday?
I simply won’t go.”  Ping’er interjected softly, “Sister, you need not worry. We’ve already reached a consensus. I’ll tell you everything later.”  Mrs. Xing, smiling broadly, then rose and said, “Now, go and attend to your own duties. I’ll have dinner prepared and then come back.”  Fengjie, overhearing all this, thought to herself, “Yuan Yang has always had a generous heart. Even if I propose this, will she agree? I must go first; then, once Mrs. Xing arrives, if she complies I’ll smoothly withdraw. But if not—if Mrs. Xing suspects and then uses her influence to cause trouble for me—I’ll be in a pickle. In that case, I might as well go together with them. If she agrees, no one will suspect a thing.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just now, my aunt sent over two cages of quail, which I had ordered fried to be served with Madam’s dinner. When I arrived at the gate, I saw the boys carrying a carriage saying that Madam’s carriage had been taken away for repairs. Perhaps it is best if I ride in my own carriage and go together.”  Mrs. Xing, pleased with the plan, ordered her servants to prepare new garments. Soon, Fengjie, having finished her tasks and attended to her duties, along with her maid, rode in a carriage to Grandmother’s. Meanwhile, after dinner, Fengjie returned to her room. As she recounted the incident to Ping’er, Ping’er shook her head and laughed, “From what I can see, it may not be so proper after all. When we speak in private, his ideas might not be accepted. We’ll just have to see.”  Fengjie replied, “Madam will surely come into the room to discuss it. If they agree, that’s all; if not, it’s no great loss. Besides, you mustn’t worry—I’ll send some quail, along with other accompaniments, prepared for the meal. And what about the extra clothes you mentioned? They must be sorted out for use.”  Li Wan interjected, “I won’t meddle in these matters; just take care of my own affairs so that I may rest—there’s no need for the girls to fuss over me.”  Fengjie quickly said, “Dear sister, please spare me a moment. You’ve always been so dear to me—why is it that today you care for Ping’er but not for me? In the past you advised me, ‘Even with many things to do, one must find time to rest and take care of oneself.’ But today, you seem determined to make me work myself to death. Besides, if it’s only the extra clothes for others, that’s one thing; but if it’s your own responsibility, then Grandmother will surely blame you. I’d rather bear the burden myself than trouble you!”  Li Wan smiled and said, “You listen to yourself—so eloquent! Now, tell me truly: does this poetry society really have any regulations?”  Fengjie laughed, “What nonsense! If I don’t contribute money to the society, wouldn’t I be branded a rebel in the Grand View Garden? And if I don’t participate, how could I dine here? Tomorrow morning, once I assume my post and swear an oath, I’ll deposit fifty taels for you to run the society. I am no poet or essayist—I’m just an ordinary person. Whether I serve as ‘inspector’ or not, once the money is in, you’ll have no choice but to kick me out!”  This sent everyone into another round of laughter. After a while, Fengjie announced, “Later, I will have the upstairs hall prepared. I’ll arrange for all the necessary supplies to be brought out for you to inspect. If something is lacking, we’ll order it according to your list. As for the painting cloth, I’ll have it cut to size. The design isn’t with Grandmother—it’s with Old Master Zhen. That way, we avoid any mishaps. I’ll also have the cloth delivered to the officials for treatment with alum—will that suffice?”  Li Wan nodded with a smile, “That is very much appreciated.
She called me lazy and scolded me, so I came in a rush, only to find you already back to being good friends—like ‘a hawk clutching a sparrow’s foot!’ Hah, I guess I was right after all.” Everyone present had a good laugh. Baochai happened to be there. Daiyu said nothing, taking a seat next to Jia Mu. Baoyu, unsure how to proceed, turned to Baochai and said, “It’s Brother Xue Pan’s birthday, yet I’m under the weather and can’t attend. He might misunderstand, thinking I’m being rude. Sister, would you explain things on my behalf?”  Baochai replied, “Why fret about that? If you weren’t ill, you’d go or not go as you please—brothers don’t stand on ceremony like that. There’s no need to worry.”  Baoyu said, “As long as you see my point.” Then, “Sister, why didn’t you stay to watch the performance?”  Baochai answered, “It’s so hot. I managed two scenes before nearly fainting, but the guests were still there, so I feigned illness and escaped. Please, do excuse me.”  Realizing she was still vexed about yesterday, Baoyu reddened slightly. He forced a chuckle and ventured, “They often compare you to Imperial Consort Yang; indeed, you’re blessed with a well-pampered constitution.” Baochai’s cheeks flushed at the remark. She wanted to lash out but held back, yet her face grew darker. At length, controlling herself, she gave a cold laugh:  “Yes, I must be the next Yang Guifei. Too bad I haven’t any decent brother or cousin to play the part of Yang Guozhong, have I?” While she was speaking, a little maid named Liang’er ran in, searching for her missing fan. Jokingly she addressed Baochai, “I bet Sister Bao is hiding it—be kind and return it, please!” But Baochai, her mood sour, scolded, “Behave, child! Did you ever see me fool around with anyone? Go question those other girls you normally play with.” Alarmed, Liang’er fled. Baoyu, having once again spoken improperly, felt even more awkward. He quickly turned away, leaving Baochai to calm her agitation. Daiyu, overhearing Baoyu’s slight toward Baochai, secretly felt gratified and nearly joined in teasing. But just then, Liang’er left and Baochai delivered her retort about Imperial Consort Yang, so Daiyu changed her approach:  “Sister Bao, which scenes did you watch?” But Baochai, noticing the faint triumph on Daiyu’s face, realized that she was probably reveling in Baoyu’s slip. Resolved not to indulge further argument, Baochai coolly replied, “I watched Li Kui scold Song Jiang, then apologize to him.” Baoyu butted in, “You know so many classics, Sister—how do you not know that’s called Bearing a Rod to Plead Forgiveness?” Baochai said lightly, “Oh, that’s what it’s called. You’re the one learned in both old and new, though I can’t see what’s so special about such a name.”  She hadn’t finished when Baoyu and Daiyu, each harboring private burdens, colored deeply. Wang Xifeng picked up on their tension and teased, “Who’s been eating raw ginger in this heat? Because the air sure tastes spicy!” The rest, clueless, merely laughed. Baoyu and Daiyu both reddened further, and Baochai, seeing Baoyu thoroughly embarrassed, dropped the matter. Everyone else remained unaware, letting the conversation move on. Soon Baochai and Wang Xifeng departed. Daiyu whispered to Baoyu, “Now you’ve found a better sparring partner—I can’t hold my own. Not everyone is as soft as I am, letting you say what you please.”  Baoyu, still feeling abashed from his exchange with Baochai, grew even more dejected. He longed to answer Daiyu but feared stoking her indignation, so he suppressed his anger and slinked away.
Come quickly on board!”  Fengjie laughed, “What’s there to fear? Our venerable ancestor, rest assured!” With that, she took up a pole and propelled the boat into the middle of the pond. The boat was small and crowded; Fengjie felt it lurch about wildly, so she quickly passed the pole to the boat lady and crouched down. Soon, Yingchun and the other sisters, along with Baoyu, boarded the boat, followed by the others. The remaining old maids and maidservants all followed along the bank. Baoyu grumbled, “These cursed lotus leaves—why haven’t we had someone come to pull them up yet?”  Baochai laughed, “For these past few days, the garden has hardly had a moment to rest. With everyone out strolling every day, who has time to tidy up?”  Dai Yu said, “I detest Li Yishan’s poetry. I only like this line: ‘Leftover lotus leaves listen to the sound of rain.’ Yet you all insist on pulling up the lotus leaves.”  Baoyu replied, “That is indeed a fine verse. In future, let’s not have the lotus leaves plucked.”  They soon reached the base of the Flower Stream, where the dark, eerie surroundings—with two banks strewn with withered grasses and broken waterlilies—only deepened the autumnal mood. Grandmother Jia, noticing a neat and spacious residence on the bank, asked, “Isn’t this Miss Xue’s house?”  Everyone answered, “Yes.”  Grandmother Jia then hastily ordered that the boat be brought to shore, and using the Yúnbu stone steps, she led everyone into the Hengwu Courtyard. There, a delicate fragrance filled the air. Strange, otherworldly plants and fairy-tale vines, growing even more lush in the cool, damp air, bore fruit like clusters of coral-like beans, dangling enticingly. Upon entering the room, which was as quiet and pristine as a snow cave, there was naught in the way of ornaments. On the table stood only a plain earthen vase, in which were placed a few chrysanthemum stems, two books, a tea caddy, and teacups. The bed was hung only with a blue gauze curtain, and the bedding was exceedingly simple. Grandmother Jia sighed, “This child is far too plain—without any adornments, perhaps you should ask your concubine for a few things. I have no objections; I never expected that the things in your home wouldn’t be brought along.” With that, she ordered Yuan Yang to fetch some antiques and then chided Fengjie, “Not sending even a few ornaments for your sister—such meagerness!” Madame Wang, Fengjie, and the others all laughed, “She doesn’t want them anyway; we originally sent some, but they were all returned.” Aunt Xue laughed too, “He isn’t one for such things even at home.”  Grandmother Jia shook her head, “That won’t do. Though he is thrifty, if a relative comes by and sees such plainness—and the young ladies, too, are superstitious about that—then what? We old women ought to be living in stables by now. You’ve seen those exquisite embroidery chambers in the plays and books of the well-to-do young ladies! Even if our sisters cannot match them, they shouldn’t stray too far from propriety. If ready-made things are available, why not display them? If one is really keen on simplicity, then having fewer items may suit; but I, who used to be so adept at arranging a household, now in my old age have no leisure for it. Our sisters are still learning how to manage things well. I fear that if the common taste prevails, even good things may be misplaced. I wager they’re not too vulgar. Now, leave it to me to arrange your sister’s room—it will be both elegant and simple. My two personal items, which have been with me until now, have never even been shown to Baoyu; if he were to see them, they’d vanish in an instant.”  With that, she called Yuan Yang over and ordered, “Bring that stone penjing, that silk-screen with the embroidered scenes, and the ink-smoked frozen-stone cauldron.
Our dear Feng can arrange it for you!” Aunt Xue laughed, “You do love to amuse yourself. But these fusses often go to waste.” Xifeng joked, “Ha, if the Old Ancestor didn’t despise me for being ‘tasty’ (i.e., in jest), I’d have been devoured by now!” Everyone roared. Baoyu, listening inside, also had to laugh. Xi Ren murmured, “That sister-in-law’s tongue could kill us all.”  After they went off, Baoyu beckoned Xi Ren closer: “You’ve been standing so long; you must be exhausted. Sit with me.” Laughing, Xi Ren complied. Then Xi Ren recalled: “Now that Miss Bao is outside, say if you want her to ask her maid Yinger to tie up some decorative cords.” Baoyu smacked his forehead: “I’d forgotten—thank heavens you reminded me.” He raised his voice toward the window, “Bao sister, after supper, could you have Yinger come tie some cords if she’s free?” Baochai answered from outside, “Sure. I’ll have her come.” Grandmother Jia overheard some snippet. She turned to Aunt Xue, “What’s that about?” Baochai explained, and the old lady teased, “Such a good child—he can get your girl to do bits of craft. If you need maids yourself, I have plenty. I love you so, after all.” Aunt Xue and Baochai laughed, saying Yinger was idle anyway. Laughing, they continued on. Soon Xiangyun, Ping’er, Xiangling, and others were spotted plucking balsam flowers among the rocks. That concluded the group’s procession out of the garden. At the second gate, Lady Wang suggested Old Madam rest a moment in her own quarters. The old lady felt a bit tired, so she agreed. Lady Wang sent a maid ahead to set up seats. Meanwhile, Zhao Yiniang feigned illness, so only Aunt Zhou and a few others were on hand to greet them. Once Grandmother Jia was settled, she asked the others what they fancied for dinner, but they insisted on deferring to her. Xifeng swiftly took charge, setting a small table. She also arranged for a portion to be delivered to Baoyu. Presently, they sent Jadecuff (Yu Chuan’er) or Goldthimble (Jin Chuan’er)—some maid, anyway—to carry it. As for Yingchun and Tanchun, only they joined the meal, since Xichun complained of discomfort and Lin Daiyu, half the time, skipped dinners. After a brief repast, everyone parted. The mention of that soup is left at that. In Baoyu’s own quarters, once Xi Ren had served him some fresh bowls of soup, word came that “Two older women from Magistrate Fu’s house are here to pay respects to the Master.” Baoyu realized they must be from Fu Shi, who was a junior official under Jia Zheng. Baoyu ordinarily disliked such visitors, but remembering Fu Shi had a younger sister praised as gifted and attractive—a certain Fu Qiufang—he dreaded offending them by refusing. So he told them to come in. This was because Fu Qiufang, though never met, had garnered Baoyu’s passing admiration. If he rejected them, it might seem he slighted Fu Qiufang. Alas, these two older women turned out to be quite lacking in polish. They mumbled a curt greeting, said hardly two or three words, while Yuchuan (Jadecuff) was present with the soup in hand. Baoyu, half listening to their babble, half taking a meal, tried also to hold out a hand for the soup. In his haste, the bowl was knocked over and splashed his hand. Jadecuff was unscalded, but jumped in alarm. The maids scurried to wipe up. Baoyu, forgetting his own burn, kept asking if Jadecuff was hurt. Jadecuff and everyone else burst into laughter. Jadecuff replied, “You’re the one who’s burned. Why keep asking me?” Only then did Baoyu sense his own hand was scalded. As they tidied up, he gave up on the meal, rinsed his hand, sipped some tea, and exchanged a few more pleasantries with the two women.
Tanchun and Xichun teased, “Brother, what are you so busy with? Even eating and tea have become such a flurry!” Baochai said, “Tell him to eat quickly and then go see Sister Daiyu. Why is he causing such a fuss here?” After his tea, Baoyu emerged and made his way toward the West Courtyard. By chance, as he reached the door of Feng Jie’s residence, he saw Feng Jie standing there at the gate, stepping on the threshold, picking her ears and cleaning her teeth, as she watched a dozen little servants moving flower pots. Upon seeing Baoyu, she laughed and said, “How good that you are here—come in, come in, and write a few characters for me.” Baoyu had no choice but to follow her in. Inside, Feng Jie ordered that a brush, ink, and paper be fetched and said to Baoyu, “Forty bolts of red brocade, forty bolts of python brocade, one hundred bolts of assorted gauze for ceremonial use, and four golden collars.” Baoyu asked, “What does that count for? It’s neither a tally nor a gift. How should I write it?” Feng Jie replied, “Just write it; I’ll understand what it means later.” Baoyu then wrote what he could. While Feng Jie gathered the items, she laughed and said, “There’s one more thing I must tell you. Do you know if the maid in your room called ‘Xiao Hong’ is there? I intend to summon her to run errands for you. Will that be acceptable?” Baoyu said, “There are plenty of people in my room; whichever sister you fancy, just call her—there’s no need to ask me.” Feng Jie laughed, “Then I shall have someone take her away.” Baoyu said, “Just send her off.” As he was about to leave, Feng Jie said, “Come back; I have one more thing to tell you.” Baoyu replied, “The Old Lady has already summoned me. I shall attend to it and come back later.” With that, he went toward the Lady Dowager’s quarters. There he found that the meal was over. The Lady Dowager asked, “What delicacies did you have with your mother?” Baoyu laughed, “Nothing in particular—I simply had an extra bowl of rice.” He then asked, “Where is Miss Lin?” The Lady Dowager replied, “Inside, in the inner room.” When Baoyu went in, he saw a maid ironing on the floor, two maids grinding powder on the kang, and Daiyu bent over as she snipped fabric. Baoyu entered with a smile, “Oh! What are you doing? We’ve only just eaten, and now you’re fussing—soon you’ll have a headache.” Daiyu ignored him and continued her cutting. One maid said, “That corner of silk isn’t smooth enough—iron it a bit more.” Daiyu then put down her scissors and said, “It’ll be fine soon enough.” Baoyu, puzzled by her remark, then saw Baochai and Tanchun arrive. After exchanging greetings with the Lady Dowager, Baochai also came in and asked, “What is Miss Lin up to?” Seeing Daiyu busy cutting, Baochai laughed, “She’s become so capable—she even knows how to tailor!” Daiyu replied, “It’s nothing more than idle chatter to coax people.” Baochai laughed, “I’ll tell you a joke: just after I spoke to the medicine man, Brother Baoyu became so indignant!” Daiyu said, “‘It’ll be fine soon enough’—that’s all.” Baoyu then said to Baochai, “Mistress, why don’t you go polish the game pieces?” Baochai replied with a laugh, “Was I born to polish game pieces?” and then departed. Daiyu said, “Then go. I’ll be watching to see if you’re devoured by tigers!” As she spoke, she resumed her cutting. Baoyu, seeing that she ignored him, could only smile and say, “You should go take a stroll; there’s no harm in postponing your tailoring.” But Daiyu would not be swayed.
How can she behave so badly behind our backs?”  You and the others laughed, “It isn’t Ping’er’s fault; it is Feng who uses her as a scapegoat. When the couples quarrel, they always take it out on Ping’er. Poor thing!”  Grandmother Jia said, “That’s right. I always say, the child isn’t like that cunning enchantress. Seeing her suffer so undeservedly, I will have her master come tomorrow and personally apologize on her behalf. Today is his good day—he must not be allowed to be angry.”  It turned out that earlier, Ping’er had already been taken into the Grand View Garden by Li Wan. Ping’er wept bitterly, and Baochai consoled her, “You are sensible enough. Grandmother has always cared for you. Today, he only had one extra sip of wine—he won’t take his anger out on you. Others have already mocked him for being insincere.”  Just then, Hu Po came over with Grandmother’s message. Ping’er, noticing a certain brightness return to her face, slowly recovered and no longer advanced. After a while, after the guests had rested, they turned to see Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Bao Yu then made way for Ping’er to come into the Yíhóng Courtyard. Xiangren quickly helped, saying, “I had intended to give you your due, but since our eldest sister and the other girls all insist on you, I dared not refuse.”  Ping’er smiled and said, “Thank you very much.” She then added, “Really, I’ve suffered for no reason—being caught in all this aggravation for nothing!”  Xiangren teased, “Second Young Lady has always been kind to you. It was merely a moment of anger last night.”  Ping’er replied, “Second Young Lady never said a word; it’s just that that harlot insulted me—and then our foolish master ended up beating me.” With that, she broke into tears again. Bao Yu quickly consoled, “Dear sister, do not be sorrowful. I will go and apologize on your behalf.”  Ping’er asked, “What does that have to do with you?”  Bao Yu smiled, “We are all siblings in heart. If they wrong someone, I should be the one to make amends.” He continued, “It’s a pity your new clothes got soiled. Why don’t you change them? I’ll even help you: we can spray them with strong wine and iron them carefully, and then re-comb your hair.”  While he spoke, he ordered some little maids, “Fetch some water for washing faces and an iron for pressing.”  It was well known that Bao Yu had never before shown his true heart toward Ping’er—even though Ping’er was Jia Lian’s beloved concubine and Fengjie’s trusted aide, Bao Yu always kept his distance. Consequently, he never treated her with complete sincerity, and over time he had harbored a grudge. Now, seeing his gentle manner toward Ping’er, she secretly mused, “Truly, his reputation is well-deserved; he considers every detail so thoughtfully.” And when Xiangren opened a chest to reveal two sets of spare clothes (which were hardly ever worn), she quickly went to wash her face. Beside him, Bao Yu laughed and advised, “Dear sister, you should put on some powder—otherwise you look as if you’re sulking against Fengjie. Besides, today is your good day; Grandmother herself sent someone to comfort you.”  Ping’er agreed and went to fetch some powder—but none could be found. Bao Yu hurried to a dressing table and opened a Xuanyao porcelain box. Inside lay ten jade hairpin-like flower sticks. He picked one up and handed it to Ping’er, laughing, “This isn’t lead powder—it’s ground purple jasmine seeds prepared with proper recipe.”  Ping’er examined it carefully in her palm. It was light, with a subtle rosy fragrance and a delicate, balanced texture that, when applied, spread easily and imparted a gentle glow—unlike any coarse powder she’d known before.
You, always sneaking about like a thief, dragging everyone into your misdeeds, and now for the sake of that harlot beating your wife and even the household servants—remind me, you are supposed to be a gentleman of a grand family! If you truly valued me, then stand up and I’ll pardon you; obediently apologize to your wife and take her home. Otherwise, you may go away—I dare not suffer your head any longer.”  Seeing Fengjie standing there, without proper makeup, with tear-swelled eyes and a sallow face, Jia Lian thought it best to offer his apology. He bowed low and said, “It is entirely my fault, dear Second Young Lady; please do not be angry.”  All present laughed. Grandmother Jia then declared, “Feng, do not be angry! If you persist, I shall be angry too!” She then ordered that Ping’er be brought in, instructing Fengjie and Jia Lian to comfort her. Upon seeing Ping’er, Jia Lian, overcome with remorse, cried out, “You were wronged yesterday—it is all my fault. Grandmother was offended because of me. I not only apologize, but will also make Grandmother apologize on your behalf.” He then bowed again, drawing laughter from Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Grandmother Jia then ordered Fengjie to go and comfort Ping’er. Ping’er, hurrying forward, knelt and said, “Forgive me, Grandmother—I have upset you; it is entirely my fault.”  Fengjie’s indignation turned to self-reproach as she wept bitterly, “How could I, having drunk too much yesterday and disregarded our usual kindness, now disgrace myself by shaming Ping’er? I have no face left to live with!”  Jia Lian interjected, “Not at all! Think carefully—whose fault was it yesterday? Today, in front of everyone, I have knelt and apologized on your behalf; you have done your duty. There is no need for you to continue lamenting—must I also kneel for you?”  This provoked laughter from Ping’er, and Jia Lian himself chuckled, “I am truly at my wit’s end.”  At that moment, a servant’s wife came running with the news, “Bao Er’s wife has hanged herself!” Both Jia Lian and Fengjie were stunned. Fengjie quickly recovered her composure and retorted, “She’s dead—what is there to make a fuss about?”  Soon, Lin Zhixiao’s family came in quietly and informed Fengjie, “They say that Bao Er’s wife’s relatives are threatening legal action.”  Fengjie sneered, “Splendid! I was just thinking of taking legal action myself!”  Lin Zhixiao explained, “I had tried to calm everyone down and even intimidated them for a while, and even offered him some money—but he eventually relented.”  Fengjie declared, “I won’t pay a single penny! If he wishes to sue, let him sue. I shall not persuade him otherwise. And if his lawsuit fails, I might just have him charged with ‘exploiting a corpse for extortion’!”  Lin Zhixiao was at a loss, and noticing Jia Lian’s and Fengjie’s knowing looks, he understood and waited silently. Jia Lian said, “I’ll go out and see what’s happening.”  Fengjie, meanwhile, declared firmly, “Do not give him any money!”  Jia Lian went out and conferred with Lin Zhixiao. After some deliberation and arrangements—promising 200 taels in compensation—they set about hiring several funeral agents and forensic examiners to handle the matter. Those officials, though tempted to protest, dared not raise objections and swallowed their grievances. Jia Lian then instructed Lin Zhixiao to record the 200 taels on the ledger and distribute it accordingly, so that the matter could be finally settled. He even arranged for additional silver to be given to Bao Er’s family, assuring them, “Someday I will find you a fine wife.” Bao Er’s family, pleased to retain both honor and funds, had nothing more to say. Inside, Fengjie, though troubled, kept her composure outwardly.
He asked her age, her surname. Hearing “Huang,” he joked that it fit well with her name “Oriole (Yinger).” She teased back that her name used to be Jin Ying, “Golden Oriole,” but her mistress shortened it. Baoyu teased: “Our Sister Bao must be very fond of you. When she marries, I bet you’ll go with her.” Yinger only smiled, while Baoyu bantered, “I often tell your older maids that whoever’s fated to have Mistress and her maid both is quite lucky.” Yinger laughed, “Miss has many hidden virtues, but you can’t guess them all.” Baoyu’s curiosity piqued. “Tell me everything.” She lowered her voice: “But promise you won’t let her know I said it.” He swore secrecy, and they chatted on. Just then, they heard someone outside remark: “Why is it so quiet in here?” Turning, they saw it was Baochai herself. Baoyu quickly invited her to sit. She noticed Yinger in mid-lacing. “What’s so interesting about cords?” she mused. “Might as well tie one around your jade.” That reminded Baoyu: “Brilliant suggestion! But which colors would suit my jade best?” Baochai said, “Never pure black or scarlet, or you’ll overshadow the jade’s own color. Better use your gold thread with blackish beads, plait them together for a refined look.” Baoyu was delighted, calling Xi Ren for the gold thread. Just then, Xi Ren came back in, carrying two dishes, puzzling over them: “Strange. Lady Wang had them delivered just to me—by name—and didn’t even call me over to thank her. How odd.” Baochai laughed, “It’s just a small token—why overthink?” Xi Ren sighed, “I’m not used to such direct gifts.” Baochai, half smiling, said, “If this embarrasses you, then just wait. Perhaps you’ll have bigger embarrassments soon.” Xi Ren, recalling Lady Wang’s hints the other day, colored and fell silent. Baoyu, hearing Baochai’s words half-jesting, half-laden with meaning, also felt a tug at his heart. But before he could comment, Baochai left, explaining, “I must go see my brother. I’ll check on you tomorrow. Apply that medication in the evening.”  She walked out, Xi Ren accompanying her to the courtyard, politely giving thanks. Baochai answered, “Remind him not to overthink. If he wants some treat, quietly fetch it from me. Best not alert the others, or trouble might follow.” Then she departed. Inside, Xi Ren said to Baoyu: “If you want anything, do be careful. . . .” But at that moment, word came from Aunt Xing’s side. Two maids arrived bringing fruit for Baoyu, also delivering messages about how the family missed him. Baoyu asked them to stay, chatted briefly, then told Qiuwen to split some fruit to send to “Miss Lin.” She had just taken it when they heard Daiyu’s voice at the door. Baoyu brightened:  “Quick, please invite her in.” What happens next must await the next chapter’s telling. Chapter 36 Embroidered Mandarin Ducks: An Ominous Dream in the Fragrant Pavilion; Recognizing Each Person’s Destiny, Baoyu Awakens to Truth in the Pear-Scented Lodge  When Grandmother Jia returned from Lady Wang’s quarters and saw that Baoyu was improving day by day, she was quite pleased. Lest Jia Zheng again summon Baoyu, she called in the head page who served Jia Zheng and instructed him:  “If there’s any guest or matter requiring someone to accompany your master, and he calls for Baoyu, do not come relaying that summons. Just say I told you this: First, Baoyu was severely injured and needs several months of proper recuperation before he can walk about; and second, his birth star is inauspicious at present—he must stay out of public view, even beyond the second gate, until after the eighth lunar month.” The page accepted this charge and left.
To be honest, who could compare with her? Not to mention, if even Xi Ren were not so solicitous, then it would be impossible. It’s only those like Qing Jingwen and Qi Xia who are counted among the best, because Baoyu dotes on them, and everyone else fawns over them. Tell me, isn’t that infuriating?” Xiao Hong replied, “There’s no need to be angry with them. As the saying goes, ‘A long banquet under a long canopy always comes to an end.’ Who can guard such a feast for a lifetime? In three, four, or five years, everyone will go their own ways—and then who will care for whom?” These words touched Jia Hui, softening her heart until tears welled up in her eyes. Yet she felt too shy to cry without cause and forced a gentle smile, adding, “You’re right. Just yesterday, Baoyu was saying how tomorrow he’d arrange the house and make new clothes—as if he were being tormented for centuries.” Xiao Hong snorted a bitter laugh and was about to speak further when a young maid, not even having her hair done, entered carrying some decorative flower motifs and two sheets of paper. “These two designs are for you to copy,” she said, dropping them by Xiao Hong’s side and then dashing off before Xiao Hong could ask, “Whose designs are these? You didn’t even finish saying; are they for the steamed buns? Or are you afraid they’ll get cold?” From outside the window, the young maid called back, “They’re for Sister Qi!” She then hurried away with a pattering sound. In a fit of pique, Xiao Hong tossed the designs aside and rummaged in a drawer for a pen. After searching in vain for a suitable pen among the worn-out ones, she said, “Wasn’t there a new pen placed here yesterday? I can’t seem to remember…” Lost in thought, she finally smiled and said, “That’s it—last night, Ying’er took it.” She then said to Jia Hui, “Fetch it for me, will you?” Jia Hui replied, “Big Sister Hua is waiting for me to get a box for her; you fetch it yourself.” Xiao Hong grumbled, “She’s waiting on you while you sit there idly chewing your teeth—if I don’t tell you to get it, she won’t wait for you at all. You little rascal!” With that, Xiao Hong left her room. Stepping out into Hongyuan, she made her way straight toward Baochai’s courtyard. Just as she reached the Qinfang Pavilion, she saw Baoyu’s wet nurse, Aunt Li, coming from that direction. Xiao Hong stopped and asked with a laugh, “Aunt Li, where have you been? Why are you coming here?” Aunt Li halted, clapped her hand, and said, “You’re too funny—always falling for that so-called Yun Ge, forcing me to call him over. If he comes in tomorrow and the household hears, it won’t look good.” Xiao Hong laughed, “Do you really believe him enough to call him over?” Aunt Li replied, “What can I do?” Xiao Hong said, “If he knew what was good for him, he wouldn’t come in here at all.” Aunt Li remarked, “But he isn’t foolish—why wouldn’t he come in?” Xiao Hong said, “If he does come in, then you mustn’t accompany him; next time, send him in alone and see how he fares!” Aunt Li replied, “I have plenty of time to go with him! I’ll just tell him to send a maid or an old woman along next time, and then he can come in.” With that, she hobbled away with her cane. Xiao Hong, hearing this, stood transfixed and did not go to fetch the pen immediately. Soon enough, a little maid came running over and, noticing Xiao Hong standing there, asked, “Sister Hong, what are you doing here?” The little maid, named Kui’er, looked up. Xiao Hong said, “Where are you headed?” Kui’er replied, “They’ve asked me to bring in Second Master Yun.” She then dashed off.
He was about to speak further when Jia Zhen’s wife, You-shi, arrived with Jia Rong’s new wife, Mistress Hu, to greet Jia Mu. She dismissed them with, “You needn’t have come; I’m only here for some idle enjoyment.” Just then someone announced, “A visitor from General Feng’s household!” They had brought offerings of pork, incense, candles, and refreshments, on hearing that the Jia family was conducting services at the temple. Wang Xifeng promptly hurried to the main balcony and clapped her hands in dismay, “Oh my! I never anticipated this. We only came for a casual outing, but others assumed we were officially holding a grand ceremony, so they’ve sent gifts. All because of the Old Lady’s idea! Now I have to scrounge up gift envelopes.” She had barely finished when two stewards from the Feng household ascended. They had not yet finished when Zhao the Minister’s household also arrived with gifts. Presently, wave after wave of distant relatives and acquaintances—hearing that the Jia ladies were at the temple—came to present offerings. Jia Mu regretfully murmured, “We never meant to hold a proper ceremony; this was just a leisurely outing, but we’ve bothered them so.” Thus, after half a day of theatricals, she decided to head back in the late afternoon. The next day, she felt no inclination to return. Wang Xifeng, however, said with a grin, “Having begun by knocking on the wall, we’ve stirred up dust. We might as well continue our fun.”  But the previous day, that Taoist Zhang had mentioned a potential match for Baoyu, leaving Baoyu feeling uneasy. Upon returning home, he seethed at having his marriage discussed, declaring with finality he’d never see Zhang Taoist again—though no one knew exactly why. Meanwhile, Daiyu, having been out in the heat, had succumbed to mild heatstroke. Concerned, Jia Mu insisted on staying put. Wang Xifeng thus went with a small party of her own, leaving the rest alone. Baoyu fretted over Daiyu’s condition. He found himself with no appetite, frequently stopping by her quarters, fearing any mishap. Daiyu only said, “Why not go listen to your plays? You can’t be enjoying yourself by staying home.” Her words, spoken so casually, jabbed at Baoyu’s already raw nerves from hearing that marriage talk. “Others might not understand how I feel, but I thought you of all people would.” Furious at her dismissal, his anger soared to new heights. He’d never vent his temper at others, but from Daiyu such remarks stung differently. His face darkened. “I see I’ve wasted my time on you—fine, then!”  Daiyu, letting out a mocking laugh, said, “You say you’ve wasted your time knowing me? Indeed, I’m scarcely worthy of the likes of you.” Baoyu abruptly approached, all but confronting her face-to-face. “By saying that, are you cursing me to be doomed by Heaven?” Daiyu, confused by the accusation, didn’t know how to respond. Baoyu continued, “I already swore an oath about this yesterday, and yet you’ve repeated your hurtful words today. Even if I fall under divine wrath, how does that benefit you?” At this, Daiyu recalled yesterday’s events, sensing her own fault in the matter; flustered and ashamed, she broke into sobs, saying, “Why would I wish to bring you harm? If that’s the case, let me be damned as well! Why must it be so? I realize that meddling Taoist tried to offer you a fine match, and you resented missing your chance, so you vent your anger upon me!”  In truth, Baoyu had borne an obsession since childhood—call it a certain “foolish ailment.” He had grown up entangled with Daiyu, heart to heart, and having read a few bizarre romantic accounts, had seen no other woman—be they kinswoman or friend—who could compare to Daiyu. Secretly, he had harbored devotion to her, but never dared speak of it. So he’d constantly test her feelings with subtle ploys, while Daiyu, harboring her own “foolish ailment,” tested him in turn.
But what she actually heard was Xiangyun extolling “managing finances” (jingji) to Baoyu, and then Baoyu telling Xi Ren, “Lin cousin never utters such rubbish. If she did, we’d become estranged.”  This statement pierced Daiyu’s heart with mingled joy and sorrow. She mused: He truly is my confidant, praising me in front of others and never minding suspicion. But if he’s wholeheartedly for me, why the persistent talk of “gold and jade,” or the presence of Sister Bao? If he’s mine, why is Sister Bao there at all…? She recalled her orphaned state, the fleeting illusions of her hopes, plus her own lingering illness. The doctors had remarked on her “deficient blood and feeble qi, risking a consumptive decline.” If it was true that she and Baoyu belonged together in spirit, how to fight her frailty? Brimming with complicated emotions, she could only weep silently. In that moment, she felt disinclined to enter the room, so she wiped her tears and withdrew. Baoyu, now dressed to meet Jia Yucun, spotted Daiyu heading off, apparently dabbing tears from her eyes. Rushing forward, he called, “Where are you going? Why are you crying again? Who offended you?” Daiyu turned and forced a tight smile: “Why talk nonsense? I’m not crying.”  Baoyu teased, “Come on—your tears haven’t even dried.” He reached out as if to wipe them away, but she stepped back: “You want to bring calamity on yourself, groping at me like that!”  Baoyu laughed, “I forgot myself for a moment. Whether I live or die hardly matters when I see you crying.”  She responded archly, “If you died, that means I’ll lose your precious golden qilin, or ‘gold and jade’—whatever shall I do?” This pricked Baoyu deeply: “Are you cursing me? Or are you angry at me?” Realizing she’d again spoken heedlessly, Daiyu hurriedly softened: “All right, all right—I said the wrong words, no need to blow a fuse. Look how anxious you’ve gotten, sweating like that.” So saying, she stepped closer to blot his brow with her handkerchief. Baoyu gazed at her. “You needn’t worry.” Daiyu gave him an odd look. “What do you mean by ‘I needn’t worry’? I don’t follow.” Baoyu sighed: “Truly you don’t see? If so, all the devotion I’ve shown day by day is wasted. Our constant misunderstandings prove you can’t understand me. You’re always uneasy at heart. That’s why you’re daily ill. If you felt more at ease, you wouldn’t be so sick.”  Daiyu felt as if thunder had struck. She realized how precisely his words mirrored her own hidden thoughts. She wanted to speak a thousand sentences, but not a syllable escaped her lips. Baoyu likewise had countless more confessions, uncertain where to begin, so they both stared, speechless. After a long pause, Daiyu sobbed once, tears streaming, and turned to go. Baoyu tried to pull her back: “Don’t leave yet—hear me out.” Daiyu, wiping her tears, brushed his hand aside: “No need. I know what’s on your mind.” Without a backward glance, she was gone. Baoyu stood gazing after her in a daze. He had hurried out earlier and forgot his fan. Xi Ren, mindful of the heat, grabbed a fan to bring him. Seeing him standing there foolishly, she joked, “I noticed you left without a fan—I’ve brought it. Why stand there like a statue?” Lost in thought, Baoyu murmured, “My dear sister, I’ve never dared speak my heart, but now that I have, even death holds no fear! On your account, I’ve developed this illness, which I hide from all. Only when your own illness abates will my suffering ease. Awake or asleep, I cannot forget you!”  Xi Ren froze, alarmed, “What on earth are you talking about?
And now I can’t relieve her suffering,” he lamented, his own tears falling in remorse. Xi Ren, seeing both of them crying piteously, felt her heart twinge. She discovered Baoyu’s hand was cold to the touch. Torn between coaxing Baoyu to restrain himself or comforting Daiyu, she too began to weep silently. Zijuan tidied the soiled handkerchief while gently fanning Daiyu. Not a word was spoken among the four, only their sniffles echoing. Eventually Xi Ren tried to break the tension, forcing a laugh at Baoyu: “If nothing else, consider how that tassel on your jade was made—does that not show you shouldn’t fight with Miss Lin?” At this, Daiyu, despite her illness, rushed over, seized the jade, and snatched up scissors to cut away at the tassel. Xi Ren and Zijuan tried to stop her, but not before she’d snipped off several threads. Sobbing, she cried, “All I’ve done is worthless. He doesn’t need me—someone else can fasten him a new one!”  Xi Ren hurriedly retrieved the jade, “What’s the use of that? My mouth outran my sense—I’m to blame.” Baoyu snapped at Daiyu, “Cut it all you like! I won’t wear it anymore!”  Their shouting caused a commotion. Some older servants, hearing Daiyu’s crying, her vomiting, and Baoyu’s smashing of the jade, feared things had spiraled out of control. They quickly reported to Jia Mu and Lady Wang. The two ladies, in the midst of more significant matters, heard the urgent tone and rushed to the garden. Xi Ren muttered, “Why alert the Old Lady and Mistress?” Zijuan, assuming Xi Ren had done so herself, blamed her in turn. When Jia Mu and Lady Wang arrived, finding Baoyu speechless and Daiyu silent, they asked what had caused the fracas. Yet they discovered no clear reason. Frustrated, they instead scolded Xi Ren and Zijuan: “Why were you not minding them properly so that such a row erupted?” The two maids, left without explanation, endured the reprimand. Eventually, Jia Mu led Baoyu away, restoring calm. Another day passed, bringing them to the third, which was Xue Pan’s birthday. At his home a banquet was laid out with theatrical performances. The Jia family were all set to attend, yet Baoyu had offended Daiyu, and they had not mended fences. He felt contrite and listless, lacking the spirit to attend. Thus he feigned illness and did not go. Daiyu, having only minor heatstroke, heard that he was also staying behind, thinking, “He loves feasting and theatrics. For him to skip it must be because of last night’s quarrel—or that he’s aware I’m not going, and so he lost interest. But I truly regret cutting the tassel from his jade. Perhaps now he’ll never wear it again, unless I fix it myself.” With such remorse in her heart, she was consumed by regret. Seeing both Baoyu and Daiyu refuse to join the others, Jia Mu bemoaned, “Oh, what grudge in a past life has me saddled with these two willful children? Not a day passes without them vexing me! Indeed, as the saying goes: ‘Fated foes inevitably cross paths!’ If I could just close my eyes and sever my breath, they can carry on their quarrels all they want. At least I’d no longer see or worry. But fate won’t let me die soon!” Lamenting so, the elderly lady shed tears. Word of these remarks reached both Baoyu and Daiyu. Neither had heard the proverb, “Fated foes inevitably cross paths,” but now, hearing it was like a Zen awakening. Each pondered it, tears welling in their eyes. Though they did not meet, one sobbed in her Xiao Xiang Pavilion, gazing at the wind, the other sighed by moonlight in the Pear-Fragrance Courtyard. As the proverb ran, “living in two different places yet sharing one heart.”  Xi Ren told Baoyu, “This is all your fault. Remember, whenever some servant couple fought, you’d scold the boys for failing to grasp a girl’s heart.
Daiyu, lying on her pillow, thought of Baochai with fondness—envying that she had a mother and a brother—then recalled Bao Yu’s long-standing amicable relations, though sometimes tinged with unspoken resentment. As she listened to the rain pattering on the bamboo and banana leaves outside, the chill seeped through the window, and tears began to fall. Before long, she finally drifted off to sleep around the fourth watch. For now, there is nothing more to say. How it all ultimately unfolds… we shall continue in the next installment. Chapter 46 Unavoidable Embarrassments for the Embarrassed; Yuan Yang’s Maid Vows to Sever Ties with Her “Yuan Yang” Companion  Note: “Yuan Yang” here is a character’s name (alluding to the mandarin duck), not the literal “mandarin duck.”  Daiyu did not finally drift off to sleep until around the fourth watch, and for a while nothing further was said. Now, we turn to Fengjie. Shortly after, she was summoned by Mrs. Xing—but unaware of the reason, she quickly changed and dressed herself before taking a carriage over. Mrs. Xing, having dismissed everyone from the room, leaned in confidentially and said to Fengjie, “I called you here for one difficult matter. Lord Jia has set his heart on the mandarin duck from Grandmother’s room and now wants it to remain in the room. He has asked me to negotiate with Grandmother. I suspect such requests are not unusual—but I fear Grandmother might refuse. Do you have any ideas on how to handle this?”  Fengjie, laughing in a conciliatory tone, replied, “In my opinion, don’t even think about meddling with this matter. Without that ‘Yuan Yang’ in her room, Grandmother wouldn’t even eat properly—she wouldn’t part with something she so cherishes. Besides, in her idle chatter Grandmother often teases Lord Jia, saying, ‘Now that he’s grown old, why must he keep collecting one thing after another in the room? First, he endangers the girls by neglecting their upbringing; second, he lets his own health go to ruin by not taking proper care—drinking with his concubines every day!’ Don’t you think the madams would enjoy hearing that? Lord Jia, on the other hand, might try to hide it—but isn’t that like “sticking a stick in a tiger’s nose”? Madam, don’t be angry. I wouldn’t dare to interfere. Besides, if we leave it as is, it might even backfire and cause more trouble. Lord Jia, now in his advanced years, sometimes acts in ways that are less than proper; the madams should counsel him instead. Compared with the young, these matters are trivial. Yet now—with his brothers, nephews, sons, and grandsons numbering in the dozens—how can he continue such antics before everyone’s eyes?”  Mrs. Xing sneered, “Even in families with three or four concubines, they get away with it. Why, then, is it that our household can’t? I’ve tried advising him, but he won’t listen. Even if it is Grandmother’s beloved maid, look at her—so pale with worry, and he’s the eldest son of an official; when she’s called to serve inside the house, it isn’t easy to refuse. I’ve summoned you to discuss this. It seems you’re already on the hook. I must say, if I tried to advise him, he’d hardly heed a word. You see his temper; if I cannot persuade him, then things will only escalate.”  Fengjie knew well that Mrs. Xing’s character was weak—she only knew how to curry favor with Jia She in order to secure her own position and profit from the household’s wealth. Everything in the household—every financial matter—passed through Jia She’s hands, who would invariably make deductions and claim it was for “saving expenses” on his lavish spending. Every servant, every child, obeyed him without question. Now that I hear your request, I can tell he’s once again trying to bend things to his will. (I suppose he’s trying to persuade you to do what you originally offered to do—only, in reality, he wants to extract money from me.)  Fengjie quickly accompanied Mrs.
One of them said to You, “Prepare some money for a tip—I’m off to wash my face.” You nodded. Seizing an opportunity when no one was looking, Fengjie slipped away from the banquet and made her way toward the rear eaves of the house. Ping’er, noticing her departure, hurried along after Fengjie. Fengjie, however, took her arm to steady her. They reached the corridor when suddenly a little maid from Fengjie’s room, who had been standing quietly, saw them coming and immediately fled. Alarmed, Fengjie shouted, “Hey! Miss, wait—you there, come back!” The little maid tried feigning deafness at first, but after hearing repeated calls, she returned reluctantly. Fengjie’s suspicions grew, and she, accompanied by Ping’er, entered the corridor. She ordered the little maid to come inside, had her open the folding screen, and then sat on the steps of the courtyard. In a commanding tone, she ordered the maid to kneel and then barked at Ping’er, “Fetch two of the junior servants from the Second Gate—bring rope and whip, and beat that little nimble-footed runt until her eyes are as good as smashed!”  The poor maid was so terrified she burst into tears and begged for mercy. Fengjie demanded, “I’m not a ghost! Why, when you see me, do you not stand still but instead run forward?”  The maid sobbed, “I didn’t see Grandmother coming. I thought the house was empty, so I ran off.”  Fengjie roared, “Since the house is empty, who told you to come? Didn’t you hear me and Ping’er calling your name over and over? You ran so fast that I had to shout at you repeatedly! You’re not far away—are you deaf? And you still try to contradict me!”  With that, Fengjie raised her hand and struck the maid sharply. The blow sent the little maid staggering and, with another slap to the face, her cheeks turned purple with the force. Ping’er quickly interceded, “Madam, be careful—your hand!”  Fengjie, incensed, said, “Ask her again why she ran off. If she won’t speak, I’ll tear her mouth to shreds!”  At first the maid tried to hold her tongue, but when Fengjie threatened to brand her with a red-hot iron, she finally burst out, “Second Young Master sent me here to keep an eye on you—he was to see you off when Grandmother left! I wasn’t expecting Grandmother to come back so soon!”  Fengjie, seeing there was more to the story, pressed further, “So, why were you keeping an eye on me? Didn’t he order you to escort me home? There must be another reason—tell me quickly, so that from now on I may take care of you properly. If you do not tell the truth, I’ll have no hesitation using a knife to cut your flesh!”  In her anger, Fengjie snatched a hairpin from her hair and began to jab it wildly at the maid’s mouth. Terrified, the maid dodged and cried, “I’ll tell you, please don’t say I told on you!”  Ping’er urged her to speak, and the maid, between sobs, managed to say, “Second Young Master has just arrived—he opened his treasure box and took two pieces of silver, along with two hairpins and two bolts of satin—and told me to secretly deliver them to Bao Er’s wife. After he collected the items, he then returned to the house. Second Young Master ordered me to keep an eye on you. As for the rest, I don’t know anything.”  Fengjie’s face paled with anger. She abruptly rose and stormed toward the house. At the door, a little maid peeked out; upon seeing Fengjie, she shrank back and ran off. Fengjie shouted after her, “What were you going to tell me?”  The little maid cried out, “Second Young Master is at home…” and repeated everything she had heard. Fengjie spat, “Why didn’t you say so sooner? Now that I’ve seen you, get out and clear yourself off!” With that, she smacked the maid again so forcefully that the maid stumbled and scurried away on tiptoe.
Hanging in the middle of the west wall was a large scroll of Mi Xiangyang’s “Mist and Rain.” On either side hung a couplet—the calligraphy of Yan Luguang—which read:  “In the leisure of mist and clouds, nature reveals a graceful bearing; By the spring of rocks and streams, one lives a wild, unbridled life.” On the table sat a large cauldron; to its left, on a rosewood stand, was a grand official kiln plate holding dozens of delicate, exquisitely molded Buddha’s hand figurines. On the right, suspended on a lacquered frame, hung a white jade bi‐qing (a kind of percussion instrument), with a small mallet beside it. At that moment, Ban’er (Tan Chun) grew restless, about to snatch the mallet to strike it; the maidservants hurried to stop him. Just then he reached for one of the Buddha hands as a snack, and Tan Chun plucked one out for him, saying, “That’s for playing around—you can’t eat it!” To which Ban’er retorted, “This is a cricket, this is a grasshopper,” and Old Liu promptly gave him a slap saying, “You lowly whelp! Stop your unseemly antics—just because I let you come in to see, now you get too cheeky!” Ban’er burst into tears, and only after much coaxing did everyone calm him down. Grandmother Jia then looked out through the gauze window toward the courtyard and said, “The phoenix trees under the rear eaves are in fine shape, albeit a bit slender.” Just then a gust of wind blew by and, in the distance, the sound of drums and flutes was faintly heard. Grandmother Jia asked, “Whose wedding is it? This place is right by the street.” Madame Wang and the others laughed and replied, “Can you really hear that from the street? It’s just that our ten or so girls are practicing their music and dance.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Since they’re performing, why not invite them in to show us a little routine? They could enjoy a stroll, and we’d have a grand time—wouldn’t that be nice?” Hearing this, Fengjie hurriedly ordered someone to go out and summon them, while simultaneously instructing that a side table be set up and a red carpet laid out. Grandmother Jia added, “Let’s arrange it on the waterside pavilion in the Lotus Fragrance Pavilion. The sound of water will make the music even more pleasing. When we return, we can have our drinks under the Zhuangjin Pavilion—so spacious and near at hand.” Everyone agreed. Grandmother Jia then smiled at Aunt Xue and said, “Let’s be off now. The sisters are not too keen on having guests come about—fearing the room might be spoiled. Let’s show some decorum: we shall properly sit in the boat and drink a toast.” As she spoke, everyone rose and set out. Tan Chun laughed, “How can that be? We beg the old lady, Aunt, and Madame to join us—but they’re all too modest to come!” Grandmother Jia laughed, “My three little maids are fine; only those two naughty little ones are troublesome. When they get drunk on our return, we’ll have a row in their room!” At this, everyone laughed merrily. They all set out together, and after not walking very far, they reached the Xingye Islet. There, a few boat ladies specially selected from Suzhou had already prepared two tangmu (rosewood) boats. With some assistance, they helped Grandmother Jia, Madame Wang, Aunt Xue, Old Liu, Yuan Yang, and Yu Chuan get aboard one boat; soon after, Li Wan joined. Fengjie also got on, standing at the prow to help row. Grandmother Jia, seated in the cabin, cautioned, “This isn’t mere play—although we’re not on a river, it is deep enough. Come quickly on board!”  Fengjie laughed, “What’s there to fear? Our venerable ancestor, rest assured!” With that, she took up a pole and propelled the boat into the middle of the pond. The boat was small and crowded; Fengjie felt it lurch about wildly, so she quickly passed the pole to the boat lady and crouched down.
She found Lady Wang seated on a cool bamboo couch, gently fanning herself. Lady Wang remarked:  “Leaving Baoyu’s side—who’s attending him now?” Xi Ren bowed and replied, “He’s fallen soundly asleep just now. There are several capable maids with him. You needn’t worry. If I’d sent any of the young maids, they might misunderstand your instructions, leading to mistakes. Better that I come.”  Lady Wang nodded:  “I wasn’t calling for anything special—just to ask how his pain is. Has it eased some?” Xi Ren said,  “Miss Bao brought a special remedy. I applied it, so he’s better. Before, the pain kept him from lying still, but now he’s dozed off, so likely it’s taking effect.” Lady Wang asked, “Has he eaten?”  Xi Ren answered, “Grandmother prepared a broth; he only had two mouthfuls. Then he asked for sour-plum juice. But I worried it might aggravate his pent-up heat inside, so I dissuaded him. Instead, I made a small bowl of sweet rose infusion, but he said it tasted dull.”  Lady Wang exclaimed, “Oh dear—you should have told me earlier. I have a few bottles of fragrant syrups that were gifted recently. I was going to give him some but worried it might be wasted. Go ahead and take two bottles. Just a spoonful in a bowl of water yields a marvelous flavor.”  She ordered the maid Caiyun to fetch them. Xi Ren said, “Two bottles is plenty. If we need more, we can always come get them.” Caiyun went off, returning after a while with two miniature glass bottles, each about three inches tall, with silver screw caps. One read “Osmanthus Dew,” the other “Rose Dew.” Xi Ren laughed:  “Such precious things—these little flasks must not hold much!” Lady Wang told her, “They’re imperial tributes—see the canary-yellow label? Guard them well so they’re not wasted.”  Xi Ren promised to do so and started to go, but Lady Wang called her back:  “Wait. I have one more question.” So Xi Ren came near. Seeing the room empty, Lady Wang asked:  “I seem to recall hearing that the reason Baoyu was beaten—besides the matter of that Prince’s actor—was because Huan mentioned something. Did you catch wind of that?” Xi Ren said, “I only heard it was because of the missing performer, that’s all. Any other reason, I wouldn’t know.” She paused, looking hesitant, then ventured,  “Forgive my boldness in your presence, but . . . truly, to speak bluntly. . . .” She trailed off. Lady Wang encouraged her: “Go on, speak plainly.”  Xi Ren said, “You won’t be angry? Then—I must say: It’s not necessarily a bad thing that the Master spanked Baoyu. If the Master never disciplined him, who knows what havoc he’d eventually cause?”  Hearing these words, Lady Wang nodded sadly and sighed. She took Xi Ren’s hand: “My child, how well you speak. Exactly my own thinking. Indeed, do you imagine I don’t realize Baoyu needs strict guidance? But consider. In former times, when Zhu was alive, I kept my sons well in hand. Now, with only Baoyu left, and he so delicate—plus the Old Ancestor dotes on him so. If I restrain him too severely, suppose something befalls him, or the Old Ancestor is upset. Then who’s to blame? That’s why we end up spoiling him. I often scold him, beseech him in tears. He listens for a moment, then soon reverts. In the end, not until he experiences real suffering does he seem moved. But if he were to be beaten so badly that he’s crippled, who can I rely on? He’s all I have!” She too was moved to tears. Seeing Lady Wang so affected, Xi Ren felt her own eyes prickle, and tears fell. She said:  “It’s only natural a mother would love her child, but we servants who attend him daily also yearn for a peaceful outcome.
Also, the Duanwu Festival gifts were distributed.” She then ordered a little maid to bring out the gifts bestowed yesterday—two fine palace fans, two strings of red musk-scented pearls, two sets of phoenix-tail brocade, and a set of lotus-scented mats. Baoyu was overjoyed upon seeing these and asked, “Are these the same as what everyone else received?” Xi Ren replied, “The Old Lady has an extra Scented Jade Ruyi and a Nephrite Pillow, in addition to what the Master, Mistress, and concubines received—a single Scented Jade Ruyi. As for Miss Lin and the second, third, and fourth sisters, they received only a fan and a few prayer beads; whereas the eldest and second sisters each received two bolts of gauze and two bolts of silk, two scented pouches, and two packages of medicine.” Baoyu laughed, “What is the reason behind it? Why is it that Miss Lin’s are not the same as mine, but Sister Bao’s match mine? Could there have been a mistake in transmission?” Xi Ren replied, “The items were all clearly labeled with tags yesterday—how could there be a mistake? Yours were from the Old Lady’s room; I went and retrieved them. The Old Lady said that tomorrow, at the break of dawn, you are to go in and give your thanks.” Baoyu said, “Naturally, I must pay my respects.” With that, he called Zijuan, “Take this to our young lady and say that what I received yesterday is mine—whatever I love, let it remain.” Zijuan agreed and took it away. Not long after, she returned and said, “The young lady has spoken: she has received it, so Second Master, keep it.” Hearing this, Baoyu ordered that the items be carefully stored away. Barely had he washed his face and prepared to go pay respects to the Lady Dowager when he saw Daiyu approaching from the top of the stairs. Baoyu ran up laughing, “I told you to choose something from my things—why haven’t you chosen anything?” Daiyu, having long since put aside her grievances from yesterday, now focused solely on the present. She said, “I do not have the good fortune to endure such luxury; I am nothing compared to Sister Bao. We are but simple beings of plants and trees!” When Baoyu mentioned the words “gold and jade,” his heart filled with suspicion, and he said, “Aside from what others speak of gold and jade, I must have such thoughts in my heart—by heaven and earth, never shall I allow that to happen!” Hearing this, Daiyu knew that his heart had begun to waver; she quickly laughed and said, “How meaningless! Swear nothing—you care nothing for gold or jade!” Baoyu replied, “My heart’s secrets are difficult to explain; in time, you shall understand. Apart from the Old Lady, the Master, and the Mistress, the fourth is you, dear sister. If there were a fifth, I would also swear an oath.” Daiyu said, “There is no need for you to swear—I know well that you hold ‘sister’ in your heart. Yet every time you see ‘elder sister,’ you forget about ‘younger sister.’” Baoyu said, “That is just your over-sensitivity—I am not as you claim.” Daiyu retorted, “Yesterday, when Sister Bao failed to smooth over your lie, why did you question me? If it were me, you would not know what to do!” At that moment, Baochai appeared from the other side, and the two of them slipped away together. Baochai, clearly having seen everything, pretended not to notice and kept her head down as she went over. Later, at Lady Wang’s, she sat for a while, then went to the Lady Dowager’s quarters, where she found Baoyu present. Baochai recalled that in the past, her mother had mentioned, “The Golden Lock was given by a monk; only when one has jade shall marriage be consummated,” so she always kept her distance from Baoyu. Yesterday, when Yuan Chun presented gifts, only he and Baoyu received similar items; this made her feel even more empty inside. Fortunately, Baoyu was entangled with Daiyu, his heart fixed solely on her, and he did not mention this matter.
I’ll have her come.” Grandmother Jia overheard some snippet. She turned to Aunt Xue, “What’s that about?” Baochai explained, and the old lady teased, “Such a good child—he can get your girl to do bits of craft. If you need maids yourself, I have plenty. I love you so, after all.” Aunt Xue and Baochai laughed, saying Yinger was idle anyway. Laughing, they continued on. Soon Xiangyun, Ping’er, Xiangling, and others were spotted plucking balsam flowers among the rocks. That concluded the group’s procession out of the garden. At the second gate, Lady Wang suggested Old Madam rest a moment in her own quarters. The old lady felt a bit tired, so she agreed. Lady Wang sent a maid ahead to set up seats. Meanwhile, Zhao Yiniang feigned illness, so only Aunt Zhou and a few others were on hand to greet them. Once Grandmother Jia was settled, she asked the others what they fancied for dinner, but they insisted on deferring to her. Xifeng swiftly took charge, setting a small table. She also arranged for a portion to be delivered to Baoyu. Presently, they sent Jadecuff (Yu Chuan’er) or Goldthimble (Jin Chuan’er)—some maid, anyway—to carry it. As for Yingchun and Tanchun, only they joined the meal, since Xichun complained of discomfort and Lin Daiyu, half the time, skipped dinners. After a brief repast, everyone parted. The mention of that soup is left at that. In Baoyu’s own quarters, once Xi Ren had served him some fresh bowls of soup, word came that “Two older women from Magistrate Fu’s house are here to pay respects to the Master.” Baoyu realized they must be from Fu Shi, who was a junior official under Jia Zheng. Baoyu ordinarily disliked such visitors, but remembering Fu Shi had a younger sister praised as gifted and attractive—a certain Fu Qiufang—he dreaded offending them by refusing. So he told them to come in. This was because Fu Qiufang, though never met, had garnered Baoyu’s passing admiration. If he rejected them, it might seem he slighted Fu Qiufang. Alas, these two older women turned out to be quite lacking in polish. They mumbled a curt greeting, said hardly two or three words, while Yuchuan (Jadecuff) was present with the soup in hand. Baoyu, half listening to their babble, half taking a meal, tried also to hold out a hand for the soup. In his haste, the bowl was knocked over and splashed his hand. Jadecuff was unscalded, but jumped in alarm. The maids scurried to wipe up. Baoyu, forgetting his own burn, kept asking if Jadecuff was hurt. Jadecuff and everyone else burst into laughter. Jadecuff replied, “You’re the one who’s burned. Why keep asking me?” Only then did Baoyu sense his own hand was scalded. As they tidied up, he gave up on the meal, rinsed his hand, sipped some tea, and exchanged a few more pleasantries with the two women. They took their leave, and the maids saw them off to the marble bridge. Outside the mansion, those two old women soon started gossiping, one of them saying, “No wonder they say Baoyu is outwardly clever but inwardly a bit dull. He scalded himself, yet fussed if she was in pain—what a simpleton!” The other chimed in, “I recall hearing folks at that house say he truly has a foolish streak. He gets caught in a rain and drenched like a wet hen, then runs telling others ‘Oh it’s raining, quick seek shelter!’ Absurd. I hear sometimes when no one is near, he mopes or giggles to himself. He sees swallows and tries talking to them, sees fish in the pond and tries chatting with them, sees stars and the moon and sighs or murmurs. And if something’s precious, he guards it fussily, but if he’s upset, he might fling away thousands in gold. Quite contradictory.” Chattering thus, they left. Back in Baoyu’s rooms, Xi Ren, noticing the visitors gone, returned with Yinger, who inquired, “What cords am I to make?” Baoyu happily said, “I wanted a few new laces, but let’s just do .
Whether older or younger, there’s a certain principle at work. Let’s say, for instance, in the Old Dowager’s quarters—imagine if there were no Girl Yuanyang. How could that work? From Her Ladyship (Madam Wang) on down, no one dares contradict the Dowager’s decisions. But Yuanyang can! And the Dowager listens only to her. The old lady’s jewelry, accessories—others may not recall them, but she does. Without her management, who knows how many swindlers might have made off with half of it by now? And yet Yuanyang is fair-minded; she’ll intervene for people, never abusing her influence.”  Xichun inserted, “That’s what the Old Dowager said just yesterday—that Yuanyang is better than even we are.”  “Yes, she’s a wonderful one,” Ping’er nodded. “There’s no comparing ourselves to her.”  Suddenly Baoyu offered, “Madam Wang’s maid Caixia is quite an honest sort.”  “Honest indeed—,” Tan-chun said. “But she’s got her wits too. Lady Wang is that Buddha-like person who rarely keeps close watch on specifics, so Caixia handles them. She keeps track of absolutely everything: from Master (Jia Zheng) coming or going to each big or small matter. If Lady Wang forgets something, Caixia quietly reminds her.”  “All right, that’s enough,” Li Wan said. Then, pointing at Baoyu, she added, “As for this young master here, if he didn’t have Xi-ren in his rooms, what do you suppose would have become of them? Our Feng-lass is a veritable Xiang Yu, but she needs two mighty arms if she’s to hoist that thousand-jin cauldron. If not for that maid, how could she be so organized?”  Ping’er said, “When Her Ladyship (Second Mistress) got married, four maids came in the dowry, but in the end, one died, another left, so only I remain, a solitary wretch.”  “You’re the lucky one—Feng-lass, too,” said Lady Li. “Don’t you recall? In Master (Lian’s) day, wasn’t there more than you two? None of them was ever satisfied. Look at me— I’m not the sort who’d drive them away, yet day after day they found themselves ill at ease. So once the master died, while I was still young, I turned them all out. If there’d been one who stayed loyally, maybe I’d still have someone to rely on now.”  At the mention of her late husband, she choked up, eyes reddening. Everyone soothed her, “No need to dwell on it—better to have parted ways.” They rose to rinse off their hands, planning to pay respects to the Old Dowager and Lady Wang. Meanwhile, older serving women and younger maids were tidying up the pavilion, gathering up cups and dishes. Xi-ren and Ping’er left together, heading out of the garden. Xi-ren invited Ping’er to come in for some tea, but Ping’er shook her head. “No thanks, maybe next time.” She was just about to head on when Xi-ren called after her:  “Wait—you know, neither the Old Dowager’s place nor Lady Wang’s has given out monthly wages yet this month. Why is that?”  Ping’er paused, glanced around to make sure no one else was within earshot, then whispered, “Don’t let it worry you—it’ll only be delayed a couple of days.”  Xi-ren arched an eyebrow, amused and slightly perplexed. “Why the secrecy? You look on edge.”  Ping’er lowered her voice further. “Here’s the truth: Our mistress has already taken this month’s wages and lent it out at interest. Until she collects from somewhere else, she can’t distribute the pay. But I’m trusting you with this secret because you asked. Don’t mention it to a single soul!”  Xi-ren smiled. “I can’t believe she’s short of money.
Dai Yu herself carefully served a covered bowl of tea on a small tea tray to Grandmother Jia. Madame Wang remarked, “We won’t be having tea—girls, don’t trouble yourself.” Hearing this, Dai Yu ordered a maid to move the chair she usually sat at by the window to the spot in front, and then asked Madame Wang to take a seat. Old Liu noticed that on the small table by the window there were pens and inkstones, and that the bookcase was crammed with books. He said, “Surely this must be that young master’s study?” Grandmother Jia laughed and pointed at Dai Yu, “This is the room of my granddaughter from my other son.” Studying Dai Yu closely, Old Liu finally laughed and said, “How can this possibly be a lady’s embroidery chamber? It is even finer than a top-notch study.”  Grandmother Jia then inquired, “Where is Baoyu?”  The maidservants replied, “He’s on the pond in a boat.”  Grandmother Jia said, “Who has arranged for the boat to be brought in?”  Li Wan quickly answered, “It was just the building staff retrieving it from the upper floor. I was afraid that our old lady’s delight might lead her to have it brought in.”  Just then someone announced, “The Second Madame has arrived.”  As Grandmother Jia and the others rose to greet her, they saw Aunt Xue already had entered. She quickly sat down and smiled, “Seeing how happy our old lady is today, it was only a matter of time before I arrived.” Grandmother Jia laughed, “I was just saying that those who come late should be punished—but who would have thought that you, Aunt, would come late!” After a few playful exchanges, Grandmother Jia, noticing that the gauze on the window was showing its age, said to Madame Wang, “This new gauze is beautifully pasted, but before long it will lose its luster. Besides, there’s neither a peach nor an apricot tree in this courtyard; the bamboo is already so green. To paste green gauze now would be mismatched. I recall that in days past we had four or five different colors for our window screens. Tomorrow, let’s have these replaced.”  Fengjie hastily remarked, “Yesterday, when I was inspecting the storeroom, I saw several bolts of silver-red, cicada-wing gauze in a large chest. There were also gauzes with various patterns of folded chrysanthemums, ones with ‘Flowing Cloud and Bat’ designs, and even some with ‘Hundred Butterflies Among Flowers’ patterns—the colors were vivid and the fabric soft. I hadn’t seen this kind before, so I took two bolts out to make two sets of soft cotton quilts. I’m sure they will be excellent.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Bah! Everyone says you haven’t experienced much—but you can’t even recognize the gauze! And now you’re mouthing off again.” Aunt Xue and the others laughed, “No matter how much experience you have, how can you compare with our old lady? Perhaps she should educate you—let us all hear it.” Fengjie laughed too, “Oh, dear ancestors, please teach me as well.”  Grandmother Jia then explained with a smile to Aunt Xue and the others, “That gauze, even older than you lot, is naturally called ‘cicada-wing gauze’ by those in the know, though many mistake it for such a thing. Its proper name is ‘Soft Misty Silk.’”  Fengjie said, “That name does have a nice ring to it—but I’ve seen hundreds of types of gauze in my long years and have never heard it called that before.”  Grandmother Jia replied with a chuckle, “As you have lived so long and seen so many things, now you start to boast. That ‘Soft Misty Silk’ only comes in four colors: one like the clear blue after a rain, one with the scent of autumn, one pine-green, and one in silver-red. When used for canopies or for window screens, it resembles a wisp of smoke from afar, hence the name ‘Soft Misty Silk.’ The silver-red is also known as ‘Rosy Haze Gauze.’ Nowadays, even the household gauze isn’t as soft, thick, and delicate as this.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Not only has Feng’er not seen it, I myself have never heard of it!” As Fengjie was speaking, she called for someone to bring a bolt.
I don’t know where it came from.”  As Daiyu thought, she recalled that she’d been somewhat indiscreet yesterday when reciting a few lines from The Peony Pavilion and The Story of the Western Wing—and her face flushed red. She then went over to Baochai, hugging her and laughing, “Oh, dear sister, I honestly don’t remember—just careless words. Teach me, and I won’t mention it further.”  Baochai smiled, “I don’t even know myself; I simply found your words so amusing that I wished to ask you.”  Daiyu said, “Oh, dear sister! Please don’t repeat it to others—I won’t say another word!”  Baochai, seeing her face flush bright red and hearing her implore, ceased her questioning. Then, after seating her to have some tea, Baochai began to explain gently, “Who do you think I am? I, too, was once a mischievous child—at the age of seven or eight I was quite the handful. Our family has long been scholars; even our grandfather cherished his collection of books. In earlier days, when many children—brothers and sisters alike—lived together, we were all afraid to look at proper books. Some of the boys loved poetry, while others loved lyrics—the Story of the Western Wing, the Pipa and the Hundred Varieties of Yuan Poems, all sorts of books. They would secretly read them behind our backs, and we would do the same. Later, when the elders found out, they’d beat, scold, burn, and confiscate them. So it’s better that us girls remain illiterate. Even if the men read, they often lack sense—better off without books, not to mention you and I! As for composing poetry or writing, these are not really our duties; indeed, they aren’t even proper for men. When men read to gain wisdom and govern the country, that is praiseworthy. But nowadays, not a single man seems to do so; if he reads, he only becomes worse. It is not that books have spoiled him; rather, he’s squandered them—so it hardly matters whether he reads or not. As for you and me, we should stick to needlework and spinning. Yet we do know a few characters. Once you know the characters, you might as well select a proper book to read—but I fear that encountering miscellaneous texts might change your disposition irretrievably.”  Hearing these words, Daiyu lowered her head while sipping tea, secretly agreeing with nothing more than a single “Yes.”  Just then, Sùyún entered and said, “Our Grandmother wishes to discuss an important matter with you two ladies. Second Sister, Third Sister, Fourth Sister, Miss Shi, and Second Young Master Bao are all waiting.”  Baochai asked, “What is it now?”  Daiyu replied, “We shall know once we get there.”  With that, she and Baochai went toward Dàoxiāng Village, where they found everyone assembled. Li Wan greeted them with a smile, “The society hasn’t yet started, and already there are such carefree fellows—four little maids are claiming a year’s leave!”  Daiyu laughed, “It’s all because of something Grandmother said yesterday—about having someone paint a picture of the garden—which caused him to take leave in delight.”  Tan Chun laughed, “Don’t blame Grandmother; it was all because of Old Liu’s words.”  Daiyu hastily laughed and added, “But indeed, it was his words—what kind of old fellow is he? He might as well be called a ‘mother locust’!”  At this the guests all burst into laughter. Baochai laughed, “In this world, once our Second Sister speaks, everything is settled. Fortunately, she is not well-versed in writing, so it’s all in good fun. And then there’s you, Pín’er, with your shrill tongue—using the methods of the Spring and Autumn Annals, you pick out the crude parts of common speech, prune away the excess, and polish it up. With that one phrase, ‘mother locust,’ you captured all the details of yesterday’s scene. I must say, your wit is remarkably swift!”  Everyone laughed, “Your commentary is nearly as good as theirs!”  Li Wan then said, “I propose that we decide together: how long a leave should we grant him?
At that moment, Xi Ren came in with thread, then someone outside announced, “It’s mealtime.” Yinger insisted Xi Ren and the others go eat, while she kept on twisting cords. Thus Baoyu reclined, content to watch Yinger tying cords while they chatted. He asked her age, her surname. Hearing “Huang,” he joked that it fit well with her name “Oriole (Yinger).” She teased back that her name used to be Jin Ying, “Golden Oriole,” but her mistress shortened it. Baoyu teased: “Our Sister Bao must be very fond of you. When she marries, I bet you’ll go with her.” Yinger only smiled, while Baoyu bantered, “I often tell your older maids that whoever’s fated to have Mistress and her maid both is quite lucky.” Yinger laughed, “Miss has many hidden virtues, but you can’t guess them all.” Baoyu’s curiosity piqued. “Tell me everything.” She lowered her voice: “But promise you won’t let her know I said it.” He swore secrecy, and they chatted on. Just then, they heard someone outside remark: “Why is it so quiet in here?” Turning, they saw it was Baochai herself. Baoyu quickly invited her to sit. She noticed Yinger in mid-lacing. “What’s so interesting about cords?” she mused. “Might as well tie one around your jade.” That reminded Baoyu: “Brilliant suggestion! But which colors would suit my jade best?” Baochai said, “Never pure black or scarlet, or you’ll overshadow the jade’s own color. Better use your gold thread with blackish beads, plait them together for a refined look.” Baoyu was delighted, calling Xi Ren for the gold thread. Just then, Xi Ren came back in, carrying two dishes, puzzling over them: “Strange. Lady Wang had them delivered just to me—by name—and didn’t even call me over to thank her. How odd.” Baochai laughed, “It’s just a small token—why overthink?” Xi Ren sighed, “I’m not used to such direct gifts.” Baochai, half smiling, said, “If this embarrasses you, then just wait. Perhaps you’ll have bigger embarrassments soon.” Xi Ren, recalling Lady Wang’s hints the other day, colored and fell silent. Baoyu, hearing Baochai’s words half-jesting, half-laden with meaning, also felt a tug at his heart. But before he could comment, Baochai left, explaining, “I must go see my brother. I’ll check on you tomorrow. Apply that medication in the evening.”  She walked out, Xi Ren accompanying her to the courtyard, politely giving thanks. Baochai answered, “Remind him not to overthink. If he wants some treat, quietly fetch it from me. Best not alert the others, or trouble might follow.” Then she departed. Inside, Xi Ren said to Baoyu: “If you want anything, do be careful. . . .” But at that moment, word came from Aunt Xing’s side. Two maids arrived bringing fruit for Baoyu, also delivering messages about how the family missed him. Baoyu asked them to stay, chatted briefly, then told Qiuwen to split some fruit to send to “Miss Lin.” She had just taken it when they heard Daiyu’s voice at the door. Baoyu brightened:  “Quick, please invite her in.” What happens next must await the next chapter’s telling. Chapter 36 Embroidered Mandarin Ducks: An Ominous Dream in the Fragrant Pavilion; Recognizing Each Person’s Destiny, Baoyu Awakens to Truth in the Pear-Scented Lodge  When Grandmother Jia returned from Lady Wang’s quarters and saw that Baoyu was improving day by day, she was quite pleased. Lest Jia Zheng again summon Baoyu, she called in the head page who served Jia Zheng and instructed him:  “If there’s any guest or matter requiring someone to accompany your master, and he calls for Baoyu, do not come relaying that summons.
She discreetly signaled Fengjie. Just as Fengjie was about to deal, she deliberately hesitated for a few moments and joked, “I swear that card is already hidden in Aunt Xue’s hand—if I don’t play it, I won’t be able to catch up!” Aunt Xue interjected, “But I don’t have that card in my hand.”  Fengjie replied, “I’ll check when I get back.”  Aunt Xue said, “You go ahead and check; deal the card so I can see what it is.”  Fengjie then passed the card to Aunt Xue; upon seeing it was a two, Aunt Xue laughed, “I wouldn’t have minded it—but I’m worried Grandmother’s hand is already full.”  Fengjie quickly laughed, “I must have dealt it wrongly!”  Grandmother, laughing heartily, threw her cards down and said, “Don’t you dare take it back! Who told you to make such a mistake?”  Fengjie replied, “But I was just trying to divine! I can’t help it.”  Grandmother laughed, “You’re the one who’s always flapping your gums, asking your own questions.” Then she turned to Aunt Xue and said, “I’m not stingy about money—I merely like a good omen.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “We’re not thinking that way at all—who in their right mind would say Grandmother loves money?”  Fengjie, counting her money, heard this and hurriedly fastened her coins back together, smiling at everyone, “That’s enough for me! I don’t even care about winning money; I just love a good omen. I’m such a miser that whenever I lose, I count my money—now put it away.”  Grandmother explained that by custom Yuan Yang was to reshuffle the cards and joked with Aunt Xue. But Yuan Yang did not move a muscle. Grandmother said, “Why are you upset? Not even the cards are being washed?” Yuan Yang picked up the cards and laughed, “Grandmother, are you not giving money?”  Grandmother replied, “If she doesn’t give money, then she’s truly out of luck.” She then ordered a little maid, “Fetch all the coins from that pouch!” The maid obeyed and placed the coins beside Grandmother. Fengjie laughed, “Reward me, then, by counting them all out!”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Surely, Fengjie, you’re being petty—but it’s all just for fun.”  Fengjie said, “If they won’t even let me have my due, then put the coins in Grandmother’s box. Let the coins be gathered all at once so that we don’t have to fuss twice—and let the money in the box be spent properly.”  Grandmother laughed so heartily that she nearly dropped her cards. She then pushed Yuan Yang and commanded, “Quickly, rip his mouth off!”  Following the order, Ping’er put down her coins and, after laughing briefly, returned. At the courtyard gate, she met Jia Lian, who asked, “Where is Madam? Lord Jia ordered me to invite her.”  Ping’er smiled and said, “She’s been standing with Grandmother for half a day and hasn’t moved. Let’s hurry up before it’s too late. Grandmother’s temper has softened a bit after Second Madam cheered her up.”  Jia Lian said, “I’ll go over—just to ask Grandmother whether the fourteen-year-old is coming out; we must get the sedan ready. And I’ve also invited Madam; wouldn’t that be fine?”  Ping’er replied, “I think you’d better not go. With both Madam and Bao Yu already in trouble, if you add to it, you’ll just be setting yourself up.”  Jia Lian retorted, “It’s all settled—can’t you see? Besides, it has nothing to do with me. Moreover, Lord Jia himself instructed me to invite Madam.
Originally, when this garden was built, there was a detailed design, even if executed freehand, the scale and proportions were correct. If you and Madame Wang step out and compare that design with a piece of heavy silk from Sister Feng, have the gentry outside make a draft according to that pattern, adding figures as needed, it will be acceptable. Of course, if you want to add the green hues and even embellish with gold and silver paste, they will have to be added. You’ll also need a furnace for preparing glue, extra glue, and brushes to wash. You must have a large table for grinding pigments, laid out with felt. Many of your small dishes are missing, and so are your brushes—start anew with a complete set.”  Xīchūn said, “I’ve never owned such painting implements; I only use what’s at hand. And as for pigments, I only have ocher, Guanghua, vine yellow, and rouge—only two brushes for coloring, at most.”  Baochai said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? I still have some of these things, though you need not use them; I’ll keep them for you until you require them. They’re only good for painting fans anyway—painting a large-scale work would be a pity. Today, I’ll draft an inventory and send it to Grandmother. You may not know everything, so I’ll have Brother Bao write it down.”  Baoyu had already prepared his brush and inkstone, fearing he might forget, so he began to note down the list as Baochai spoke. Baochai recited:    “First set: four fine brushes; second set: four fine brushes; third set: four fine brushes; four large dye brushes; four medium dye brushes; four small dye brushes; ten large ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten small ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten whisker brushes; twenty large coloring brushes; twenty small coloring brushes; ten surface brushes; twenty willow-twig brushes; four taels of vermilion arrowheads; four taels of southern ochre; four taels of stone yellow; four taels of stone blue; four taels of stone green; four taels of tube yellow; eight taels of Guanghua; fourteen boxes of lead powder; twelve packets of rouge; two hundred packets of great scarlet; two hundred packets of lapis lazuli; fourteen taels of Guangyun glue; four taels of purified alum. The glue and alum for silk remain separate—just hand over the silk and have them process it. With these colors, after sorting and mixing, you’ll have enough for a lifetime. In addition, you’ll need four fine silk baskets, two coarse baskets, four carrying brushes, four small and large porcelain basins, twenty large coarse bowls, ten five-inch dishes, twenty three-inch coarse white dishes, two wind furnaces, four sand pots of various sizes, two new porcelain jars, two new water buckets, four one-foot-long white cloth bags, twenty jin of floating charcoal, one or two jin of willow charcoal, one three-tier wooden box, one yard of real gauze, two taels of ginger, and half a jin of sauce.”  Daiyu interjected with a laugh, “And an iron pot and an iron spatula!”  Baochai asked, “What’s that for?”  Daiyu replied, “If you need ginger and sauce for the pigments, I’ll get you an iron pot to fry them—so you can cook the pigments properly.”  The assembled guests laughed. Baochai laughed, “Pín’er, you do know that a coarse porcelain dish will not withstand being fired without first being treated with ginger juice and sauce on its base—once it’s fired, it will crack.”  Hearing this, everyone agreed, “That’s exactly it.”  Daiyu glanced at the list once more, then quietly whispered to Tan Chun, “Look at that—painting a picture requires so many water jars and boxes. It seems he has mistakenly copied his dowry list as well.”  Tan Chun laughed heartily and said, “Sister Bao, will you not twist his little mouth? Ask him what he meant by those words.”  Baochai laughed, “No need—‘can there be ivory in a dog’s mouth?’”  Saying this, she strode over and playfully grabbed Daiyu, intending to pinch her cheek.
Even you must kneel to me. What is there to do?” Xi Ren’s own eyes brimmed with tears. Qingwen, too, had been crying, on the verge of speaking, when Daiyu entered. Startled, Qingwen slipped out. Daiyu, smiling faintly, asked: “Why such tears on a festive day? Are you quarreling over who gets to eat the biggest dumpling?” Baoyu and Xi Ren, forced to laugh, tried to compose themselves. Daiyu teased Xi Ren: “Oh, dear sister-in-law—tell me, did you two have a couple’s spat? Let me mediate.” Xi Ren, blushing, waved her off: “Don’t joke, Miss. We’re only servants.” Daiyu responded with a grin, “But you are my sister-in-law, as I see it.” Baoyu interjected, “Now let’s not provoke talk. If folks overhear, it’ll cause more trouble for her.”  Xi Ren smiled, “Aye, if I truly offended you, let me die and be done.” Daiyu mock-sobbed, “If you died, I’d cry my own life away.” Baoyu added with a laugh, “If you died, I’d become a monk.” Xi Ren exclaimed, “That’s enough now!” Daiyu feigned annoyance, “Ah yes, you said that about me as well—how many times do you plan to become a monk?” She wiggled two fingers. Baoyu realized she was reminding him of his earlier vow and, feeling awkward, hastily changed the subject. Daiyu giggled, letting the matter drop, then left as well. Soon a servant announced, “Young Master Xue invites you.” Baoyu had no choice but to go, drinking with Xue Pan until evening. Returning with some drink in him, he headed to his courtyard. In the yard, stands and mats were arranged for fresh air, but on the main couch lay a person, apparently sleeping. Baoyu assumed it was Xi Ren and sat on the edge, patting her:  “Is your pain better now?” Startled, the person turned—Qingwen. “Hmph! Why are you bothering me?” Baoyu recognized her and, pulling her up, smiled: “How aloof you’ve grown! This morning you only broke a fan, I teased you a little, and you started talking about leaving. And you even snapped at Xi Ren, who was only trying to help. Was that fair?”  Qingwen responded, “It’s too hot for you to be grabbing me like this. Others might see. I’m just a maid, not worthy of sharing your couch.” Baoyu laughed, “If you knew it wasn’t your place, then why were you napping here?” Qingwen hesitated, then let out a giggle: “True enough. I’ll go wash up. Xi Ren and the others have all bathed; I must do the same. Let me fetch them.” Baoyu grinned, “I’ve had a fair bit to drink, so I’d like a wash as well. Why don’t we share water?” She smirked, “No, thanks. I recall how you once bathed for hours, flooding the floor! I’ll bring you water for your face, and get you some fruit from the crystal bowl.” Baoyu responded, “Fine. If you’re not bathing, at least wash your hands and peel me some fruit.” Qingwen laughed, “I’m a clumsy fool—just look how I snapped that fan. If I broke a plate or something, you’d scold me. Better not risk it.” Baoyu rejoined, “Don’t be silly. All these items are merely borrowed from the world. If you enjoy ripping a fan to hear the sound, so be it—just don’t do it in a rage. If you delight in the crash of porcelain, you might even break a dish. Just not from anger. That’s real cherishing: using them how you like.” Encouraged, Qingwen teased, “Is that so? Then hand me a fan to rip, so I can relish the sound!” Baoyu, in high spirits, offered her a fan.
Such lawlessness! Why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Hit him, scold him, and let him amend his ways. Expelling him outright is unthinkable since he is not our own son. He is merely the attendant of the madams; if we expel him, the madams’ honor will suffer. I say, let Grandmother teach him a lesson with a few lashes; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never near the wine again.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt again and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai then instructed, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I’ll have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt once more before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse consented as they escorted them away. Later, Li Wan and the others returned to the garden. That evening, Fengjie had many old, well-used painting tools brought out and delivered to the garden. Baochai and the others selected what they needed; of the assorted items, only half were usable. An inventory was drawn up for Fengjie to purchase the missing supplies—but we need not go into further detail. One day, word arrived that the dye for the silk and the preliminary sketches had been delivered. Bao Yu would assist Xiuchun with the work, while Tan Chun, Li Wan, Yingchun, Baochai, and the others would gather there—first to admire the paintings, and then to have their meetings. Noticing the cool weather and the lengthening nights, Baochai went to Grandmother Jia’s room to discuss arranging some needlework. By day she visited Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang twice, inevitably sitting with them. In the garden, the sisters would occasionally chat as well. Thus, during the day there was little free time, and by night the girls worked under the lamplight until around the third watch. Every year after the spring and autumn equinoxes, Daiyu’s old illness would flare up—and this autumn, having spent extra time with Grandmother, she felt overtaxed; she soon began coughing again, feeling worse than before. Consequently, she rarely left her room and confined herself to recuperation. Sometimes, feeling isolated, she longed for a sister’s company—but when Baochai and the others visited and exchanged a few words, she would soon tire of conversation. Everyone, aware of her delicate condition, forgave her for her curt receptions and lax manners. That day, Baochai visited Daiyu and broached the subject of her illness. Baochai said, “The doctors we’ve seen are fine, but the medicines you take never seem to work. Perhaps we should invite a master physician to examine you. If your illness were cured, wouldn’t that be wonderful? Every year you suffer through spring and summer—though you’re neither old nor young, it is simply not right.”  Daiyu replied, “It is hopeless. I know my illness is incurable. And besides, judging by how I appear at my best, one can see…”  Baochai nodded, “Exactly. The ancients said, ‘He who eats grain lives,’ but your diet fails to nourish your vital energy and blood—this is not good.”  Daiyu sighed, “‘Life and death are decreed by fate; wealth and honor belong to heaven.’ It cannot be forced by human effort. This year, I feel even worse than in previous years.” As she spoke, she coughed two or three times. Baochai said, “Yesterday I noticed that your prescription had too much ginseng and cinnamon. Although they boost energy and supplement the spirit, they should not be overly warming. In my opinion, we must first calm your liver and nourish your stomach. When the liver fire is subdued, it can no longer overcome the earth, and with your stomach at ease, your food will naturally restore you. Every morning, have a little top-grade bird’s nest—say, one tael—and five qian of rock sugar, and cook a porridge in a silver pot. Once accustomed to it, it is even more effective than medicine—it nourishes yin and replenishes qi.”  Daiyu sighed, “You always treat others so kindly—but I sometimes suspect you hide ulterior motives.
Today, we even have an unwitting guest of the opposite sex to tease!”  Li Wan, ever the sensible one, said, “You’re not doing any good mischief. He isn’t a child—be careful what the old lady says!”  Yuan Yang laughed, “It doesn’t concern our dear eldest sister; with me here, it’s all in fun.”  As they spoke, Grandmother Jia and the others arrived and sat down as they pleased. First, the maidservants brought in tea one by one. After the meal, Fengjie, holding a Western-style cloth handkerchief and carrying a set of ebony chopsticks inlaid with silver in a three-piece pattern, began to arrange the place settings. Grandmother Jia then said, “Have that small nanmu table brought over so that our honored guest, Liu, may sit near me.” On hearing this, everyone hastily carried the table over. Fengjie shot a conspiratorial glance at Yuan Yang, who quickly pulled Old Liu away and whispered a few words to him. “This is our family’s custom—if you slip up, we will all tease you about it.” Once the arrangements were complete, everyone resumed their seats. Aunt Xue, who had finished her meal earlier, did not eat again but sat aside sipping tea. Grandmother Jia’s table was occupied by Baoyu, Xiangyun, Dai Yu, and Baochai, while Madame Wang’s table had Yingchun and the two other sisters. Old Liu sat next to Grandmother Jia. Usually when Grandmother Jia dines, a few maidservants are at hand with basin, tail-end duster, and handkerchiefs; but today Yuan Yang was not assigned that task—instead she purposely handed over her tail-end duster to brush Old Liu. The maidservants, knowing he was about to be the subject of some teasing, moved aside to let him be. All the while, Yuan Yang kept signaling to him with glances. Once Old Liu had seated himself, he picked up his chopsticks; they felt heavy in his hands. It turned out that Fengjie and Yuan Yang had secretly arranged for him to be given a pair of four-edged, elephant-ivory chopsticks inlaid with gold—designed especially for an elder. When Old Liu saw them, he exclaimed, “These fork-like chopsticks are even heavier than the iron spades we use back home—how on earth can I manage them?” His remark sent everyone into peals of laughter. Just then, a young wife stepped forward with a box. A maid lifted the lid to reveal two bowls of dishes. Li Wan took one and placed it on Grandmother Jia’s table, while Fengjie selected a bowl of pigeon eggs and set it on Old Liu’s table. When Grandmother Jia said “please,” Old Liu rose and in a loud voice declared, “Old Liu! Old Liu! I have an appetite as big as a bull—if I were a sows, I’d never lift my head!” He puffed out his cheeks and fixed everyone with a stern look, remaining silent thereafter. For a moment everyone was taken aback, but then, thinking it over, all burst into hearty laughter. Xiangyun lost control and spurted a mouthful of tea, Dai Yu laughed so hard she gasped and clutched the table crying “Oh dear!” Baoyu rolled into Grandmother Jia’s arms as she laughed and exclaimed, “My precious!” Madame Wang laughed, pointing at Fengjie but at a loss for words. Even Aunt Xue couldn’t hold back—her tea sprayed all over Tan Chun’s skirt. Tan Chun’s teacup even toppled onto Yingchun. Xi Chun left her seat and tugged at her nanny saying, “Rub my belly!” On the floor, some guests bent low in laughter, some slipped out to squat and chuckle, and others held back their laughter so as to help their sisters change outfits. Only Fengjie and Yuan Yang continued to supervise the teasing—always ensuring Old Liu was the butt of the joke. Taking up his chopsticks again, Old Liu felt he was no longer in command and said, “The chickens here are so handsome, and their eggs so delicate—remarkably fine indeed. I must have one!” The laughter ceased for a moment, only to resume as soon as his words were heard. Grandmother Jia laughed until tears welled in her eyes, even while Hu Po patted her back.
What nonsense! Baoyu now lives in the garden with all his attendants, and yet you come here delivering messages?” Bei Ming laughed, “You’re scolding me—now I’m confused!” and hurried off toward the east gate. By chance, a group of servants were playing soccer beneath the corridor; Bei Ming explained the matter to one, and after a short while a small servant ran in, and after a while returned carrying a bundle, which he handed to Bei Ming. Returning to the study, Baoyu changed his clothes and ordered the horses to be prepared. He then, accompanied only by Bei Ming, Chuyao, Shuangrui, and Shou’er—four little servants—set off. They arrived at the gate of Feng Ziying’s residence, where someone announced to Feng Ziying, who came out to greet them. It turned out that Xue Baochai (or Xue Bo) had already been waiting there for a long time, along with many singing-servant boys and “Jiang Yuhan,” a singing boy from Jinxiang Court, and Yun’er, a courtesan from Jinxiang Court. After exchanging greetings, they sat down for tea. Baoyu, holding a cup of tea aloft with a smile, said, “Ever since the matter of ‘fortune and misfortune’ was mentioned, I have dwelt on it day and night. Today, when I heard my name called, I came immediately.” Feng Ziying laughed, “Our esteemed cousin is truly sincere. The other day, I merely made an excuse to invite you all for a drink, fearing you would decline; who would have thought you all believed me so earnestly?” With that, everyone laughed. Then the wine was served, and all were seated. Feng Ziying first summoned the singing-servant boys to bring wine, then called Yun’er over to offer three toasts. After three cups, Xue Pan, now in high spirits, grabbed Yun’er’s hand and laughed, “Sing me your newest fresh tune; I’ll drink a whole jar, alright?” Yun’er, laughing, picked up her pipa and began to sing:    “Two foes, hard to part,   Thinking of you, my heart won’t rest. Two figures, so handsome, defy description;   Last night, in secret, we pledged our love beneath the withering blooms. One in stealth, one in pursuit—   Captured before the Three Officials, I had no reply.”  After singing, she laughed, “Just have a jarful!” Xue Pan, upon hearing this, chuckled, “Not worth a jar—sing something even better.” Baoyu then laughed and said, “Listen to me: with such reckless drinking, one becomes easily intoxicated and loses all sense. I’ll drink a vast ocean’s worth, and decree a new rule: whoever does not obey shall be fined ten large cups and expelled from the gathering.” Feng Ziying and Jiang Yuhan and the others agreed, “Agreed, agreed!” Baoyu then picked up his cup, drank it in one gulp, and said, “Now, if we must speak of ‘sorrow,’ ‘melancholy,’ ‘joy,’ and ‘delight,’ we must also explain the origin of these four feelings. After speaking, we shall drink a cup. The surface of the wine should be accompanied by a fresh song; beneath the wine, there should be something lively—perhaps an ancient poem, a couplet, passages from the Four Books or the Five Classics, or an idiom.” Before Xue Pan could finish, he stood up and interjected, “I won’t be part of it; don’t count me in. Is this some sort of prank?” Yun’er also stood, shoving him back down with a laugh, “What’s the matter? Aren’t you used to drinking every day? Or is it that you’re not even as good as I am? I’ll speak up when I return. If you can’t say it out loud, you’ll be fined a few more cups, and then you’ll be drunk to death!” Everyone clapped and exclaimed, “Splendid!” Xue Pan, finding no escape, sat down. Then Baoyu began: “Daughter, sorrow—youth is spent in lonely seclusion. Daughter, melancholy—regret for urging a husband to seek a noble title.
They hired caretakers to supply incense and stoke the fires. But many years have passed. The family died off; the shrine fell to ruin; the statue all but decayed… folks claim it’s turned into a spirit.”  “No, not a spirit,” Baoyu corrected. “Certainly such a person can’t truly die.”  Old Mrs. Liu invoked the Buddha: “So that’s how it is? We took it for a ghost. Folks say she roams around at night sometimes, and some want to smash her with mallets.”  Baoyu gasped, “They mustn’t! Leveling that shrine would be a grievous sin!”  “Your word, Master, sets me straight,” the old woman said. “Once I’m back, I’ll hold them off.”  Baoyu enthusiastically went on, “In fact, our Old Ancestress, our Lady, and everyone here are devout. We love building shrines and erecting images. Tomorrow I’ll write a donation request, so you can gather funds to rebuild that shrine and repair the statue, paying a caretaker to burn incense monthly. How’s that?”  “Well, thanks to that young lady, I’d get some funds for myself, too,” Old Mrs. Liu chuckled. Baoyu asked about the location and distance, which the old woman just made up. He took it at face value. That night, he weighed plans thoroughly, and by next morning sought out Huaijing^4, gave him a few hundred copper coins, and sent him forth in search of the location. “Bring me news, and I’ll decide on the next step.”  But as evening neared, Baoyu grew anxious. Finally at sunset, Huaijing returned triumphant. “Master, you explained it poorly. I spent the whole day trudging about, for the place names you gave me didn’t match anywhere. Finally, near the northeast corner, by some farmland ridges, I came across a battered shrine. That must be it.”  Excited, Baoyu pressed, “Good! The old woman’s memory might have been off. So, go on—did you find the statue?”  “Indeed, the shrine faces south and is indeed falling apart. I was tired and cross but decided to look inside. The statue nearly frightened me off. It looked so lifelike.”  “You see?” Baoyu cried. “It does have supernatural power and transforms into human form sometimes.”  Huaijing slapped his knees. “Human form? Master, it was no girl’s effigy at all— just a green-faced, red-haired plague deity!”  Baoyu spat in frustration, “Useless dolt, can’t handle even this simple business. Off you go, useless scum!”  “It’s not me who’s muddled,” retorted Huaijing. “You must have gleaned nonsense from some book or idle talk and believed it. So you sent me on a fool’s errand. Now you blame me—what’s it got to do with my competence?”  Seeing him offended, Baoyu softened his tone. “Calm down, no need to argue. Another day, when you’re free, look again. If it’s a hoax, that’s that. But if indeed there’s something real, and you can help preserve it, you’d earn some spiritual merit. I’ll reward you handsomely.”  He was still speaking when a page from the second gate appeared: “The maids from the Old Dowager’s quarters are waiting by the gate— they want to see the young master.”  For what reason, we must hear in the next chapter. Chapter 40 Madam Shi’s Two Banquets in the Grand View Garden; The Golden Mandarin Ducks Announce the Orders for the Insignia  It was said that upon hearing this, Baoyu hurried in to see what was going on. He found Hu Po standing by a folding screen saying, “Hurry along—I've been waiting for you to speak.” When Baoyu entered the upstairs room, he saw Grandmother Jia, together with Madame Wang and the other ladies, discussing how to invite Shi Xiangyun to rejoin the banquet. Baoyu then remarked, “I have an idea: since no outsiders are present and we haven’t fixed a set menu for the food, why not let everyone choose a few of their favorite dishes?
Dejected and dispirited, she went back to her room and lay down. Everyone said she simply wasn’t feeling well, and they did not press the matter further. The next day turned out to be the birthday of Madame Wang Zi Teng. Originally, someone had been sent to invite both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, but when Lady Wang saw that the Lady Dowager was not going, she too found it awkward to go. In the end, however, Aunt Xue accompanied Feng Jie along with three of the Jia sisters—Baochai and Baoyu—to attend, and they did not return until late in the evening. Lady Wang was sitting in Aunt Xue’s courtyard when she saw Jia Huan coming down from his studies; she ordered him to go copy and recite the “Diamond Sutra Mantra.” So Jia Huan went to sit on Lady Wang’s kang, and someone was ordered to light a candle as he began to copy the sutra with a pompous air. In a while, she also called for Cai Yun to pour tea, and later for Yu Chuan to trim wax flowers, complaining that Jin Chuan was blocking the light. The other maids, who were long tired of his airs, ignored him. Only Cai Xia still got along with him—she poured tea for him and whispered, “Just behave yourself; why must you be so annoying?” Jia Huan looked at her and said, “I know, so don’t try to coax me. Now that you’re so close to Baoyu, ignoring me, I can tell what’s going on.” Cai Yun, clenching her teeth, poked him on the head and said, “You ungrateful wretch—like a dog biting Lü Dongbin, you just don’t appreciate good fortune!”  While they were bantering, Feng Jie arrived with Lady Wang. Lady Wang then asked Jia Huan in a measured tone about which of the guests had come that day, how the play was, and how the banquet had fared. Not long after, Baoyu also arrived. Seeing Lady Wang, he courteously exchanged a few words, then was ordered to have his head shaved and his robe removed, to have his boots taken off—and before long he collapsed into Lady Wang’s arms. Lady Wang began fondly caressing his hands and face, while Baoyu clung to her neck, chattering on. Lady Wang remarked, “My dear son, you’ve had too much to drink—your face is all hot. You’re just fidgeting and will soon get even more drunk! Why don’t you lie quietly for a while?” At that, she had someone bring him a pillow. Baoyu then collapsed right behind her, and he called for Cai Xia to pat him. Baoyu laughed and joked with Cai Xia, but she responded only briefly, her eyes fixed on Jia Huan. Baoyu grabbed her hand and said, “Dear sister, why don’t you pay attention to me too?” As he spoke and tugged at her hand, Cai Xia refused to give in, saying, “Keep this up and I’ll cry out!” At that moment, Jia Huan, who had long harbored a grudge against Baoyu, now seeing him frolicking with Cai Xia, felt his resentment rise even further. Lost in thought, he schemed and deliberately pretended to mishandle things; he clumsily pushed a bright, oozing wax candle straight onto Baoyu’s face. A startled “Ai-yo!” rang out from Baoyu, and everyone in the room was shocked. Hastily, someone brought a lamp from the floor to shine on him; they saw that Baoyu’s face was smeared with wax. Lady Wang, both angry and anxious, ordered that Baoyu be washed immediately while cursing Jia Huan. Feng Jie rushed onto the kang in a few quick strides to help tidy up Baoyu, exclaiming, “That little runt is still as clumsy as ever! I told you, you shouldn’t be put on display! Even Aunt Zhao should teach him proper behavior!” This remark reminded Lady Wang, who then called Aunt Zhao over and scolded, “To raise such an unfeeling child without proper discipline—how many times must I warn you? When you get carried away, you let him run wild!” Aunt Zhao had no choice but to swallow her anger and help clean Baoyu. They soon noticed that a row of blisters had appeared along the left side of his face, fortunately not near his eyes.
She, eager to host a gathering, said, “Let me treat you all.” They teased about finances, as her family might object. Baochai suggested a better approach: hold a general gathering with crabs and wine in the garden, letting the older generation join for a feast under the flowers. Then after the seniors leave, they can remain for verse— thus no undue burden. Xiangyun found it perfect. That night in Baochai’s suite, the two of them laid out the plan: they would focus on “chrysanthemums,” but to avoid clichés, they devised a set of twelve two-character topics all containing the word “chrysanthemum”— from “Remembering Chrysanthemums” to “Visiting Chrysanthemums,” “Asking Chrysanthemums,” “Chrysanthemum Shadows,” “Chrysanthemum Dreams,” down to “Faded Chrysanthemums.” They decided not to fix a single rhyme but let each participant choose. Then they parted for bed, awaiting the next day’s event. Chapter 38 Lin Xiaoxiang Takes First Place in the Chrysanthemum Verse Xue Héngwú Engages in Crab Odes With a Hint of Satire  That night, after Baochai and Xiangyun finished their discussion, nothing more was said. Early the next day, Xiangyun then invited Grandmother Jia and the others to view the blooming osmanthus (cassia) blossoms. Grandmother Jia and all responded, “It seems she’s in the mood—well, we’d better not spoil her elegant plan.” By noon, indeed, Grandmother Jia, along with Lady Wang, Wang Xifeng, and having also invited Aunt Xue, entered the Garden. Grandmother Jia asked, “Which spot is best?” Lady Wang replied, “Wherever you prefer, we’ll go there.” Wang Xifeng said, “The Lotus-Fragrance Pavilion is already set up. There’s a pair of osmanthus trees on the slope in full bloom; the water in the river is crystal clear, and the pavilion sits in the middle of the water—so bright and open. Glancing at the water is so refreshing to the eyes.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia said, “That is fine.”  Saying so, she led the party to the Lotus-Fragrance Pavilion. Now, the Lotus-Fragrance Pavilion stands in the middle of the pond, windows open on all four sides, flanked by winding corridors crossing water on one side and meeting rockwork on the other, with a meandering bridge at the rear. The group went up the bamboo footbridge. Wang Xifeng hastened forward to support Grandmother Jia, saying with a smile, “Old Ancestress, take bigger steps, no harm done. Bamboo bridges always creak a bit.”  Before long they entered the pavilion. Outside the railings stood two bamboo tables: one laid with wine cups, chopsticks, and serving implements; the other arranged for tea, with whisks and cups. Several maids fanned a brazier for brewing tea on one side, while on the other side more maids were heating wine. Grandmother Jia smiled approvingly, “A thoughtful tea arrangement—clean and well-set in a suitable location.” Xiangyun laughed, “It’s all thanks to Sister Bao’s help in preparing.” Grandmother Jia said, “I knew that child is meticulous—every matter thoroughly arranged.” As she spoke, she also noticed a pair of black-lacquer inlaid panels with an inscription on the pillars. She instructed Xiangyun to read them:  “Lotus bloom’s reflection breaks as the orchid boat returns, The fragrance of water-caltrops and lotus roots drifts deep, beneath the bamboo bridge.” Having listened, Grandmother Jia again lifted her head to read the hanging plaque overhead, then turned toward Aunt Xue, saying:  “In my younger years at home, we also had a waterside pavilion called something like ‘the Pillow of Rosy Clouds.’ I was about the age of these girls, playing there every day with a few companions. One day I slipped, nearly drowned—took a great effort to be rescued. I ended up hitting my head on a wooden peg and cut it open. Even now, if you look at the hair whorl above my forehead, there’s a pit the size of a fingertip—that’s where I was hurt.
Then I wouldn’t hear or see . . . .” Alarmed, Baoyu covered her mouth:  “Stop—stop saying that.” Yet Baoyu’s contradictory mind was drawn by her direct sincerity. He apologized softly, and Xi Ren changed the topic, speaking of romantic trifles and ladies’ charms. Then they veered into talk of how maids might nobly die. Xi Ren realized she’d gone too far, so she quickly shut up. Baoyu lay turning over the possibilities. One day, Baoyu got bored wandering the same spots in the garden, so he recalled a scene from The Peony Pavilion and yearned to read it again. But even reading it twice didn’t satisfy him. He’d heard that among the twelve budding actresses in the Pear-Fragrance Lodge, a girl named Ling Guan was the best at singing. He slipped out of the corner gate to find them. Encountering some young performers—Kui Guan and Yao Guan—he asked, “Where’s Ling Guan?” They said, “She’s in her room.” He hurried to see her. She lay on a pillow, barely turning at his arrival. Having always jested easily with the other maids, Baoyu approached with a grin: “Sister, do sing the Nieao Qing Si number (the Peony Pavilion snippet).” But Ling Guan just got up and stiffly said, “My throat is hoarse. The other day, I was supposed to sing for Her Highness, and I still can’t. Why come ask me?” This left Baoyu red-faced, not used to being brushed off. He retreated. The other girls suggested, “Wait for Master Qiang (Jia Qiang). If he wants it, she’ll do it.” Baoyu asked, “Is Qiang out?” “Yes, presumably Ling Guan needed something, so he’s off to procure it.”  Soon, Jia Qiang arrived with a birdcage. He had a fancy mincing bird that performed little stunts in a model stage inside the cage. He came in, saw Baoyu, politely greeted him, and approached Ling Guan:  “Look, a new toy for you—this finch will amuse you so you won’t be bored.” But Ling Guan gave him only a frosty laugh:  “Your family tears us from our normal lives, caging us in here to learn these worthless songs, and now you bring me a caged bird for further mockery? I want none of it.” Jia Qiang tried pledging innocence, but seeing her unwavering hostility, he ended up dismantling the cage and freeing the bird. Then she moaned that she’d coughed blood, and no one truly cared for her. Jia Qiang nervously insisted he had asked a doctor who said it was minor, but she dismissed him. Baoyu, witnessing their exchange, realized that the one painting “蔷” in the rose arbor was precisely Ling Guan, so he quietly left. Jia Qiang, too absorbed with Ling Guan, paid him no mind. Baoyu returned to his room, quite shaken. Understanding now the significance of “蔷,” he felt a new pang. Arriving at the Garden, he found Lin Daiyu and Xi Ren conversing. The moment he stepped in, he exclaimed:  “Last night I said something flawed, no wonder Father calls me ignorant and shallow. I spoke of wanting only your tears to bury me, but I realize now, that was foolish. I see I cannot have them all. Everyone will have their own tears for their own destinies.” Xi Ren, recalling his earlier talk, merely said with a laugh, “You truly are half-crazed.” Baoyu fell silent, pondering how each personal bond might be foreordained, gloomily wondering, “In the end, who shall weep for me upon my grave?”  Seeing Baoyu in such a mystic mood, Daiyu guessed he had confronted yet another heartbreak but asked no details. She only said, “I was just at Aunt Wang’s, who said tomorrow is Aunt Xue’s birthday. Are you going or not? She told me to ask if you’ll send word in advance.” Baoyu replied, “I refused to attend even Uncle’s birthday last time, how can I go to Aunt Xue’s? Suppose I run into some official or dignitary—my father might hear.
She then fetched a large cauldron containing three or four handfuls of lily incense, and covered him with a lid. Fortunately, he did not vomit. Quietly, she smiled and said, “Never mind—I'm here. Come with me.”  Old Liu agreed and followed her out to the little maids’ room. She had him sit down and then instructed him, “Just say, ‘I fell asleep on the rocks and took a little nap’ and that’s that.”  Old Liu replied, “Yes.” Then she served him two bowls of tea, and he slowly felt the alcohol wear off. Looking around, he asked, “Whose embroidered room is this? It is so exquisite—I feel as though I have entered the palace of heaven.”  Xiǎo Yín smiled faintly, “That, sir, is actually the bedroom of Second Young Master Bao.”  Old Liu was so startled he dared not utter another word. Xiǎo Yín then led him out to where the others were waiting, and simply said, “He was sleeping on the grass; I brought him here.” The guests paid him little heed and that was that. Soon Grandmother Jia awoke and began to set the evening meal in the Dàoxiāng Village. Feeling rather languid, she did not eat but instead sat on a bamboo chair in a light open sedan and returned to her room to rest, instructing Fengjie and the others to dine. Her daughters soon returned to the garden. For reasons now unknown, we shall continue the tale in the next chapter. Chapter 42 Lord Héngwú’s Refined Explanations Dispelling Oddities; Master Xiāoxiāng’s Elegant Jests Filling in the Remaining Notes  After Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang had departed, the sisters returned to the garden for a meal. Old Liu, accompanied by Ban’er, went first to see Fengjie and said, “Tomorrow morning I must head home. Though I’ve only stayed a couple of days, these few days have been filled with experiences—tasting, seeing, and hearing things I never knew existed. I’m truly grateful that Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue, and all the young ladies—even the maidservants in each household—have so kindly cared for an old man like me. When I go, I have nothing else to repay them but to offer high incense and recite Buddhist sutras for you every day, praying that you all live to a hundred. That will be enough compensation for my heart.”  Fengjie laughed and replied, “Don’t flatter yourself—all this is done for you. Even Grandmother’s been affected by the wind, lying there complaining of discomfort; and our eldest sister has caught a chill and is running a fever.”  Old Liu sighed and said, “Grandmother is advanced in years and cannot bear excessive exertion.”  Fengjie continued, “She’s never been as happy as yesterday. Usually when we stroll in the garden we only sit in one or two places, but yesterday—because you were here—they made sure to tour the entire garden; nearly half the grounds were covered. And our eldest sister, since I sent for you, received a cake from Madame Wang—but who would have thought that eating it out in the open would give her a fever?”  Old Liu remarked, “I fear our eldest sister won’t venture far into the garden. Unlike our children—who, in a moment, might run off to some graveyard—first, the wind might unsettle them, and second, if they remain too neat and proper, they may even encounter a spirit. In my opinion, we should have her view a talismanic booklet, to carefully ward off any ill spirits.”  At these words Fengjie was reminded, and she called for Ping’er to bring out the "Jade Box Record." After a short while, Cai Ming began to recite:  “On the twenty-fifth day of the Eighth Month, for the ailing one— From the southeast a spirit appears; a vengeful female ghost from a deceased family haunts, accompanied by a Flower God. Offer forty sheets of five-colored paper money and, taking forty steps to the southeast, send them off—great auspice!”  Fengjie laughed and said, “Truly, it is as if the spirit here in the garden is not the Flower God at all! I only worry that Grandmother herself may have encountered one.” She then ordered that two portions of paper money be prepared and assigned two attendants—one to accompany Grandmother Jia and one to accompany our eldest sister—for the exorcism.
Jia Lian, still drunk and blustering, was forced to kneel and apologize. Grandmother Jia berated him for his behavior—blaming him for provoking both her and the madams by mistreating Fengjie and Ping’er. In the end, Jia Lian meekly admitted his guilt, and Grandmother Jia ordered Fengjie and Jia Lian to go comfort Ping’er. As the room buzzed with commotion, servants and young maids alike joined in the cacophony. After much haggling and reconciliatory talk—and after news came in that Bao Er’s wife had hanged herself, which only added fuel to the fire—the family was in a state of disarray. Finally, Fengjie was forced to report the entire scandal to Grandmother Jia, while Jia Lian and others could only apologize profusely. Grandmother Jia, exasperated, declared that if any of them mentioned the matter again, she would personally administer a severe punishment. In the end, as the household slowly calmed, Fengjie remarked bitterly that perhaps all these troubles were ultimately caused by Bao Yu’s actions. Li Wan then scolded, “It is all because of Bao Yu—he ruined our first gathering and now continues to cause strife. Who can truly be blamed?”  Fengjie laughed wryly and said, “I suppose I’ll have to endure it for the rest of my life—if I must be treated like a ‘burnt-out child,’ so be it.”  The assembled crowd burst into laughter once more. Later that evening…  A maid announced, “Big Madam has arrived!” and Mrs. Wang hurried out to greet her. To be continued in the next installment… Chapter 47 When the Blundering Tyrant Flirts, He Gets Beaten; The Cold Gentleman, Fearing Trouble, Flees to Another Land  It happened that as soon as Mrs. Wang heard Mrs. Xing arrive, she hastily went out to meet her. Mrs. Xing, not yet aware that Grandmother had learned about the “Yuan Yang incident,” was still trying to gather further details. When she entered the courtyard, a few old maids whispered something to her, and only then did she understand. Just as she was about to leave, she saw that Mrs. Wang had brought someone out, so she had no choice but to step back inside. After first offering her respects to Grandmother, who said nothing but made her own self feel ashamed, Fengjie soon managed to dodge discussing one particular matter. Meanwhile, Yuan Yang stormed off to her room in anger. Mrs. Xing, mindful of not bruising her own face, gradually withdrew along with Mrs. Wang and a few others. Once Grandmother was alone, she said, “I’ve heard that you’ve been acting as a matchmaker for your master. You behave so ‘three obediences and four virtues’–but that kind of devotion is excessive! Now that our household is full of sons and grandsons, why should you fear his whims? I’ve heard that you let your master run roughshod over you.” Mrs. Xing’s face turned bright red, and she replied, “I’ve advised him several times—but what can I do? Grandmother already knows everything. I had no choice.”  Grandmother said, “Do you really mean to let him bully you into doing terrible things? Think of it: your brother’s wife is so docile and has suffered much—all this while, isn’t it your duty to take care of him? Even if you’re only helping out, you’re always left holding the broom and the rake. With so many matters to attend to, I must now take care of them myself. If they’re left unattended—even little details like Yuan Yang’s careful work—everything will be neglected. Must I be the one always worrying and haggling over every little thing? I already have more than enough in this house; yet every time I try to settle matters, they always come asking for more. Yuan Yang, if she doesn’t behave, then between her and the others—inside and outside, big or small—how can anything be overlooked? I find myself forced to micromanage, constantly haggling with them over every little item. And besides, she still clings to her master’s favor; she never demands new clothes from the madams or silver from the old matron. For these past years, from your cousin and your wife down to every servant in the household, everyone has complied.
Several of her favorite snacks were casually laid out on a small table for her to nibble on while she conversed at ease. She arranged two small banquets for herself—one to entertain the little maids and other attendants (who otherwise had no assigned seats), instructing them to sit beneath the eaves and help themselves without the need for strict etiquette. Madame Wang and Mrs. Xing sat at a high table downstairs, while several of the sisters occupied seats on a platform. From time to time Grandmother Jia would instruct You (Youshi) and others, “Let Feng lie on the upper table so that you may properly attend to me—it’s too hard for her all year long.” You readily agreed and teasingly added, “She says she can’t sit properly at the head of the table; once she’s seated up there, she’s all over the place, and she refuses to drink her wine!”  Grandmother Jia laughed and replied, “You don’t know—wait until I send her up myself.”  Just then, Fengjie hurried in with a laugh: “Old Ancestor, don’t believe their nonsense! I’ve already downed several cups of wine.”  Grandmother Jia smiled and ordered You, “Take her outside and, while she’s there, have her seated in a chair. All of you take turns to toast her. If she still refuses to drink, I’ll go up myself!”  You then quickly led Fengjie back outside and had her brought back to sit down. Someone promptly fetched a basin of wine and poured a cup. Laughing, You said, “For being so dutiful to Grandmother and the madams all year round, I won’t be stingy this time. My dear, have a sip in my stead.”  Fengjie replied with a laugh, “If you’ll see to my filial duties, then get down on your knees and drink!”  You retorted, “You surely do not know who you’re talking to! I tell you, it’s not every day we have such an occasion—after today, who knows when we’ll again get such a chance? So let’s drink two whole cups now!”  Fengjie, finding herself unable to avoid the matter, eventually took two cups. One by one the sisters came forward and each had two sips, while even the old nurse, Miss Lai’s mother, along with a few other elderly maids, joined in the toasting. Fengjie herself was pressed to drink repeatedly by others until she could only cry out, “Please, dear sisters, spare me! I’ll drink more tomorrow!”  Yuan Yang laughed, “Really, have we no shame? Even in front of the madams they’re still treating you as their mistress! In the past you maintained some dignity—but today, before everyone’s eyes, you’re behaving like the head of a household! I’d rather we just left without drinking!”  With that, Yuan Yang and some others left. Fengjie quickly tried to hold on, calling, “Oh, dear sisters, please, I’ll drink!” and she helped herself to another full cup, emptying it in one go. Yuan Yang finally smiled and dispersed. Afterward, the group resumed the feast. Fengjie, feeling that the wine was beginning to take its toll, suddenly felt a pounding in her heart and decided she needed to return home and rest. At that moment, the troupe of performing entertainers arrived. One of them said to You, “Prepare some money for a tip—I’m off to wash my face.” You nodded. Seizing an opportunity when no one was looking, Fengjie slipped away from the banquet and made her way toward the rear eaves of the house. Ping’er, noticing her departure, hurried along after Fengjie. Fengjie, however, took her arm to steady her. They reached the corridor when suddenly a little maid from Fengjie’s room, who had been standing quietly, saw them coming and immediately fled. Alarmed, Fengjie shouted, “Hey! Miss, wait—you there, come back!” The little maid tried feigning deafness at first, but after hearing repeated calls, she returned reluctantly. Fengjie’s suspicions grew, and she, accompanied by Ping’er, entered the corridor. She ordered the little maid to come inside, had her open the folding screen, and then sat on the steps of the courtyard.
Deliberately, she stepped heavily and called out with a laugh, “Qin’er, I reckon you’re hiding somewhere—show yourself!” As she called, she deliberately advanced. At that moment, inside the pavilion, little Xiao Hong (or Kui’er) had just pushed the window open. Then Baoqin called out, “Did you hide Lin Daiyu in there?” Kui’er replied, “I haven’t seen Lin Daiyu!” Baochai said, “I was just watching from across the river—Lin Daiyu was crouching here, playing with water. I wanted to startle her quietly, but before I could reach her, she noticed me and circled off to the east, disappearing. Could it be she’s hiding inside?” With that, Baochai deliberately stepped in, searched around, and then withdrew, murmuring to herself, “She must have darted into one of the mountain caves again. If I met a snake, even a bite would be fine.” She then walked off, amused in her heart, wondering, “I suppose that matter is settled—though I wonder how they are doing?”  Meanwhile, little Xiao Hong, having heard Baochai’s words, believed them and urged Baochai to go away. Then she pulled Kui’er aside and said, “It’s terrible—Lin Daiyu is crouching here. She must have heard our talk and gone!” Kui’er, after a long moment, said nothing. Xiao Hong continued, “What are we to do?” Kui’er replied, “Who cares what happens? Everyone should mind their own business.” Xiao Hong said, “But what if Sister Daiyu hears this? She is so particular and delicate—if she overhears and lets it slip, what then?” The two of them were still discussing when Xiangling, Zhen’er, Si Qi, and the scribe arrived at the pavilion. The pair quickly hushed their conversation and joined in the playful banter. Soon, Feng Jie appeared on the hillside, waving her hand. Xiao Hong immediately abandoned the others and ran up to Feng Jie with a bright smile, asking, “What has the Old Lady ordered you to do?” Feng Jie examined Xiao Hong and, finding her looks clean and pretty and her speech sensible, laughed and said, “My maid, none of my girls accompanied me today. I just recalled that I need to send someone out on an errand. I wonder if you’re capable? Tell me, am I being clear?” Xiao Hong laughed, “Old Lady, whatever you say, just instruct me. If I fail to do it properly and it delays your work, you can punish me as you please.” Feng Jie smiled, “Tell me, are you from that young mistress’s room? If I send you out and she later comes to fetch you, I’ll speak on your behalf.” Xiao Hong replied, “I’m from Second Master Baoyu’s room.” Feng Jie laughed, “Oh my! So you were in Baoyu’s room all along—no wonder.” She continued, “Very well; when he asks, I’ll speak for you. Go and tell Sister Ping in our house that outside, on the table under the Ruyao dish rack, there’s a bundle of silver—one hundred and twenty taels, which is the embroidery fee for the seamstress. When the Zhang Cai family comes, weigh it in front of them, then send it off. And one more thing: there’s a small pouch on the headboard inside—fetch that too.” Xiao Hong agreed and departed. After a short while, she returned—but Feng Jie was no longer on the hillside. Instead, Si Qi emerged from a cave, fastening her sash. Xiao Hong asked, “Sister, do you know where Second Aunt Lian has gone?” Si Qi replied, “I haven’t the slightest idea.” Hearing this, Xiao Hong looked around and then saw that over by the pond, Tanchun and Baochai were watching the fish. Xiao Hong went over and asked, “Do you know where Second Aunt Lian went just now?” Tanchun replied, “She’s off to look for our eldest aunt at her courtyard.” Xiao Hong then continued on toward Daoxiang Village, where, at the very entrance, she found Qingwen, Qi Xia, Bi Hen, Qiu Wen, Mei Yue, the scribe, Ru Hua, Ying’er, and a group of others gathered.
To have some important matter, he should have mentioned it rather than sneaking off. If he does it again, when your father returns home, I will have him beaten!”  Fengjie laughed, “A simple bow is one thing—but tomorrow, Bao, you must at least announce your departure. Do not let anyone follow you out unsupervised. There are so many carriages and horses on the street that one cannot be left in the lurch. It is not like the strict rules we observe when we leave the house.”  At this, Grandmother Jia scolded those in attendance, “Why do you all simply follow his orders? When he says he is leaving, he leaves without so much as a word in return!” Then she asked, “Where exactly did he go? Has he eaten anything? Has he been frightened?”  Bao Yu could only reply, “A favored concubine of the Prince Bei has passed away. Today he went to express his grief. I saw him crying so bitterly that I could not leave him there, so I waited for him a while longer.”  Grandmother Jia declared, “If he ever leaves without informing me beforehand, I will have your father beat you!”  Bao Yu hastily agreed. Grandmother Jia then threatened to discipline the attendants as well. The others interjected, “Grandmother, please do not be angry. He has promised he will not do it again—and besides, he has returned safely, so let us all enjoy ourselves for a while.”  Though Grandmother Jia remained uneasy at first, when she saw Bao Yu return she was overjoyed and her earlier anger melted away. She only worried that he might not have eaten enough or that something might have startled him on the way. In the end she fussed over him lovingly. Xiangren had long since come over to attend to him, and everyone settled in to watch the performance. That day the play was “The Record of the Thorned Hairpin” (Jingchai Ji). Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue, and the others wept with sorrow at times, laughed at others, and even cursed in parts. How exactly all this turned out… we shall explain in the next installment. Chapter 44 Unexpected Ups and Downs: Fengjie’s Jealousy and Outburst, While Ping’er Cheerfully Prepares Her Appearance  It happened that Baoyu and the sisters were sitting together watching the performance of “The Record of the Thorned Hairpin.” When Daiyu saw the scene “Male Sacrifice” on stage, she remarked to Baochai, “That Wang Shipeng is so clueless—no matter how often he offers a ritual, he’ll surely end up by the river doing something foolish. As the saying goes, ‘Seeing an object makes one think of someone.’ All water in the world comes from one source; no matter from which stream you scoop a bowl, once you begin to cry, you may as well let your heart be completely moved.”  Baochai offered no reply, and Bao Yu, upon hearing this, fell silent in thought. Meanwhile, Grandmother Jia resolved that today, unlike previous days, she must teach Fengjie a lesson in both joy and sorrow. Rather than fussing about with elaborate banquet seating in the main room, she reclined lazily on a couch in a side room with Aunt Xue and Madame Xue (Xue Yima) watching the play. Several of her favorite snacks were casually laid out on a small table for her to nibble on while she conversed at ease. She arranged two small banquets for herself—one to entertain the little maids and other attendants (who otherwise had no assigned seats), instructing them to sit beneath the eaves and help themselves without the need for strict etiquette. Madame Wang and Mrs. Xing sat at a high table downstairs, while several of the sisters occupied seats on a platform. From time to time Grandmother Jia would instruct You (Youshi) and others, “Let Feng lie on the upper table so that you may properly attend to me—it’s too hard for her all year long.” You readily agreed and teasingly added, “She says she can’t sit properly at the head of the table; once she’s seated up there, she’s all over the place, and she refuses to drink her wine!”  Grandmother Jia laughed and replied, “You don’t know—wait until I send her up myself.”  Just then, Fengjie hurried in with a laugh: “Old Ancestor, don’t believe their nonsense!
I know my illness is incurable. And besides, judging by how I look at my best, one can tell…”  Baochai nodded, “Exactly. The ancients said, ‘One who eats grains will live,’ but your diet fails to nourish your vital energy and blood. That is no good.”  Daiyu sighed, “‘Life and death are decreed by fate, and wealth and honor belong to heaven’—one cannot force it. This year, I feel even worse than in previous years.” As she spoke, she coughed two or three times. Baochai said, “Yesterday I noticed that your prescription had too much ginseng and cinnamon. Although they boost energy and replenish the spirit, they shouldn’t be so warming. In my opinion, we should first focus on soothing the liver and nourishing the stomach. Once the liver fire is subdued, it can’t overcome the earth; the stomach will recover, and your diet will naturally restore you. Every morning, take a little high-grade bird’s nest—say, one tael—and five qian of rock sugar, and cook a porridge in a silver pot. Once accustomed to it, it is even more efficacious than medicine—it is most nourishing and yin-restorative.”  Daiyu sighed, “You always treat others kindly—but I sometimes suspect you hide ulterior motives. The other day you advised me against reading miscellaneous books, and I was so grateful to you. In hindsight, I must have been mistaken, for I’ve only harmed myself. Now that I reflect, when my mother passed away, I had no siblings. I’ve reached fifteen years of age without anyone to guide me as you once did. No wonder Yun often praises you. In the past I resented your admonitions, but now I see their truth. For instance, when you suggested that I eat bird’s nest porridge—though bird’s nest is easy to come by, I, being so frail and afflicted by this recurring illness, have little recourse. The doctors and decoctions, with all that ginseng and cinnamon, have turned my world upside down. Now I’m writing new verses about it—why, then, should I trouble myself with bird’s nest porridge? Grandmother, Madam Wang, and Fengjie will have nothing more to say, and the maids below will surely think me too meddlesome. You know how everyone gossips behind my back…”  Baochai smiled, “In that case, I am just as you are.”  Daiyu replied, “How can you compare? You have a mother and a brother; your family still owns property, houses, and land. You simply live off family connections without truly contributing to household affairs, while I have nothing—my every possession, every blade of grass, is like that of the other maidens. What do you expect? I’m bound to be the subject of endless scorn!”  Baochai laughed, “In the end, it will only amount to a modest dowry someday; you needn’t worry too much.”  Hearing this, Daiyu blushed and said, “Others regard you as a proper person and confide their troubles in you, yet you laugh at me!”  Baochai smiled, “Even if it is in jest, it is the honest truth. Don’t worry—if you stay with me for a day, I will help pass the time. Tell me your grievances; I’ll see to it that they’re resolved. I have a brother, as you know; though he is superior to you in some respects, we share similar fates. We are, in effect, fellow sufferers. You are an understanding person—why should you recite some ‘lament of Sima Niu’ about your woes? Sometimes, less is more. Tomorrow, I’ll speak with my mother; I suspect we have some bird’s nest left over that I can give you. Then, have the maids cook it up—cheap and quiet—and you’ll be well.”  Daiyu laughed and said, “It’s a trifle, but I’m touched by your kindness.”  After this, Daiyu sipped a bowl of thin porridge while reclining on her bed. As dusk approached, the sky darkened and a steady rain began. The autumn drizzle fell softly on the bamboo and banana leaves, deepening the melancholy. Knowing Baochai would not come, Daiyu, by lamplight, picked up a book of miscellaneous tunes from the Music Bureau, including “Autumn Chamber Lament” and “Farewell Lament.” Moved by the rain and her emotions, she began composing a poem reminiscent of “A Moonlit Night on the Spring River,” titling it “Evening Wind and Rain at the Autumn Window.” The verses read:    Autumn flowers are bleak, autumn grasses turn yellow,   A lonely autumn lamp burns as the autumn night drags on.
If you felt more at ease, you wouldn’t be so sick.”  Daiyu felt as if thunder had struck. She realized how precisely his words mirrored her own hidden thoughts. She wanted to speak a thousand sentences, but not a syllable escaped her lips. Baoyu likewise had countless more confessions, uncertain where to begin, so they both stared, speechless. After a long pause, Daiyu sobbed once, tears streaming, and turned to go. Baoyu tried to pull her back: “Don’t leave yet—hear me out.” Daiyu, wiping her tears, brushed his hand aside: “No need. I know what’s on your mind.” Without a backward glance, she was gone. Baoyu stood gazing after her in a daze. He had hurried out earlier and forgot his fan. Xi Ren, mindful of the heat, grabbed a fan to bring him. Seeing him standing there foolishly, she joked, “I noticed you left without a fan—I’ve brought it. Why stand there like a statue?” Lost in thought, Baoyu murmured, “My dear sister, I’ve never dared speak my heart, but now that I have, even death holds no fear! On your account, I’ve developed this illness, which I hide from all. Only when your own illness abates will my suffering ease. Awake or asleep, I cannot forget you!”  Xi Ren froze, alarmed, “What on earth are you talking about? We must hurry in—someone might hear!” Startled by her voice, Baoyu realized that in his stupor, he’d mistaken Xi Ren for Daiyu. Overcome by embarrassment, he mumbled, “Oh! . . . it’s you.” Accepting the fan, he slunk off wordlessly. Xi Ren stood there, deeply unsettled. He must have meant that speech for Lin Daiyu, she realized. It implies a dangerous entanglement—if they transgress in some way . . . oh dear, how can we prevent trouble? She was still pondering this when Baochai arrived from another path, calling cheerily, “Why are you daydreaming in the blazing sun?” Xi Ren quickly steadied herself: “I was watching two birds fight, amusements of nature.” Baochai laughed, “So that’s it. I saw Baoyu rush out in a hurry—I tried calling him, but he looked so preoccupied he didn’t respond. Where’s he off to?” Xi Ren explained, “Master just summoned him—likely a visitor. Might be some official call.” Baochai said, “So hot—why drag him out? Maybe the Master is annoyed and wants to scold him.” Xi Ren replied, “I think it’s just a guest.” Baochai laughed, “That guest must be insane, trudging about in this heat.” Xi Ren said, “Isn’t that so!”  Baochai then inquired, “I saw Xiangyun heading to your place. Why?” Xi Ren answered, “We chatted awhile, and I asked her to help me with some sewing. She agreed.” Baochai nodded: “That girl’s always doing needlework at home. She told me she’s worn out by it—her family can’t afford hired seamstresses, so all chores fall on them. I recall her eyes turning red whenever the subject arises. She complains about all the exhausting tasks, but dares not speak openly.” Xi Ren sighed, “Yes, I recall requesting her to tie a few butterfly knots last month. She said she’d do them, but took a long while. Likely she had to do it late at night. If I’d known, I’d not have asked her. Master Baoyu is picky, though, refusing the house seamstresses for his personal items.” Baochai said quietly, “Don’t worry, I’ll do some for you if needed.” Xi Ren brightened, “Truly? That would be such a blessing! Perhaps tonight I’ll bring them over.”  She was mid-sentence when an old woman came in a hurry: “Something dreadful! Jin Chuan’er, from the Mistress’s rooms, has just drowned herself in a well.” Xi Ren gasped: “That Jin Chuan’er?
It struck him squarely in the eye, eliciting an exclamation, “Ai-yo!”  (To be continued…)  Chapter 29 They Who Enjoy Comfort Pray for Even More Blessings; A Young Woman Burdened by Deep Affection Pours Out Her Emotions  In his daze, Baoyu hadn’t expected Lin Daiyu to toss her handkerchief toward him. It landed squarely over his eyes, startling him. He exclaimed, “Who did that?” Daiyu merely shook her head and smiled, “I dare not claim otherwise. I accidentally lost my grip. Sister Bao wanted to see that silly goose, so I tried showing it, but it slipped from my hand.” Rubbing his eyes, Baoyu wanted to retort, but found nothing fitting to say. Just then, Wang Xifeng (Feng Jie) arrived, speaking of the upcoming ceremony on the first day of the lunar month at Qingxu Temple, urging Baochai, Baoyu, and Daiyu to watch the theatricals. Baochai waved her off with a laugh, “No, no—it’s sweltering outside, and what new plays are there to see? I’m not going.” Wang Xifeng argued, “But it’s cool there, with balconies on both sides. If you don’t go, I’ll go alone! I’ve already arranged to drive the Taoists away for a day or two to clean and hang the curtains. No strangers allowed in the temple—that’s how we’ll have a proper outing. I even informed the Mistress. These days at home, I’m suffocating! Whenever a performance is staged at home, I’m never able to sit and enjoy it properly.” Hearing this, the Lady Dowager Jia Mu said with a smile, “Well, if you’re so eager, I’ll go with you.” Wang Xifeng, delighted, laughed, “The Old Ancestor is coming along? That’s wonderful! Though this means I won’t get as much peace as I’d hoped!” Jia Mu reassured her, “Tomorrow, I’ll be on the main balcony, and you can sit on a side balcony. You needn’t come over and stand on ceremony with me—how about that?” Wang Xifeng said happily, “The Old Ancestor is so kind to me.” Jia Mu then turned to Baochai. “You should come too, and bring your mother. Better to be out on a warm day than just napping at home.” Helpless to refuse, Baochai agreed. Jia Mu sent someone to invite Aunt Xue, and on the way told Lady Wang that she wanted to bring all the young ladies along. Lady Wang, being unwell and anticipating a visit from Yuan Chun (and thus having already declined), merely smiled. “How wonderful! Have them announce in the garden that whoever wishes to go may join the Old Lady on the first.”  That announcement stirred up much excitement. Some might have been indifferent, but the maids—who rarely got to venture outside the gate—were all eager. Even those whose mistresses were reluctant tried to convince them in every way. Hence, Li Wan and others were swayed, and Jia Mu was ever so pleased, having already instructed the servants to prepare and tidy everything. No need to elaborate further. On the first day of the lunar month, carriages crowded the gates of Rongguo Mansion; lines of horses and servants formed. Upon hearing that the Noble Consort was doing a good deed and that Jia Mu herself would offer incense—and that it was also the Duanwu festival—everything from carriages to ceremonial objects was arranged with great flair, quite unlike normal times. Shortly after, Jia Mu and the others emerged. Jia Mu was carried in an eight-bearer sedan chair; Li, Xifeng, and Aunt Xue each had four-bearer sedans; Baochai and Daiyu shared a jeweled, emerald-canopied, eight-treasures carriage; Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun rode a vermilion carriage with an ornate canopy. Following them were the maids: Yuanyang, Yingwu, Hupo, Zhenzhu for Jia Mu; Zijuan, Xueyan, and the Parrot Girl for Daiyu; Ying’er and Wenxing for Baochai; Siqi and Xiuju for Yingchun; Shishu and Cuimo for Tanchun; Ruhua and Caiping for Xichun; Tongxi and Tonggui (plus Xiangling and her own maid Zhen’er) for Aunt Xue; Suyun and Biyue for Li Wan; Ping’er, Feng’er, and Xiao Hong for Xifeng; and also two of Lady Wang’s maids, Jinchuan and Caiyun, trailing behind Xifeng.
It’s all sorted out, nothing to worry about.”  Being so easily frightened, the Dowager stood at once, leaning on people as she went to the veranda. A rosy blaze was still visible in the southeast corner. Fearing a real hazard, she prayed under her breath and told them to get incense for the Fire God. Then Lady Wang and others arrived to reassure her, “All sorted out, Madame. Please, let us go back inside.”  The Dowager stood watch until the last flame died away, then finally led them all indoors again. Baoyu’s immediate thought was to find out more about that girl out in the snow, so once they sat down, he hastened to ask Old Mrs. Liu, “That young girl— why would she be collecting firewood on a snowy morning? She might have gotten ill from the cold.”  The Dowager scolded, “So it was talk of stolen firewood that caused this upset! Must you keep asking? Drop it. Have her tell other stories.”  Though disappointed, Baoyu had to yield. Old Mrs. Liu reflected, then switched to another topic:  “Our village, next over from ours, has this old granny of ninety-something. She recites her Buddhist prayers daily. Who’d guess her devotion moved the Bodhisattva Guanyin to come in a dream saying, ‘You’re so devout. I told the Jade Emperor you shouldn’t be left without a descendant, so here’s a grandson for you!’ You see, that old granny had only one son, and he in turn only had one boy, who died at about seventeen. They wept until they were half-dead. But after a while, she truly gave birth to another grandson. Now he’s thirteen or fourteen, round as a little dumpling, bright as can be. Are the gods not real?”  This anecdote unwittingly touched upon the Dowager’s and Lady Wang’s own hopes, and even Lady Wang pricked up her ears. Yet Baoyu’s thoughts remained on that tale of the girl gathering wood. Even after hearing the second yarn, he was lost in thought. Tan-chun changed the subject, “Yesterday we borrowed Cousin Shi; let’s do something to repay her kindness. Perhaps we’ll arrange a session or a small banquet for the Old Ancestress to enjoy the chrysanthemums?”  Baoyu smiled, “The Old Dowager does want to throw a do to thank Cousin Shi. Let her do it. Then after we attend hers, we can do ours.”  “Time is passing,” Tan-chun noted, “It’s growing colder. I doubt the Old Dowager will be willing.”  “She quite likes wind and snow,” said Baoyu. “We can wait till the first heavy snowfall, then invite her to view it. We can write poems in the snow— how amusing that’d be!”  Lin Daiyu teased, “Yes, we can write poems in the snow, but from what that old granny said, better to haul some firewood in the snow, that’d be even more fun!” Her remark set off laughter among the other girls. Baoyu cast her a sideways glance but said nothing. When it was time to disperse, Baoyu stole away with Old Mrs. Liu and coaxed her into continuing that first story. Cornered, she had to improvise:  “Well… it’s a deserted shrine near the northern edge of our farmland. Not for gods or buddhas, but for some old lord… oh, I forget the name,” she said, flustered. “No matter the name or who it was—just the basic circumstances,” Baoyu pressed. “That old lord had no sons—only a daughter, named something like Ruoyu, who was educated and read. The parents doted on her like a priceless pearl. Alas, the girl took ill at seventeen and died.”  Baoyu stomped in regret. “So tragic. Then what?”  “Overcome by grief, the parents built that shrine and had a statue of her made. They hired caretakers to supply incense and stoke the fires. But many years have passed. The family died off; the shrine fell to ruin; the statue all but decayed… folks claim it’s turned into a spirit.”  “No, not a spirit,” Baoyu corrected.
She grew suspicious, not knowing their motive. One day, upon receiving yet another gift from them, she confided in Ping’er after suppertime:  “Sister, can you guess why they keep bringing me presents? I can’t figure it out.” Ping’er gave a wry chuckle: “Madam, do you truly not remember? My guess: each of them likely wants the opening left by Jin Chuan’er’s death. Over at Lady Wang’s side, there are four main serving girls, each drawing a monthly allowance of one tael of silver. The rest get only a few hundred copper coins each month. Now that Jin Chuan’er’s gone, that ‘one tael a month’ slot is open, so all those families are vying for it.”  Wang Xifeng, hearing that, brightened: “Ah—yes, that must be it. They’re not satisfied with the money they earn by other means, or the easy tasks they already enjoy. They want that special slot for their daughter. And it sure isn’t easy for them to push so much silver my way. But if they want to come courting me, so be it. Let them keep sending gifts. I have my own plan.” Feeling content, she made no immediate move, letting them come a few times more until the tributes were sufficient. Then she planned to mention it to Lady Wang. That day, midday, Aunt Xue, Baochai, Daiyu, and some others were in Lady Wang’s rooms, all sharing watermelon. Wang Xifeng considered it a good opportunity, so she said to Lady Wang:  “Since Jin Chuan’er died, you’ve been short a maid in your service. Madam, might you have someone in mind to fill that spot? Then next month’s payroll will not be disrupted.” Lady Wang thought a moment: “Truly, do we need four or five of them? As long as I manage, we might simply leave that place unfilled, no need to follow an old ‘four maids’ rule.”  Xifeng smiled, “Yes, your reasoning is sound in principle; but the rest of the household staff might gossip—since every mistress’s room has four or five main maids. And saving that single tael of silver is hardly a big deal.”  Lady Wang considered further, “Alright. Then let’s keep the one-tael slot ‘technically’ open but unoccupied. The monthly tael can go to her younger sister, Yu Chuan’er. Jin Chuan’er served me for some time yet came to a sad end, so awarding her sister double pay is no big extravagance.” Xifeng promptly turned to Yu Chuan’er with an exaggerated grin: “Rejoice, rejoice!” Yu Chuan’er curtsied in thanks. Then Lady Wang asked, “I recall Zhao Yiniang and Zhou Yiniang get how much monthly?” Xifeng answered, “Two taels each, the standard. Zhao Yiniang gets another two for Huan, plus four strings of coins.” Lady Wang pressed, “So every month is fully disbursed to them? The other day I overheard a mention that one string of coins was shorted, how come?” Xifeng quickly explained:  “We never short them. But for their personal maids, the standard is one string of coins per person. Since last year, the ‘outer’ managers proposed a half-allowance for the Yiniangs’ maids, cutting that to five hundred coins each. With two maids each, that’s one string less. This arrangement was not my doing. I even suggested we revert to the old full pay for them, but the outer stewards insisted ‘No, we only have this budget.’ So, not my fault. Meanwhile, I distribute monthly wages on schedule—like it or not, no one can blame me. They used to wait for months at the outer offices but never got it smoothly, right?” Lady Wang only frowned, then changed the subject: “At the Old Ancestor’s place, there are eight maids on one-tael pay, correct?” Xifeng nodded: “Yes, well, only seven remain in practice, the eighth being Xi Ren.” Lady Wang said, “Yes, but Xi Ren belongs to Grandmother’s staff, not Baoyu’s, so that monthly pay is under the old lady’s name.
“What now?”  One of them said, “It’s late, Miss—my mother’s ill at home, and I need to fetch a doctor. Please be kind and let me off for half a day.”  “You fellows are impossible, taking turns telling the Mistress you want leave— it’s always the same story. The other day it was Zhu’er, and Master (Baoyu) asked for him, but he wasn’t there. I had to cover for him, and then got scolded for ‘taking sides.’ Now today it’s you.”  Zhou Rui’s wife pleaded, “But truly, his mother’s unwell, Miss. Won’t you speak on his behalf?”  “All right, but be back first thing tomorrow. Don’t come lazing around half the day. Also, on your way out, see Wang. Tell him from Mistress: if the interest due isn’t handed in tomorrow, Mistress won’t wait— she’ll ‘graciously’ let him keep it for himself.”  Elated, the lad promised and dashed away. Eventually, Ping’er and Zhou Rui’s wife escorted Old Mrs. Liu into the Old Dowager’s rooms. At that time, all the ladies of the Garden were also in attendance. The old woman entered to see a chamber radiant with pearls and jade, ladies dressed in all colors. She couldn’t guess who was who. On a couch, half-reclined an aged woman, behind whom stood a stunning maid, robed in gauze, gently massaging her legs. Next to them was none other than Lady Feng. Old Mrs. Liu recognized the couch-bound matriarch must be the Old Dowager, so she quickly approached with a respectful smile, bowed low, and called out: “Many greetings, old dear goddess of longevity!”  The Dowager promptly straightened and returned the greeting, ordering Zhou Rui’s wife to bring a seat for the visitor. Liu’s grandson Ban’er stood there shyly, forgetting to offer any proper greeting. “How old are you now, dear old friend?” the Dowager asked. The old woman rose from her seat. “Seventy-five this year, ma’am.”  Addressing the assembled ladies, the Dowager said, “So advanced and still so vigorous, older than me by several years. Were I to reach that age, I fear I’d hardly be able to move!”  Old Mrs. Liu replied, “We common folk have had to toil from birth. The Old Dowager was born to fortune. If we all could live so comfortably, who’d do the fieldwork?”  “Ah, how are your eyes and teeth?” the Dowager inquired. “All good, except for a loose molar on the left side that started acting up this year,” the old woman answered. “While I’m old, I’m useless,” the Dowager said. “My vision is blurred, my hearing dull, my memory gone. Half these old kinfolks, I don’t recall them. I get anxious at the idea of entertaining them, so I avoid them. I can just manage to chew a bite or two, take a nap, and amuse myself with these grandchildren when bored, that’s all.”  Old Mrs. Liu chuckled, “That’s truly your good fortune, ma’am. We can’t afford such ease.”  “Fortune, indeed, or just a worthless old carcass,” the Dowager teased, eliciting laughter from all. She went on: “I heard from Feng-lass you’ve brought a big load of melons and vegetables. I’ve had her put them away quickly. I’ve been craving some fresh produce from the field. The stuff in town markets is never as good.”  “These are just rustic trifles,” Old Mrs. Liu said. “Something fresh, that’s all. If we had our way, we’d enjoy fish and meat daily. But we can’t afford it.”  “All the same, it’s a pleasure,” the Dowager insisted. “Since we’re now acquainted, you mustn’t just go away empty-handed.
Xiangling asked after her, and Ping’er, smiling, replied that she was well. Baochai then teased Ping’er, “Today I’ve brought her in as a companion—I was just about to report it to your grandmother.” Ping’er laughed, “What did you say? I have nothing to add.” Baochai said, “That’s exactly right. A proper host must inform everyone, so that those who keep vigil at night will know you’re here and can secure the gate. Just go back and tell them, and I won’t have to send someone.” Ping’er agreed, then added to Xiangling, “Since you’re here, why not also pay a visit to the neighbors?” Baochai interjected, “I was just about to send her over.” Ping’er replied, “You need not go to our house; Second Young Master is ill at home.” Xiangling accepted this and went off, first stopping at Grandmother’s before heading to the room of the other sisters—details omitted. Meanwhile, after Xiangling left, Ping’er pulled Baochai aside in a hushed tone, “Sister, have you heard our new news?” Baochai replied, “I haven’t heard it. My brother has been out these past few days, so I haven’t heard any of the household gossip.” Ping’er laughed, “Lord Jia beat Second Young Master so badly—didn’t you hear?” Baochai said, “I only caught a vague sentence in the morning and wasn’t sure. I was about to visit your grandmother, but then you appeared. And what is it that he beat her for?” Ping’er gritted her teeth and cursed, “It’s all that damned Jia Yucun—a bastard wildling who’s been roaming about since he was a child! In less than ten years, he’s caused so many problems. This past spring, our master found a few old fans somewhere; when he returned home, he discovered that all the fine fans in the house were now useless, so he ordered a search. Who should show up but that insolent wretch, known as the ‘Dullard Stone’—so poor he could hardly eat, yet stubbornly guarding twenty old fans as if he’d never part with them! Our Second Young Master, after enduring so many troubles, saw this fellow and, after repeated admonitions, invited him into his house and inspected the fans. According to Second Young Master, these were priceless—authentic works depicting the Xiang Fei, palm, bamboo, deer, and jade bamboos; all genuine relics. When he informed our master, the master offered as many silver taels as needed. But that Stone Dullard said, ‘Even if I starve or freeze to death, I won’t sell them—even if it costs a thousand taels a fan!’ Our master was at his wit’s end, constantly cursing Second Young Master for failing him. I’ve heard that, in the end, our master ended up paying him 500 taels—first exchanging silver, then taking the fans. But he still refused, insisting, ‘You must first take my life before you get my fans!’ Think about it—what’s the use? Who would believe it?”  Baochai, upon hearing this, ordered one of the maids, “Go ask our mother if you will; if she approves, I won’t go.” Ping’er went to see, and she said, “Sister, did you hear that?” Baochai replied, “If it’s so, then let’s not worry about it; our master isn’t one to be taken lightly. Even if he endures a few losses, it will eventually balance out.”  Just then, Xue Pan (or the other younger relative) came bustling in. Fengjie and the others hurriedly stood and greeted her with smiles. Old Madam Lai sat near the hearth and said cheerily, “I’m delighted—if it weren’t for our masters’ favor, where would my joy come from? Yesterday, Grandmother even sent Cai Ge with gifts, and my grandson kowtowed at the door.”  Li Wan asked with a smile, “How early did you leave last night?”  Old Madam Lai sighed, “I can’t control them—they do as they please.
So, go on—did you find the statue?”  “Indeed, the shrine faces south and is indeed falling apart. I was tired and cross but decided to look inside. The statue nearly frightened me off. It looked so lifelike.”  “You see?” Baoyu cried. “It does have supernatural power and transforms into human form sometimes.”  Huaijing slapped his knees. “Human form? Master, it was no girl’s effigy at all— just a green-faced, red-haired plague deity!”  Baoyu spat in frustration, “Useless dolt, can’t handle even this simple business. Off you go, useless scum!”  “It’s not me who’s muddled,” retorted Huaijing. “You must have gleaned nonsense from some book or idle talk and believed it. So you sent me on a fool’s errand. Now you blame me—what’s it got to do with my competence?”  Seeing him offended, Baoyu softened his tone. “Calm down, no need to argue. Another day, when you’re free, look again. If it’s a hoax, that’s that. But if indeed there’s something real, and you can help preserve it, you’d earn some spiritual merit. I’ll reward you handsomely.”  He was still speaking when a page from the second gate appeared: “The maids from the Old Dowager’s quarters are waiting by the gate— they want to see the young master.”  For what reason, we must hear in the next chapter. Chapter 40 Madam Shi’s Two Banquets in the Grand View Garden; The Golden Mandarin Ducks Announce the Orders for the Insignia  It was said that upon hearing this, Baoyu hurried in to see what was going on. He found Hu Po standing by a folding screen saying, “Hurry along—I've been waiting for you to speak.” When Baoyu entered the upstairs room, he saw Grandmother Jia, together with Madame Wang and the other ladies, discussing how to invite Shi Xiangyun to rejoin the banquet. Baoyu then remarked, “I have an idea: since no outsiders are present and we haven’t fixed a set menu for the food, why not let everyone choose a few of their favorite dishes? There’s no need to follow the conventional banquet layout. We could simply place one tall tray in front of each person with one or two items they love, along with a ‘Ten-Brocade Heart’ self-filling wine box. Wouldn’t that be rather novel?”  Grandmother Jia smiled and said, “Very good.” She immediately ordered someone to tell the kitchen, “Tomorrow, prepare our favorite dishes according to the number of guests, and have the boxes ready. Breakfast shall also be served in the garden.” While they were still in discussion, it wasn’t long before the lanterns were lit, and the evening passed without further conversation. The next morning, with the clear, bright weather promising a delightful day, Li Wan rose early. She watched as the maidservants swept up fallen leaves and polished tables and chairs, while preparing the tea and wine utensils. Just then, Feng’er entered with the elderly Liu Laolao, saying, “Our dear Madam is in a great hurry today.” Li Wan laughed and replied, “I told you yesterday you wouldn’t make it, yet you insisted on going anyway.” Old Liu Laolao chuckled, “The old lady insisted I come along so I wouldn’t miss out on the fun for a day.”  Feng’er then produced several keys of different sizes and said, “Our madam remarked that the tall tables outside might not be sufficient. So she suggested that we open up the upper floor and bring down those stored tables for use today. Madam was meant to come in person but was busy chatting with the lady of the house. Please, Madam, open them up and have people help carry them down.” Li Wan promptly ordered Su Yun to fetch the keys and then sent out the housekeepers to call a few of the junior servants from the two gates. Standing at the base of the Grand View Tower and looking upward, Li Wan ordered that the Zhuangjin Pavilion be opened; one by one, tables were carried down. In unison, the servants, the elderly maids, and the young ladies together carried down more than twenty tables.
But expelling him outright is not acceptable, for he is not our own blood. He is merely the attendant of the madams; if we expel him, the madams will be disgraced. I say Grandmother should give him a few lashes as a warning. If he continues, then expel him. One must consider not only his own mother but also the madams.”  Fengjie then said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and give him forty strokes. If he dares drink again, he won’t be allowed near the wine.”  Old Madam Lai’s household agreed, and soon Zhou Rui’s and Zhang Cai’s families arrived with their accounts. Fengjie declared, “My daughter-in-law is here to pick up her mother-in-law.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded. Old Madam Lai said, “What is the matter? Tell me, and I shall decide.”  Fengjie explained, “At my birthday the other day, while no one was outside to manage things, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he sat there cursing instead. When two women entered, he took the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of buns all over the courtyard. After everyone left, I sent Cai Ming to scold him—and he ended up cursing Cai Ming. Such lawlessness! Why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Hit him, scold him, and let him amend his ways. Expelling him outright is unthinkable since he is not our own son. He is merely the attendant of the madams; if we expel him, the madams’ honor will suffer. I say, let Grandmother teach him a lesson with a few lashes; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never near the wine again.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt again and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai then instructed, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I’ll have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt once more before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse consented as they escorted them away. Later, Li Wan and the others returned to the garden. That evening, Fengjie had many old, well-used painting tools brought out and delivered to the garden. Baochai and the others selected what they needed; of the assorted items, only half were usable. An inventory was drawn up for Fengjie to purchase the missing supplies—but we need not go into further detail. One day, word arrived that the dye for the silk and the preliminary sketches had been delivered. Bao Yu would assist Xiuchun with the work, while Tan Chun, Li Wan, Yingchun, Baochai, and the others would gather there—first to admire the paintings, and then to have their meetings. Noticing the cool weather and the lengthening nights, Baochai went to Grandmother Jia’s room to discuss arranging some needlework. By day she visited Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang twice, inevitably sitting with them. In the garden, the sisters would occasionally chat as well. Thus, during the day there was little free time, and by night the girls worked under the lamplight until around the third watch. Every year after the spring and autumn equinoxes, Daiyu’s old illness would flare up—and this autumn, having spent extra time with Grandmother, she felt overtaxed; she soon began coughing again, feeling worse than before. Consequently, she rarely left her room and confined herself to recuperation. Sometimes, feeling isolated, she longed for a sister’s company—but when Baochai and the others visited and exchanged a few words, she would soon tire of conversation. Everyone, aware of her delicate condition, forgave her for her curt receptions and lax manners. That day, Baochai visited Daiyu and broached the subject of her illness. Baochai said, “The doctors we’ve seen are fine, but the medicines you take never seem to work. Perhaps we should invite a master physician to examine you. If your illness were cured, wouldn’t that be wonderful? Every year you suffer through spring and summer—though you’re neither old nor young, it is simply not right.”  Daiyu replied, “It is hopeless.
The old woman rose from her seat. “Seventy-five this year, ma’am.”  Addressing the assembled ladies, the Dowager said, “So advanced and still so vigorous, older than me by several years. Were I to reach that age, I fear I’d hardly be able to move!”  Old Mrs. Liu replied, “We common folk have had to toil from birth. The Old Dowager was born to fortune. If we all could live so comfortably, who’d do the fieldwork?”  “Ah, how are your eyes and teeth?” the Dowager inquired. “All good, except for a loose molar on the left side that started acting up this year,” the old woman answered. “While I’m old, I’m useless,” the Dowager said. “My vision is blurred, my hearing dull, my memory gone. Half these old kinfolks, I don’t recall them. I get anxious at the idea of entertaining them, so I avoid them. I can just manage to chew a bite or two, take a nap, and amuse myself with these grandchildren when bored, that’s all.”  Old Mrs. Liu chuckled, “That’s truly your good fortune, ma’am. We can’t afford such ease.”  “Fortune, indeed, or just a worthless old carcass,” the Dowager teased, eliciting laughter from all. She went on: “I heard from Feng-lass you’ve brought a big load of melons and vegetables. I’ve had her put them away quickly. I’ve been craving some fresh produce from the field. The stuff in town markets is never as good.”  “These are just rustic trifles,” Old Mrs. Liu said. “Something fresh, that’s all. If we had our way, we’d enjoy fish and meat daily. But we can’t afford it.”  “All the same, it’s a pleasure,” the Dowager insisted. “Since we’re now acquainted, you mustn’t just go away empty-handed. If you don’t mind staying here, spend a day or two. Our place has a garden with fruit, too. Tomorrow you can have a taste, then bring some home, so your trip won’t be wasted.”  Seeing the Dowager so delighted, Lady Feng also urged, “We might not match your farmland for size, but we do have a couple of spare rooms. Stay a couple of days, share some stories from the country for our Old Dowager’s amusement.”  The Dowager smiled at Feng-lass. “Don’t tease her. She’s just a simple soul from the sticks, easily flustered by your jokes.” She signaled some maids to bring fruit for Ban’er, but the child, seeing so many strangers, dared not eat. The Dowager then had money given him, and some junior lads took him outside to play. Having finished her tea, Old Mrs. Liu started telling more stories from rural life, the trifling sights and wonders in the fields day by day, through all four seasons. The Dowager took great delight. Meanwhile, those assembled—Baoyu, the young ladies, and the rest— had never heard such talk, and found it more entertaining than a blind man’s novel performance. Though old, though rustic, Mrs. Liu possessed a streak of cleverness and had weathered many experiences. Observing how keen the Dowager was, and how much the young ones enjoyed her tales, she spared no detail. “You see,” she said, “we farm folk work fields and plant vegetables year in and year out, in spring, summer, autumn, winter, braving the elements—who has time to sit idle? Why, we set up wooden benches out there in the fields. You can’t imagine the strange incidents we witness! Take last winter, for instance, when it snowed for days and drifted three, four feet. I got up at dawn, hadn’t yet left the house, when I heard a rattle in the yard. I guessed someone was nicking our firewood. Sneaking to the window, I peeked out. Sure enough, it wasn’t from our own village, so I—”  “Must’ve been some traveler, caught in the cold, snatching a bit of wood to warm himself,” the Dowager said.
Of course, if you want to add the green hues and even embellish with gold and silver paste, they will have to be added. You’ll also need a furnace for preparing glue, extra glue, and brushes to wash. You must have a large table for grinding pigments, laid out with felt. Many of your small dishes are missing, and so are your brushes—start anew with a complete set.”  Xīchūn said, “I’ve never owned such painting implements; I only use what’s at hand. And as for pigments, I only have ocher, Guanghua, vine yellow, and rouge—only two brushes for coloring, at most.”  Baochai said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? I still have some of these things, though you need not use them; I’ll keep them for you until you require them. They’re only good for painting fans anyway—painting a large-scale work would be a pity. Today, I’ll draft an inventory and send it to Grandmother. You may not know everything, so I’ll have Brother Bao write it down.”  Baoyu had already prepared his brush and inkstone, fearing he might forget, so he began to note down the list as Baochai spoke. Baochai recited:    “First set: four fine brushes; second set: four fine brushes; third set: four fine brushes; four large dye brushes; four medium dye brushes; four small dye brushes; ten large ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten small ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten whisker brushes; twenty large coloring brushes; twenty small coloring brushes; ten surface brushes; twenty willow-twig brushes; four taels of vermilion arrowheads; four taels of southern ochre; four taels of stone yellow; four taels of stone blue; four taels of stone green; four taels of tube yellow; eight taels of Guanghua; fourteen boxes of lead powder; twelve packets of rouge; two hundred packets of great scarlet; two hundred packets of lapis lazuli; fourteen taels of Guangyun glue; four taels of purified alum. The glue and alum for silk remain separate—just hand over the silk and have them process it. With these colors, after sorting and mixing, you’ll have enough for a lifetime. In addition, you’ll need four fine silk baskets, two coarse baskets, four carrying brushes, four small and large porcelain basins, twenty large coarse bowls, ten five-inch dishes, twenty three-inch coarse white dishes, two wind furnaces, four sand pots of various sizes, two new porcelain jars, two new water buckets, four one-foot-long white cloth bags, twenty jin of floating charcoal, one or two jin of willow charcoal, one three-tier wooden box, one yard of real gauze, two taels of ginger, and half a jin of sauce.”  Daiyu interjected with a laugh, “And an iron pot and an iron spatula!”  Baochai asked, “What’s that for?”  Daiyu replied, “If you need ginger and sauce for the pigments, I’ll get you an iron pot to fry them—so you can cook the pigments properly.”  The assembled guests laughed. Baochai laughed, “Pín’er, you do know that a coarse porcelain dish will not withstand being fired without first being treated with ginger juice and sauce on its base—once it’s fired, it will crack.”  Hearing this, everyone agreed, “That’s exactly it.”  Daiyu glanced at the list once more, then quietly whispered to Tan Chun, “Look at that—painting a picture requires so many water jars and boxes. It seems he has mistakenly copied his dowry list as well.”  Tan Chun laughed heartily and said, “Sister Bao, will you not twist his little mouth? Ask him what he meant by those words.”  Baochai laughed, “No need—‘can there be ivory in a dog’s mouth?’”  Saying this, she strode over and playfully grabbed Daiyu, intending to pinch her cheek. Daiyu laughed and pleaded, “Oh, dear sister, spare me! I am young and only know how to talk; I do not appreciate the gravity of things—if you do not spare me, who will?”  Not knowing the underlying cause, the others all laughed and said, “He speaks so pitifully that even we must relent—let him be!”  Originally, Baochai was only teasing, but upon hearing him mention his earlier talk about perusing miscellaneous books, she no longer wished to tease further and let him go.
Half a year into this year, she hasn’t touched a thread.”  Just then, a servant arrived: “Master invites Second Master—someone from Xinglong Street is here.”  Baoyu knew it must be the newly arrived official, Jia Yucun, so he frowned. Xi Ren rushed to fetch his robe. He grumbled while pulling on his boots, “There’s Father with him, so why call me? Must I greet that man every time?”  Xiangyun fanned herself, quipping, “It’s only natural that you meet important guests. Or your father wouldn’t summon you.”  Baoyu scowled, “It’s not he wants me. That man demands to see me.”  Xiangyun teased, “The adage says: ‘A cultured master invites many guests.’ He must admire your brilliance. You do have a special knack for pleasing, I guess.”  Baoyu retorted, “Please—save it. I’m the most mediocre of all, no interest in officialdom or associating with such people.”  Xiangyun shook her head in good humor, “Still your old ways. You’re grown now, and even if you don’t want to be a scholar or official, you should meet men of rank, discuss administrative matters, and build up a circle. If you spend your days only among us girls, what can come of that?”  Her words rankled Baoyu. He said sharply, “You’d best go chat in another room, or you’ll end up stifled by my ignorance!” Xi Ren, attempting to defuse the tension, explained, “Cousin Xiang, better not talk politics around him. Last time Miss Bao remarked something similar, and he stormed off, leaving her embarrassed.”  Baoyu said, “Now you see how I label such talk as nonsense. If Lin cousin ever uttered such nonsense, I’d have kept her at a distance, too.”  Hearing that, Xiangyun and Xi Ren both chuckled ironically, “So talk of ‘statecraft’ is nonsense?”  It happened that Lin Daiyu was drawing near, suspecting that with Xiangyun here, Baoyu would come around to discuss the golden qilin or some such trifling token. She had read enough “frivolous romances” in which minor tokens—jade ornaments, gold trinkets, embroidered sashes—led to fated couplings. Concerned that Baoyu and Xiangyun might form the sort of “talented scholar and beautiful maiden” scenario, she’d quietly approached to observe. But what she actually heard was Xiangyun extolling “managing finances” (jingji) to Baoyu, and then Baoyu telling Xi Ren, “Lin cousin never utters such rubbish. If she did, we’d become estranged.”  This statement pierced Daiyu’s heart with mingled joy and sorrow. She mused: He truly is my confidant, praising me in front of others and never minding suspicion. But if he’s wholeheartedly for me, why the persistent talk of “gold and jade,” or the presence of Sister Bao? If he’s mine, why is Sister Bao there at all…? She recalled her orphaned state, the fleeting illusions of her hopes, plus her own lingering illness. The doctors had remarked on her “deficient blood and feeble qi, risking a consumptive decline.” If it was true that she and Baoyu belonged together in spirit, how to fight her frailty? Brimming with complicated emotions, she could only weep silently. In that moment, she felt disinclined to enter the room, so she wiped her tears and withdrew. Baoyu, now dressed to meet Jia Yucun, spotted Daiyu heading off, apparently dabbing tears from her eyes. Rushing forward, he called, “Where are you going? Why are you crying again? Who offended you?” Daiyu turned and forced a tight smile: “Why talk nonsense? I’m not crying.”  Baoyu teased, “Come on—your tears haven’t even dried.” He reached out as if to wipe them away, but she stepped back: “You want to bring calamity on yourself, groping at me like that!”  Baoyu laughed, “I forgot myself for a moment.
Must be seventy or eighty catties in total.”  Then she asked, “But with so many mouth to feed upstairs and down, even that might not be enough, might it?”  Ping’er said, “They’re not for everyone, mind. Only the notable folks can each have a couple. Others, well, some might get some if they’re lucky, some might not.”  Old Mrs. Liu exclaimed, “Crabs this year cost a nickel a catty, so ten catties is half a tael, times five is two and a half taels, times three is seven taels five, plus the wine and cooking, that must be over twenty taels silver total! My Buddha! That single meal costs a year’s living for us farmers.”  Ping’er then asked, “Have you met with the Mistress?”  “Yes, we saw her,” Old Mrs. Liu nodded. “She told us to wait. But it’s getting on in the day, so we might as well set out. If it gets too late, we can’t get out of the city.”  “I’ll go and see,” Zhou Rui’s wife offered. She headed off but came back moments later, beaming. “Well, Old Mrs. Liu, you sure are in luck, stumbling right into a perfect chance.”  “What do you mean?” Ping’er asked. Zhou Rui’s wife explained, “The Second Mistress is currently in the Old Dowager’s quarters, so I quietly whispered to her, ‘Old Mrs. Liu wants to leave soon, worried about missing the gate closing.’ The Mistress said, ‘They brought all that produce from so far, let them stay overnight and go in the morning.’ Perfect fortune for you, right? But that’s not all— the Old Dowager overheard and asked, ‘Who’s Old Mrs. Liu?’ so the Mistress told her. Then the Old Dowager said, ‘I’ve been wanting to meet someone truly advanced in years, to chat about the old times— bring her over so I can see her.’ Isn’t that a stroke of luck you never dreamed of?”  She urged Old Mrs. Liu to come along. The old woman hesitated. “Look at me, dressed like this— how can I appear in front of them? Sister, just tell them I’ve gone.”  Ping’er laughed, “It’s fine! Our Old Dowager truly loves simple folk and pities the poor. She’s not like those cunning, fussy types. If you’re uneasy, Ms. Zhou and I can accompany you in.” And so, with Zhou Rui’s wife, she brought Old Mrs. Liu toward the Old Dowager’s rooms. At the second gate, the shift of junior footmen leapt to attention on seeing Ping’er. Two of them ran up:  “Miss Ping’er!”  She turned. “What now?”  One of them said, “It’s late, Miss—my mother’s ill at home, and I need to fetch a doctor. Please be kind and let me off for half a day.”  “You fellows are impossible, taking turns telling the Mistress you want leave— it’s always the same story. The other day it was Zhu’er, and Master (Baoyu) asked for him, but he wasn’t there. I had to cover for him, and then got scolded for ‘taking sides.’ Now today it’s you.”  Zhou Rui’s wife pleaded, “But truly, his mother’s unwell, Miss. Won’t you speak on his behalf?”  “All right, but be back first thing tomorrow. Don’t come lazing around half the day. Also, on your way out, see Wang. Tell him from Mistress: if the interest due isn’t handed in tomorrow, Mistress won’t wait— she’ll ‘graciously’ let him keep it for himself.”  Elated, the lad promised and dashed away. Eventually, Ping’er and Zhou Rui’s wife escorted Old Mrs. Liu into the Old Dowager’s rooms. At that time, all the ladies of the Garden were also in attendance.
They praised it. Next, they read Baochai’s:  She, precious of shape, by day behind a closed door. Herself draws water for the moss-filled pot. Rouge washed out, it left an autumn shade on the steps; Ice summoned, dew cast about the courtyard's soul. Pale to the extreme, a bloom’s true brilliance appears; Weighted by sorrow, could jade remain unscarred? She merits tribute as a pure White Empress— Silent and dignified, stands proud at day’s wane. Li Wan nodded, “As always, Sister Bao’s lines are solid.” Then Baoyu’s:  Autumn’s form, so delicate, leaning on gate after gate, Seven layered stems like piled snow in the pot. Emerging from her bath, the imperial beauty in ice’s reflection; At heart, Xi Shi, all jade in her soul. Dawn breezes can’t dispel a thousand sorrowful flecks, Past night’s drizzle only adds new tear-stains. She alone leans against a painted railing—seemingly pensive, Emotions swirl, the plaintive flute laments at dusk. He admitted Tanchun’s was better. Li Wan, however, favored Baochai for “substance.” At last, they pressured Lin Daiyu. She dashed off a poem in a breath, tossed it over. Everyone read:  A half-rolled Xiang curtain, half-shut gate, Ground ice for soil, carved jade for pot. Baoyu exclaimed in delight:  “Where does she get that approach?” Reading on:  Three parts of pear-blossom whiteness borrowed, One wisp of plum-blossom spirit gleaned. Moon-sprung fairy sewing pure white sleeves, Sighing autumn-worn maiden dabbing tear streaks. Shy, silent—whom can she confide in? Worn by the western breeze, the night turns dark. All declared it even more delicate and fresh. Li Wan thus decided, “If we want airy novelty, hers wins. For depth and fullness, Sister Bao’s. So Daiyu is second place.” Tanchun grinned, “Yes, that’s fair. Our ‘Xiao Xiang Consort’ stands second.” Li Wan said, “And our ‘Lord of Yihong’ is last— does that suit?” Baoyu laughed, “Mine truly is poor, so be it.” Yet then he quipped, “Between the ‘Fragrant Bank Lady’ and the ‘Xiao Xiang Consort,’ though, I find it hard to compare.” Li Wan objected, “Don’t fuss, or face a penalty.” Baoyu relented. Li Wan concluded:  “From now on, on the 2nd and 16th each month, we’ll gather at my place. Meanwhile, if you wish extra meets, that’s free play, but on the set days you must come. We’re done here, let’s disperse.” They parted, some returning home, some off to greet Grandmother or Lady Wang. At Yihong Court, Xi Ren had noticed earlier that a messenger from Jia Yun came bearing two pots of white begonias. She had the family servants place them properly, then took out six mace of silver and three hundred coppers to reward them, plus the laborers who carried the flowers. “Divide it up for wine,” she said. They tried refusing, but Xi Ren insisted. Then she inquired if any menservants stood ready at the back gate. The old women said yes, four men daily. Xi Ren said: “Good, we’ll have them hire a cart for delivering something soon, so we needn’t disturb the front.” They left. Back inside, Xi Ren prepared a tray to send to Xiangyun, but found the white silk jade-inlaid dish missing. She asked Qingwen, Qiuwen, Moxue, etc. They all looked at each other blankly. At length, Qingwen recalled, “It’s still at Third Miss’s place with the lychee we delivered; we never brought it back.” Xi Ren sighed, “Of so many common trays, you had to pick that one. If Lady Wang’s side is okay, Grandmother’s side is fine. But there are so many hands . . . let’s retrieve it.” So Qingwen declared she’d go get it.
It must mean he secretly values that ‘gold and jade’ talk, fears I’ll be upset, and feigns anger to mislead me.” Baoyu, for his part, thought, “No matter what, I’m happy as long as she goes along with me. I would gladly die for her—whether she knows this or not matters not, as long as it brings me closer to her.” Daiyu mused, “Go ahead and do as you wish. If you’re well, I am as well. But if you let yourself be lost in others, you push me away.”  Reader, these two in truth share one heart, yet ironically their yearning to be closer produces estrangement. Such were the private thoughts that long haunted them, too tangled to set forth entirely here. We return to their outward dispute. Once Baoyu heard Daiyu mention “fine marriage,” it clashed even more with his spirit, leaving him speechless with rage. In a fit of pique, he snatched the jade from his neck, bit his lip, and flung it violently to the ground. “What worthless thing! I’ll smash it to end this!” But that jade was exceedingly hard—despite the blow, it remained intact. Infuriated, Baoyu grabbed about for something heavier to break it. Alarmed, Daiyu wept, “Why destroy a mute object? If you must smash something, smash me instead!”  They argued louder and louder. Seeing Baoyu pounding the jade with all his might, Zijuan, Xueyan, and the others rushed to intervene. When they failed to pry it away from him, they summoned Xi Ren. She arrived in haste and managed to seize it from his grasp. Baoyu sneered, “What concern is it of yours if I destroy what’s mine?”  Seeing Baoyu’s face drained to a sallow shade, brow creased with anger, Xi Ren clutched his hand and, smiling, said, “There’s no point quarreling with Sister Lin over such a trifling thing. If you damage it, how will she not be distressed?” Hearing Xi Ren speak so understandingly, Daiyu realized that even Xi Ren seemed more compassionate than Baoyu. Overwhelmed, she broke down again in bitter sobs. Suddenly agitated, she coughed up the cooled remedy she had just drunk, retching “Wah!” in a gush. Zijuan leapt forward to catch it in a handkerchief, soiling it thoroughly. Xueyan massaged Daiyu’s back. Zijuan urged, “Even if you’re upset, miss, you must care for yourself. The medicine was just helping you recover. Now after a quarrel with Second Master, you’re vomiting it all. Should you fall ill, how would that burden Second Master’s heart?”  Baoyu, hearing this, felt the words strike his own heart. “So, even now, Daiyu isn’t as thoughtful as Zijuan is,” he thought. Observing Daiyu’s reddened face, tearful eyes, anger flushing her cheeks, tears mingling with sweat, her frail state, Baoyu regretted having quarreled. “I shouldn’t have fought her. And now I can’t relieve her suffering,” he lamented, his own tears falling in remorse. Xi Ren, seeing both of them crying piteously, felt her heart twinge. She discovered Baoyu’s hand was cold to the touch. Torn between coaxing Baoyu to restrain himself or comforting Daiyu, she too began to weep silently. Zijuan tidied the soiled handkerchief while gently fanning Daiyu. Not a word was spoken among the four, only their sniffles echoing. Eventually Xi Ren tried to break the tension, forcing a laugh at Baoyu: “If nothing else, consider how that tassel on your jade was made—does that not show you shouldn’t fight with Miss Lin?” At this, Daiyu, despite her illness, rushed over, seized the jade, and snatched up scissors to cut away at the tassel. Xi Ren and Zijuan tried to stop her, but not before she’d snipped off several threads. Sobbing, she cried, “All I’ve done is worthless. He doesn’t need me—someone else can fasten him a new one!”  Xi Ren hurriedly retrieved the jade, “What’s the use of that?
But if they want to come courting me, so be it. Let them keep sending gifts. I have my own plan.” Feeling content, she made no immediate move, letting them come a few times more until the tributes were sufficient. Then she planned to mention it to Lady Wang. That day, midday, Aunt Xue, Baochai, Daiyu, and some others were in Lady Wang’s rooms, all sharing watermelon. Wang Xifeng considered it a good opportunity, so she said to Lady Wang:  “Since Jin Chuan’er died, you’ve been short a maid in your service. Madam, might you have someone in mind to fill that spot? Then next month’s payroll will not be disrupted.” Lady Wang thought a moment: “Truly, do we need four or five of them? As long as I manage, we might simply leave that place unfilled, no need to follow an old ‘four maids’ rule.”  Xifeng smiled, “Yes, your reasoning is sound in principle; but the rest of the household staff might gossip—since every mistress’s room has four or five main maids. And saving that single tael of silver is hardly a big deal.”  Lady Wang considered further, “Alright. Then let’s keep the one-tael slot ‘technically’ open but unoccupied. The monthly tael can go to her younger sister, Yu Chuan’er. Jin Chuan’er served me for some time yet came to a sad end, so awarding her sister double pay is no big extravagance.” Xifeng promptly turned to Yu Chuan’er with an exaggerated grin: “Rejoice, rejoice!” Yu Chuan’er curtsied in thanks. Then Lady Wang asked, “I recall Zhao Yiniang and Zhou Yiniang get how much monthly?” Xifeng answered, “Two taels each, the standard. Zhao Yiniang gets another two for Huan, plus four strings of coins.” Lady Wang pressed, “So every month is fully disbursed to them? The other day I overheard a mention that one string of coins was shorted, how come?” Xifeng quickly explained:  “We never short them. But for their personal maids, the standard is one string of coins per person. Since last year, the ‘outer’ managers proposed a half-allowance for the Yiniangs’ maids, cutting that to five hundred coins each. With two maids each, that’s one string less. This arrangement was not my doing. I even suggested we revert to the old full pay for them, but the outer stewards insisted ‘No, we only have this budget.’ So, not my fault. Meanwhile, I distribute monthly wages on schedule—like it or not, no one can blame me. They used to wait for months at the outer offices but never got it smoothly, right?” Lady Wang only frowned, then changed the subject: “At the Old Ancestor’s place, there are eight maids on one-tael pay, correct?” Xifeng nodded: “Yes, well, only seven remain in practice, the eighth being Xi Ren.” Lady Wang said, “Yes, but Xi Ren belongs to Grandmother’s staff, not Baoyu’s, so that monthly pay is under the old lady’s name. Baoyu doesn’t have any one-tael maids. Xi Ren is still considered part of the old lady’s retinue.”  Xifeng said, “Indeed, Xi Ren remains accounted for in the old lady’s listing and draws that pay. Some might say, ‘Because Xi Ren is now with Baoyu, we can stop paying her as an old lady’s maid.’ But that’s not possible—unless we assigned another girl to the old lady in Xi Ren’s place. Or if we cut Xi Ren’s monthly from there, we’d have to add an equivalent for Huan’s staff to keep everything symmetrical. The seven bigger maids—Qingwen, Moxue, and so on—get a string each; the smaller ones—Jiahui, etc.—just five hundred each. That’s the old lady’s arrangement, so no one else can question it.”  Aunt Xue, smiling, said, “My, how Sister Feng’s words tumble like a cart of walnuts.
Then, kicking open a door, she barged in without waiting, seizing a servant from the Bao household and starting to beat him. Fearing that Jia Lian might leave, she roared at the door, “You harlot! How dare you steal your master’s man and then even use his wife to cover it up! Ping’er, come here—if these harlots keep mocking me, I’ll have none of it!” She then struck Ping’er several more times. Ping’er, feeling unjustly treated and unable to defend herself, began to cry bitterly. “What is the point of all this? Why drag me into this?” she wailed, as soon after, Fengjie also started beating the servant from the Bao household. Jia Lian, having drunk too much, entered, pleased at first; but upon seeing Fengjie and the commotion with Ping’er—which had clearly angered Ping’er and even brought Ping’er to tears—he scolded, “You harlot! Now you’ve resorted to physical violence!”  Ping’er, trembling, pleaded, “Why are you all whispering behind my back and dragging me into this?”  Fengjie, noticing Ping’er’s fear of Jia Lian, became even more furious and resumed beating her, all the while ordering that the servant from the Bao household be struck instead. Ping’er, now desperate, dashed out seeking a knife with the intent to end it all. Outside, several maids and little servants rushed to intercept and console her. In the midst of the chaos, Fengjie, seeing Ping’er attempting self-harm, collapsed into Jia Lian’s arms, crying out, “They—all these miserable folks—are making a fool of me! Go ahead, strangle me if you must!”  Jia Lian, so incensed that he pulled a sword from the wall and shouted, “There’s no need for you to seek death! I’m truly at my wits’ end—let’s kill them all! I’ll pay for this with my life, so that everything will be set right!”  Just then, as the fracas reached its climax, You and several others burst in and said, “What is the meaning of this? We were all well a moment ago, and now chaos has broken out!”  Jia Lian, now three parts drunk and displaying his authority with a dangerous air, seemed intent on taking his anger out on Fengjie. Seeing this, Madame Wang and Mrs. Xing rushed forward, scolding, “You vile scum! How can you behave in such a base manner in front of Grandmother? Remember, Grandmother is here!”  Jia Lian sneered, “It’s all Grandmother’s fault—she spoiled Feng! I’m even angry enough to curse out loud!”  Mrs. Xing, snatching the sword from him, cried, “Get out at once!”  Jia Lian began babbling nonsense, drooling as he stammered, “Oh, please, don’t… I’m not worth your anger…”  Grandmother Jia, fuming, declared, “I know very well that you are not to be taken lightly! Send for your father at once and let him see what you’ve done!”  Hearing this, Jia Lian staggered out in a daze. In his indignation, he refused to return home and instead went to the study. Meanwhile, Mrs. Xing and Madame Wang continued to discuss Fengjie. Grandmother Jia remarked, “What is there to fuss about? You young ones are as greedy as cats—how can you possibly be trusted to keep a secret? Ever since you were little, everyone has been treated like this. It’s all my fault for letting you drink too much and get all sour!”  This remark made everyone laugh. Grandmother Jia added, “Rest assured—tomorrow I’ll have your son-in-law apologize on your behalf, so do not let yourself be humiliated today.” She then scolded, “As for that Ping’er—her little feet—I always thought well of her. How can she behave so badly behind our backs?”  You and the others laughed, “It isn’t Ping’er’s fault; it is Feng who uses her as a scapegoat. When the couples quarrel, they always take it out on Ping’er.
The other day, you gave rings to the other girls, and I received one from them, but now you’ve brought me one in person—I see how thoughtful you are. A trinket is a trinket, but it shows your sincere heart.”  Xiangyun asked, “Who gave it to you previously?”  Xi Ren said, “Miss Bao (Baochai) did.”  Xiangyun sighed, “So she’s the one who gave it. I was sure it was Miss Lin (Daiyu). Day in and day out, I keep telling people there’s truly no one kinder than Sister Bao. How sad we aren’t real sisters! If I only had a sister like that, no parents in the world wouldn’t matter.” Her eyes were reddening again. Baoyu interjected, “All right, no more talk about that.”  Xiangyun eyed him and teased, “I get it: you’re worried your dear Lin cousin might overhear me praising Bao sister. Are you afraid she’ll be displeased?”  Xi Ren, chuckling at Xiangyun’s frankness, said, “Miss Xiang, you’re older now, yet still so direct.”  Baoyu chimed in, “I always say trying to converse with you all is precarious.”  Xiangyun cut him short, “Dear older brother, spare me your words that give me gooseflesh. You only talk big in front of me, but with your Lin cousin—goodness knows how you sweet-talk her.”  Laughing, Xi Ren spoke up, “Let’s not banter. I do have a favor to ask of you, Miss Xiang. There’s a pair of shoes, and the insole has come loose. I’ve been under the weather and can’t manage the sewing. Could you find a moment to fix them?”  Xiangyun asked, “Why me? You have so many skilled seamstresses in your household. Why ask me to do your needlework?”  Xi Ren clarified with a smile, “You must know, in this room, Master Baoyu’s personal items are not made by outside needleworkers.”  Realizing these were for Baoyu, Xiangyun grinned, “Oh—so they’re his shoes, are they? Fine, I’ll do them for you, on one condition: that it’s your request. I can’t be saddled with tasks from everyone.”  Xi Ren laughed, “Where do you get your ideas? As if I’d trouble you for something of mine. Let me say plainly, yes, they are for him, but just accept my thanks, and never mind whose they are.”  Xiangyun teased, “I recall how much sewing I’ve done for you in the past. I’d do it, but you see, the reason I balk at sewing for him is that I heard the other day a fan case I’d made was compared with some other, and in a fit, it got snipped in two. So now you want me to do more for him? What am I, your slave?”  Baoyu intervened, “I didn’t know it was your workmanship at the time.”  Xi Ren likewise: “He truly had no idea it was yours. I tricked him, telling him, ‘We found a new craftswoman outside—her skill is truly splendid, so we tested one piece, a fan case, to see if it’s any good.’ He believed it and showed it to folks. Somehow that offended someone else, who tore it up. Later, when he wanted another made, I revealed it was your handiwork—he was mortified. Pardon us.”  Xiangyun laughed, “The culprit is none other than Miss Lin, I guess. She’s hardly reason to fuss over my trifling work. If she’s so adept, let her do the handiwork!”  Xi Ren said, “It’s not that. She rarely does needlework these days. The old lady fears it might tire her, and her doctors say she needs calm rest. She rarely even picks up a needle. Last year she spent all year making a scented pouch for him. Half a year into this year, she hasn’t touched a thread.”  Just then, a servant arrived: “Master invites Second Master—someone from Xinglong Street is here.”  Baoyu knew it must be the newly arrived official, Jia Yucun, so he frowned.
Where is your tutor?” Sensing paternal wrath, Jia Huan seized the moment, “Father, I…didn’t run for mischief. I was near the well when I glimpsed a drowned maid. Her head was huge, her body was bloated, it was dreadful! So I bolted.” Jia Zheng, both startled and pained, asked, “Who could possibly have jumped in our well? Such a thing has never happened in our house, known for leniency with servants. Perhaps my neglect has emboldened the house staff to oppress them—leading to a tragic death. Should outsiders learn of this, how can I show my face to our ancestors?” He then ordered, “Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!” The servants complied. But Jia Huan hurried to cling to Jia Zheng’s robe and knelt:  “Father, don’t be angry. No one beyond the servants in Lady Wang’s quarters knows. My mother told me…” He paused to glance around. Jia Zheng signaled the bystanders away, and they withdrew. Jia Huan whispered, “Mother told me: earlier, in Lady Wang’s chambers, Baoyu tried to force himself on Mother’s maid Jin Chuan’er. Failing that, he had her beaten. In her humiliation, Jin Chuan’er threw herself down the well in anger.”  He had barely finished when Jia Zheng’s face turned deathly pale. He roared, “Bring Baoyu here at once!” Fuming, he stormed toward his study, raging, “If anyone comes pleading for him, I’ll surrender them fatherhood and property altogether. Let me renounce these official robes, shave my head, and find some quiet place to end my miserable life, thus sparing the ancestors more disgrace at having such a son!” Onlookers, seeing him in that state, realized this again concerned Baoyu; not daring to intervene, they scattered. Jia Zheng, breath ragged, slumped into a chair, tears streaming, repeatedly ordering, “Bring Baoyu! Get a stick, get a rope, bar the gates! If word passes inside, he’ll be killed on the spot!” The pages had no choice but to concur and search out Baoyu. Baoyu, having been warned by Jia Zheng not to move, sensed peril but did not anticipate Jia Huan’s added accusations. He paced the hallway for a chance to send word inside but found no suitable messenger—nor was his page boy Bei Ming around. Desperate, he cornered an old female servant:  “Hurry in, tell them Father’s going to beat me—quick, please, it’s urgent!” But Baoyu spoke hastily, and the old servant, being half-deaf, only heard “jump in the well.” She said, “If he wants to jump, let him jump. What are you afraid of?” Realizing she was of no help, Baoyu pleaded, “Call my boy to me!” She misread it as him prattling about the concluded matter. The poor woman just shrugged: “Why fuss? Everything’s resolved, and Lady Wang gave some silver. All done.” Baoyu, at wits’ end, saw that words were wasted on her. Before long, Jia Zheng’s attendants arrived and dragged Baoyu in front of him. Seeing him, eyes inflamed with fury, Jia Zheng wasted no time questioning any details about “roaming with actors” or “neglecting studies.” He simply snapped, “Gag him and beat him to death!” The servants, trembling, pinned Baoyu to a bench and raised their heavy wooden paddle. After ten or so strikes, Baoyu, knowing it was futile to beg mercy, only sobbed “woo-woo,” muffled by his tears. Jia Zheng, deeming the blows too gentle, kicked aside the man wielding the board, seized it himself, and laid on another dozen strokes, each harder than the last. Baoyu, never having suffered such agony, at first screamed and struggled, but gradually his voice died away, leaving faint whimpers. Everyone, alarmed by the severity, rushed forward trying to stop him, but Jia Zheng refused:  “Ask him what abominations he’s done. Is it excusable? You lot have spoiled him, now you’d shield him at the brink? Someday if he kills father or betrays emperor, would you still intervene too late?” The crowd, sensing his fury was unstoppable, scrambled to find a way to alert someone inside.
Even the quilt cannot resist the force of autumn’s gusts,   While the ticking of a broken clock hastens the urgent rain. All night long, the chill persists, as if a lone mourner weeps by the lamp. In a desolate courtyard shrouded in faint mist, beneath sparse bamboo and a vacant window,   I wonder—when will the wind and rain ever cease? Already tears have soaked the window’s gauze. After finishing her poem, Daiyu set her brush aside, intending to sleep. Soon a maid announced, “Second Young Master Bao has arrived!” Before the words were finished, Bao Yu appeared—wearing a large straw hat and a raincoat. Daiyu couldn’t help but laugh, “From where has such a fisherman come?”  Bao Yu quickly inquired, “How are you today? Have you taken your medicine? How many meals have you had?” As he spoke, he removed his hat and raincoat. Lifting a lantern in one hand while shielding his face with the other, he examined Daiyu and smiled, “You look much better today.”  Daiyu observed that beneath his raincoat he wore a half-worn short red silk jacket fastened with a green scarf, revealing green silk trousers decorated with floral patterns, and his cotton gown—embroidered with gilt thread and butterfly motifs—completed his ensemble. Daiyu asked, “Weren’t you afraid of the rain? Yet your shoes and socks appear remarkably clean.”  Bao Yu laughed, “This whole outfit is complete. I only just got a new pair of tangwood clogs, which I took off under the eaves.”  Daiyu then inspected his raincoat and hat—clearly not mass-produced market items but finely made. “What kind of grass were they woven from? No wonder they feel so smooth and not prickly,” she observed. Bao Yu explained, “These three items were gifts from the Prince of Beijing. On rainy days he himself wears them at home. If you like them, I’ll have a set made for you. And if nothing else, it’s the hat that intrigues me most: its top is adjustable—when it snows, you remove the bamboo ties and wear just the rim. Both men and women use it. I’ll give you one to wear when it snows in winter.”  Daiyu laughed, “I don’t want that. Wearing it would make me look like one of those theatrical fisherwomen in costume.” As soon as she spoke, she realized that her remark echoed Bao Yu’s earlier words; mortified, her face flushed scarlet, and she buried her face in the table, choked with tears. Bao Yu, however, paid her no heed. Noticing a poem on the table, he picked it up and read it aloud with appreciation. Daiyu quickly snatched it from him and, in a fit of anger, nearly set the lamp afire. Bao Yu laughed, “I’ve memorized it already!”  Daiyu said, “I’m tired now—please, go on. I’ll come back tomorrow.”  Bao Yu then reached into his pocket and produced a gold watch about the size of a walnut. Glancing at its hands—which indicated a time between the late seventh and early eighth hour—he quickly tucked it away, saying, “I should let you rest; I’ve disturbed you all day.” With that, he donned his raincoat and hat once more, stepped out, then reentered and asked, “What would you like to eat? Tell me, so that tomorrow morning when I return to Grandmother’s, everything will be clear.”  Daiyu smiled, “I’ll think it over tonight and tell you in the morning. Now, listen—the rain grows heavier; please hurry. Is anyone with you?”  Two maids replied, “Yes, outside someone is holding an umbrella and lighting a lantern.”  Daiyu laughed, “A lantern at this hour—really?”  Bao Yu said, “It matters not; it’s a goat-horn style, which isn’t afraid of the rain.”  Hearing this, Daiyu went to the bookshelf, retrieved a glass lantern decorated with embroidered motifs, had a small candle lit, and handed it to Bao Yu, saying, “This one shines brighter—ideal for rainy nights.”  Bao Yu replied, “I do have one like that, but I worry it might fall and break, so I left it unlit.”  Daiyu remarked, “If a lantern falls, it’s the lantern that loses value—what matters is the person.
Baoyu read, laughed, and asked the old woman:  “Has he come alone? Did he bring the flowers?” She replied, “Yes, two pots of them.” Baoyu said, “Alright, tell him I understand, I appreciate his kindness. Place them in my rooms.”  And so, continuing with Cui Mo, he arrived at Tanchun’s Autumn Fresh Hall, only to find Baochai, Daiyu, Yingchun, and Xichun already there. Seeing him come, all laughed, “Here’s another one!” Tanchun herself remarked:  “I had the notion to form a little circle. I wrote you all a note, and see, not one has declined. This show that my single summon enticed them all.” Baoyu grinned, “If we’d done this earlier in spring, we could have formed a club. Now in the autumn, we’re a bit late.” Daiyu said, “It’s not too late. No regrets. Just you, don’t keep pushing me—I dare not join.” Yingchun teased, “If you’re too shy, who dares join?” Baoyu said, “This is a serious undertaking, let’s all share ideas. No modest disclaimers. Everyone speak—Sister Bao, Sister Lin, propose something.” Baochai said, “Why hurry? We’re missing a few people.”  Just then Li Wan arrived, remarking, “Oh dear—how refined! Forming a Poetry Club, I claim the leading seat. Last spring, I had half a mind for it. But I can’t compose verses well, so I kept quiet. Now that Third Sister’s raised the idea, let me come help see it done.”  Daiyu teased, “Yes, but first we must discard old forms of address, so we call each other poet-ladies instead of the usual sister or aunt. Or at least adopt courtesy names, so it’s not so mundane.” Li Wan nodded, “Indeed. Why not adopt courtesy names? Or ‘style names’ or ‘titles’— we’ll call each other that to keep it elegant. I shall call myself ‘Dao Xiang Lao Nong’ (the Farmer of Rice-Fragrance). I’m old enough anyway.” Tanchun laughed, “I’ll label myself ‘Autumn Fresh Dweller’ or something.” Baoyu objected, “Dweller or Lay-person, so plain. We have phoenix trees and plantains around, name yourself after them, that’s more interesting.” Tanchun said, “I like the banana leaves, so let’s say ‘Banana-Leaf Sojourner.’” The others found that witty. Daiyu teased, “Then quickly, haul you in for venison. Zhuangzi’s text says something about ‘banana leaves covering a deer’s remains.’ You calling yourself the Banana-lodge Deer begs we butcher you!” Everyone roared with laughter. Tanchun retorted, “I’ll find you a suitable title soon, see if I can’t get even.” Then she said, “She lives in the Xiao Xiang Pavilion, loves to weep, so we’ll style her ‘Xiao Xiang Consort’—since her tears might turn her bamboos into those spotted-lament ‘Xiang Fei’ stalks!” Everyone clapped, calling it apt. Daiyu hung her head in silence. Li Wan smiled, “I have one for Sister Bao, just three characters.” The group asked what. She said, “I dub her ‘Heng Wu jun’—‘The Lady of Fragrant Bank.’” Tanchun exclaimed, “That’s splendid.”  Baoyu asked, “Then me? Find me something.” Baochai teased, “You’re best labeled ‘Busy For Nothing.’” Li Wan said, “You used to call yourself ‘Lord of the Crimson Cave Blossoms’— that’s enough.” Baoyu dismissed, “Childish nonsense. Give me another.” Baochai said, “How about ‘Wealthy Idle Person’?
He then saw Baochai and Tanchun standing together, chatting as they watched cranes dance. When Daiyu appeared, the three of them exchanged words. Soon Baoyu arrived, and Tanchun laughed, “How’s Brother Baoyu? I haven’t seen you in three whole days!” Baoyu grinned, “How are you, dear sister? Just the other day I was asking about you with the eldest sister.” Tanchun said, “Brother Baoyu, come here and talk with me.” Upon hearing this, Baoyu left Baochai and Baochai, and accompanied Tanchun until they reached a pomegranate tree. Tanchun then said, “Haven’t our masters been calling you these days?” Baoyu laughed, “They haven’t called me.” Tanchun continued, “Yesterday I thought I heard that they ordered you to go out.” Baoyu laughed, “That must have been a misunderstanding; they didn’t call me.” Tanchun laughed again, “Over these months, I’ve managed to save up about ten taels. You should spend some of it so that when you go out tomorrow—perhaps pick up a fine painting or a delicate trinket—bring something back for me.” Baoyu replied, “When I wander through the city, in the grand halls and temples, I see nothing novel or exquisite—only the same old gold, jade, bronze, and porcelain antiques, or else silks, food, and clothing.” Tanchun said, “Who needs those? I’d be perfectly satisfied with the small basket made from willow twigs, the fragrant bamboo root box, or even a wind stove made of glued clay—all that pleases me. But everyone seems to love those things and scrambles to grab them.” Baoyu laughed, “So that’s what you want? It’s nothing; spend a few taels on them for the boys, and you can have two carts’ worth.” Tanchun then said, “Do the servants know? You must pick out something that is both interesting and unpretentious; bring me several pieces. I’d even have you make a pair of shoes for me like the ones you bought last time—better crafted than that pair!” Baoyu laughed, “Speaking of shoes, your mention reminds me of a story. Once, while wearing a pair, I happened to meet our Master. He wouldn’t accept them and asked, ‘Who made these?’ I dared not mention Third Sister, so I said they were a gift from my birthday aunt. When he heard that, he didn’t know what to say—then he lamented, ‘Why waste human effort and fine materials on such things?’ I later told Xi Ren, and she said, ‘That’s fine—but Aunt Zhao complained bitterly: even proper brothers, with shoes and socks in disarray, have nothing to complain about when making such items!’” Tanchun’s face suddenly grew grave. “Tell me, how absurd can this get? Am I to be the one making shoes? Does Huan’er not have her share? Clothes are clothes, shoes and socks are shoes and socks—when the maidservants and mistresses of the house all grumble, who are they even complaining to? I might casually make a pair or a half-pair whenever I feel like it for a brother; whatever I choose is as I please—who would dare oppose me? That, too, just makes him even more vexed.” Baoyu nodded with a smile, “You know not—he naturally has his own ideas in his heart.” At that moment, Tanchun, growing exasperated, twisted her head and said, “You’ve become muddled too! His ideas are, by nature, low and base. He simply thinks whatever he does is right. As for me, I only acknowledge the Lady Dowager and the Mistress—others I disregard. Even among my sisters and brothers, I treat those who are kind to me well, and those who aren’t I care not for. I’m not one to mention others, but he is so muddle-headed that it’s unbelievable! And the jokes—why, just the other day when I used the money you bought to purchase those playthings for me, a couple of days later he remarked that I had no money left, how miserable I was.
If he continues, then expel him. One must consider not only his own mother but also the madams.”  Fengjie then said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and give him forty strokes. If he dares drink again, he won’t be allowed near the wine.”  Old Madam Lai’s household agreed, and soon Zhou Rui’s and Zhang Cai’s families arrived with their accounts. Fengjie declared, “My daughter-in-law is here to pick up her mother-in-law.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded. Old Madam Lai said, “What is the matter? Tell me, and I shall decide.”  Fengjie explained, “At my birthday the other day, while no one was outside to manage things, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he sat there cursing instead. When two women entered, he took the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of buns all over the courtyard. After everyone left, I sent Cai Ming to scold him—and he ended up cursing Cai Ming. Such lawlessness! Why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Hit him, scold him, and let him amend his ways. Expelling him outright is unthinkable since he is not our own son. He is merely the attendant of the madams; if we expel him, the madams’ honor will suffer. I say, let Grandmother teach him a lesson with a few lashes; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never near the wine again.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt again and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai then instructed, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I’ll have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt once more before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse consented as they escorted them away. Later, Li Wan and the others returned to the garden. That evening, Fengjie had many old, well-used painting tools brought out and delivered to the garden. Baochai and the others selected what they needed; of the assorted items, only half were usable. An inventory was drawn up for Fengjie to purchase the missing supplies—but we need not go into further detail. One day, word arrived that the dye for the silk and the preliminary sketches had been delivered. Bao Yu would assist Xiuchun with the work, while Tan Chun, Li Wan, Yingchun, Baochai, and the others would gather there—first to admire the paintings, and then to have their meetings. Noticing the cool weather and the lengthening nights, Baochai went to Grandmother Jia’s room to discuss arranging some needlework. By day she visited Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang twice, inevitably sitting with them. In the garden, the sisters would occasionally chat as well. Thus, during the day there was little free time, and by night the girls worked under the lamplight until around the third watch. Every year after the spring and autumn equinoxes, Daiyu’s old illness would flare up—and this autumn, having spent extra time with Grandmother, she felt overtaxed; she soon began coughing again, feeling worse than before. Consequently, she rarely left her room and confined herself to recuperation. Sometimes, feeling isolated, she longed for a sister’s company—but when Baochai and the others visited and exchanged a few words, she would soon tire of conversation. Everyone, aware of her delicate condition, forgave her for her curt receptions and lax manners. That day, Baochai visited Daiyu and broached the subject of her illness. Baochai said, “The doctors we’ve seen are fine, but the medicines you take never seem to work. Perhaps we should invite a master physician to examine you. If your illness were cured, wouldn’t that be wonderful? Every year you suffer through spring and summer—though you’re neither old nor young, it is simply not right.”  Daiyu replied, “It is hopeless. I know my illness is incurable. And besides, judging by how I appear at my best, one can see…”  Baochai nodded, “Exactly.
Not a word was spoken among the four, only their sniffles echoing. Eventually Xi Ren tried to break the tension, forcing a laugh at Baoyu: “If nothing else, consider how that tassel on your jade was made—does that not show you shouldn’t fight with Miss Lin?” At this, Daiyu, despite her illness, rushed over, seized the jade, and snatched up scissors to cut away at the tassel. Xi Ren and Zijuan tried to stop her, but not before she’d snipped off several threads. Sobbing, she cried, “All I’ve done is worthless. He doesn’t need me—someone else can fasten him a new one!”  Xi Ren hurriedly retrieved the jade, “What’s the use of that? My mouth outran my sense—I’m to blame.” Baoyu snapped at Daiyu, “Cut it all you like! I won’t wear it anymore!”  Their shouting caused a commotion. Some older servants, hearing Daiyu’s crying, her vomiting, and Baoyu’s smashing of the jade, feared things had spiraled out of control. They quickly reported to Jia Mu and Lady Wang. The two ladies, in the midst of more significant matters, heard the urgent tone and rushed to the garden. Xi Ren muttered, “Why alert the Old Lady and Mistress?” Zijuan, assuming Xi Ren had done so herself, blamed her in turn. When Jia Mu and Lady Wang arrived, finding Baoyu speechless and Daiyu silent, they asked what had caused the fracas. Yet they discovered no clear reason. Frustrated, they instead scolded Xi Ren and Zijuan: “Why were you not minding them properly so that such a row erupted?” The two maids, left without explanation, endured the reprimand. Eventually, Jia Mu led Baoyu away, restoring calm. Another day passed, bringing them to the third, which was Xue Pan’s birthday. At his home a banquet was laid out with theatrical performances. The Jia family were all set to attend, yet Baoyu had offended Daiyu, and they had not mended fences. He felt contrite and listless, lacking the spirit to attend. Thus he feigned illness and did not go. Daiyu, having only minor heatstroke, heard that he was also staying behind, thinking, “He loves feasting and theatrics. For him to skip it must be because of last night’s quarrel—or that he’s aware I’m not going, and so he lost interest. But I truly regret cutting the tassel from his jade. Perhaps now he’ll never wear it again, unless I fix it myself.” With such remorse in her heart, she was consumed by regret. Seeing both Baoyu and Daiyu refuse to join the others, Jia Mu bemoaned, “Oh, what grudge in a past life has me saddled with these two willful children? Not a day passes without them vexing me! Indeed, as the saying goes: ‘Fated foes inevitably cross paths!’ If I could just close my eyes and sever my breath, they can carry on their quarrels all they want. At least I’d no longer see or worry. But fate won’t let me die soon!” Lamenting so, the elderly lady shed tears. Word of these remarks reached both Baoyu and Daiyu. Neither had heard the proverb, “Fated foes inevitably cross paths,” but now, hearing it was like a Zen awakening. Each pondered it, tears welling in their eyes. Though they did not meet, one sobbed in her Xiao Xiang Pavilion, gazing at the wind, the other sighed by moonlight in the Pear-Fragrance Courtyard. As the proverb ran, “living in two different places yet sharing one heart.”  Xi Ren told Baoyu, “This is all your fault. Remember, whenever some servant couple fought, you’d scold the boys for failing to grasp a girl’s heart. But now you’re the one quarreling with a young lady! Tomorrow is the fifth (Duanwu festival), an auspicious day. If you two carry on like enemies, the Old Lady will be even more upset, and everyone else will be on edge. Listen to me—take a moment, apologize, and let things be as before. Isn’t that best?” Baoyu was left uncertain whether to comply or not.
You’re growing more brazen by the day—have you no sense of decency?”  Before she could finish, someone outside shouted, “Ah, wonderful!” Startled, both turned to see Wang Xifeng rushing inside with a grin, “So there you are! The Old Lady’s been ranting at the sky and the earth about you two, ordering me to check whether you’ve made up. I told her you’d be fine on your own within three days, but she said I was lazy and forced me here. Indeed, I see you’ve made peace on your own, so I’m spared the trouble of mediating. Truly, you’re like ‘two roosters with locked spurs’: You fight, then cling tight—why the big fuss? Come along and soothe the Old Lady, or you’ll worry her to death.” With that, she seized Daiyu by the arm to lead her away. Daiyu called out for her maids, but none came. Wang Xifeng laughed, “Why bother them? I can look after you.” She dragged Daiyu away, with Baoyu trailing in their wake. Exiting the garden, they arrived at Jia Mu’s quarters. Wang Xifeng said, “I told our Old Ancestor there was no need to send me—these two would reconcile on their own. She wouldn’t believe, forced me to come mediate. But I found them nestling together, perfectly fine. Tell me, what’s there for me to do?” She made the entire household burst into laughter. At that moment, Baochai was also present. Daiyu, speechless, took a seat next to Jia Mu. Baoyu, having nothing else to say, turned to Baochai and teased, “Today’s my big brother Xue Pan’s birthday, and I’m sick—I haven’t even paid him a courtesy. He might think I’m shunning him. Sister, please explain that I truly am unwell.”  Baochai responded, “Goodness, must that be spelled out? If you had the energy, you wouldn’t disturb him, and if you don’t, you’re hardly at fault. He won’t blame you. You’re all brothers—no need to worry about that.”  Baoyu beamed, “As long as you understand my predicament.” Then, “Sister, why didn’t you attend the show?”  Baochai answered, “The heat is unbearable. I watched two acts and nearly fainted, so I excused myself saying I felt unwell. But the guests hadn’t dispersed, so I had to claim I was unwell. Why ask me?”  Hearing her explanation, Baoyu reddened a bit, feeling embarrassed, then forced a laugh: “They always compare you to Lady Yang—indeed, you seem pampered from birth.”  Baochai flushed and, on the verge of anger, realized she shouldn’t make a fuss. Reflecting for a moment, she found she couldn’t maintain composure and, coloring deeper, managed a sardonic laugh: “I may be Yang Guifei, but I lack a good elder brother or cousin to be my Yang Guozhong!”  Just as she finished, a maid named Liang’er came searching for her fan and jokingly said to Baochai, “I bet Sister Baochai is hiding it. Please give it back, dear sister!” Baochai scolded sharply, “You be careful what you say! Do I ever play about with anyone? Go pester those merry girls who banter and jest all day. Look elsewhere for your missing fan!” Frightened, Liang’er backed away. Baoyu, realizing he’d once again spoken rashly in front of Baochai, felt even more ill at ease, so he hurriedly turned away to chat with someone else. Daiyu overheard Baoyu teasing Baochai, which gave her some secret satisfaction, and she nearly butted in to exploit the moment. Yet, at the same time, Baochai seized the chance to reprove Liang’er. Daiyu, to fill the gap, asked affably, “Sister Bao, what two acts did you watch?”  But now Baochai, annoyed both by Baoyu’s prattle and the missing fan, saw Daiyu’s hint of pleasure and surmised she was amused at Baoyu’s earlier teasing.
If I broke a plate or something, you’d scold me. Better not risk it.” Baoyu rejoined, “Don’t be silly. All these items are merely borrowed from the world. If you enjoy ripping a fan to hear the sound, so be it—just don’t do it in a rage. If you delight in the crash of porcelain, you might even break a dish. Just not from anger. That’s real cherishing: using them how you like.” Encouraged, Qingwen teased, “Is that so? Then hand me a fan to rip, so I can relish the sound!” Baoyu, in high spirits, offered her a fan. Taking it, she promptly tore it in two with a crisp “rip.” Baoyu clapped and laughed, “Marvelous—rip it louder!” She tore a few more times, sending fragments fluttering. Just then, Miasue (麝月) arrived, gasping, “Is that how you amuse yourselves—wanton destruction!” Baoyu snatched Miasue’s fan, gave it to Qingwen, who also shredded it, making both of them laugh merrily. Miasue grumbled, “You’re using my fan to amuse yourselves!” Baoyu laughed, “Look in the fan-chest for a better one.” Miasue said, “If that’s your attitude, why not bring out the whole lot for her to shred?” Baoyu said with a grin, “Sure—go fetch them.” Miasue shot back, “I’ll not commit such mischief. If you want them, get them yourself!” Qingwen, stifling a laugh, leaned back on the couch. “I’ve had enough for now—tomorrow we’ll tear some more. How about that?” Baoyu joked: “They say, ‘A thousand gold coins can’t buy a smile’—how many fans can equal that?” Laughing, they sat down. Hearing the noise, Xi Ren came over, so Qingwen set aside the matter. A small maid named Jia Hui collected the torn fan remnants. Thus ended their revelry for the night. —  Early the next day at noon, Lady Wang, Baochai, Daiyu, and the other young ladies were gathered in Jia Mu’s quarters. A servant announced, “Miss Shi’s here!” and soon Shi Xiangyun arrived, accompanied by her retinue of maids and matrons. Baochai and Daiyu hurried out to greet her in the courtyard, exchanging warm salutations. Xiangyun, two or three months older, quickly drew them close; they led her inside to pay respects. Jia Mu greeted her fondly:  “So hot—take off that outer robe.” Xiangyun complied. Lady Wang teased, “Why wear so much in this heat?” Xiangyun laughed, “My second aunt insisted upon it! I’d never choose it myself.” Baochai chimed in, “She’s known for wearing others’ clothes. Remember that time, a year or so ago, she put on Baoyu’s robe and boots, plus his sash, and from behind looked just like him, only with a couple extra ornaments. Grandma even called, ‘Baoyu, mind that lamp overhead!’ She didn’t realize it wasn’t him until we all burst out laughing, and Grandma said, ‘Look how fetching you are dressed like a lad!’”  Daiyu added, “That’s nothing. The year before last, we’d just brought her here for two days, and one snowy day, the Old Lady and Aunt might have returned from a formal visit. A brand-new bright red ape-fur cloak of the Old Lady’s was left lying around. When no one was looking, she put it on—too large and long, so she tied a towel around her waist, went out in the backyard chasing snowmen. Fell headlong in a drift—completely covered in snow!” Everyone laughed reminiscing. Baochai laughed, “Ask Nurse Zhou—does she still behave so mischievously?” Nurse Zhou only smiled. Yingchun added, “Playful is one thing, but she talks incessantly, day or night. As she dozes off, she’s still gossiping.” Lady Wang said, “She’s older now—someone’s looking at her for marriage.
You’re as reliable as they come. I intend to speak with Grandmother and have her keep you in the house. You’re far superior to those new ones—once you’re in, your face will change; they might even make you an official concubine, bestowing honor and prestige. You are a strong-minded girl. As the saying goes, ‘gold remains gold in exchange.’ Who would have thought that Lord Jia would take notice? Now that you have arrived, your longtime ambition is fulfilled; you’ll also silence those who sneer at you. Follow me back to Grandmother’s.”  At this, Yuan Yang’s face turned scarlet. She tried to pull her hand away, but Mrs. Xing, noticing her embarrassment, added, “What’s there to be shy about? You needn’t say a word—just come with me.” Yuan Yang, still lowering her head, refused to move. Mrs. Xing persisted, “Do you truly not want to? If you really refuse, you are nothing but a foolish maid. Think: if Grandmother doesn’t treat you as her own, then you’ll forever be regarded as a mere servant. In a few years, if you are forced into a marriage, you’ll remain a servant forever. Come with us—you know my temperament is gentle, and Lord Jia treats you well. In a year or two, if you bear a son and a daughter, you’ll be right at my side. In our household, who wouldn’t follow you? If you remain unappreciated by your master all your life, then you’ve missed your chance. Now, what if he were to lay hands on you? That would be a disaster indeed.”  Yuan Yang coldly laughed, “What nonsense! I simply won’t go.”  Ping’er interjected softly, “Sister, you need not worry. We’ve already reached a consensus. I’ll tell you everything later.”  Mrs. Xing, smiling broadly, then rose and said, “Now, go and attend to your own duties. I’ll have dinner prepared and then come back.”  Fengjie, overhearing all this, thought to herself, “Yuan Yang has always had a generous heart. Even if I propose this, will she agree? I must go first; then, once Mrs. Xing arrives, if she complies I’ll smoothly withdraw. But if not—if Mrs. Xing suspects and then uses her influence to cause trouble for me—I’ll be in a pickle. In that case, I might as well go together with them. If she agrees, no one will suspect a thing.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just now, my aunt sent over two cages of quail, which I had ordered fried to be served with Madam’s dinner. When I arrived at the gate, I saw the boys carrying a carriage saying that Madam’s carriage had been taken away for repairs. Perhaps it is best if I ride in my own carriage and go together.”  Mrs. Xing, pleased with the plan, ordered her servants to prepare new garments. Soon, Fengjie, having finished her tasks and attended to her duties, along with her maid, rode in a carriage to Grandmother’s. Meanwhile, after dinner, Fengjie returned to her room. As she recounted the incident to Ping’er, Ping’er shook her head and laughed, “From what I can see, it may not be so proper after all. When we speak in private, his ideas might not be accepted. We’ll just have to see.”  Fengjie replied, “Madam will surely come into the room to discuss it. If they agree, that’s all; if not, it’s no great loss. Besides, you mustn’t worry—I’ll send some quail, along with other accompaniments, prepared for the meal. And what about the extra clothes you mentioned? They must be sorted out for use.”  Li Wan interjected, “I won’t meddle in these matters; just take care of my own affairs so that I may rest—there’s no need for the girls to fuss over me.”  Fengjie quickly said, “Dear sister, please spare me a moment. You’ve always been so dear to me—why is it that today you care for Ping’er but not for me?
Everything feels so tedious and wearisome.” Xi Ren replied, “Once you step outside, all will be well. Continue moping like this, and your heart will only grow more weary.” Resigned, Baoyu allowed her to lead him. He staggered out of his room, played with a sparrow on the corridor, then stepped out into the courtyard. Following the course of the Qinfang Creek, he admired the goldfish swimming about. On the hillside, he soon saw two young deer darting like arrows. Perplexed as to their meaning, he was about to ponder further when Jia Lan appeared from behind, carrying a small bow. Upon seeing Baoyu, Jia Lan halted and said with a smile, “Second Uncle is at home; I thought you had gone out.” Baoyu chided, “You’re being mischievous again! What are you aiming at?” Jia Lan laughed, “When you’re not studying, what else is there to do? That’s why I practice archery and horsemanship.” Baoyu retorted, “Not so fast—with your teeth chattering, there’s no time for such theatrics.” With that, Baoyu ambled over to a courtyard gate. There, he saw a tall, elegant phoenix-tail pattern and a gentle, melodic dragon’s call—it was none other than the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Strolling in leisurely, he noticed that the Xiang Curtain hung down to the floor and the place was eerily silent. Approaching a window, he detected a subtle, enchanting fragrance seeping in from behind the gauze, and as he pressed his face to the screen, he heard a long, soft sigh: “Every day, our hearts grow so drowsy with longing…” Baoyu felt an inexplicable stirring within and looked again. There, on a bed, Lin Daiyu was stretching languidly. From outside, Baoyu called, “Why is it that every day our hearts grow so drowsy with longing?” As he said this, he lifted the curtain and stepped inside. Daiyu, lost in her own reverie, blushed deeply, covering her face with her sleeve, and turned over to feign sleep. Baoyu moved closer to pull her close, but then Daiyu’s wet nurse and two older maids suddenly entered, saying, “Sister is sleeping; wait until she awakens to be attended to.” Just then, Daiyu turned over and sat up, laughing, “Who’s sleeping?” The two maids, seeing her awake, laughed and said, “We thought the young miss was asleep.” They then called for Zijuan, “Young miss, you’re awake—please come and serve.” And with that, they all went off. Daiyu sat on her bed, fixing her hair, and asked Baoyu with a smile, “If others are sleeping, why do you come in to see me?” Baoyu, his eyes still heavy with sleep yet glistening, his cheeks tinged with rose, felt his heart leap; he slumped into a chair and laughed, “What did you just say?” Daiyu replied, “I didn’t say anything.” Baoyu grinned, “I’ll give you a chestnut to chew on—you know, I heard everything.” While they were speaking, Zijuan entered, and Baoyu laughed, “Zijuan, please brew me a cup of your best tea.” Zijuan said, “We have nothing very fine—only when Xi Ren comes will we have the best.” Daiyu interjected, “Don’t mind her. Please, go fetch me some water.” Zijuan answered, “Since he is a guest, naturally we should first brew tea and then fetch water.” With that, she went off to pour the tea. Baoyu laughed, “Good little maid! ‘If I could share a bed of romance with you, how could I ever bear to see you arranged with quilts and beds?’” Daiyu suddenly became agitated and demanded, “What did you say?” Baoyu protested with a laugh, “I didn’t say anything at all!” Daiyu then burst into tears, “Nowadays, even a little sip of tea provokes idle chatter—village gossip is spread, mocking my name in worthless books. I’ve become nothing more than a distraction for men!” Crying, she got out of bed and began to leave.
“What kind of grass were they woven from? No wonder they feel so smooth and not prickly,” she observed. Bao Yu explained, “These three items were gifts from the Prince of Beijing. On rainy days he himself wears them at home. If you like them, I’ll have a set made for you. And if nothing else, it’s the hat that intrigues me most: its top is adjustable—when it snows, you remove the bamboo ties and wear just the rim. Both men and women use it. I’ll give you one to wear when it snows in winter.”  Daiyu laughed, “I don’t want that. Wearing it would make me look like one of those theatrical fisherwomen in costume.” As soon as she spoke, she realized that her remark echoed Bao Yu’s earlier words; mortified, her face flushed scarlet, and she buried her face in the table, choked with tears. Bao Yu, however, paid her no heed. Noticing a poem on the table, he picked it up and read it aloud with appreciation. Daiyu quickly snatched it from him and, in a fit of anger, nearly set the lamp afire. Bao Yu laughed, “I’ve memorized it already!”  Daiyu said, “I’m tired now—please, go on. I’ll come back tomorrow.”  Bao Yu then reached into his pocket and produced a gold watch about the size of a walnut. Glancing at its hands—which indicated a time between the late seventh and early eighth hour—he quickly tucked it away, saying, “I should let you rest; I’ve disturbed you all day.” With that, he donned his raincoat and hat once more, stepped out, then reentered and asked, “What would you like to eat? Tell me, so that tomorrow morning when I return to Grandmother’s, everything will be clear.”  Daiyu smiled, “I’ll think it over tonight and tell you in the morning. Now, listen—the rain grows heavier; please hurry. Is anyone with you?”  Two maids replied, “Yes, outside someone is holding an umbrella and lighting a lantern.”  Daiyu laughed, “A lantern at this hour—really?”  Bao Yu said, “It matters not; it’s a goat-horn style, which isn’t afraid of the rain.”  Hearing this, Daiyu went to the bookshelf, retrieved a glass lantern decorated with embroidered motifs, had a small candle lit, and handed it to Bao Yu, saying, “This one shines brighter—ideal for rainy nights.”  Bao Yu replied, “I do have one like that, but I worry it might fall and break, so I left it unlit.”  Daiyu remarked, “If a lantern falls, it’s the lantern that loses value—what matters is the person. And you’re not accustomed to clogs anyway. Let those outside hold the lantern up; this one is light and bright, and it’s mine. Bring it back tomorrow. Even if you drop it, it’s only a little mishap—why, suddenly you seem to have taken on the temperament of someone who ‘cuts open her belly to hide pearls’!”  Bao Yu laughed and accepted the lantern. Ahead, two maids with umbrellas and goat-horn lanterns, and behind, two little maids with umbrellas, accompanied him. He handed the lantern to one of the little maids to carry as he supported himself on her shoulder and departed. At the same time, two maids from the Hengwú Courtyard arrived carrying a large package of bird’s nest and another package of refined “snowflake” confections (made from powdered sugar with candied plum pieces). “These are far better than what one buys,” they said. “Our girls insisted, ‘Girls, eat first; more will be brought later.’”  Daiyu replied, “Thank you for your thoughtfulness,” and then ordered, “Take them out to the tea room for serving.”  An old maid remarked with a smile, “We won’t have tea now—we have other business.”  Daiyu smiled, “I know you’re busy. Now that the day is cool and the night is long, it is time for an evening gathering—and perhaps a couple of rounds of gambling.”  One old maid laughed, “Honestly, this year I’ve been lucky.
It was merely a moment of anger last night.”  Ping’er replied, “Second Young Lady never said a word; it’s just that that harlot insulted me—and then our foolish master ended up beating me.” With that, she broke into tears again. Bao Yu quickly consoled, “Dear sister, do not be sorrowful. I will go and apologize on your behalf.”  Ping’er asked, “What does that have to do with you?”  Bao Yu smiled, “We are all siblings in heart. If they wrong someone, I should be the one to make amends.” He continued, “It’s a pity your new clothes got soiled. Why don’t you change them? I’ll even help you: we can spray them with strong wine and iron them carefully, and then re-comb your hair.”  While he spoke, he ordered some little maids, “Fetch some water for washing faces and an iron for pressing.”  It was well known that Bao Yu had never before shown his true heart toward Ping’er—even though Ping’er was Jia Lian’s beloved concubine and Fengjie’s trusted aide, Bao Yu always kept his distance. Consequently, he never treated her with complete sincerity, and over time he had harbored a grudge. Now, seeing his gentle manner toward Ping’er, she secretly mused, “Truly, his reputation is well-deserved; he considers every detail so thoughtfully.” And when Xiangren opened a chest to reveal two sets of spare clothes (which were hardly ever worn), she quickly went to wash her face. Beside him, Bao Yu laughed and advised, “Dear sister, you should put on some powder—otherwise you look as if you’re sulking against Fengjie. Besides, today is your good day; Grandmother herself sent someone to comfort you.”  Ping’er agreed and went to fetch some powder—but none could be found. Bao Yu hurried to a dressing table and opened a Xuanyao porcelain box. Inside lay ten jade hairpin-like flower sticks. He picked one up and handed it to Ping’er, laughing, “This isn’t lead powder—it’s ground purple jasmine seeds prepared with proper recipe.”  Ping’er examined it carefully in her palm. It was light, with a subtle rosy fragrance and a delicate, balanced texture that, when applied, spread easily and imparted a gentle glow—unlike any coarse powder she’d known before. Then she saw a packet of rouge—not merely a sheet, but a small white jade box containing a paste resembling rose petal jelly. Bao Yu explained with a smile, “The rouge sold in the market is impure and faint in color. This is the best quality—extracted from the finest rouge, clarified, and steamed with floral dew. Just a small dab on the lips will do; dissolve a little in water and apply it on the palm, and it is enough to refresh your face.”  Following his instructions, Ping’er carefully applied the cosmetics. Instantly, her face became beautifully radiant and fragrant. Bao Yu then took a blossoming autumn herb with twin blooms, snipped it with bamboo scissors, and pinned it in her hair. Just then, Li Wan sent for him, and he hurried away. Bao Yu, who had never before fully revealed his heart to Ping’er—and who regarded her as an exceptionally bright and graceful beauty, far surpassing the crude common folk—felt deep resentment. Today, on Jin Chuan’s birthday, he spent the entire day in gloom. Yet later, when the incident unfolded, he found that in Ping’er’s presence he was able to show a small measure of care—a rare pleasure in this life—and lay in bed, his heart quietly content. But soon his thoughts turned to Jia Lian. He knew that Jia Lian indulged in sensual pleasures without a care for proper refinement; and that Ping’er, having no parents or siblings of her own, was entirely responsible for serving Jia Lian and his wife. That she managed everything so meticulously, even under Jia Lian’s vulgar and Fengjie’s domineering manner, moved him deeply—and he bitterly thought how ill-fated she was. With such thoughts, his heart ached anew. After a while he got up; noticing that the wine had nearly been finished, he retrieved an iron and pressed his clothes, then discovered that his silk garment still bore traces of tears.
She found Chun Qian hanging towels by the railing. Chun Qian said, “She’s asleep.” The entire rooms were dark, no lamps lit, and Daiyu lay on her bed. Hearing footsteps, she asked, “Who is it?” “Qingwen,” came the reply. “What’s your business?” “Second Master asked me to bring you these cloths.”  At that, Daiyu fell silent, thinking, What’s this about, sending me cloth? She asked, “Who gave them to him—some nice new cloth? Let him keep them for someone else. I need none.” Qingwen laughed:  “They’re not new—just old household ones.” Daiyu felt even more bemused, but after pondering a moment, she said, “Set them down then, and go.” Qingwen complied, withdrew, and headed back, puzzling over the meaning. As for Daiyu, she gradually realized the cloth likely alluded to her habit of crying tears into her handkerchief, or some deeper gesture of comfort. Overcome, her mind whirled: He sees my grief. He sends me this sign as reassurance. She mused, If that’s truly the reason, I’m moved. If not, it’s quite odd. But maybe it truly is a secret token. Embarrassed and touched, she wrote lines of verse upon the two pieces of cloth, with brush and ink, despite feeling feverish:  1 My tears in emptiness fill empty eyes; They trickle unseen—where now can they abide? You kindly send a scrap of cloth, but oh, For your sake how can I not lament inside? 2 Gems cast aside, pearls spilled in stealth, Each day undone, each day solitary. Unwiped upon pillow or sleeve they fall, Let them stain dot by dot, in futility. 3 These bright embroidered threads can't gather tears off my face; The old Xiang River's mark is lost and out of place. Outside my window stands a bamboo grove, row on row— But do they sense the fragrance-laden tearstains that overflow? Daiyu would have continued, but she felt scorching heat within. Her cheeks burned. Glancing in the mirror, she saw her face tinted like peach blossoms, suspecting the onset of illness once more. She retired to bed, holding the cloth, lost in longing. Meanwhile, Xi Ren went to find Baochai at her lodging, only to learn she had gone to see her mother, Aunt Xue. Xi Ren couldn’t return empty-handed, so she tarried. Not until the first watch of night did Baochai come back. Earlier, Baochai, fully aware of her brother Xue Pan’s temperament, had half-suspected he orchestrated slander toward Baoyu. Xi Ren’s hints further convinced her. But in truth, Xi Ren had gleaned it from Bei Ming, who was merely speculating, so everything formed a chain of partial misunderstandings, each believing it wholly true. In fact, though Xue Pan had that unsavory reputation, this time he was innocent—yet pinned with guilt by rumor. That evening, Xue Pan, tipsy from a banquet, met with Aunt Xue. On learning Baoyu had been severely punished, he asked, “But how did that happen?” Aunt Xue, upset, retorted, “All because of your meddling, you wretch! Now you ask me?” Bewildered, Xue Pan insisted, “My meddling? I had no part.” Aunt Xue snapped, “Your sister knows it’s your doing—are you implying she’s falsely accusing you?” Just then, Baochai intervened, “Mother, calm down. Maybe it was him, maybe not, but it’s done. No point fighting. If we stir up more fuss, it’ll only grow. I only advise you, brother, to keep out of trouble from now on, mind your own affairs. You’re careless, blurting out everything. If this fiasco wasn’t your doing, you still look suspect.”  Xue Pan’s unvarnished nature flared at being wrongly accused of conspiracies. In his boozy wrath, he wanted to swear innocence, even threatening, “Whoever claims I slandered Baoyu, I’ll knock out their teeth!” He raged:  “Why is Baoyu treated like a demigod? If his father beats him, must we all cower for days? Another time, the father spanked him lightly, and people blamed cousin Zhen.
Do you know if the maid in your room called ‘Xiao Hong’ is there? I intend to summon her to run errands for you. Will that be acceptable?” Baoyu said, “There are plenty of people in my room; whichever sister you fancy, just call her—there’s no need to ask me.” Feng Jie laughed, “Then I shall have someone take her away.” Baoyu said, “Just send her off.” As he was about to leave, Feng Jie said, “Come back; I have one more thing to tell you.” Baoyu replied, “The Old Lady has already summoned me. I shall attend to it and come back later.” With that, he went toward the Lady Dowager’s quarters. There he found that the meal was over. The Lady Dowager asked, “What delicacies did you have with your mother?” Baoyu laughed, “Nothing in particular—I simply had an extra bowl of rice.” He then asked, “Where is Miss Lin?” The Lady Dowager replied, “Inside, in the inner room.” When Baoyu went in, he saw a maid ironing on the floor, two maids grinding powder on the kang, and Daiyu bent over as she snipped fabric. Baoyu entered with a smile, “Oh! What are you doing? We’ve only just eaten, and now you’re fussing—soon you’ll have a headache.” Daiyu ignored him and continued her cutting. One maid said, “That corner of silk isn’t smooth enough—iron it a bit more.” Daiyu then put down her scissors and said, “It’ll be fine soon enough.” Baoyu, puzzled by her remark, then saw Baochai and Tanchun arrive. After exchanging greetings with the Lady Dowager, Baochai also came in and asked, “What is Miss Lin up to?” Seeing Daiyu busy cutting, Baochai laughed, “She’s become so capable—she even knows how to tailor!” Daiyu replied, “It’s nothing more than idle chatter to coax people.” Baochai laughed, “I’ll tell you a joke: just after I spoke to the medicine man, Brother Baoyu became so indignant!” Daiyu said, “‘It’ll be fine soon enough’—that’s all.” Baoyu then said to Baochai, “Mistress, why don’t you go polish the game pieces?” Baochai replied with a laugh, “Was I born to polish game pieces?” and then departed. Daiyu said, “Then go. I’ll be watching to see if you’re devoured by tigers!” As she spoke, she resumed her cutting. Baoyu, seeing that she ignored him, could only smile and say, “You should go take a stroll; there’s no harm in postponing your tailoring.” But Daiyu would not be swayed. Baoyu then asked the maids, “Who ordered her to tailor?” Daiyu, noticing the question directed at the maids, said, “It was her own wish to tailor—it has nothing to do with Second Master.” Just then, someone came in and announced, “There are guests outside calling!” Hastily, Baoyu withdrew. Daiyu cried out, “Amitābha, hurry back; if only I were dead already!”  Baoyu went outside and heard Bei Ming say, “Lord Feng’s household has sent word.” Baoyu, recognizing the reference to yesterday’s matter, said, “I must fetch my garments,” and returned to his study. Bei Ming waited at the second gate until an old woman came out; Bei Ming approached her and said, “Second Master Baoyu is waiting in the study for his clothes. Please go in and deliver a message.” The old woman spat, “Bah! What nonsense! Baoyu now lives in the garden with all his attendants, and yet you come here delivering messages?” Bei Ming laughed, “You’re scolding me—now I’m confused!” and hurried off toward the east gate. By chance, a group of servants were playing soccer beneath the corridor; Bei Ming explained the matter to one, and after a short while a small servant ran in, and after a while returned carrying a bundle, which he handed to Bei Ming.
But since Grandmother adores him, they always reward him.”  Mrs. Xing smiled approvingly and then confided, “My idea is this: let’s not mention it to Grandmother at once. If Grandmother says no, then the matter is dead. I’m thinking of speaking quietly to Yuan Yang. Even if she is bashful, if I explain it to her thoroughly and she remains silent, then all will be settled. And even if Grandmother does not agree, if Yuan Yang is willing, as the saying goes ‘if a man leaves, he won’t be detained,’ then it will work out naturally.”  Fengjie laughed, “That is indeed a clever plan—absolutely foolproof. Not to mention Yuan Yang herself: who in this household doesn’t secretly wish to rise in rank? If a maid can be promoted to a position typically reserved for a mistress, then that would be most agreeable.”  Mrs. Xing added, “Exactly so. Now, go ahead—don’t let even a whisper get out. I’ll have my dinner and then come over.”  Fengjie, inwardly pondering, thought, “Yuan Yang has always been a magnanimous maid. But now that I propose this plan, will she agree? I must go over first and coax Grandmother; then when the madams arrive, I can slip away with the others. If Yuan Yang agrees, then no harm is done; if not, Mrs. Xing, who is so suspicious, might later become furious with me. I should act quickly.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just as I arrived, my maternal aunt sent over two cages of quail. I had them fried and intended to serve them with Madam’s dinner. But as I entered the main door, I saw the boys carrying the carriage—they said Madam’s carriage had been taken away for repairs. Perhaps it is best that I ride in my own carriage with them.”  Mrs. Xing, satisfied with her plan, ordered her attendants to change her garments. Soon, Fengjie, having attended briefly to her duties, and her maid, boarded a carriage and rode over. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Xing went off to Grandmother Jia’s. After exchanging some idle chatter with Grandmother Jia, she left, pretending to head toward Madame Wang’s room; she slipped out through a back door, and passed in front of Yuan Yang’s quarters. There she found Yuan Yang quietly sewing. On seeing Mrs. Xing, Yuan Yang rose. Mrs. Xing smiled, “What are you working on?” Then, taking the spool of thread from Yuan Yang’s hand, she said, “Let me see the flowers you’ve stitched.” After examining them, she remarked, “They’re even more beautiful now,” and then carefully set the thread aside while scrutinizing Yuan Yang. Yuan Yang was dressed in a partly new, lotus-colored silk jacket with a blue satin shoulder piece, paired with a water-green skirt. Her slim waist and delicate features—her oval face with jet-black hair and a slightly prominent nose, and tiny freckles on her cheeks—caught Mrs. Xing’s eye. Feeling somewhat self-conscious under such appraisal, Yuan Yang blushed and asked in a timid tone, “Madam, why have you come at this time?”  Mrs. Xing winked at her attendant and then sat down, taking Yuan Yang’s hand and saying warmly, “I’ve come to congratulate you.”  Yuan Yang’s face flushed even deeper; she lowered her head and said nothing. Mrs. Xing continued, “You know, there’s not a trustworthy person by Lord Jia’s side these days. He wants to buy someone for himself, but he fears that those new maidens from outside are too unclean—or may have faults. Because the whole household is looking for a daughter-in-law, they worry about the quality: either the appearance is not good or the character is poor. With your excellent qualities, none of that need worry you. In fact, if you were taken in by Grandmother, you’d be far better off than any newly purchased one. You’re as reliable as they come. I intend to speak with Grandmother and have her keep you in the house. You’re far superior to those new ones—once you’re in, your face will change; they might even make you an official concubine, bestowing honor and prestige.
Should outsiders learn of this, how can I show my face to our ancestors?” He then ordered, “Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!” The servants complied. But Jia Huan hurried to cling to Jia Zheng’s robe and knelt:  “Father, don’t be angry. No one beyond the servants in Lady Wang’s quarters knows. My mother told me…” He paused to glance around. Jia Zheng signaled the bystanders away, and they withdrew. Jia Huan whispered, “Mother told me: earlier, in Lady Wang’s chambers, Baoyu tried to force himself on Mother’s maid Jin Chuan’er. Failing that, he had her beaten. In her humiliation, Jin Chuan’er threw herself down the well in anger.”  He had barely finished when Jia Zheng’s face turned deathly pale. He roared, “Bring Baoyu here at once!” Fuming, he stormed toward his study, raging, “If anyone comes pleading for him, I’ll surrender them fatherhood and property altogether. Let me renounce these official robes, shave my head, and find some quiet place to end my miserable life, thus sparing the ancestors more disgrace at having such a son!” Onlookers, seeing him in that state, realized this again concerned Baoyu; not daring to intervene, they scattered. Jia Zheng, breath ragged, slumped into a chair, tears streaming, repeatedly ordering, “Bring Baoyu! Get a stick, get a rope, bar the gates! If word passes inside, he’ll be killed on the spot!” The pages had no choice but to concur and search out Baoyu. Baoyu, having been warned by Jia Zheng not to move, sensed peril but did not anticipate Jia Huan’s added accusations. He paced the hallway for a chance to send word inside but found no suitable messenger—nor was his page boy Bei Ming around. Desperate, he cornered an old female servant:  “Hurry in, tell them Father’s going to beat me—quick, please, it’s urgent!” But Baoyu spoke hastily, and the old servant, being half-deaf, only heard “jump in the well.” She said, “If he wants to jump, let him jump. What are you afraid of?” Realizing she was of no help, Baoyu pleaded, “Call my boy to me!” She misread it as him prattling about the concluded matter. The poor woman just shrugged: “Why fuss? Everything’s resolved, and Lady Wang gave some silver. All done.” Baoyu, at wits’ end, saw that words were wasted on her. Before long, Jia Zheng’s attendants arrived and dragged Baoyu in front of him. Seeing him, eyes inflamed with fury, Jia Zheng wasted no time questioning any details about “roaming with actors” or “neglecting studies.” He simply snapped, “Gag him and beat him to death!” The servants, trembling, pinned Baoyu to a bench and raised their heavy wooden paddle. After ten or so strikes, Baoyu, knowing it was futile to beg mercy, only sobbed “woo-woo,” muffled by his tears. Jia Zheng, deeming the blows too gentle, kicked aside the man wielding the board, seized it himself, and laid on another dozen strokes, each harder than the last. Baoyu, never having suffered such agony, at first screamed and struggled, but gradually his voice died away, leaving faint whimpers. Everyone, alarmed by the severity, rushed forward trying to stop him, but Jia Zheng refused:  “Ask him what abominations he’s done. Is it excusable? You lot have spoiled him, now you’d shield him at the brink? Someday if he kills father or betrays emperor, would you still intervene too late?” The crowd, sensing his fury was unstoppable, scrambled to find a way to alert someone inside. Lady Wang, hearing the uproar, had no time to inform Grandmother Jia and hurriedly put on clothes to come out, ignoring all eyes, a maid at her side. Men scattered in haste, uncertain how to stop the beating. Jia Zheng was set to strike more when Lady Wang appeared, intensifying his anger. Furious, his strokes landed all the harder. The two pages who had been holding Baoyu quickly let go, and Baoyu sprawled limp.
And you must need new clothes.” Baochai said, “I have plenty of unworn garments, so no.” Shortly, Aunt Xue finished her toilet, took Baochai along, and they returned to the Rong Mansion. Xue Pan also withdrew. Aunt Xue and Baochai proceeded to the Garden to see Baoyu. Entering Green Delights Court (Yihong Yuan), they saw from the throng outside the veranda that Grandmother Jia and the rest must be present. The mother and daughter entered, greeted them all, and found Baoyu lying on a couch. Aunt Xue inquired, “Feeling better?” Baoyu tried to sit up:  “A bit improved. I’m so sorry to trouble you and Sister. I am unworthy of all this.” Aunt Xue gently pressed him back onto the bed and asked, “If there’s anything you fancy or need, we can have it sent.” Baoyu forced a smile: “When I think of indulgences, I always rely on Aunt,” Lady Wang then asked, “Craving anything in particular to eat? I’ll have it fixed.” Baoyu replied, “Nothing special, except I recall that time we had small lotus leaves and lotus pods in a soup—rather refreshing.” Wang Xifeng teased, “Just hear that, such a simple craving, but a fuss. You sure you want that ‘lotus soup’ from last time?” Grandmother Jia promptly called for it to be prepared. Fengjie, taking the matter in hand, said, “Let me see who kept those molds.” A servant found them eventually in storage. Aunt Xue took a look: a little box of four silver molds, each about a foot long and an inch square, carved in shapes of miniature blossoms: chrysanthemum, plum blossom, lotus pods, water caltrops—some three or four dozen delicate designs. She laughed, “Indeed, your mansion thinks of everything: even soup needs shaped flour bits! If one hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t guess these were for soup.” Fengjie said:  “Yes, from years ago. They shape lumps of dough or watery flour, to soak in fresh lotus-leaf essence. We did it once, and I found it unremarkable. Who daily fusses with that? But if our Master Baoyu craves it . . .” Grandmother Jia, enjoying the novelty, arranged a big pot of the soup for them all. Xifeng’s lively banter amused the old lady, who teased that she used the public accounts to buy everyone’s favor. They all laughed. Baochai, from the side, quipped, “I’ve watched for years, and no matter how clever you are, it can’t rival Grandmother’s craft.” The old lady retorted with a chuckle, “Ha, child, I’m so old I can’t even be crafty. Xifeng is decent enough, better than your timid Aunt—ha!” Baoyu interjected, “But Sister-in-Law is as dear to you as Sister Lin, since you always say those who can talk well are favored.” Old Madam commented, “Oh, talkative sorts have one set of charms, while quiet ones have another. They each can be dear. If it’s all chatter, it can be wearisome, but silence can be tiresome too.” Baoyu joked, “Then which is correct? Like Sister-in-Law or Sister Lin or not? We also have these other girls—” Grandmother Jia cut him off: “Now, dear child, I’ll say this plainly: among all, including my own four granddaughters, the one I prize most is your cousin Bao (Baochai).” Aunt Xue, hearing that, quickly demurred. Lady Wang nodded, “But truly, she frequently praises Miss Bao behind your back.” Baoyu, wanting to steer the praise to Lin Daiyu, was surprised that the conversation turned entirely to Baochai. He shot her a grin; she merely turned to talk with Xi Ren. Just then, a servant arrived to escort them to dinner. They all rose, and Grandmother Jia gently told Baoyu, “Rest up, child.” Then she urged the maids, “Look after him carefully.” With that, leaning on Xifeng, she led Aunt Xue, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, and the others out.
Have her tell other stories.”  Though disappointed, Baoyu had to yield. Old Mrs. Liu reflected, then switched to another topic:  “Our village, next over from ours, has this old granny of ninety-something. She recites her Buddhist prayers daily. Who’d guess her devotion moved the Bodhisattva Guanyin to come in a dream saying, ‘You’re so devout. I told the Jade Emperor you shouldn’t be left without a descendant, so here’s a grandson for you!’ You see, that old granny had only one son, and he in turn only had one boy, who died at about seventeen. They wept until they were half-dead. But after a while, she truly gave birth to another grandson. Now he’s thirteen or fourteen, round as a little dumpling, bright as can be. Are the gods not real?”  This anecdote unwittingly touched upon the Dowager’s and Lady Wang’s own hopes, and even Lady Wang pricked up her ears. Yet Baoyu’s thoughts remained on that tale of the girl gathering wood. Even after hearing the second yarn, he was lost in thought. Tan-chun changed the subject, “Yesterday we borrowed Cousin Shi; let’s do something to repay her kindness. Perhaps we’ll arrange a session or a small banquet for the Old Ancestress to enjoy the chrysanthemums?”  Baoyu smiled, “The Old Dowager does want to throw a do to thank Cousin Shi. Let her do it. Then after we attend hers, we can do ours.”  “Time is passing,” Tan-chun noted, “It’s growing colder. I doubt the Old Dowager will be willing.”  “She quite likes wind and snow,” said Baoyu. “We can wait till the first heavy snowfall, then invite her to view it. We can write poems in the snow— how amusing that’d be!”  Lin Daiyu teased, “Yes, we can write poems in the snow, but from what that old granny said, better to haul some firewood in the snow, that’d be even more fun!” Her remark set off laughter among the other girls. Baoyu cast her a sideways glance but said nothing. When it was time to disperse, Baoyu stole away with Old Mrs. Liu and coaxed her into continuing that first story. Cornered, she had to improvise:  “Well… it’s a deserted shrine near the northern edge of our farmland. Not for gods or buddhas, but for some old lord… oh, I forget the name,” she said, flustered. “No matter the name or who it was—just the basic circumstances,” Baoyu pressed. “That old lord had no sons—only a daughter, named something like Ruoyu, who was educated and read. The parents doted on her like a priceless pearl. Alas, the girl took ill at seventeen and died.”  Baoyu stomped in regret. “So tragic. Then what?”  “Overcome by grief, the parents built that shrine and had a statue of her made. They hired caretakers to supply incense and stoke the fires. But many years have passed. The family died off; the shrine fell to ruin; the statue all but decayed… folks claim it’s turned into a spirit.”  “No, not a spirit,” Baoyu corrected. “Certainly such a person can’t truly die.”  Old Mrs. Liu invoked the Buddha: “So that’s how it is? We took it for a ghost. Folks say she roams around at night sometimes, and some want to smash her with mallets.”  Baoyu gasped, “They mustn’t! Leveling that shrine would be a grievous sin!”  “Your word, Master, sets me straight,” the old woman said. “Once I’m back, I’ll hold them off.”  Baoyu enthusiastically went on, “In fact, our Old Ancestress, our Lady, and everyone here are devout. We love building shrines and erecting images. Tomorrow I’ll write a donation request, so you can gather funds to rebuild that shrine and repair the statue, paying a caretaker to burn incense monthly. How’s that?”  “Well, thanks to that young lady, I’d get some funds for myself, too,” Old Mrs.
You might be less distressed if you didn’t care for him so much now!”  Jia Zheng, panicked, kowtowed, “If Mother speaks so, your son is left with no ground to stand on!” She retorted, “You’re the one forcing me to lose ground, not the other way around! We’ll just go home, leaving you unburdened. No one left for you to thrash!” Meanwhile, she ordered, “Prepare the carts and horses—I’m set to leave.” Jia Zheng knelt upright, bowed repeatedly, and begged forgiveness. While speaking, Grandmother Jia approached Baoyu, seeing that he truly had been beaten severely this time. She was both heartbroken and furious, cradling him in tears. Lady Wang, Feng Jie, and others intervened, persuading her for quite some while until at last her tears subsided somewhat. Maids and older women came forward, offering to help Baoyu stand. Feng Jie scolded them: “You fools, do you have eyes or not? In this state, how can you help him walk? Hurry inside and bring out the cane-bottomed bench!” Realizing her meaning, they dashed off, fetched out a low bench, and gently laid Baoyu on it, then followed behind as Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang led him back to her room. Jia Zheng, seeing his mother’s anger unsoftened, didn’t dare leave. He followed them into her quarters, soon witnessing Baoyu’s appalling injuries. Lady Wang alternated between “My precious child!” and “You worthless boy, I gave birth to you only for you to vex your father and me. If it weren’t for losing Zhu, I wouldn’t care so.” On and on, weeping all the while. Jia Zheng, seeing the miserable result, regretted his own excessive blows. He tried consoling his mother. Eyes brimming with tears, she said, “Yes, children need discipline, but not to this extent. If you still stay here, unsatisfied, do you want to see him truly die?” At that, Jia Zheng uttered a few meek acknowledgments and withdrew. At that time, Aunt Xue, Baochai, Xiangling, Xi Ren, Xiangyun, and others were also present. Xi Ren’s heart burned with grievance over the entire mess, yet she couldn’t show too much. Observing everyone busy with water or fans, she slipped away outside, to the secondary gate, and had the lads bring Bei Ming. Meeting him, she pressed him: “What started all this? Why didn’t you warn us sooner?” Bei Ming, upset, said, “I wasn’t around at first. By the time I heard, the beating was half over. I asked around and discovered it was about that Qiguan business and Jin Chuan’er’s suicide.” Xi Ren asked, “How did Master find out?” He answered, “Likely it was triggered by Xue Eldest Master (Xue Pan). He’s long been jealous, so he’s sowed rumors out there, letting them fester until they reached the Master’s ears. And Jin Chuan’er’s matter was reported by the Third Young Master (Jia Huan). That’s what Master’s men said.” Xi Ren, now seeing how both incidents aligned, deemed them credible. Returning inside, she saw that everyone was tending to Baoyu. After things were stabilized, Grandmother Jia ordered, “Carefully carry him to his own quarters.” The group responded in unison, bustling to move Baoyu to the Green Delights Pavilion, settling him onto his own bed. Only after more confusion did the onlookers gradually disperse. Xi Ren finally came forward, carefully attending to him and inquiring about his pains. What would happen next? We must wait for the following chapter to learn more. Chapter 34 In Passion’s Throes, Compassion Mends a “Younger Sister”; Amid Errors Compounded, a “Brother” Heeds Good Counsel  When Xi Ren saw that Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the others had departed, she came over to Baoyu’s bedside, tears in her eyes, and asked softly, “How did things come to this extreme?”  Baoyu sighed, “All for those same matters—why ask further! But now the lower half of my back hurts dreadfully.
The pair quickly hushed their conversation and joined in the playful banter. Soon, Feng Jie appeared on the hillside, waving her hand. Xiao Hong immediately abandoned the others and ran up to Feng Jie with a bright smile, asking, “What has the Old Lady ordered you to do?” Feng Jie examined Xiao Hong and, finding her looks clean and pretty and her speech sensible, laughed and said, “My maid, none of my girls accompanied me today. I just recalled that I need to send someone out on an errand. I wonder if you’re capable? Tell me, am I being clear?” Xiao Hong laughed, “Old Lady, whatever you say, just instruct me. If I fail to do it properly and it delays your work, you can punish me as you please.” Feng Jie smiled, “Tell me, are you from that young mistress’s room? If I send you out and she later comes to fetch you, I’ll speak on your behalf.” Xiao Hong replied, “I’m from Second Master Baoyu’s room.” Feng Jie laughed, “Oh my! So you were in Baoyu’s room all along—no wonder.” She continued, “Very well; when he asks, I’ll speak for you. Go and tell Sister Ping in our house that outside, on the table under the Ruyao dish rack, there’s a bundle of silver—one hundred and twenty taels, which is the embroidery fee for the seamstress. When the Zhang Cai family comes, weigh it in front of them, then send it off. And one more thing: there’s a small pouch on the headboard inside—fetch that too.” Xiao Hong agreed and departed. After a short while, she returned—but Feng Jie was no longer on the hillside. Instead, Si Qi emerged from a cave, fastening her sash. Xiao Hong asked, “Sister, do you know where Second Aunt Lian has gone?” Si Qi replied, “I haven’t the slightest idea.” Hearing this, Xiao Hong looked around and then saw that over by the pond, Tanchun and Baochai were watching the fish. Xiao Hong went over and asked, “Do you know where Second Aunt Lian went just now?” Tanchun replied, “She’s off to look for our eldest aunt at her courtyard.” Xiao Hong then continued on toward Daoxiang Village, where, at the very entrance, she found Qingwen, Qi Xia, Bi Hen, Qiu Wen, Mei Yue, the scribe, Ru Hua, Ying’er, and a group of others gathered. Qingwen, upon seeing Xiao Hong, said, “You’re out of your mind! The courtyard isn’t watered, the sparrows aren’t fed, and the tea stove isn’t lit—yet you wander about outside!” Xiao Hong replied, “Yesterday Second Master said that today we needn’t water the flowers; we only water once every day. When I feed the sparrows, you’re still sleeping.” Bi Hen asked, “What about the tea stove?” Xiao Hong answered, “Today it isn’t my shift. Whether there’s tea or not, don’t ask me.” Qi Xia said, “Listen to his tongue! Enough—let him wander about.” Xiao Hong retorted, “You ask around if you must—whether I’ve wandered or not. It was Second Aunt Lian who ordered me to fetch something.” With that, she held up the small pouch to show them, then fell silent as everyone dispersed. Soon, Xiao Hong decided to find Feng Jie. Entering the Li residence, she found Feng Jie in conversation with Mrs. Li. Xiao Hong approached and said, “Sister Ping told me that as soon as the Old Lady came out, she gathered up the silver. When the Zhang Cai family came to fetch it, they weighed it and took it away.” She then handed over the pouch. She added, “Sister Ping told me to report back to the Old Lady so that Wang’er might go to that household, as Sister Ping has already arranged everything according to the Old Lady’s wishes.” Feng Jie laughed and said, “How could it be that she managed to carry out my orders?” Xiao Hong replied, “Sister Ping said: ‘Our Old Lady inquires after the well-being of everyone here.
In my view, it is extremely difficult. Granting him a year’s leave is too generous, a month is too little—perhaps we should give him six months; and even assign Brother Bao to assist him. Not so that Brother Bao will be found teaching him to paint—that would only spoil the work further—but so that, in case anyone is uncertain or finds difficulty with placement, Brother Bao can consult with skilled painters and ease the task.”  Baoyu, delighted, exclaimed, “That is absolutely right! Mr. Zhan Ziliang’s meticulous pavilions are exquisite, and Mr. Cheng Rixing’s beauties are unparalleled—let’s consult them!”  Baochai said, “I think you’re just ‘busy doing nothing’—you mention it, and then ask them, but wait for everything to be arranged before proceeding. For now, what shall we use to paint?”  Baoyu replied, “We have Xuelang paper at home—large sheets that hold ink well.”  Baochai sneered, “You’re hopeless! Xuelang paper is used for calligraphy or freehand landscapes—especially for the Southern School of landscape painting. With ink alone, it hardly accepts textures; and if you try to paint without using colors, it is difficult to fire, and neither the painting nor the paper is worth much. Let me give you a method. Originally, when this garden was built, there was a detailed design, even if executed freehand, the scale and proportions were correct. If you and Madame Wang step out and compare that design with a piece of heavy silk from Sister Feng, have the gentry outside make a draft according to that pattern, adding figures as needed, it will be acceptable. Of course, if you want to add the green hues and even embellish with gold and silver paste, they will have to be added. You’ll also need a furnace for preparing glue, extra glue, and brushes to wash. You must have a large table for grinding pigments, laid out with felt. Many of your small dishes are missing, and so are your brushes—start anew with a complete set.”  Xīchūn said, “I’ve never owned such painting implements; I only use what’s at hand. And as for pigments, I only have ocher, Guanghua, vine yellow, and rouge—only two brushes for coloring, at most.”  Baochai said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? I still have some of these things, though you need not use them; I’ll keep them for you until you require them. They’re only good for painting fans anyway—painting a large-scale work would be a pity. Today, I’ll draft an inventory and send it to Grandmother. You may not know everything, so I’ll have Brother Bao write it down.”  Baoyu had already prepared his brush and inkstone, fearing he might forget, so he began to note down the list as Baochai spoke. Baochai recited:    “First set: four fine brushes; second set: four fine brushes; third set: four fine brushes; four large dye brushes; four medium dye brushes; four small dye brushes; ten large ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten small ‘crab-claw’ brushes; ten whisker brushes; twenty large coloring brushes; twenty small coloring brushes; ten surface brushes; twenty willow-twig brushes; four taels of vermilion arrowheads; four taels of southern ochre; four taels of stone yellow; four taels of stone blue; four taels of stone green; four taels of tube yellow; eight taels of Guanghua; fourteen boxes of lead powder; twelve packets of rouge; two hundred packets of great scarlet; two hundred packets of lapis lazuli; fourteen taels of Guangyun glue; four taels of purified alum. The glue and alum for silk remain separate—just hand over the silk and have them process it. With these colors, after sorting and mixing, you’ll have enough for a lifetime. In addition, you’ll need four fine silk baskets, two coarse baskets, four carrying brushes, four small and large porcelain basins, twenty large coarse bowls, ten five-inch dishes, twenty three-inch coarse white dishes, two wind furnaces, four sand pots of various sizes, two new porcelain jars, two new water buckets, four one-foot-long white cloth bags, twenty jin of floating charcoal, one or two jin of willow charcoal, one three-tier wooden box, one yard of real gauze, two taels of ginger, and half a jin of sauce.”  Daiyu interjected with a laugh, “And an iron pot and an iron spatula!”  Baochai asked, “What’s that for?”  Daiyu replied, “If you need ginger and sauce for the pigments, I’ll get you an iron pot to fry them—so you can cook the pigments properly.”  The assembled guests laughed.
Yesterday, Grandmother even sent Cai Ge with gifts, and my grandson kowtowed at the door.”  Li Wan asked with a smile, “How early did you leave last night?”  Old Madam Lai sighed, “I can’t control them—they do as they please. Just the other day, someone kowtowed at home for me, and I had nothing nice to say—I told him, ‘Boy, don’t think you’re all that! You’re thirty years old now—even if you’re a servant, your master’s favor should have you reading and writing like a young gentleman. Yet you don’t even know how to write the word for ‘servant’! All you know is how to enjoy your blessings without remembering the hardships your grandfather and father endured—struggling through generations only to squander what you have! And now, at twenty, you’ve been granted even more, and you’re expected to support your future. Think of all those starving while you, a mere sprout, are pampered! Now that you’ve been blessed for ten years, if you continue to beg for more, you’ll be the laughingstock of the household!’”  Li Wan and Fengjie laughed, “You exaggerate! We all know he does his best.”  Then Old Madam Lai inquired, “But what about that Second Sister’s son? What misdeed did he commit that he must be expelled?”  Fengjie laughed, “That is exactly what I was going to tell you. The other day on my birthday, while no one was outside to attend to matters, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he sat there cursing instead. When two women entered, he took the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of steamed buns all over the courtyard. After everyone had gone, I sent Cai Ming to scold him—and he ended up berating Cai Ming fiercely. That insolent wretch—why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him—teach him a lesson so that he may mend his ways. Expelling him outright is not acceptable, for he is not our own flesh and blood. He is merely the attendant of the madams. If we expel him, the madams’ honor will suffer. I say, let Grandmother administer a few lashes as a warning; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes. If he dares to drink again, he must never be allowed near the wine!”  Old Madam Lai’s family agreed. Soon, Zhou Rui’s and Zhang Cai’s families arrived with their accounts. Fengjie declared, “My daughter-in-law is here to fetch her mother-in-law.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded. Old Madam Lai said, “What is the matter? Tell me, so that I can judge.”  Fengjie explained, “At my birthday the other day, while no one was outside managing affairs, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he sat there cursing instead. When two women entered, he gathered the little ones. One of them dropped a box of buns in the courtyard. After everyone left, I sent Cai Ming to scold him—and he ended up cursing Cai Ming. Such lawlessness! Why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him—teach him to mend his ways. Expelling him outright would be too harsh, for he is not our own son but merely the attendant of the madams. I say, let Grandmother teach him a few licks as a warning; if he continues, then expel him. We must consider his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never near the wine!”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt again and pleaded. Old Madam Lai then ordered, “Send these three back to their rooms.
Everyone would think me wicked, and you left me, so what meaning is that?” She answered, “If you were truly vile, why would I remain? Or I might as well just die. We all have to die anyway. Then I wouldn’t hear or see . . . .” Alarmed, Baoyu covered her mouth:  “Stop—stop saying that.” Yet Baoyu’s contradictory mind was drawn by her direct sincerity. He apologized softly, and Xi Ren changed the topic, speaking of romantic trifles and ladies’ charms. Then they veered into talk of how maids might nobly die. Xi Ren realized she’d gone too far, so she quickly shut up. Baoyu lay turning over the possibilities. One day, Baoyu got bored wandering the same spots in the garden, so he recalled a scene from The Peony Pavilion and yearned to read it again. But even reading it twice didn’t satisfy him. He’d heard that among the twelve budding actresses in the Pear-Fragrance Lodge, a girl named Ling Guan was the best at singing. He slipped out of the corner gate to find them. Encountering some young performers—Kui Guan and Yao Guan—he asked, “Where’s Ling Guan?” They said, “She’s in her room.” He hurried to see her. She lay on a pillow, barely turning at his arrival. Having always jested easily with the other maids, Baoyu approached with a grin: “Sister, do sing the Nieao Qing Si number (the Peony Pavilion snippet).” But Ling Guan just got up and stiffly said, “My throat is hoarse. The other day, I was supposed to sing for Her Highness, and I still can’t. Why come ask me?” This left Baoyu red-faced, not used to being brushed off. He retreated. The other girls suggested, “Wait for Master Qiang (Jia Qiang). If he wants it, she’ll do it.” Baoyu asked, “Is Qiang out?” “Yes, presumably Ling Guan needed something, so he’s off to procure it.”  Soon, Jia Qiang arrived with a birdcage. He had a fancy mincing bird that performed little stunts in a model stage inside the cage. He came in, saw Baoyu, politely greeted him, and approached Ling Guan:  “Look, a new toy for you—this finch will amuse you so you won’t be bored.” But Ling Guan gave him only a frosty laugh:  “Your family tears us from our normal lives, caging us in here to learn these worthless songs, and now you bring me a caged bird for further mockery? I want none of it.” Jia Qiang tried pledging innocence, but seeing her unwavering hostility, he ended up dismantling the cage and freeing the bird. Then she moaned that she’d coughed blood, and no one truly cared for her. Jia Qiang nervously insisted he had asked a doctor who said it was minor, but she dismissed him. Baoyu, witnessing their exchange, realized that the one painting “蔷” in the rose arbor was precisely Ling Guan, so he quietly left. Jia Qiang, too absorbed with Ling Guan, paid him no mind. Baoyu returned to his room, quite shaken. Understanding now the significance of “蔷,” he felt a new pang. Arriving at the Garden, he found Lin Daiyu and Xi Ren conversing. The moment he stepped in, he exclaimed:  “Last night I said something flawed, no wonder Father calls me ignorant and shallow. I spoke of wanting only your tears to bury me, but I realize now, that was foolish. I see I cannot have them all. Everyone will have their own tears for their own destinies.” Xi Ren, recalling his earlier talk, merely said with a laugh, “You truly are half-crazed.” Baoyu fell silent, pondering how each personal bond might be foreordained, gloomily wondering, “In the end, who shall weep for me upon my grave?”  Seeing Baoyu in such a mystic mood, Daiyu guessed he had confronted yet another heartbreak but asked no details. She only said, “I was just at Aunt Wang’s, who said tomorrow is Aunt Xue’s birthday. Are you going or not? She told me to ask if you’ll send word in advance.” Baoyu replied, “I refused to attend even Uncle’s birthday last time, how can I go to Aunt Xue’s?
Better have his clothes properly packed and let him go back soon—at least he won’t suffer any longer. Even if you’re reluctant, if you keep holding on, he’ll only continue to suffer.” Before she could finish, the Lady Dowager spat in Aunt Zhao’s face and cursed, “You tongue-tied wench! How can you say he’s useless? What good would come from his death? Don’t be absurd! If he dies, I might as well take your life too! It’s all your fault—you have been goading him day after day, forcing him to study and write until his courage was shattered, and now you act as if he trembles before his own father like a scared little mouse. Isn’t it all because of your petty instigations? If you’re so intent on pushing him to death, then you’ll have your way! I’ll not spare a word!” She wept and cursed as she cried. Jia Zheng, overhearing these words, grew even more anxious and quickly shooed Aunt Zhao away, trying to soothe everyone. Suddenly, someone returned with the news, “Both coffins are ready.” Hearing this, the Lady Dowager felt as if a knife had stabbed her heart; she burst into tears and furious curses, “Who ordered these coffins to be made? Bring the men who made them here so I can beat them to death!” The uproar became absolute. Then, faintly, they heard the sound of a wooden fish from afar, accompanied by the chanting, “Namo Jieyuan, Jiejie Pusa! Whoever suffers misfortune, whose household is troubled, who is plagued by evil spirits or meets with calamity—come to us for healing!” Both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang heard this and ordered their servants to search the street. It turned out that the voices belonged to a ragged monk and a shabby Taoist priest. What did that monk look like? He had a nose like a suspended gallbladder, long eyebrows; his eyes shone like bright stars with a precious gleam. Clad in a tattered kasaya and worn straw sandals with no trace of luxury, he bore a raw, festering sore on his head. And what of the Taoist? He appeared as if one foot were high and the other low, his body perpetually wet and trailing mud. When asked where he hailed from, he replied, “From Penglai, beyond the Weak Water in the West.” Jia Zheng ordered the two to be brought in and asked, “From which mountain do you practice your way?” The monk smiled and said, “Officer, there is no need for further words. Knowing that the household here is in distress, I have come specifically to heal it.” Jia Zheng asked, “There are two people afflicted by evil—do you know of any immortal remedy?” The Taoist laughed and said, “Your household now possesses a treasure of singular rarity; with it, there is no need to ask about a remedy.” Moved, Jia Zheng said, “When the child was born, he carried a piece of jade with the inscription ‘Able to Remove Evil’—yet it has lost its power. The monk replied, “Officer, you are unaware—Baoyu was originally endowed with spiritual vitality, but he has been seduced by the allure of pleasures and worldly gains, and that is why it has lost its effect. Now, remove that precious jade from his neck and let me recite a few incantations; it will naturally regain its power.” Jia Zheng then took the jade from Baoyu’s neck and handed it to the two holy men. The monk held it in his palm, sighed deeply, and said:    “Beneath Qingeng Peak we parted thirteen years ago. Time in this world flies by; yet the bonds of fate remain unbroken—alas, alas! How enviable were those days:   Unfettered by heaven or earth, with neither joy nor sorrow in one’s heart. But after attaining spiritual insight, one inevitably stirs up strife among men. Alas, what a pity this ordeal has become:   The once-precious jade is now marred by stains and smudges, and every day the windows imprison the mandarin ducks. When the stupor of dreams finally lifts, debts of injustice must be repaid so that all may be set free.”  After reciting, the monk fiddled with the jade again, muttering nonsensical words, and then told Jia Zheng, “This object is now powerful—do not desecrate it.
Now you’re suggesting that if you don’t muster the spirit to win some money from Grandmother by fortune-telling, then you want to practice divination?”  Fengjie grinned, “I was just about to calculate how much I should lose today. I still want to win! Look—the table’s set and everyone is in position.” This caused Grandmother and Aunt Xue to burst into laughter. Soon, Yuan Yang arrived and sat directly below Grandmother. Below her sat Fengjie. After spreading out a red carpet and shuffling the cards, five players began a game. Yuan Yang noted that Grandmother’s hand was almost complete—just missing a two. She discreetly signaled Fengjie. Just as Fengjie was about to deal, she deliberately hesitated for a few moments and joked, “I swear that card is already hidden in Aunt Xue’s hand—if I don’t play it, I won’t be able to catch up!” Aunt Xue interjected, “But I don’t have that card in my hand.”  Fengjie replied, “I’ll check when I get back.”  Aunt Xue said, “You go ahead and check; deal the card so I can see what it is.”  Fengjie then passed the card to Aunt Xue; upon seeing it was a two, Aunt Xue laughed, “I wouldn’t have minded it—but I’m worried Grandmother’s hand is already full.”  Fengjie quickly laughed, “I must have dealt it wrongly!”  Grandmother, laughing heartily, threw her cards down and said, “Don’t you dare take it back! Who told you to make such a mistake?”  Fengjie replied, “But I was just trying to divine! I can’t help it.”  Grandmother laughed, “You’re the one who’s always flapping your gums, asking your own questions.” Then she turned to Aunt Xue and said, “I’m not stingy about money—I merely like a good omen.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “We’re not thinking that way at all—who in their right mind would say Grandmother loves money?”  Fengjie, counting her money, heard this and hurriedly fastened her coins back together, smiling at everyone, “That’s enough for me! I don’t even care about winning money; I just love a good omen. I’m such a miser that whenever I lose, I count my money—now put it away.”  Grandmother explained that by custom Yuan Yang was to reshuffle the cards and joked with Aunt Xue. But Yuan Yang did not move a muscle. Grandmother said, “Why are you upset? Not even the cards are being washed?” Yuan Yang picked up the cards and laughed, “Grandmother, are you not giving money?”  Grandmother replied, “If she doesn’t give money, then she’s truly out of luck.” She then ordered a little maid, “Fetch all the coins from that pouch!” The maid obeyed and placed the coins beside Grandmother. Fengjie laughed, “Reward me, then, by counting them all out!”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Surely, Fengjie, you’re being petty—but it’s all just for fun.”  Fengjie said, “If they won’t even let me have my due, then put the coins in Grandmother’s box. Let the coins be gathered all at once so that we don’t have to fuss twice—and let the money in the box be spent properly.”  Grandmother laughed so heartily that she nearly dropped her cards. She then pushed Yuan Yang and commanded, “Quickly, rip his mouth off!”  Following the order, Ping’er put down her coins and, after laughing briefly, returned. At the courtyard gate, she met Jia Lian, who asked, “Where is Madam? Lord Jia ordered me to invite her.”  Ping’er smiled and said, “She’s been standing with Grandmother for half a day and hasn’t moved. Let’s hurry up before it’s too late. Grandmother’s temper has softened a bit after Second Madam cheered her up.”  Jia Lian said, “I’ll go over—just to ask Grandmother whether the fourteen-year-old is coming out; we must get the sedan ready.
. it’s you.” Accepting the fan, he slunk off wordlessly. Xi Ren stood there, deeply unsettled. He must have meant that speech for Lin Daiyu, she realized. It implies a dangerous entanglement—if they transgress in some way . . . oh dear, how can we prevent trouble? She was still pondering this when Baochai arrived from another path, calling cheerily, “Why are you daydreaming in the blazing sun?” Xi Ren quickly steadied herself: “I was watching two birds fight, amusements of nature.” Baochai laughed, “So that’s it. I saw Baoyu rush out in a hurry—I tried calling him, but he looked so preoccupied he didn’t respond. Where’s he off to?” Xi Ren explained, “Master just summoned him—likely a visitor. Might be some official call.” Baochai said, “So hot—why drag him out? Maybe the Master is annoyed and wants to scold him.” Xi Ren replied, “I think it’s just a guest.” Baochai laughed, “That guest must be insane, trudging about in this heat.” Xi Ren said, “Isn’t that so!”  Baochai then inquired, “I saw Xiangyun heading to your place. Why?” Xi Ren answered, “We chatted awhile, and I asked her to help me with some sewing. She agreed.” Baochai nodded: “That girl’s always doing needlework at home. She told me she’s worn out by it—her family can’t afford hired seamstresses, so all chores fall on them. I recall her eyes turning red whenever the subject arises. She complains about all the exhausting tasks, but dares not speak openly.” Xi Ren sighed, “Yes, I recall requesting her to tie a few butterfly knots last month. She said she’d do them, but took a long while. Likely she had to do it late at night. If I’d known, I’d not have asked her. Master Baoyu is picky, though, refusing the house seamstresses for his personal items.” Baochai said quietly, “Don’t worry, I’ll do some for you if needed.” Xi Ren brightened, “Truly? That would be such a blessing! Perhaps tonight I’ll bring them over.”  She was mid-sentence when an old woman came in a hurry: “Something dreadful! Jin Chuan’er, from the Mistress’s rooms, has just drowned herself in a well.” Xi Ren gasped: “That Jin Chuan’er? The one in Lady Wang’s service?” The old woman confirmed, “Yes, that same one. Dismissed a few days ago, she’d been weeping non-stop at home. No one minded her. Suddenly she disappeared. Then, a maid drawing water from that old corner well found a corpse below—turns out it was her. Some tried fishing her out, but too late.”  Baochai exclaimed, “Such a tragedy!” Xi Ren, recalling Jin Chuan’er’s usual camaraderie, shed tears. Baochai, seeing Xi Ren upset, said softly, “I’d better go console Aunt Wang.” Xi Ren, forced to stifle her grief, also excused herself. Baochai reached Lady Wang’s quarters to find it silent, Lady Wang alone, tears on her cheeks. Not wishing to bring up Jin Chuan’er’s death first, Baochai quietly sat. Lady Wang asked, “Where have you come from?” “From the garden.” “Did you see your Cousin Baoyu? Just now he returned with a dull expression.” “He’s just gone out again,” Baochai answered. Lady Wang nodded with a sigh, “Did you hear the terrible news? Jin Chuan’er hurled herself down a well!” Baochai said, “What? Why on earth would she do that? That’s so strange.” Lady Wang lamented, “Some days back I scolded her over a minor mishap and dismissed her in anger. I intended only to let her reflect for a few days before recalling her. Who’d have guessed she had such a fierce temper!
Jia Zhen, standing on the steps, asked, “Where’s the steward?” The younger servants below cried out, “Calling the steward!” In no time, Lin Zhixiao, adjusting his cap, ran forward. Jia Zhen ordered, “Though this place is large, we have many people here today. Of those you’re responsible for, keep them in this courtyard. Anyone we don’t need, dismiss them to another courtyard. Assign more of the younger servants at this second gate and the side gates, ready to fetch items or pass along messages. Understand? Not a single idle person may enter—our young ladies and mistresses have come out.” Lin Zhixiao repeatedly affirmed, “Yes, yes, I understand.” Jia Zhen then asked, “Well, then—where is Rong’er?”  Even as he spoke, they all saw Jia Rong come running out of the bell tower. “You see how cool he’s been in there, while we roast in the heat?” Jia Zhen barked, ordering the household men, “Spit on him!” They knew his temper and obeyed without hesitation; one servant spat in Jia Rong’s face. Jia Zhen glared at him, while that same servant asked Jia Rong, “Aren’t you feeling the heat, Master? Why do you get to be cool?” Jia Rong, with head bowed, dared not speak. Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia Qin, and the rest were all petrified; even Jia Lian, Jia, Jia Qiong, and others hurriedly crept away along the wall. Jia Zhen snapped, “What are you standing here for? Hurry back home and tell your mother—Grandmother and the ladies are here, so she’d better hurry along to wait on them!” Frightened, Jia Rong sprinted off, repeatedly calling for his horse, all the while complaining, “That’s what I get for being left in the dark!” and scolding the stable-boys, “Are your hands tied? Bring my horse at once!” He wanted to send a young servant in his place, but feared rumors might spread, so he had no choice but to go himself, riding off quickly. Just as Jia Zhen was about to proceed inward, he noticed a Taoist named Zhang, who stood by, smiling. “By all rights,” said the Taoist, “I should be waiting upon you inside. But the weather’s hot, the young ladies have come, and the officiant fears to intrude, so he awaits your orders. Worried in case the Old Lady wonders, or might wish to visit somewhere, I’m staying here at your service.”  Jia Zhen knew that this Zhang Taoist was the old “substitute” who had served the Late Duke of Rongguo, honored by the emperor as the “Grand Illusioned Immortal,” holding the official Daoist Register, titled “Immortal to the End.” Princes and dukes treated him like a deity, and he frequented both Mansions, known to the mistresses and daughters. JZ thus dared not slight him. With a laugh, Jia Zhen said, “There’s no need for such formality with us. Speak again and I’ll tug that beard out of yours. Now come on in!” The Taoist joined him in good humor. When they reached Jia Mu, Jia Zhen respectfully said, “Old Lady, Taoist Zhang has come to greet you.” Jia Mu replied, “Invite him in.” Jia Zhen ushered him forward. Zhang Taoist laughed heartily, “Boundless Longevity to you! May the Old Ancestor enjoy long life and peace, and good fortune to all these ladies and maidens! It’s been a while since I visited the Mansion in person, but I see the Old Ancestor is looking even more radiant.” Jia Mu smiled, “How are you, Immortal Zhang?” Zhang Taoist replied, “Thanks to your blessings, this humble priest is well enough—only I’ve been worried about our young master. How has he been? On the 26th of the fourth month, we celebrated the Great Obscured Five’s birthday here. There were few guests, and everything was in proper order. I thought to invite the young master for a stroll, but they said he wasn’t at home?” Jia Mu said, “Indeed, he was not home then,” and she turned to call, “Baoyu.”  But Baoyu had stepped away to relieve himself, returning in haste.
When they reached the Héngwú Courtyard and entered a room, Baochai sat down and said with a laugh, “You still won’t kneel for me? I must interrogate you.”  Daiyu, puzzled, replied with a smile, “Look at you—Bao Yatou is going crazy! What are you going to interrogate me about?”  Baochai coldly retorted, “Oh, what a 'thousand-gold' lady you are—so refined, never leaving your room! And yet what do you prattle about? Just speak plainly.”  Daiyu, still not fully understanding, burst into laughter and said, “When have I ever said anything? You’re simply trying to pin my faults. Come on, tell me what you have in mind.”  Baochai laughed, “Stop pretending to be naive! What did you say during yesterday’s drinking game? I don’t know where it came from.”  As Daiyu thought, she recalled that she’d been somewhat indiscreet yesterday when reciting a few lines from The Peony Pavilion and The Story of the Western Wing—and her face flushed red. She then went over to Baochai, hugging her and laughing, “Oh, dear sister, I honestly don’t remember—just careless words. Teach me, and I won’t mention it further.”  Baochai smiled, “I don’t even know myself; I simply found your words so amusing that I wished to ask you.”  Daiyu said, “Oh, dear sister! Please don’t repeat it to others—I won’t say another word!”  Baochai, seeing her face flush bright red and hearing her implore, ceased her questioning. Then, after seating her to have some tea, Baochai began to explain gently, “Who do you think I am? I, too, was once a mischievous child—at the age of seven or eight I was quite the handful. Our family has long been scholars; even our grandfather cherished his collection of books. In earlier days, when many children—brothers and sisters alike—lived together, we were all afraid to look at proper books. Some of the boys loved poetry, while others loved lyrics—the Story of the Western Wing, the Pipa and the Hundred Varieties of Yuan Poems, all sorts of books. They would secretly read them behind our backs, and we would do the same. Later, when the elders found out, they’d beat, scold, burn, and confiscate them. So it’s better that us girls remain illiterate. Even if the men read, they often lack sense—better off without books, not to mention you and I! As for composing poetry or writing, these are not really our duties; indeed, they aren’t even proper for men. When men read to gain wisdom and govern the country, that is praiseworthy. But nowadays, not a single man seems to do so; if he reads, he only becomes worse. It is not that books have spoiled him; rather, he’s squandered them—so it hardly matters whether he reads or not. As for you and me, we should stick to needlework and spinning. Yet we do know a few characters. Once you know the characters, you might as well select a proper book to read—but I fear that encountering miscellaneous texts might change your disposition irretrievably.”  Hearing these words, Daiyu lowered her head while sipping tea, secretly agreeing with nothing more than a single “Yes.”  Just then, Sùyún entered and said, “Our Grandmother wishes to discuss an important matter with you two ladies. Second Sister, Third Sister, Fourth Sister, Miss Shi, and Second Young Master Bao are all waiting.”  Baochai asked, “What is it now?”  Daiyu replied, “We shall know once we get there.”  With that, she and Baochai went toward Dàoxiāng Village, where they found everyone assembled. Li Wan greeted them with a smile, “The society hasn’t yet started, and already there are such carefree fellows—four little maids are claiming a year’s leave!”  Daiyu laughed, “It’s all because of something Grandmother said yesterday—about having someone paint a picture of the garden—which caused him to take leave in delight.”  Tan Chun laughed, “Don’t blame Grandmother; it was all because of Old Liu’s words.”  Daiyu hastily laughed and added, “But indeed, it was his words—what kind of old fellow is he?
Even a woven quilt cannot withstand the autumn wind’s force,   While the chime of a broken timepiece hastens the urgent autumn rain. All night long, the air is chill and restless—by the lamp, it seems a lonely parting weeps. In a desolate courtyard of thin smoke, through sparse bamboo and a vacant window,   I wonder when the wind and rain will cease; already, tears soak the gauze of my window. After finishing her poem, Daiyu set her brush aside, intending to rest. Soon a maid announced, “Second Young Master Bao has arrived!” Before the words were finished, Bao Yu entered wearing a large straw hat and a worn raincoat. Daiyu couldn’t help but laugh, “From where has such a fisherman appeared?”  Bao Yu quickly asked, “How do you do? Have you taken your medicine? How many meals have you had today?” As he spoke, he removed his hat and raincoat. Lifting a lantern in one hand and shielding the light with the other, he examined Daiyu’s face and smiled, “You look much better today.”  Daiyu noted that beneath his raincoat he wore a half-worn short red silk jacket, tied with a green scarf, exposing green silk trousers decorated with scattered floral patterns, and below, a cotton gown embroidered with gilt thread and butterfly motifs, with delicate shoes. Daiyu inquired, “Weren’t you afraid of the rain? Yet your shoes and socks look so clean.”  Bao Yu replied with a smile, “This entire outfit is complete. I just got a new pair of tangwood clogs; I took them off under the eaves.”  Daiyu then examined his raincoat and hat, noting they were not of common market quality but finely made. “What kind of grass were they woven from? No wonder they don’t feel as prickly as others,” she observed. Bao Yu explained, “These three items were gifts from Prince Beijing. On rainy days he himself wears them at home. If you like them, I’ll have a set made for you. Everything else aside, it’s the hat that intrigues me most. The top part is adjustable—in winter when it snows, one removes the bamboo ties and uses just the rim; both men and women wear it. I’ll give you one to wear in winter.”  Daiyu laughed, “I don’t want that. Wearing it would make me look like one of those painted, theatrical fisherwomen.” As soon as she spoke, she realized her remark echoed Bao Yu’s earlier words; mortified, her face flushed scarlet, and she buried her face in the table, stifling sobs. Bao Yu, however, was oblivious. Noticing a poem on the table, he picked it up and read aloud, exclaiming his approval. Daiyu quickly snatched it from him and, in a burst of anger, almost set the lamp on fire. Bao Yu laughed, “I already memorized it!”  Daiyu said, “I’m tired now—please go on. I’ll come back tomorrow.”  Bao Yu then reached into his pocket and withdrew a walnut-sized gold watch. Glancing at its hands, which pointed between the hours of 7 and 8, he quickly tucked it away, saying, “I should let you rest; I’ve disturbed your peace all day.” With that, he donned his raincoat and hat once more, stepped out, then reentered and asked, “What would you like to eat? Tell me so that tomorrow when I return to Grandmother’s, I can be clear about it.”  Daiyu smiled, “I’ll think it over tonight and tell you in the morning. Listen—the rain is growing heavier. Hurry now. Is anyone with you?”  Two maids replied, “Yes, outside someone is holding an umbrella and lighting a lantern.”  Daiyu laughed, “That kind of lantern at this hour?”  Bao Yu said, “It doesn’t matter—it’s a ‘goat-horn’ style, not prone to damage by rain.”  Hearing this, Daiyu went to the bookshelf and took down a glass, embroidered-ball lantern, instructed someone to light a small candle, and handed it to Bao Yu, saying, “This one shines brighter—perfect for use in the rain.”  Bao Yu replied, “I have one just like that, but I’m afraid it might slip and break, so I didn’t light it.”  Daiyu said, “If the lantern falls, it’s the lantern that loses value—not the person.
Only Aunt Zhao, feigning sorrow on the outside, inwardly felt a sense of relief. On the fourth morning, Baoyu suddenly opened his eyes and said to the Lady Dowager, “From now on, I shall no longer stay in this house—send me away at once.” The Lady Dowager, hearing this, felt as if her heart had been ripped out. Aunt Zhao, trying to console her, said, “Old Lady, do not be overly sorrowful; our son is of no use anyway. Better have his clothes properly packed and let him go back soon—at least he won’t suffer any longer. Even if you’re reluctant, if you keep holding on, he’ll only continue to suffer.” Before she could finish, the Lady Dowager spat in Aunt Zhao’s face and cursed, “You tongue-tied wench! How can you say he’s useless? What good would come from his death? Don’t be absurd! If he dies, I might as well take your life too! It’s all your fault—you have been goading him day after day, forcing him to study and write until his courage was shattered, and now you act as if he trembles before his own father like a scared little mouse. Isn’t it all because of your petty instigations? If you’re so intent on pushing him to death, then you’ll have your way! I’ll not spare a word!” She wept and cursed as she cried. Jia Zheng, overhearing these words, grew even more anxious and quickly shooed Aunt Zhao away, trying to soothe everyone. Suddenly, someone returned with the news, “Both coffins are ready.” Hearing this, the Lady Dowager felt as if a knife had stabbed her heart; she burst into tears and furious curses, “Who ordered these coffins to be made? Bring the men who made them here so I can beat them to death!” The uproar became absolute. Then, faintly, they heard the sound of a wooden fish from afar, accompanied by the chanting, “Namo Jieyuan, Jiejie Pusa! Whoever suffers misfortune, whose household is troubled, who is plagued by evil spirits or meets with calamity—come to us for healing!” Both the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang heard this and ordered their servants to search the street. It turned out that the voices belonged to a ragged monk and a shabby Taoist priest. What did that monk look like? He had a nose like a suspended gallbladder, long eyebrows; his eyes shone like bright stars with a precious gleam. Clad in a tattered kasaya and worn straw sandals with no trace of luxury, he bore a raw, festering sore on his head. And what of the Taoist? He appeared as if one foot were high and the other low, his body perpetually wet and trailing mud. When asked where he hailed from, he replied, “From Penglai, beyond the Weak Water in the West.” Jia Zheng ordered the two to be brought in and asked, “From which mountain do you practice your way?” The monk smiled and said, “Officer, there is no need for further words. Knowing that the household here is in distress, I have come specifically to heal it.” Jia Zheng asked, “There are two people afflicted by evil—do you know of any immortal remedy?” The Taoist laughed and said, “Your household now possesses a treasure of singular rarity; with it, there is no need to ask about a remedy.” Moved, Jia Zheng said, “When the child was born, he carried a piece of jade with the inscription ‘Able to Remove Evil’—yet it has lost its power.

Now, remove that precious jade from his neck and let me recite a few incantations; it will naturally regain its power.” Jia Zheng then took the jade from Baoyu’s neck and handed it to the two holy men. The monk held it in his palm, sighed deeply, and said:    “Beneath Qingeng Peak we parted thirteen years ago. Time in this world flies by; yet the bonds of fate remain unbroken—alas, alas! How enviable were those days:   Unfettered by heaven or earth, with neither joy nor sorrow in one’s heart.
If you need these, you should have said so earlier so that we could have brought them along at a lower price.”  Bao Yu said, “Nonsense! I am not so foolish as to run off risking my life for nothing.”  After a while, Bei Mei grinned and said, “I have an idea. I suspect that you, Second Young Master, will not only use these incense items—you will likely need others as well. Why not ride on for another two li? There is a Water-Narcissus Nunnery (Shuixian An) just ahead.”  Bao Yu asked eagerly, “The Water-Narcissus Nunnery is right here? Splendid! Then let’s go there.”  Without delay, he spurred his horse on, and while glancing back at Bei Mei he said, “The lady of the Water-Narcissus Nunnery is related to our family. Once we get there, we can borrow her incense burner; surely she will be agreeable.”  Bei Mei replied, “Even if it isn’t from our own family, any temple you are unfamiliar with would be too timid to refuse. But one thing—I’ve always seen you disdain this Water-Narcissus Nunnery. Why, then, do you now show such delight in it?”  Bao Yu answered, “I have long detested the vulgar practice of shamelessly worshipping deities and erecting temples without understanding the true origin. In days of old, rich men and foolish wives would hear of a deity and hastily build a temple, never knowing who the god really was—believing in wild legends as truth. For example, in the Water-Narcissus Nunnery they worship a ‘Luoshen’ and thus call it the Water-Narcissus Nunnery. Little do they know that there has never been any true Luoshen; it was merely the invention of Cao Zijian. Today, however, it suits my purpose perfectly, so I shall borrow their incense burner.”  Before long Bao Yu reached the gate. The elderly nun there, surprised to see him—as if a living dragon had fallen from the sky—rushed forward to greet him and ordered the old Taoist to come and take his horse. Bao Yu entered but did not bow before the Luoshen statue; he only took his time admiring it. Although it was a clay sculpture, it possessed the graceful mien of “fluttering as if startled, graceful as if swimming like a dragon; like a lotus emerging from clear waves, or the sun shining on rosy clouds.” Bao Yu was moved to tears. The elderly nun offered him tea, and Bao Yu then borrowed her incense burner to burn incense. After she had been gone for a while, she even prepared incense, ritual paper, and a paper horse. Bao Yu said, “I won’t use any of that,” and ordered Bei Mei to carry the burner to the back garden. They searched for a clean spot but could find none. Bei Mei suggested, “How about on the platform by the well?”  Bao Yu nodded. Together they went to the well platform, set the burner down, and Bei Mei stood aside. Bao Yu took out his incense, lit it on the burner, and—with tears in his eyes—offered a half bow before turning to command its removal. Bei Mei agreed but did not immediately remove it; he quickly got down and kowtowed several times, exclaiming, “I, Bei Mei, have known your heart these past few years. Only today, during this offering, did you not tell me your true thoughts. The spirit that receives the offering, though it may not even have a known name, must surely be that peerless, exquisitely intelligent and graceful young lady of the mortal world. Second Young Master’s unspoken heart is difficult to confess. I shall, on his behalf, pray for you. If you possess any spiritual power, come often and keep watch over him. And may you in the netherworld guarantee that in his next life he be reborn as a girl so that you two may play together—would that not be doubly delightful?”  After finishing, he kowtowed several more times before finally rising. Bao Yu, hearing that Bei Mei had not finished, couldn’t help laughing. He playfully kicked Bei Mei, “Don’t spout nonsense—people will hear and laugh at you!”  Bei Mei got up, gathered the incense burner, and walked with Bao Yu.
Liu reflected, then switched to another topic:  “Our village, next over from ours, has this old granny of ninety-something. She recites her Buddhist prayers daily. Who’d guess her devotion moved the Bodhisattva Guanyin to come in a dream saying, ‘You’re so devout. I told the Jade Emperor you shouldn’t be left without a descendant, so here’s a grandson for you!’ You see, that old granny had only one son, and he in turn only had one boy, who died at about seventeen. They wept until they were half-dead. But after a while, she truly gave birth to another grandson. Now he’s thirteen or fourteen, round as a little dumpling, bright as can be. Are the gods not real?”  This anecdote unwittingly touched upon the Dowager’s and Lady Wang’s own hopes, and even Lady Wang pricked up her ears. Yet Baoyu’s thoughts remained on that tale of the girl gathering wood. Even after hearing the second yarn, he was lost in thought. Tan-chun changed the subject, “Yesterday we borrowed Cousin Shi; let’s do something to repay her kindness. Perhaps we’ll arrange a session or a small banquet for the Old Ancestress to enjoy the chrysanthemums?”  Baoyu smiled, “The Old Dowager does want to throw a do to thank Cousin Shi. Let her do it. Then after we attend hers, we can do ours.”  “Time is passing,” Tan-chun noted, “It’s growing colder. I doubt the Old Dowager will be willing.”  “She quite likes wind and snow,” said Baoyu. “We can wait till the first heavy snowfall, then invite her to view it. We can write poems in the snow— how amusing that’d be!”  Lin Daiyu teased, “Yes, we can write poems in the snow, but from what that old granny said, better to haul some firewood in the snow, that’d be even more fun!” Her remark set off laughter among the other girls. Baoyu cast her a sideways glance but said nothing. When it was time to disperse, Baoyu stole away with Old Mrs. Liu and coaxed her into continuing that first story. Cornered, she had to improvise:  “Well… it’s a deserted shrine near the northern edge of our farmland. Not for gods or buddhas, but for some old lord… oh, I forget the name,” she said, flustered. “No matter the name or who it was—just the basic circumstances,” Baoyu pressed. “That old lord had no sons—only a daughter, named something like Ruoyu, who was educated and read. The parents doted on her like a priceless pearl. Alas, the girl took ill at seventeen and died.”  Baoyu stomped in regret. “So tragic. Then what?”  “Overcome by grief, the parents built that shrine and had a statue of her made. They hired caretakers to supply incense and stoke the fires. But many years have passed. The family died off; the shrine fell to ruin; the statue all but decayed… folks claim it’s turned into a spirit.”  “No, not a spirit,” Baoyu corrected. “Certainly such a person can’t truly die.”  Old Mrs. Liu invoked the Buddha: “So that’s how it is? We took it for a ghost. Folks say she roams around at night sometimes, and some want to smash her with mallets.”  Baoyu gasped, “They mustn’t! Leveling that shrine would be a grievous sin!”  “Your word, Master, sets me straight,” the old woman said. “Once I’m back, I’ll hold them off.”  Baoyu enthusiastically went on, “In fact, our Old Ancestress, our Lady, and everyone here are devout. We love building shrines and erecting images. Tomorrow I’ll write a donation request, so you can gather funds to rebuild that shrine and repair the statue, paying a caretaker to burn incense monthly. How’s that?”  “Well, thanks to that young lady, I’d get some funds for myself, too,” Old Mrs.
Shortly, Xifeng stepped out to the corridor: Yúanyāng and the others were happily feasting. Seeing her, they got up saying, “Madam, what brings you here again? We want to enjoy a bit ourselves.” Xifeng laughed, “You, Yúanyāng, are too wicked. I come to let you relish, but you don’t appreciate it and even complain. All right, pour me a cup at least, so I can drink.” Yúanyāng giggled, poured her a cup, and offered it to Xifeng’s lips. Xifeng threw her head back and drank, then Amber and Cai Xia each offered her another, which she also drained. Ping’er prepared a crab’s roe morsel; Xifeng said, “Stir in more ginger-vinegar.” After finishing it, she said, “Okay, you carry on—I must get back.” Yúanyāng teased, “Shameless thing, sneaking a share from us.” Xifeng retorted, “Don’t provoke me. I know your Master (Lian) fancies you and is about to ask Old Ancestress to let him take you as a concubine.” Yúanyāng reddened, half-laughing, “Shame on you! You’re the Mistress and you say such stuff! If I weren’t worried about dirtying you with fishy fingers, I’d wipe them all over your face!” She stepped up, hand raised. Xifeng squealed, “Good Sister, spare me this once!” Amber teased, “Now that Yúanyāng is going, can Ping’er resist? She’s only eaten two crabs but has drunk an entire dish of vinegar.” Ping’er, holding a roe-laden crab, turned to smear it on Amber’s face. “You wagging-tongue minx!” Amber giggled and dodged; Ping’er missed and lurched forward, smearing it square on Xifeng’s cheek. Xifeng, in mid-banter with Yúanyāng, was startled, crying “Ay!” so that all roared with laughter. Xifeng, too, had to laugh while scolding, “You little whore, messing up your mistress’s face as you feed your jealousy!” Ping’er quickly fetched water to rinse her off. Yúanyāng teased, “Ah, retribution in the moment!” The noise reached Grandmother Jia’s side, who asked repeatedly, “What’s so funny? Let us in on it!” Yúanyāng hollered back, “Second Mistress was vying for our crabs. Ping’er got annoyed and slapped crab roe on her face—Master and servant are brawling!” Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the rest were all amused. Grandmother Jia said, “Pity her. Give her the best bits—legs, or the belly. Let her enjoy.” Yúanyāng announced, “Plenty of crab legs here for Mistress to have.” Xifeng, having washed, returned to serve a bit more for the older folks. Lin Daiyu, wary of eating too much, had only nibbled half a crab’s claw before stepping away from the table. Grandmother Jia soon felt enough, and everyone washed their hands. Some strolled among the flowers, others watched fish in the pond. After a while, Lady Wang commented to Grandmother Jia:  “There’s a breeze here, plus we’ve eaten crab. Perhaps best to go rest inside. If you’d like more enjoyment, we can come back tomorrow.” Grandmother Jia, nodding, said, “So it shall be. I’d hate to break up your fun, but yes, let’s all withdraw.” Then she turned to Xiangyun, “Don’t let your Cousin Baoyu overindulge in these crabs.” Xiangyun assented. She also reminded Xiangyun and Baochai, “And you two, mind not to eat too much. Lovely as it is, that stuff can upset your stomach.” The two curtsied, seeing them off. Then, with the seniors gone, they told the maids to clear the remainders, setting up a fresh arrangement.
You’re just fidgeting and will soon get even more drunk! Why don’t you lie quietly for a while?” At that, she had someone bring him a pillow. Baoyu then collapsed right behind her, and he called for Cai Xia to pat him. Baoyu laughed and joked with Cai Xia, but she responded only briefly, her eyes fixed on Jia Huan. Baoyu grabbed her hand and said, “Dear sister, why don’t you pay attention to me too?” As he spoke and tugged at her hand, Cai Xia refused to give in, saying, “Keep this up and I’ll cry out!” At that moment, Jia Huan, who had long harbored a grudge against Baoyu, now seeing him frolicking with Cai Xia, felt his resentment rise even further. Lost in thought, he schemed and deliberately pretended to mishandle things; he clumsily pushed a bright, oozing wax candle straight onto Baoyu’s face. A startled “Ai-yo!” rang out from Baoyu, and everyone in the room was shocked. Hastily, someone brought a lamp from the floor to shine on him; they saw that Baoyu’s face was smeared with wax. Lady Wang, both angry and anxious, ordered that Baoyu be washed immediately while cursing Jia Huan. Feng Jie rushed onto the kang in a few quick strides to help tidy up Baoyu, exclaiming, “That little runt is still as clumsy as ever! I told you, you shouldn’t be put on display! Even Aunt Zhao should teach him proper behavior!” This remark reminded Lady Wang, who then called Aunt Zhao over and scolded, “To raise such an unfeeling child without proper discipline—how many times must I warn you? When you get carried away, you let him run wild!” Aunt Zhao had no choice but to swallow her anger and help clean Baoyu. They soon noticed that a row of blisters had appeared along the left side of his face, fortunately not near his eyes. Lady Wang, seeing this, was both pained and fearful that the Lady Dowager would question her; in her haste she began scolding Aunt Zhao again! Then she consoled Baoyu and had some “Bad Poison Powder” applied to his burns. Baoyu said, “It hurts a bit, but it’s not too bad; in a day or two it will be fine.” Lady Wang then ordered that Baoyu be properly sent back to his room. Xi Ren and the others were in an uproar. When Lin Daiyu learned that Baoyu had been burned after being out all day, she became gloomy; later that evening she sent people to inquire two or three times. When she learned of the burn, she hurried over herself. There she found Baoyu gazing at himself in a mirror, his left cheek thoroughly coated with medicated paste. Lin Daiyu, thinking it must be terribly painful, rushed to take a closer look, but Baoyu covered his face and waved her away, knowing his naturally fastidious nature would not permit her to see. Daiyu eventually gave up but asked, “How much does it hurt?” Baoyu replied, “Not terribly—give it a day or two and it’ll be fine.” Daiyu sat for a while and then went back. The next day, when Baoyu met the Lady Dowager, though he admitted that the burn was his own fault, the Lady Dowager couldn’t help but scold all his attendants again. One day later, a wet nurse named Ma Daopo—whom Baoyu had once regarded as his “dry mother”—came to the mansion. Seeing Baoyu, she was greatly startled; upon learning about his burn, she nodded with sorrow and began to trace a few patterns on his face with her finger, murmuring under her breath and reciting incantations, “This will be cured for sure; it is merely a transient mishap.” She then went on to tell the Lady Dowager, “Our ancestors and the Great Bodhisattva surely did not foresee the dire words of the sutras! It is said that when the children of high families grow up, many petty ghosts lurk in the shadows, waiting to pinch, twist, or even knock over one’s bowl at meal times—thus many noble families’ descendants never truly mature.” Hearing this, the Lady Dowager asked, “Is there any remedy for such a curse?” Ma Daopo replied, “That is simple enough—just engage in more virtuous acts to generate good karma.
Yuan Yang concluded, “All together, it forms ‘A Single Flower.’”  Old Liu raised both his hands in a gesture of humor and added, “But then the flower falls and forms a huge, odd gourd!” At this, the assembled guests broke into uproarious laughter. Outside, shouts and commotion were heard—though the cause remains unknown. We shall continue the story in the next installment. Chapter 41 Baoyu Tasting Tea in the Lóngcuì Nunnery; Old Liu Drunkenly Lies in the Yíhóng Courtyard  Old Liu, waving his hands, remarked, “When the flowers fall, they form a giant gourd!” At these words the assembled guests burst into raucous laughter. After the door cup had been consumed, he continued in playful jest, “Today, let me speak frankly—my hands and feet are rather clumsy, and having drunk too much, I carelessly knocked over this porcelain cup. If only a wooden cup were available instead—if I lost my grip, dropping it to the ground wouldn’t matter at all.” At his remark the laughter grew even louder. Fengjie, upon hearing this, quickly laughed and said, “If you truly want a wooden cup, I shall fetch one for you. But allow me to say first—wooden cups simply cannot compare with porcelain ones; they are always used in sets. One must taste an entire set before it is acceptable.”  Old Liu thought to himself, “I was only teasing, but who would have guessed that she’d actually have one? I have often attended feasts with the local gentry and seen golden and silver cups—but never a wooden one. Oh, of course, it must be the wooden bowls used by children to trick me into drinking more. Never mind; after all, this honeyed liquor is like ambrosia. Drinking a bit extra won’t hurt.” Finishing his thought, he said, “Let’s have it brought over and then discuss it further.”  At once Fengjie ordered Feng’er, “In the inner room, on the bookcase, there are ten sets of bamboo-root cups. Bring them here.”  As Feng’er prepared to fetch them, Yuan Yang teased, “I know those ten cups of yours are rather small. And now that you mention wooden ones, you’ve brought out bamboo-root cups—which don’t look very impressive. Why not use our huángyáng (boxwood) cups, made into a full set of ten, so I can make you drink a toast with each?”  Fengjie laughed, “That would be even better.”  Yuan Yang duly sent for them. When Old Liu saw the set of ten cups arranged in order of size—from one as large as a small basin to one so small that two would fit in his hand—he was both astonished and delighted. Astonished by the exquisite carving: a marvelous scene of mountains, water, trees, figures, inscriptions of grass characters and seals, all carved in a single tone. In his excitement he declared, “Bring me the smallest ones!”  Fengjie laughed, “This particular cup does not have the generous capacity, so none dare use it. Since you insist, Old Liu, if you really want it, you must taste every cup in turn.”  Old Liu, alarmed, quickly protested, “I dare not! Dear Madam, have mercy on me.”  Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue, and Madame Wang, knowing he was a man of advanced years, could not bear to see him overdo it and quickly laughed, “We’re only jesting; laugh as you may, but you mustn’t drink more than just this first cup.”  Old Liu replied, “Amitābha! I will stick to the small cup and set aside the big one, so I can take it home and savor it slowly.” His words elicited more laughter. Yuan Yang, with no alternative, ordered someone to fill a large cup to the brim. Old Liu, cradling it in both hands, drank deeply. Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue cautioned, “Slowly now—don’t choke!” Aunt Xue then commanded Fengjie to arrange some dishes. Fengjie said with a smile, “Old Liu, just name what you’d like to eat, and I’ll have it served for you.”  Old Liu replied, “I know all the names—everything here is delicious.”  Grandmother Jia suggested, “Have some salted eggplant served to him.”  Hearing this, Fengjie picked out a portion of salted eggplant and fed it to Old Liu, laughing, “You all eat eggplants every day—taste ours, prepared so delectably!”  Old Liu laughed, “Stop teasing me!
On rainy days he himself wears them at home. If you like them, I’ll have a set made for you. And if nothing else, it’s the hat that intrigues me most: its top is adjustable—when it snows, you remove the bamboo ties and wear just the rim. Both men and women use it. I’ll give you one to wear when it snows in winter.”  Daiyu laughed, “I don’t want that. Wearing it would make me look like one of those theatrical fisherwomen in costume.” As soon as she spoke, she realized that her remark echoed Bao Yu’s earlier words; mortified, her face flushed scarlet, and she buried her face in the table, choked with tears. Bao Yu, however, paid her no heed. Noticing a poem on the table, he picked it up and read it aloud with appreciation. Daiyu quickly snatched it from him and, in a fit of anger, nearly set the lamp afire. Bao Yu laughed, “I’ve memorized it already!”  Daiyu said, “I’m tired now—please, go on. I’ll come back tomorrow.”  Bao Yu then reached into his pocket and produced a gold watch about the size of a walnut. Glancing at its hands—which indicated a time between the late seventh and early eighth hour—he quickly tucked it away, saying, “I should let you rest; I’ve disturbed you all day.” With that, he donned his raincoat and hat once more, stepped out, then reentered and asked, “What would you like to eat? Tell me, so that tomorrow morning when I return to Grandmother’s, everything will be clear.”  Daiyu smiled, “I’ll think it over tonight and tell you in the morning. Now, listen—the rain grows heavier; please hurry. Is anyone with you?”  Two maids replied, “Yes, outside someone is holding an umbrella and lighting a lantern.”  Daiyu laughed, “A lantern at this hour—really?”  Bao Yu said, “It matters not; it’s a goat-horn style, which isn’t afraid of the rain.”  Hearing this, Daiyu went to the bookshelf, retrieved a glass lantern decorated with embroidered motifs, had a small candle lit, and handed it to Bao Yu, saying, “This one shines brighter—ideal for rainy nights.”  Bao Yu replied, “I do have one like that, but I worry it might fall and break, so I left it unlit.”  Daiyu remarked, “If a lantern falls, it’s the lantern that loses value—what matters is the person. And you’re not accustomed to clogs anyway. Let those outside hold the lantern up; this one is light and bright, and it’s mine. Bring it back tomorrow. Even if you drop it, it’s only a little mishap—why, suddenly you seem to have taken on the temperament of someone who ‘cuts open her belly to hide pearls’!”  Bao Yu laughed and accepted the lantern. Ahead, two maids with umbrellas and goat-horn lanterns, and behind, two little maids with umbrellas, accompanied him. He handed the lantern to one of the little maids to carry as he supported himself on her shoulder and departed. At the same time, two maids from the Hengwú Courtyard arrived carrying a large package of bird’s nest and another package of refined “snowflake” confections (made from powdered sugar with candied plum pieces). “These are far better than what one buys,” they said. “Our girls insisted, ‘Girls, eat first; more will be brought later.’”  Daiyu replied, “Thank you for your thoughtfulness,” and then ordered, “Take them out to the tea room for serving.”  An old maid remarked with a smile, “We won’t have tea now—we have other business.”  Daiyu smiled, “I know you’re busy. Now that the day is cool and the night is long, it is time for an evening gathering—and perhaps a couple of rounds of gambling.”  One old maid laughed, “Honestly, this year I’ve been lucky. Every night a few are on duty; if we don’t gamble, it’s no fun.
Xing retorted, “You unfilial wretch! Others would even risk their lives for their fathers, yet you complain about me. You haven’t behaved yourself these few days—if I were in your shoes, I’d be beaten raw.”  Jia Lian replied, “Madam, please hurry; I’ve been sent to fetch her for half a day already.” With that, he escorted his mother out to the other side. Mrs. Xing briefly recounted her side of the matter, and then, unable to do more, Jia She (Jia Zhen) himself—feeling both ashamed and helpless—soon fell ill and thereafter dared not see Grandmother. Instead, he sent Mrs. Xing and Jia Lian to pay their respects every day. In the meantime, various people were sent out to purchase and search until, at last, after spending 500 taels, a seventeen‑year‑old girl was bought and named Yanhong, to be kept in the house. For the next couple of days there was little more to report. Before long the fourteenth day arrived. It was dark early, and soon the wife of Mr. Lai arrived with invitations. Grandmother, delighted, led Mrs. Wang, Aunt Xue, Baochai, and the other sisters out to the Grand Flower Garden, where they sat for half a day. Although the Flower Garden was not as grand as the Grand View Garden, it was neat and spacious—with springs, rocks, groves, pavilions, and several charming spots. In the great hall outside, Xue Pan, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, and several close relatives were present. Mr. Lai’s household also invited several current officials and well-to-do young men as guests. Among them was Liu Xianglian—whom Xue Pan had met once before and could not get out of his mind. He learned that Liu Xianglian was especially fond of performing comic “sheng‑dan” (boy roles in opera) in folk plays, and often recited such “love and lust” pieces; misunderstanding his performance, some even took him to be one of the “romantic youths” of the theatre. Being young and handsome, his identity was misunderstood by many. Mr. Lai’s son, Lai Shangrong, who was a longtime friend of his, thus invited him as company. Yet after drinking, others managed their intoxication, except for Xue Pan—who relapsed into his old bad habits. In his sour mood, he wished to leave at once. But Lai Shangrong insisted, “Just now, Second Young Master Bao reminded me—although he saw you, with so many people around it’s hard to converse, so he told me to ask you not to leave when you’re dismissed; he still has words for you. If you insist on leaving, then I’ll have him called out so that you two may settle your differences—it doesn’t concern me.” With that he ordered the little servants, “Go inside and discreetly find an old maid to inform him. Tell him to come out quickly.” The servant obeyed. Before a cup of tea had been finished, Second Young Master Bao appeared. Lai Shangrong smiled at him, “Good uncle, leave him with you; I’ll arrange the rest,” and then departed. Bao Yu then took Liu Xianglian aside to the side-room and asked, “Have you been to Qin Zhong’s grave these past days?”  Xianglian replied, “Why wouldn’t I? The other day a few of us went falconing. His grave is about two li away; I thought that with the diligent summer rains his grave might be in disrepair. I even snuck away with the others to take a look—and spent a few hundred taels on repairs the very next morning.”  Bao Yu said, “That explains it. Last month, in our Grand View Garden, the lotus pods had ripened; I picked ten and sent Bei Mei out to offer them at his grave. When I asked him if the rain had damaged them, he said ‘Not only were they undamaged, but they look even fresher than before.’ I believe our friends have tidied up well. I only regret that I spend all my time confined at home—any movement is immediately noticed. Every time, someone stops me or advises me; even if I have money, I can never use it.”  Xianglian replied, “That matter is nothing for you to worry about.
Jiang Yuhan quickly rose to make amends. Everyone said, “Those who do not know are not guilty.”  A short while later, Baoyu excused himself to relieve himself, and Jiang Yuhan followed him out. Standing in the corridor, Jiang Yuhan again apologized. Baoyu, seeing his gentle, charming manner, felt deeply attached, and clutched his hand tightly, saying, “When you have time, come with us to our place. I have one more thing to ask of you—among your distinguished company there is a young fellow called Qi Guan, whose reputation now stretches across the land; alas, I have never had the chance to meet him.” Jiang Yuhan laughed, “That is my little name indeed.” Baoyu, delighted, stamped his foot and exclaimed, “How fortunate! Truly, your fame is well-deserved. Now that we have met for the first time, what do you say?” After a moment’s thought, he withdrew a fan from his sleeve, detached a jade pendant from it, and handed it to Qi Guan, saying, “This trifle is offered as a token of today’s friendship.” Qi Guan accepted with a smile, “I have received a token without merit—what can I do to repay it? Well, I too have a curious treasure; I only managed to fasten it this morning. It is brand new, and may serve to show a modest sign of my affection.” He then unfastened a large red scarf from his undershirt and handed it to Baoyu, saying, “This scarf was presented by the Queen of Qianxiang; in summer it graces the skin with fragrance and leaves no sweat. It was given by the Prince of Beijing yesterday, and only now have I worn it. Were it offered to another, I would never part with it. But since Second Master requests, please let me wear yours instead.” Baoyu, delighted, quickly took it and unfastened one of his own “Songhua” scarves to hand over to Qi Guan. Just as they finished tying them together, a loud shout rang out: “I’ve caught you!” Xue Pan suddenly leaped out, grabbing the two and shouting, “You two, leaving the feast without your wine—what are you doing? Bring it out so I can see!” They both protested, “There is nothing!” Xue Pan would not relent until Feng Ziying appeared and finally revealed the matter. Then they all resumed drinking until late in the evening. Baoyu returned to the garden, unfastened his outer garment, and sat down to drink tea. Xi Ren noticed that the pendant on his fan was missing, and asked, “Where did it go?” Baoyu said, “It was lost on horseback.” Xi Ren did not press further. Later, at bedtime, she saw that tied around his waist was a large red scarf spattered with blood spots. Realizing with almost complete certainty what had happened, she said, “Now that you have a proper belt, return mine to me!” Hearing this, Baoyu suddenly recalled that the scarf originally belonged to Xi Ren and should not have been given away. Regretting it deeply, he could only smile and say, “I’ll compensate you with another.” Xi Ren nodded and sighed, “I knew you would get up to these things—no wonder you never plan ahead!” After a few more words, she feared that he might be provoked into more mischief, and so they eventually went to sleep without further exchange. The next morning, when Baoyu awoke, he laughed and said, “Last night, I lost it and didn’t know—look at my trousers!” Xi Ren looked down and saw that the red scarf Baoyu had tied yesterday now hung around her own waist. Realizing that Baoyu had changed it during the night, she quickly untied it, saying, “I do not fancy this kind of thing; take it away at once.” Baoyu, hearing this, could only gently try to dissuade her. In the end, Xi Ren, unable to refuse, tied it around her waist for the time being. Later, when Baoyu went out, he finally unfastened it and tossed it into an empty box, changing into another one himself. Baoyu did not mention the matter further. When asked, “Did anything happen yesterday?” Xi Ren replied, “Second Aunt Lian sent someone to fetch little Xiao Hong. He was supposed to wait for you, but thinking it urgent, I decided on my own to send him off.” Baoyu said, “Very well.
Meanwhile, Baoyu sat beside Jia Mu upstairs. He told a small maid to bring the tray of items, having already reattached his jade. He began rifling through them, picking out pieces for Jia Mu to see. Suddenly noticing a bright gold-and-kingfisher-feather qilin, Jia Mu took an interest and remarked, “I recall seeing a child wearing something like this.” Baochai said, “Cousin Xiangyun (Shi Xiangyun) has one, only a bit smaller.” Jia Mu said, “So that must be Yun’er’s.” Baoyu muttered, “She’s come to stay with us so often, but I never noticed it.” Tanchun teased, “Sister Bao truly has an attentive mind—she remembers every little detail.” Daiyu gave a sardonic laugh, “He shows little interest in other things, but he’s very keen on these ornaments people wear.” Baochai, hearing this, pretended not to notice, and Baoyu—upon learning Xiangyun owned such a qilin—hurriedly stashed the piece in his bosom, fearing the others might wonder why he kept it upon hearing Xiangyun had one. With the item hidden, he darted glances around. No one seemed to pay attention, except Daiyu, who eyed him with a slight nod, as though in admiration. Baoyu felt somewhat uneasy; he took it out again and, catching Daiyu’s eye, forced a smile, “This is interesting. I’ll keep it for you until we’re home, then attach a tassel so you can wear it. How about that?” Daiyu turned away, “I’m not interested.” Baoyu said, “If you don’t want it, I’ll hold on to it myself.” He tucked it back in. He was about to speak further when Jia Zhen’s wife, You-shi, arrived with Jia Rong’s new wife, Mistress Hu, to greet Jia Mu. She dismissed them with, “You needn’t have come; I’m only here for some idle enjoyment.” Just then someone announced, “A visitor from General Feng’s household!” They had brought offerings of pork, incense, candles, and refreshments, on hearing that the Jia family was conducting services at the temple. Wang Xifeng promptly hurried to the main balcony and clapped her hands in dismay, “Oh my! I never anticipated this. We only came for a casual outing, but others assumed we were officially holding a grand ceremony, so they’ve sent gifts. All because of the Old Lady’s idea! Now I have to scrounge up gift envelopes.” She had barely finished when two stewards from the Feng household ascended. They had not yet finished when Zhao the Minister’s household also arrived with gifts. Presently, wave after wave of distant relatives and acquaintances—hearing that the Jia ladies were at the temple—came to present offerings. Jia Mu regretfully murmured, “We never meant to hold a proper ceremony; this was just a leisurely outing, but we’ve bothered them so.” Thus, after half a day of theatricals, she decided to head back in the late afternoon. The next day, she felt no inclination to return. Wang Xifeng, however, said with a grin, “Having begun by knocking on the wall, we’ve stirred up dust. We might as well continue our fun.”  But the previous day, that Taoist Zhang had mentioned a potential match for Baoyu, leaving Baoyu feeling uneasy. Upon returning home, he seethed at having his marriage discussed, declaring with finality he’d never see Zhang Taoist again—though no one knew exactly why. Meanwhile, Daiyu, having been out in the heat, had succumbed to mild heatstroke. Concerned, Jia Mu insisted on staying put. Wang Xifeng thus went with a small party of her own, leaving the rest alone. Baoyu fretted over Daiyu’s condition. He found himself with no appetite, frequently stopping by her quarters, fearing any mishap. Daiyu only said, “Why not go listen to your plays? You can’t be enjoying yourself by staying home.” Her words, spoken so casually, jabbed at Baoyu’s already raw nerves from hearing that marriage talk.
But I can’t compose verses well, so I kept quiet. Now that Third Sister’s raised the idea, let me come help see it done.”  Daiyu teased, “Yes, but first we must discard old forms of address, so we call each other poet-ladies instead of the usual sister or aunt. Or at least adopt courtesy names, so it’s not so mundane.” Li Wan nodded, “Indeed. Why not adopt courtesy names? Or ‘style names’ or ‘titles’— we’ll call each other that to keep it elegant. I shall call myself ‘Dao Xiang Lao Nong’ (the Farmer of Rice-Fragrance). I’m old enough anyway.” Tanchun laughed, “I’ll label myself ‘Autumn Fresh Dweller’ or something.” Baoyu objected, “Dweller or Lay-person, so plain. We have phoenix trees and plantains around, name yourself after them, that’s more interesting.” Tanchun said, “I like the banana leaves, so let’s say ‘Banana-Leaf Sojourner.’” The others found that witty. Daiyu teased, “Then quickly, haul you in for venison. Zhuangzi’s text says something about ‘banana leaves covering a deer’s remains.’ You calling yourself the Banana-lodge Deer begs we butcher you!” Everyone roared with laughter. Tanchun retorted, “I’ll find you a suitable title soon, see if I can’t get even.” Then she said, “She lives in the Xiao Xiang Pavilion, loves to weep, so we’ll style her ‘Xiao Xiang Consort’—since her tears might turn her bamboos into those spotted-lament ‘Xiang Fei’ stalks!” Everyone clapped, calling it apt. Daiyu hung her head in silence. Li Wan smiled, “I have one for Sister Bao, just three characters.” The group asked what. She said, “I dub her ‘Heng Wu jun’—‘The Lady of Fragrant Bank.’” Tanchun exclaimed, “That’s splendid.”  Baoyu asked, “Then me? Find me something.” Baochai teased, “You’re best labeled ‘Busy For Nothing.’” Li Wan said, “You used to call yourself ‘Lord of the Crimson Cave Blossoms’— that’s enough.” Baoyu dismissed, “Childish nonsense. Give me another.” Baochai said, “How about ‘Wealthy Idle Person’? You’re both well-off and idle, two blessings no one else can combine.” Baoyu retorted, “No, I’m unworthy. Let me remain un-titled.” Daiyu said, “He dwells in Yihong Court— ‘Lord of Yihong’ is apt.” They laughed. Li Wan said, “So let’s name the second girl ‘Bamboo Shoal’ and the fourth ‘Lotus Arbor’—they dwell in the Purple Reed Isle and Lotus Fragrance Quay. That’s settled.”  Li Wan concluded, “I outrank you by generation, so I’ll speak plainly: We form a group of seven. I and the second, the fourth do not do poetry. So the four who can compose are you: Tanchun, Baoyu, Daiyu, and Baochai. We three older ones will do separate roles. Let me be Master, they can help. We three might occasionally do a verse if the topic is easier.” Yingchun and Xichun, reluctant about verse, nodded relief. Tanchun said, “So I start the society but now you’re in charge? Fine, you old folks help. So be it.”  Baoyu declared, “Now let’s gather at your place (Dao Xiang Village).” Li Wan replied, “Wait, don’t press. Let’s name a date; tomorrow I’ll call you all.” Baochai said, “Though we shall fix regular gatherings, maybe every fortnight or so, because meeting too often might dull the fun.” Tanchun suggested, “Yes, two or three times a month is enough.” Baochai stated, “Let’s set the 2nd and 16th of each month, no matter the weather.
Just as he tried to get up, however, he was overcome by pain throughout his body. Before long, the guests at the table realized that both he and Xianglian were missing. They searched everywhere. Someone remarked, “Perhaps they slipped out the north gate.” Sè Pan’s usual attendant, who was always fearful of him, had been ordered not to follow—so who dared go in search of him? Finally, Jia Zhen, worried, ordered Jia Rong to lead some little servants to track them down. They eventually found, outside the north gate, near the bridge, Sè Pan’s horse tied to a tree. The onlookers said, “Alright then—where there’s a horse, there must be a man.” They all gathered near the horse, and soon they heard a groan from among the reeds. When they hurried over, they discovered Sè Pan lying there with his clothes in tatters, his face swollen and disfigured, as if he were a mud-covered sow. Jia Rong, suspecting what had transpired, dismounted and ordered someone to help him up, laughing, “It appears that Sè Pan, who always flirts shamelessly, has finally taken his dalliance too far into the reeds. Perhaps even the Dragon King has taken a fancy to you and wants you to court him—so you’ve bumped into the Dragon’s horn!” Sè Pan was so mortified he wished he could vanish into a hole—how could he possibly get back on his horse? Jia Rong then ordered a small sedan to be fetched from the inner quarters, and Sè Pan was escorted into the city. Jia Rong even intended to take him to the Lai household for a banquet, but Sè Pan pleaded bitterly, asking that no one be told; Jia Rong reluctantly agreed and sent him home separately. Later that evening, Jia Rong recounted the scene to Jia Zhen, and Jia Zhen laughed, “He needed to get his comeuppance!” By nightfall the party had dispersed, and inquiries were made afterward. Sè Pan remained in his room, nursing his wounds and complaining of pain. When Grandmother and the others returned home, both Aunt Xue and Baochai noticed that Xiangling (Xue Pan’s relative) was crying with swollen eyes. When they went to check on Sè Pan, they saw that although he bore scars on his face and body, he had not suffered any serious injuries. Aunt Xue felt both sorrow and anger, cursing Sè Pan and then cursing Xianglian, and even considered informing Mrs. Wang so that someone might seize Xianglian. Baochai hurriedly interjected, “It’s nothing serious—these things happen after a night of drinking. Anyone who gets drunk may be beaten a few times; that is well known. Besides, our household is notorious for its lawlessness. Mother only feels sorry because she’s worried. Once, when your brother recovered after several losses, those respectable men like Mr. Zhen and Jia Lian didn’t let him off lightly—and eventually someone had to apologize on his behalf.”  A few days later, Sè Pan lay in his room, cursing Xianglian, and even ordered his servant, “Go dismantle his house! Beat him to death and sue him!” But Sè Pan’s attendant was quickly hushed by Aunt Xue, who said, “Xianglian may have been rude while intoxicated, but now that he’s sober, he regrets his actions and is terrified of punishment.” Sè Pan, upon hearing this, realized his predicament. (How things ultimately resolve… we shall continue in the next installment.) Chapter 48 Excessive Passion Misleads One’s Pursuit of Leisure; The Cultivated Maiden, in Elegant Assembly, Sorrowfully Struggles to Compose Poetry  It happened that after hearing those words, Xue Pan’s anger gradually subsided. Three or five days later—though his pain had eased, and his wounds still had not fully healed—he pretended to be ill at home, ashamed to face his relatives and friends. Before long the calendar showed October. In the various shops, managers were busy settling their annual accounts and preparing farewell drinks for those returning home. One of these men, Zhang Dehui, who had long served as the overseer at Xue Pan’s pawnshop and now enjoyed a modest income of two or three thousand taels, announced that he, too, must return home this year and would only come back next spring. He said, “This year the supply of paper, letters, and spices is short—and next year they will be dearer.
She said, “You silly man, how could these humble Taoists have such things? We can’t accept this.”  Zhang Taoist replied, “It’s just a token of their respect. I can’t refuse on their behalf. If you deny them, you make me look unworthy, as if I scorned my own subordinates.” Hearing this, Jia Mu relented, and the items were taken. Baoyu said, “Old Ancestor, since Grandfather Zhang insists, we can’t decline. But what good is this stuff to me? Why don’t I have a servant carry them and distribute them to the poor outside?” Jia Mu smiled, “You make a fair point.” Zhang Taoist quickly objected, “Master Baoyu, though you wish to do good, these items—trifling though they may be—are still accessories. If you hand them to the poor, they won’t do any real good, and they might just get lost or wasted. If you want to help the poor, best distribute coin.” Baoyu nodded, “Very well. Then we shall keep them and hand out silver tonight.” With that, Zhang Taoist took his leave. Jia Mu and her companions proceeded upstairs; Jia Mu occupied the main balcony, Feng Jie and others the eastern one, while the maids were to watch from the western balcony in rotating shifts. After a while, Jia Zhen came by to report, “We drew lots for the performance at the altar—the first play is The Legend of the White Serpent.” Jia Mu asked, “What’s that about?” Jia Zhen replied, “It tells of how Emperor Gaozu of Han slew the white serpent, starting his great cause.” Jia Mu murmured in mild approval, “Well then, it seems the gods have arranged it so; we’ll just accept it.” She asked, “And the second?” Jia Zhen said, “That is Full of Court Officials.” Jia Mu nodded, “That one might do.” She asked, “And the third?” He replied, “The Dream of Nanke.” At that, Jia Mu did not speak further. JZ withdrew to prepare offerings, burn symbolic money, and commence the performances. Meanwhile, Baoyu sat beside Jia Mu upstairs. He told a small maid to bring the tray of items, having already reattached his jade. He began rifling through them, picking out pieces for Jia Mu to see. Suddenly noticing a bright gold-and-kingfisher-feather qilin, Jia Mu took an interest and remarked, “I recall seeing a child wearing something like this.” Baochai said, “Cousin Xiangyun (Shi Xiangyun) has one, only a bit smaller.” Jia Mu said, “So that must be Yun’er’s.” Baoyu muttered, “She’s come to stay with us so often, but I never noticed it.” Tanchun teased, “Sister Bao truly has an attentive mind—she remembers every little detail.” Daiyu gave a sardonic laugh, “He shows little interest in other things, but he’s very keen on these ornaments people wear.” Baochai, hearing this, pretended not to notice, and Baoyu—upon learning Xiangyun owned such a qilin—hurriedly stashed the piece in his bosom, fearing the others might wonder why he kept it upon hearing Xiangyun had one. With the item hidden, he darted glances around. No one seemed to pay attention, except Daiyu, who eyed him with a slight nod, as though in admiration. Baoyu felt somewhat uneasy; he took it out again and, catching Daiyu’s eye, forced a smile, “This is interesting. I’ll keep it for you until we’re home, then attach a tassel so you can wear it. How about that?” Daiyu turned away, “I’m not interested.” Baoyu said, “If you don’t want it, I’ll hold on to it myself.” He tucked it back in. He was about to speak further when Jia Zhen’s wife, You-shi, arrived with Jia Rong’s new wife, Mistress Hu, to greet Jia Mu.
Next, Feng Ziying spoke, “Daughter, delight—for your firstborn bore twins. Daughter, joy—for you secretly catch crickets in the garden. Daughter, sorrow—for your husband lies gravely ill. Daughter, melancholy—for a great gust has blown down the dressing hall.” With that, he took up his wine and sang:    “You are a darling, so full of affection,   So cunningly eccentric, a mischievous sprite—   Yet you do not believe my words; go quietly and inquire in secret   To learn whether I truly care for you!”  After singing, he drank his cup and said, “‘The crowing of a cock resounds outside the thatched inn under the moon.’” Then Yun’er spoke: “Daughter, sorrow—whom will you rely on for the rest of your days?” Xue Pan laughed, “My son, with Brother Xue at your side, what do you fear?” Everyone murmured, “Stop teasing him, stop teasing him!” Yun’er then added, “Daughter, melancholy—when will your mother’s beating cease?” Xue Pan said, “The other day, I saw your mother and made sure she would not beat you.” Everyone shouted, “Say no more, let’s have ten cups of wine!” Xue Pan quickly slapped himself and said, “You have no ears—no more words!” Yun’er continued, “Daughter, delight—when your lover is reluctant to leave home. Daughter, joy—when, living in a quiet place, your heart is at ease.” He then sang:    “In March, the cardamom blossoms open on the third day,   While a little insect tries to burrow in;   After a long while, unable to penetrate, it climbs onto a flower to swing. Oh, tender and delicate, if I do not open for you, how will you slip inside?”  After finishing his song, he drank his cup and said, “‘The peach blossoms are tender and graceful.’” Next, Xue Pan spoke: “I must now say: Daughter, sorrow—   Marrying a man who is as slow as a turtle.” Everyone burst into laughter. Xue Pan said, “What is so funny? Am I not speaking the truth? A daughter who marries a man destined to be a muddled fool—how can she not be heartbroken?” Everyone laughed, “You speak truly! Now, tell us the rest!” Xue Pan glared and said, “Daughter, melancholy—” but then paused. The others asked, “How can one be so melancholic?” Xue Pan replied, “It is as if a huge monkey has emerged from the embroidered chamber!” Everyone roared with laughter, “That must be fined—well, it can be forgiven for now, but that line makes no sense at all!” They then called for more wine. Baoyu said, “As long as it rhymes, that is fine.” Xue Pan retorted, “Enough already—what are we making such a fuss about!” At that, Yun’er laughed and said, “The next couplet will be even harder—allow me to speak for you.” Xue Pan exclaimed, “Nonsense! Truly, I am no good—is that so? Listen then: Daughter, delight—may you lazily rise on your wedding day!” Everyone marveled, “How elegant this line is!” Xue Pan said, “Daughter, joy—when one thrusts a cock’s member inward.” Everyone turned and shouted, “That’s dreadful! Come on, sing it already!” Xue Pan then sang, “A tiny mosquito goes ‘hmm, hmm, hmm’…” The guests were all taken aback, “What sort of tune is that?” Xue Pan continued, “And two flies buzz ‘buzzz, buzzz, buzzz’…” The others cried, “Enough, enough, enough!” Xue Pan declared, “Whether you like it or not, this is a new tune called ‘Humming Rhyme.’ If you are too lazy to listen, then you can forgo the wine base—I shall not sing it.” The guests all said, “Let it be, don’t delay others!”  Then Jiang Yuhan said, “Daughter, sorrow—when your husband goes away and never returns.
I get anxious at the idea of entertaining them, so I avoid them. I can just manage to chew a bite or two, take a nap, and amuse myself with these grandchildren when bored, that’s all.”  Old Mrs. Liu chuckled, “That’s truly your good fortune, ma’am. We can’t afford such ease.”  “Fortune, indeed, or just a worthless old carcass,” the Dowager teased, eliciting laughter from all. She went on: “I heard from Feng-lass you’ve brought a big load of melons and vegetables. I’ve had her put them away quickly. I’ve been craving some fresh produce from the field. The stuff in town markets is never as good.”  “These are just rustic trifles,” Old Mrs. Liu said. “Something fresh, that’s all. If we had our way, we’d enjoy fish and meat daily. But we can’t afford it.”  “All the same, it’s a pleasure,” the Dowager insisted. “Since we’re now acquainted, you mustn’t just go away empty-handed. If you don’t mind staying here, spend a day or two. Our place has a garden with fruit, too. Tomorrow you can have a taste, then bring some home, so your trip won’t be wasted.”  Seeing the Dowager so delighted, Lady Feng also urged, “We might not match your farmland for size, but we do have a couple of spare rooms. Stay a couple of days, share some stories from the country for our Old Dowager’s amusement.”  The Dowager smiled at Feng-lass. “Don’t tease her. She’s just a simple soul from the sticks, easily flustered by your jokes.” She signaled some maids to bring fruit for Ban’er, but the child, seeing so many strangers, dared not eat. The Dowager then had money given him, and some junior lads took him outside to play. Having finished her tea, Old Mrs. Liu started telling more stories from rural life, the trifling sights and wonders in the fields day by day, through all four seasons. The Dowager took great delight. Meanwhile, those assembled—Baoyu, the young ladies, and the rest— had never heard such talk, and found it more entertaining than a blind man’s novel performance. Though old, though rustic, Mrs. Liu possessed a streak of cleverness and had weathered many experiences. Observing how keen the Dowager was, and how much the young ones enjoyed her tales, she spared no detail. “You see,” she said, “we farm folk work fields and plant vegetables year in and year out, in spring, summer, autumn, winter, braving the elements—who has time to sit idle? Why, we set up wooden benches out there in the fields. You can’t imagine the strange incidents we witness! Take last winter, for instance, when it snowed for days and drifted three, four feet. I got up at dawn, hadn’t yet left the house, when I heard a rattle in the yard. I guessed someone was nicking our firewood. Sneaking to the window, I peeked out. Sure enough, it wasn’t from our own village, so I—”  “Must’ve been some traveler, caught in the cold, snatching a bit of wood to warm himself,” the Dowager said. “Not a traveler—here’s where it gets odd, Old Longevity Goddess!” Old Mrs. Liu exclaimed. “It turned out to be a girl, about seventeen or eighteen, extremely pretty, with a sleekly oiled hairstyle, all dressed in bright red jacket and a white silk skirt—”  She had just reached this point when a sudden commotion sounded outside, with someone calling, “Nothing serious—don’t alarm the Old Dowager!” Startled, the Dowager asked, “What’s happening?”  A maid answered, “Some water flooded from the stables in the southern courtyard. It’s all sorted out, nothing to worry about.”  Being so easily frightened, the Dowager stood at once, leaning on people as she went to the veranda. A rosy blaze was still visible in the southeast corner. Fearing a real hazard, she prayed under her breath and told them to get incense for the Fire God.
The rest must produce a poem each.” Yingchun said, “Better we draw rhymes by lot for fairness.”  Li Wan chuckled, “I came in just now and saw they brought in two pots of white begonias—why not do them as the theme?” Yingchun said, “We’ve not even admired them, we just rush to make poems?” Baochai reasoned, “We needn’t see them first. The ancients wrote verses on intangible inspiration. Anyway, the poem’s not about the pot; it’s the mind that counts.” So Yingchun rummaged a book on the shelf, opened a random page that revealed a seven-character regulated verse. “We’ll do the same form.” She then had a young maid name some random word—“men” (gate)—which locked them into the “thirteen-yuan” rhyme set, with the first rhyme as “men,” plus “pen,” “hun,” “hen,” “hun,” etc. Baoyu muttered, “Tricky… ‘pen’ with ‘men’—not easy!”  Shishu prepared four sets of paper and brushes. Each turned quietly to composition. Daiyu, oddly enough, fiddled with a parasol tree, teased a parrot, or joked with the maids, unhurried. Yingchun lit a short “dream-sweet” incense stick to measure time, so they had to finish before it burned out or face a penalty. Tanchun quickly finished first, revising a bit, and handed it to Yingchun. Then asked Baochai, “Do you have yours?” “Yes, I suppose,” said Baochai, “though it’s not great.” Baoyu paced the veranda, telling Daiyu, “They’re nearly done.” She answered, “Don’t bother me.” He turned and saw Baochai had copied her piece. Panicking at the waning incense, he exclaimed, “I only have four lines so far!” Then, scolding Daiyu, “The incense is nearly done, you’re still dawdling about in the dew?” Daiyu responded, “I can’t be rushed.” So Baoyu hurriedly jotted something, ignoring quality. Li Wan reminded, “Time’s up. If you’re not done, you’ll be penalized.” Baoyu complained but had to comply. They first read Tanchun’s:  On White Begonias (Seven-Character Regulated Verse) Twilight sun on cold grass beyond the repeated gate, Moss carpets the pot, glistening after rain. Jade-like in spirit, none can match its pure bright; Snow-like in flesh, so easily stirs the soul. A tender heart so frail—how can it compete, A phantom shape at midnight, the moon leaves its trace. Let none declare that draped-in-white immortals ascend— Rather, companion my autumn verse until dusk. They praised it. Next, they read Baochai’s:  She, precious of shape, by day behind a closed door. Herself draws water for the moss-filled pot. Rouge washed out, it left an autumn shade on the steps; Ice summoned, dew cast about the courtyard's soul. Pale to the extreme, a bloom’s true brilliance appears; Weighted by sorrow, could jade remain unscarred? She merits tribute as a pure White Empress— Silent and dignified, stands proud at day’s wane. Li Wan nodded, “As always, Sister Bao’s lines are solid.” Then Baoyu’s:  Autumn’s form, so delicate, leaning on gate after gate, Seven layered stems like piled snow in the pot. Emerging from her bath, the imperial beauty in ice’s reflection; At heart, Xi Shi, all jade in her soul. Dawn breezes can’t dispel a thousand sorrowful flecks, Past night’s drizzle only adds new tear-stains. She alone leans against a painted railing—seemingly pensive, Emotions swirl, the plaintive flute laments at dusk. He admitted Tanchun’s was better. Li Wan, however, favored Baochai for “substance.” At last, they pressured Lin Daiyu.
Failing that, he had her beaten. In her humiliation, Jin Chuan’er threw herself down the well in anger.”  He had barely finished when Jia Zheng’s face turned deathly pale. He roared, “Bring Baoyu here at once!” Fuming, he stormed toward his study, raging, “If anyone comes pleading for him, I’ll surrender them fatherhood and property altogether. Let me renounce these official robes, shave my head, and find some quiet place to end my miserable life, thus sparing the ancestors more disgrace at having such a son!” Onlookers, seeing him in that state, realized this again concerned Baoyu; not daring to intervene, they scattered. Jia Zheng, breath ragged, slumped into a chair, tears streaming, repeatedly ordering, “Bring Baoyu! Get a stick, get a rope, bar the gates! If word passes inside, he’ll be killed on the spot!” The pages had no choice but to concur and search out Baoyu. Baoyu, having been warned by Jia Zheng not to move, sensed peril but did not anticipate Jia Huan’s added accusations. He paced the hallway for a chance to send word inside but found no suitable messenger—nor was his page boy Bei Ming around. Desperate, he cornered an old female servant:  “Hurry in, tell them Father’s going to beat me—quick, please, it’s urgent!” But Baoyu spoke hastily, and the old servant, being half-deaf, only heard “jump in the well.” She said, “If he wants to jump, let him jump. What are you afraid of?” Realizing she was of no help, Baoyu pleaded, “Call my boy to me!” She misread it as him prattling about the concluded matter. The poor woman just shrugged: “Why fuss? Everything’s resolved, and Lady Wang gave some silver. All done.” Baoyu, at wits’ end, saw that words were wasted on her. Before long, Jia Zheng’s attendants arrived and dragged Baoyu in front of him. Seeing him, eyes inflamed with fury, Jia Zheng wasted no time questioning any details about “roaming with actors” or “neglecting studies.” He simply snapped, “Gag him and beat him to death!” The servants, trembling, pinned Baoyu to a bench and raised their heavy wooden paddle. After ten or so strikes, Baoyu, knowing it was futile to beg mercy, only sobbed “woo-woo,” muffled by his tears. Jia Zheng, deeming the blows too gentle, kicked aside the man wielding the board, seized it himself, and laid on another dozen strokes, each harder than the last. Baoyu, never having suffered such agony, at first screamed and struggled, but gradually his voice died away, leaving faint whimpers. Everyone, alarmed by the severity, rushed forward trying to stop him, but Jia Zheng refused:  “Ask him what abominations he’s done. Is it excusable? You lot have spoiled him, now you’d shield him at the brink? Someday if he kills father or betrays emperor, would you still intervene too late?” The crowd, sensing his fury was unstoppable, scrambled to find a way to alert someone inside. Lady Wang, hearing the uproar, had no time to inform Grandmother Jia and hurriedly put on clothes to come out, ignoring all eyes, a maid at her side. Men scattered in haste, uncertain how to stop the beating. Jia Zheng was set to strike more when Lady Wang appeared, intensifying his anger. Furious, his strokes landed all the harder. The two pages who had been holding Baoyu quickly let go, and Baoyu sprawled limp. Jia Zheng still aimed to continue, but Lady Wang clung to the paddle. “Enough! Enough!” he shouted. “You mean to kill me with frustration.” Weeping, Lady Wang pleaded, “Though Baoyu deserves punishment, you must take care, especially in this sweltering heat. The Old Ancestor hasn’t been in the best health. If you beat Baoyu to death, that’s one thing, but if it upsets her, what then?”  Jia Zheng sneered, “Don’t talk to me about that! I sired this unworthy wretch—he’s my failing. All my efforts at discipline go thwarted by others.
Look at me— I’m not the sort who’d drive them away, yet day after day they found themselves ill at ease. So once the master died, while I was still young, I turned them all out. If there’d been one who stayed loyally, maybe I’d still have someone to rely on now.”  At the mention of her late husband, she choked up, eyes reddening. Everyone soothed her, “No need to dwell on it—better to have parted ways.” They rose to rinse off their hands, planning to pay respects to the Old Dowager and Lady Wang. Meanwhile, older serving women and younger maids were tidying up the pavilion, gathering up cups and dishes. Xi-ren and Ping’er left together, heading out of the garden. Xi-ren invited Ping’er to come in for some tea, but Ping’er shook her head. “No thanks, maybe next time.” She was just about to head on when Xi-ren called after her:  “Wait—you know, neither the Old Dowager’s place nor Lady Wang’s has given out monthly wages yet this month. Why is that?”  Ping’er paused, glanced around to make sure no one else was within earshot, then whispered, “Don’t let it worry you—it’ll only be delayed a couple of days.”  Xi-ren arched an eyebrow, amused and slightly perplexed. “Why the secrecy? You look on edge.”  Ping’er lowered her voice further. “Here’s the truth: Our mistress has already taken this month’s wages and lent it out at interest. Until she collects from somewhere else, she can’t distribute the pay. But I’m trusting you with this secret because you asked. Don’t mention it to a single soul!”  Xi-ren smiled. “I can’t believe she’s short of money. You’d think she’d have enough by now, so why the hassle?”  Ping’er sighed, “As if! Over these few years, she’s rolled over just the wages alone to make a few hundred taels profit. Plus, she never has to spend her official allowances on herself; every ten or eight taels she squirrels away, invests again. Before long, her personal interest alone brings in well over a thousand taels each year.”  “She's using our money to generate her own interest,” Xi-ren teased, “leaving us waiting around like idiots!”  “That’s an ungrateful way to put it,” Ping’er said. “Haven’t you enough silver?”  “I have enough, sure—but no place to spend it,” Xi-ren replied. “All I do is save for that certain someone, you know.”  Ping’er said, “If at any time you need a big sum—some emergency— just come to me, I do have a little. Take it, and I’ll just deduct it from your future pay.”  “Not needed right now. If some crisis does arise, I can send for it.”  Ping’er nodded, took her leave, and walked out the garden gate, where a maid from Feng-jie’s side had come. “My mistress wants you—she’s waiting.”  “What pressing matter could there be?” Ping’er muttered. “I was just chatting with Lady Li. I’m hardly running away! But it’s always one lackey after another.”  “That’s not up to me,” the maid said. “You’ll have to discuss with the mistress.”  “You’re all getting too big for your boots,” Ping’er huffed but hurried along regardless. Arriving at Feng-jie’s place, Ping’er didn’t see her mistress in the front room. Instead, there sat none other than that old Mrs. Liu who had once come scrounging for gifts, with her grandson Ban’er in tow, accompanied by Zhang-cai’s wife and Zhou Rui’s wife. A few maids were there too, pouring out pouches of jujubes, squashes, and other produce. As soon as they saw Ping’er, they all stood respectfully.
Grandmother Jia laughed until tears welled in her eyes, even while Hu Po patted her back. She said, “Surely this is nothing more than Fengjie’s impish mischief—don’t believe his words.”  At that moment, as Old Liu was praising the delicate eggs, Fengjie laughed and said, “They’re priced at a tael or two of silver apiece—quick, taste one, for they’ll be cold and unpalatable soon.” Old Liu then extended his chopsticks to pick one up—but try as he might, he couldn’t grasp it. After a commotion in the bowl, he finally managed to lift one, only to have it slip down and roll on the floor. Hastily setting his chopsticks down and bending to pick it up, he found that someone from the floor had already retrieved it. With a sigh, he lamented, “For a price of a tael of silver, it vanished without even a sound!”  The guests, now too amused to continue eating, all turned their attention to him for further teasing. Grandmother Jia then said, “Who is now taking out those chopsticks again—without hosting a grand feast! It’s all due to Fengjie’s orders. Surely they should be exchanged again.” The chopsticks on the floor had not originally been prepared for such teasing; they were what Fengjie and Yuan Yang had brought. Hearing this, someone quickly gathered them up and replaced them with another pair of ebony chopsticks inlaid with silver. Old Liu remarked, “First gold, then silver—it just doesn’t compare to the ones we used back home.” Fengjie replied, “If the food were poisoned, the taste of silver would reveal it!”  Old Liu retorted, “The dishes here are so toxic that our food back home would be like arsenic by comparison! Even if I were to be poisoned, I’d still eat every last morsel.”  Seeing how entertaining Old Liu was, Grandmother Jia, delighted by his good appetite, had her own dishes brought over for him. She then summoned an old nurse to have various dishes neatly ladled into bowls. After the meal, Grandmother Jia and the others retired to Tan Chun’s bedroom for some idle chat. Meanwhile, the remaining tables were cleared away and another table was set up. Old Liu, looking at Li Wan and Fengjie seated together eating, sighed, “Of all the things, I love your household’s ways best—it’s true what they say, ‘Etiquette comes from the great families.’”  Fengjie quickly laughed and said, “Don’t be too sentimental now—it’s all in good fun.” Before she had finished her sentence, Yuan Yang joined in laughing, “Old Liu, don’t be cross—I’ll apologize on our behalf.”  Old Liu smiled broadly and said, “What have you young ladies said? We’re only trying to please our old lady—what’s there to be cross about? Just tell me what you need, and I’ll understand. It’s all in good humor. If I were truly angry, I wouldn’t say another word.” Yuan Yang then scolded playfully, “Why don’t you pour yourself another cup of tea, old fellow!”  Old Liu quickly responded, “That very sister has just poured tea for me—I’ve already eaten, and now it’s your turn to have some.” Fengjie then pulled Yuan Yang down beside her and said, “Come dine with us; there’s no need to make a fuss on your way back.” Yuan Yang sat down, and soon the old maids brought more bowls and utensils. After the three of them finished eating, Old Liu remarked, “I think you people barely ate a morsel, yet you don’t seem hungry at all. No wonder the wind is so chill today.”  Yuan Yang then asked, “There’s still plenty left—where did it all go?”  The old maids explained, “It hasn’t all been served yet; it’s waiting here, to be distributed equally among everyone.”  Yuan Yang said, “They won’t be able to finish it all—choose two bowls’ worth to send to the flat maid in Second Madame’s quarters.”  Fengjie objected, “She’s already had her meal—no need to send her any.”  Yuan Yang replied, “If she can’t finish it, she might as well feed it to your cat!” The maids, overhearing this, quickly selected two dishes, packed them in a small box, and sent them off.
Respectful greetings. Reading this, Baoyu couldn’t help clapping his hands and laughing:  “Splendid, Third Sister has real taste! Let’s do it— let me hurry to discuss it with the others.” Handing the note to a nearby maid, he dashed off with Cui Mo. Passing the Qinfang Pavilion, an old gate-warden woman approached from the back gate, carrying a letter:  “It’s from Cousin Yu (Jia Yun). He’s waiting outside, paying respects. He asked me to deliver this to you.” Baoyu opened it:  Your unworthy son Yun, respectfully greets Father: Ever since you magnanimously acknowledged me, day and night I think of how to fulfill my filial duty, yet find no way to repay your kindness. Some time ago, handling the purchase of flowers and plants, by Heaven’s grace I made acquaintance with many horticulturists and discovered many noted gardens. One day, encountering an extremely rare type of white begonia, I contrived countless methods to procure just two pots. If you, father, will accept me as truly your own child, please take these and enjoy them. As it’s still hot weather, and the young ladies in the Garden might be inconvenienced, I dared not come in personally, but instead sent a note of respectful greeting. I humbly kneel. Baoyu read, laughed, and asked the old woman:  “Has he come alone? Did he bring the flowers?” She replied, “Yes, two pots of them.” Baoyu said, “Alright, tell him I understand, I appreciate his kindness. Place them in my rooms.”  And so, continuing with Cui Mo, he arrived at Tanchun’s Autumn Fresh Hall, only to find Baochai, Daiyu, Yingchun, and Xichun already there. Seeing him come, all laughed, “Here’s another one!” Tanchun herself remarked:  “I had the notion to form a little circle. I wrote you all a note, and see, not one has declined. This show that my single summon enticed them all.” Baoyu grinned, “If we’d done this earlier in spring, we could have formed a club. Now in the autumn, we’re a bit late.” Daiyu said, “It’s not too late. No regrets. Just you, don’t keep pushing me—I dare not join.” Yingchun teased, “If you’re too shy, who dares join?” Baoyu said, “This is a serious undertaking, let’s all share ideas. No modest disclaimers. Everyone speak—Sister Bao, Sister Lin, propose something.” Baochai said, “Why hurry? We’re missing a few people.”  Just then Li Wan arrived, remarking, “Oh dear—how refined! Forming a Poetry Club, I claim the leading seat. Last spring, I had half a mind for it. But I can’t compose verses well, so I kept quiet. Now that Third Sister’s raised the idea, let me come help see it done.”  Daiyu teased, “Yes, but first we must discard old forms of address, so we call each other poet-ladies instead of the usual sister or aunt. Or at least adopt courtesy names, so it’s not so mundane.” Li Wan nodded, “Indeed. Why not adopt courtesy names? Or ‘style names’ or ‘titles’— we’ll call each other that to keep it elegant. I shall call myself ‘Dao Xiang Lao Nong’ (the Farmer of Rice-Fragrance). I’m old enough anyway.” Tanchun laughed, “I’ll label myself ‘Autumn Fresh Dweller’ or something.” Baoyu objected, “Dweller or Lay-person, so plain. We have phoenix trees and plantains around, name yourself after them, that’s more interesting.” Tanchun said, “I like the banana leaves, so let’s say ‘Banana-Leaf Sojourner.’” The others found that witty. Daiyu teased, “Then quickly, haul you in for venison. Zhuangzi’s text says something about ‘banana leaves covering a deer’s remains.’ You calling yourself the Banana-lodge Deer begs we butcher you!” Everyone roared with laughter.
After all, he’s grown up now—if we keep him confined at home out of fear that he doesn’t know the world, he’ll remain the same next year. Since he speaks so confidently, Mother has decided to set aside 1,800 taels to try him out. With reliable men to help him, he won’t be easily duped. And if he goes out, with no one to spur him on and no one to depend on, he’ll know what it means to struggle. I’m afraid, though, that he might end up saving himself more by staying put,” Baochai observed thoughtfully. After a long pause, Aunt Xue agreed, “It’s as you say. Spending a little money to teach him some manners is worthwhile.” Their discussion ended without further words. The next day, Aunt Xue (or “Aunt Yita”) summoned Zhang Dehui to the study. She ordered that Xue Pan be treated to wine and a meal. Meanwhile, she positioned herself in the back corridor by a window, speaking in earnest to Zhang Dehui and imploring him to look after Xue Pan. Zhang Dehui promised in full, finishing the meal and then saying, “The fourteenth day is an auspicious day for travel. Our esteemed brother will prepare his luggage and hire mules so that he may set out at dawn on the fourteenth.” Xue Pan was overjoyed and promptly reported this to his mother. Aunt Xue, Baochai, Xiangling, and two elderly maids and young maids busied themselves for several days preparing for the journey. They assigned one of Xue Pan’s “old servant” (the one responsible for his milk delivery) and two veteran servants familiar with old customs. In all, there were six attendants. They hired three large carts solely for moving luggage, and also hired four sturdy mules. Xue Pan rode a sturdy, dark-blue mule bred in the household, while an extra riding horse was arranged. Once all was in order, Aunt Xue and Baochai spent the night admonishing him (words need not be repeated here). On the thirteenth day, Xue Pan first bade farewell to his maternal uncle, then went to bid farewell to the Jia family. Jia Zhen and others made a few parting remarks; details need not be recounted. Finally, on the morning of the fourteenth, Aunt Xue, Baochai, and the others escorted Xue Pan out of the ceremonial gate—while his mother and his younger sister’s four eyes watched him leave and then return. Aunt Xue’s retinue from the capital consisted of only four or five households, along with two or three elderly maids and a few young girls. Now, having accompanied Xue Pan away, only one or two men remained outside. Thus, that very day Aunt Xue went to the study and had all the furnishings, playthings, curtains, and such moved inside and stored away. She then ordered the wives of the two men who had accompanied them to come in and sleep. She further instructed Xiangling to tidy up his room and “lock the door—so that at night you can sleep with me.” Baochai said, “Since Mother has these people to keep her company, why not ask Sister Ling and me to accompany her? Our garden is empty, and as the night grows long, if I work all night, adding another companion would only be better.” Aunt Xue laughed, “That’s right—I almost forgot. I should have asked you earlier. I even told your brother the other day: ‘Wen Xing is still young; he won’t last long; Ying’er by herself isn’t enough to serve, so you must also buy a maid for assistance.’” Baochai replied, “We need to find one who is reliable; if we get the wrong one, it’s a small expense, but it’s best to take our time and, if someone with a proven background is found, purchase her.” With that, she ordered Xiangling to pack up the bedding and furniture and have an elderly maid and Zhen’er deliver them to the Hengwú Courtyard; then Baochai and Xiangling returned to the garden. Xiangling said to Baochai, “I originally planned to speak with Madam later, once Grandfather had left, so that we might be companions. I feared Madam might suspect that I was simply coming to loaf about in the garden—but you ended up mentioning it.” Baochai laughed, “I know you’ve long envied this garden for more than just a day or two, but you never had the leisure to enjoy it fully.
In my view, she likely wasn’t truly trying to kill herself out of spite. Perhaps while wandering near the well, she slipped and fell. Could she truly have that much hatred? Even if so, that speaks to her folly. There’s nothing you could have done. Her passing is sad, but a fleeting matter.”  Lady Wang sighed, “Nevertheless, I can’t rest easy. I’ve already given her mother fifty taels of silver. I wanted to provide some new clothes from the girls’ wardrobes to wrap her in. But only Lin Daiyu’s birthday outfits were finished, and that child is so sensitive—how could I use her clothes for a burial? So I’ve ordered tailors to hurry up a new set. If it had been some ordinary maid, I’d just give silver. But Jin Chuan’er, serving me intimately, was almost like a daughter…” She broke into tears again. Baochai gently said, “Aunt, no need to strain yourself further. I have two sets of new garments that might be suitable. We can use those—why trouble to have new ones made this instant? She often wore my hand-me-downs, so presumably they’ll fit.”  Lady Wang asked, “But wouldn’t you mind the bad omen?”  Baochai smiled, “I never bother with such superstitions.” She left to fetch them, accompanied by two serving women Lady Wang had assigned. Returning, they found Baoyu seated near Lady Wang, tears brimming. Lady Wang had evidently been scolding him but fell silent when Baochai arrived. Perceiving the tension, Baochai said nothing further, handing over the clothes, which Lady Wang then sent off with Jin Chuan’er’s mother. Chapter 33 Hostile Glances Among Kin Over a Few Words; Various Misdeeds Lead to a Harsh Paternal Reprimand  Lady Wang summoned Jin Chuan’er’s mother, handed her a few pieces of hair ornaments before her very eyes, and instructed, “Invite a few Buddhist monks to recite prayers, releasing her soul from suffering.” Jin Chuan’er’s mother kowtowed, expressed gratitude, and departed. Baoyu, returning from his meeting with Yu Cun (Jia Yucun), heard that Jin Chuan’er had taken her own life out of shame. The news rent his heart in two. Then, after he came inside, Lady Wang had stern words of reproach for him, to which he had no real reply. Spotting Baochai entering, he quickly seized the moment to slip away. Uncertain of where to go, he wandered aimlessly, hands clasped behind his back, head bowed. Sighing to himself, he ambled into the front hall. Just as he rounded the painted screen, he collided head-on with someone coming the other way. That person barked, “Stop there!” Startled, Baoyu lifted his eyes and, seeing it was none other than his father Jia Zheng, he instantly sucked in a sharp breath and silently stood off to one side, hands lowered. Jia Zheng demanded, “What is this forlorn look? A moment ago Yu Cun wanted to see you, and you took an age to appear. Once you finally did, you scarcely uttered a single confident or lively word, just mumbled away in disarray. Even now, you’re sighing like your heart’s full of private discontent. With everything you have, what can be lacking, and why such a show? Come, give me a proper explanation!”  Though Baoyu ordinarily possessed a quick tongue, his mind now was wholly consumed with grief over Jin Chuan’er—he felt he wanted to die alongside her. So he barely registered his father’s words, standing there dumbstruck and lost. Jia Zheng observed his son’s panic and speechlessness, which was uncharacteristic, and his displeasure grew. He was about to scold him when a gate attendant arrived, announcing, “There is a messenger from Prince Zhongshun’s household here to see Master.” Hearing that, Jia Zheng began to wonder: “We hardly have dealings with Prince Zhongshun’s estate—why send someone today?” Nonetheless, he ordered, “Bring him to the reception hall,” and hurried inside to change attire. When he emerged, he greeted the visitor with polite ceremony, had tea served, and they had scarcely begun exchanging pleasantries when that official from Zhongshun’s mansion took the lead:  “Sir, I do not come uninvited of my own accord.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Xing and Madame Wang continued to discuss Fengjie. Grandmother Jia remarked, “What is there to fuss about? You young ones are as greedy as cats—how can you possibly be trusted to keep a secret? Ever since you were little, everyone has been treated like this. It’s all my fault for letting you drink too much and get all sour!”  This remark made everyone laugh. Grandmother Jia added, “Rest assured—tomorrow I’ll have your son-in-law apologize on your behalf, so do not let yourself be humiliated today.” She then scolded, “As for that Ping’er—her little feet—I always thought well of her. How can she behave so badly behind our backs?”  You and the others laughed, “It isn’t Ping’er’s fault; it is Feng who uses her as a scapegoat. When the couples quarrel, they always take it out on Ping’er. Poor thing!”  Grandmother Jia said, “That’s right. I always say, the child isn’t like that cunning enchantress. Seeing her suffer so undeservedly, I will have her master come tomorrow and personally apologize on her behalf. Today is his good day—he must not be allowed to be angry.”  It turned out that earlier, Ping’er had already been taken into the Grand View Garden by Li Wan. Ping’er wept bitterly, and Baochai consoled her, “You are sensible enough. Grandmother has always cared for you. Today, he only had one extra sip of wine—he won’t take his anger out on you. Others have already mocked him for being insincere.”  Just then, Hu Po came over with Grandmother’s message. Ping’er, noticing a certain brightness return to her face, slowly recovered and no longer advanced. After a while, after the guests had rested, they turned to see Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Bao Yu then made way for Ping’er to come into the Yíhóng Courtyard. Xiangren quickly helped, saying, “I had intended to give you your due, but since our eldest sister and the other girls all insist on you, I dared not refuse.”  Ping’er smiled and said, “Thank you very much.” She then added, “Really, I’ve suffered for no reason—being caught in all this aggravation for nothing!”  Xiangren teased, “Second Young Lady has always been kind to you. It was merely a moment of anger last night.”  Ping’er replied, “Second Young Lady never said a word; it’s just that that harlot insulted me—and then our foolish master ended up beating me.” With that, she broke into tears again. Bao Yu quickly consoled, “Dear sister, do not be sorrowful. I will go and apologize on your behalf.”  Ping’er asked, “What does that have to do with you?”  Bao Yu smiled, “We are all siblings in heart. If they wrong someone, I should be the one to make amends.” He continued, “It’s a pity your new clothes got soiled. Why don’t you change them? I’ll even help you: we can spray them with strong wine and iron them carefully, and then re-comb your hair.”  While he spoke, he ordered some little maids, “Fetch some water for washing faces and an iron for pressing.”  It was well known that Bao Yu had never before shown his true heart toward Ping’er—even though Ping’er was Jia Lian’s beloved concubine and Fengjie’s trusted aide, Bao Yu always kept his distance. Consequently, he never treated her with complete sincerity, and over time he had harbored a grudge. Now, seeing his gentle manner toward Ping’er, she secretly mused, “Truly, his reputation is well-deserved; he considers every detail so thoughtfully.” And when Xiangren opened a chest to reveal two sets of spare clothes (which were hardly ever worn), she quickly went to wash her face. Beside him, Bao Yu laughed and advised, “Dear sister, you should put on some powder—otherwise you look as if you’re sulking against Fengjie. Besides, today is your good day; Grandmother herself sent someone to comfort you.”  Ping’er agreed and went to fetch some powder—but none could be found.
Why do you get to be cool?” Jia Rong, with head bowed, dared not speak. Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia Qin, and the rest were all petrified; even Jia Lian, Jia, Jia Qiong, and others hurriedly crept away along the wall. Jia Zhen snapped, “What are you standing here for? Hurry back home and tell your mother—Grandmother and the ladies are here, so she’d better hurry along to wait on them!” Frightened, Jia Rong sprinted off, repeatedly calling for his horse, all the while complaining, “That’s what I get for being left in the dark!” and scolding the stable-boys, “Are your hands tied? Bring my horse at once!” He wanted to send a young servant in his place, but feared rumors might spread, so he had no choice but to go himself, riding off quickly. Just as Jia Zhen was about to proceed inward, he noticed a Taoist named Zhang, who stood by, smiling. “By all rights,” said the Taoist, “I should be waiting upon you inside. But the weather’s hot, the young ladies have come, and the officiant fears to intrude, so he awaits your orders. Worried in case the Old Lady wonders, or might wish to visit somewhere, I’m staying here at your service.”  Jia Zhen knew that this Zhang Taoist was the old “substitute” who had served the Late Duke of Rongguo, honored by the emperor as the “Grand Illusioned Immortal,” holding the official Daoist Register, titled “Immortal to the End.” Princes and dukes treated him like a deity, and he frequented both Mansions, known to the mistresses and daughters. JZ thus dared not slight him. With a laugh, Jia Zhen said, “There’s no need for such formality with us. Speak again and I’ll tug that beard out of yours. Now come on in!” The Taoist joined him in good humor. When they reached Jia Mu, Jia Zhen respectfully said, “Old Lady, Taoist Zhang has come to greet you.” Jia Mu replied, “Invite him in.” Jia Zhen ushered him forward. Zhang Taoist laughed heartily, “Boundless Longevity to you! May the Old Ancestor enjoy long life and peace, and good fortune to all these ladies and maidens! It’s been a while since I visited the Mansion in person, but I see the Old Ancestor is looking even more radiant.” Jia Mu smiled, “How are you, Immortal Zhang?” Zhang Taoist replied, “Thanks to your blessings, this humble priest is well enough—only I’ve been worried about our young master. How has he been? On the 26th of the fourth month, we celebrated the Great Obscured Five’s birthday here. There were few guests, and everything was in proper order. I thought to invite the young master for a stroll, but they said he wasn’t at home?” Jia Mu said, “Indeed, he was not home then,” and she turned to call, “Baoyu.”  But Baoyu had stepped away to relieve himself, returning in haste. Rushing forward, he greeted, “Greetings, Grandfather Zhang!” The Taoist also embraced him warmly, grinning, “My boy, you’ve grown so robust!” Jia Mu interjected, “He might look strong on the outside, but inside he’s frail; plus, his father forces him to study day and night, nearly driving him into illness.” Zhang Taoist nodded, “The other day, I saw some of the poems and calligraphy your son had done—superb! Why would the Master grumble that he doesn’t like books enough? If this humble priest may suggest, he’s plenty accomplished!” With a sigh, he added, “Observing his figure, his conversation, his every gesture—why, it’s exactly like the old Duke in his day!” His eyes rimmed with tears. Seeing this, Jia Mu felt a twinge of sorrow herself. “Indeed,” she mused aloud, “I’ve raised quite a few sons and grandsons, but none resembles him as much as this precious boy does his grandfather.”  The Taoist turned to Jia Zhen, “Of course, in your generation, you never saw the old Duke.
Do you think I wouldn’t thank you?” Ma Daopo laughed, “If I did not pity you both so much, I’d never wish to see you suffer. As for gratitude, I’m not seeking it.” Aunt Zhao, now slightly mollified, said, “You, so wise, how can you be so muddled? Your method is truly effective—in the end, all our wealth will be ours; then, what can’t we have?” Ma Daopo lowered her head for a long while and then said, “When everything is settled and there’s no evidence left, you’ll still be inclined to listen to me!” Aunt Zhao replied, “That’s not difficult at all—I’ve already saved a few taels and a hundred pieces of jewelry. Just take a few of these; I’ll even write an IOU for you, and when the time comes, I’ll repay you in full.” Ma Daopo considered for a moment and said, “Very well—I must advance the funds first.” Before Aunt Zhao could ask further, she quickly sent a little maid away, opened a chest, took out some jewelry and scattered silver, and wrote an IOU for fifty taels, which she handed to Ma Daopo, saying, “Take this now as your offering.” Seeing these items along with the IOU, Ma Daopo readily accepted, reached out and took the silver, then kept the IOU. She asked Aunt Zhao for a piece of paper, and using scissors she cut out two little paper figures, inquiring about their ages, which she then wrote on them. Next, she took a sheet of blue paper, cut out five paper-faced green ghosts, arranged them together, and pinned them with a needle, saying, “I shall perform a ritual when I return—it will surely work.” Just then, one of Lady Wang’s maids entered and said, “Aunt Nai Nai is in her room. The Mistress is waiting for you.” With that, the two dispersed, and Ma Daopo went on her way. Meanwhile, Lin Daiyu, since Baoyu’s burn had kept him indoors, often conversed with her there. That day after dinner, after reading a couple of chapters, she spent some time sewing with Zijuan, but feeling restless and discontented, she went out to admire the newly sprouted bamboo shoots in the courtyard. Unwittingly, she left the courtyard and entered the garden. Looking around and finding no one about except for the vibrant flowers and chirping birds, she strolled toward Yihong Court. There she saw several maids fetching water; in the gallery, some were watching the painted eyebrow maids bathe. From inside a room she heard laughter; it turned out that Li Wan, Feng Jie, and Baochai were present. At the sight of her arrival, they all laughed, “Aren’t there two more here?” Daiyu smiled and said, “Today we are all together—who arranged for this visit?” Feng Jie replied, “I sent two bottles of tea to the young ladies the other day—did you like it?” Daiyu said, “I nearly forgot; thank you for thinking of us.” Baoyu remarked, “I tried it and it wasn’t very good; I don’t know what others say.” Baochai commented, “It tasted alright, at least verbally.” Feng Jie added, “That tea came from the tribute of Siam. I found it not so good myself—nothing compared to what we usually drink.” Daiyu said, “I found it pleasant, though I wonder about your stomachs.” Baoyu said, “If you like it, then just take all of mine away.” Feng Jie replied, “I still have plenty.” Daiyu said, “I’ll ask a maid to fetch some.” Feng Jie said, “No need—I’ve already sent someone. Tomorrow I have another favor to ask of you; have someone send it over as well.” Daiyu laughed, “Listen to that—just a bit of tea and you manage to summon people!” Feng Jie laughed, “Since you’ve had our tea, why don’t you become our daughter-in-law?” Everyone burst into laughter. Daiyu’s face flushed scarlet as she turned away, silent.
Soon Grandmother Jia awoke and began to set the evening meal in the Dàoxiāng Village. Feeling rather languid, she did not eat but instead sat on a bamboo chair in a light open sedan and returned to her room to rest, instructing Fengjie and the others to dine. Her daughters soon returned to the garden. For reasons now unknown, we shall continue the tale in the next chapter. Chapter 42 Lord Héngwú’s Refined Explanations Dispelling Oddities; Master Xiāoxiāng’s Elegant Jests Filling in the Remaining Notes  After Grandmother Jia and Madame Wang had departed, the sisters returned to the garden for a meal. Old Liu, accompanied by Ban’er, went first to see Fengjie and said, “Tomorrow morning I must head home. Though I’ve only stayed a couple of days, these few days have been filled with experiences—tasting, seeing, and hearing things I never knew existed. I’m truly grateful that Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue, and all the young ladies—even the maidservants in each household—have so kindly cared for an old man like me. When I go, I have nothing else to repay them but to offer high incense and recite Buddhist sutras for you every day, praying that you all live to a hundred. That will be enough compensation for my heart.”  Fengjie laughed and replied, “Don’t flatter yourself—all this is done for you. Even Grandmother’s been affected by the wind, lying there complaining of discomfort; and our eldest sister has caught a chill and is running a fever.”  Old Liu sighed and said, “Grandmother is advanced in years and cannot bear excessive exertion.”  Fengjie continued, “She’s never been as happy as yesterday. Usually when we stroll in the garden we only sit in one or two places, but yesterday—because you were here—they made sure to tour the entire garden; nearly half the grounds were covered. And our eldest sister, since I sent for you, received a cake from Madame Wang—but who would have thought that eating it out in the open would give her a fever?”  Old Liu remarked, “I fear our eldest sister won’t venture far into the garden. Unlike our children—who, in a moment, might run off to some graveyard—first, the wind might unsettle them, and second, if they remain too neat and proper, they may even encounter a spirit. In my opinion, we should have her view a talismanic booklet, to carefully ward off any ill spirits.”  At these words Fengjie was reminded, and she called for Ping’er to bring out the "Jade Box Record." After a short while, Cai Ming began to recite:  “On the twenty-fifth day of the Eighth Month, for the ailing one— From the southeast a spirit appears; a vengeful female ghost from a deceased family haunts, accompanied by a Flower God. Offer forty sheets of five-colored paper money and, taking forty steps to the southeast, send them off—great auspice!”  Fengjie laughed and said, “Truly, it is as if the spirit here in the garden is not the Flower God at all! I only worry that Grandmother herself may have encountered one.” She then ordered that two portions of paper money be prepared and assigned two attendants—one to accompany Grandmother Jia and one to accompany our eldest sister—for the exorcism. And sure enough, our eldest sister soon slept soundly. Fengjie continued with a laugh, “It is really those of you with more years who have experienced more. Our eldest sister often falls ill, though we do not know why.”  Old Liu replied, “That happens too. Children of wealthy families are pampered and delicate, and naturally cannot withstand even minor hardships. And little ones who are overly spoiled can hardly stand up to any adversity. Perhaps in the future Aunt Xue should be a little less indulgent with her.”  Fengjie agreed, “That is true. I recall that our eldest sister still does not even have a proper name—why don’t you give her one, to commemorate your longevity; after all, you are from the village, and you need not worry about offending anyone. After all, poor folk’s names are meant to carry weight.”  Old Liu, upon hearing this, thought for a moment and then laughed, “When did you take her in?”  Fengjie replied, “It happened on a rather inauspicious day—coincidentally, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.”  Old Liu quickly laughed, “That’s perfect—let her be called ‘Qiǎo Jie’ (Clever Sister).
There were few guests, and everything was in proper order. I thought to invite the young master for a stroll, but they said he wasn’t at home?” Jia Mu said, “Indeed, he was not home then,” and she turned to call, “Baoyu.”  But Baoyu had stepped away to relieve himself, returning in haste. Rushing forward, he greeted, “Greetings, Grandfather Zhang!” The Taoist also embraced him warmly, grinning, “My boy, you’ve grown so robust!” Jia Mu interjected, “He might look strong on the outside, but inside he’s frail; plus, his father forces him to study day and night, nearly driving him into illness.” Zhang Taoist nodded, “The other day, I saw some of the poems and calligraphy your son had done—superb! Why would the Master grumble that he doesn’t like books enough? If this humble priest may suggest, he’s plenty accomplished!” With a sigh, he added, “Observing his figure, his conversation, his every gesture—why, it’s exactly like the old Duke in his day!” His eyes rimmed with tears. Seeing this, Jia Mu felt a twinge of sorrow herself. “Indeed,” she mused aloud, “I’ve raised quite a few sons and grandsons, but none resembles him as much as this precious boy does his grandfather.”  The Taoist turned to Jia Zhen, “Of course, in your generation, you never saw the old Duke. Even your father’s generation likely doesn’t recall him well.” Chuckling, he continued, “The other day, at someone’s house, I caught sight of a young lady, perhaps fifteen, pretty as could be. I thought, ‘Master Bao ought to be considering marriage.’ Judging by looks and intelligence, and her family background, the match is well-suited—but I dared not bring it up without the Old Lady’s approval. If you permit, I’ll inquire more.” Jia Mu replied, “A while back, a monk told us that this boy’s destiny doesn’t favor an early wedding. Let him grow a bit older before anything is settled. But you keep an ear out—whatever their fortune or rank, as long as she’s a fair match in looks and disposition, let me know. If they’re a poor family, we can always lend them a little silver. The important thing is that she has a gentle temperament—those are so hard to find!”  At this moment, Feng Jie teased, “Grandfather Zhang, about our maid’s ‘Name Talisman’—you still haven’t exchanged it. Not long ago, you had the face to send someone to me for some goose-yellow silk. Had I not given it, you might have felt ashamed!” Zhang Taoist burst into laughter. “My eyes must have grown dim. I didn’t notice you were here, so I forgot to say thanks. The Name Talisman is done. I intended to bring it the other day, but who would have expected the Consort to hold a service, and I got distracted. It’s still by the Buddha’s side for safekeeping—let me fetch it.” With that, he dashed to the main hall, returning with a tea tray covered by a crimson satin cloth, on which lay the newly written talisman. The nurse for Big Mistress (the baby girl) received it. Zhang Taoist made a move to pick up the child, but Feng Jie said, “You could have carried it in your hands—why bring out a big tray?” Zhang Taoist replied, “One’s hands might be unclean—far better to use a tray.” Wang Xifeng joked, “Waving that tray about, you gave me quite a scare. I thought perhaps you were soliciting alms from us, rather than delivering a talisman.” The others roared with laughter, including Jia Zhen who could not help but grin. Jia Mu chided, “Oh, you mischievous child—aren’t you afraid of scorching your tongue in hell?” Wang Xifeng giggled, “We have a different standard among ourselves. After all, he always warns me to do good deeds and says if I delay, I’ll soon become short-lived.” Zhang Taoist also laughed.
Xing, Yuan Yang rose. Mrs. Xing smiled, “What are you working on?” Then, taking the spool of thread from Yuan Yang’s hand, she said, “Let me see the flowers you’ve stitched.” After examining them, she remarked, “They’re even more beautiful now,” and then carefully set the thread aside while scrutinizing Yuan Yang. Yuan Yang was dressed in a partly new, lotus-colored silk jacket with a blue satin shoulder piece, paired with a water-green skirt. Her slim waist and delicate features—her oval face with jet-black hair and a slightly prominent nose, and tiny freckles on her cheeks—caught Mrs. Xing’s eye. Feeling somewhat self-conscious under such appraisal, Yuan Yang blushed and asked in a timid tone, “Madam, why have you come at this time?”  Mrs. Xing winked at her attendant and then sat down, taking Yuan Yang’s hand and saying warmly, “I’ve come to congratulate you.”  Yuan Yang’s face flushed even deeper; she lowered her head and said nothing. Mrs. Xing continued, “You know, there’s not a trustworthy person by Lord Jia’s side these days. He wants to buy someone for himself, but he fears that those new maidens from outside are too unclean—or may have faults. Because the whole household is looking for a daughter-in-law, they worry about the quality: either the appearance is not good or the character is poor. With your excellent qualities, none of that need worry you. In fact, if you were taken in by Grandmother, you’d be far better off than any newly purchased one. You’re as reliable as they come. I intend to speak with Grandmother and have her keep you in the house. You’re far superior to those new ones—once you’re in, your face will change; they might even make you an official concubine, bestowing honor and prestige. You are a strong-minded girl. As the saying goes, ‘gold remains gold in exchange.’ Who would have thought that Lord Jia would take notice? Now that you have arrived, your longtime ambition is fulfilled; you’ll also silence those who sneer at you. Follow me back to Grandmother’s.”  At this, Yuan Yang’s face turned scarlet. She tried to pull her hand away, but Mrs. Xing, noticing her embarrassment, added, “What’s there to be shy about? You needn’t say a word—just come with me.” Yuan Yang, still lowering her head, refused to move. Mrs. Xing persisted, “Do you truly not want to? If you really refuse, you are nothing but a foolish maid. Think: if Grandmother doesn’t treat you as her own, then you’ll forever be regarded as a mere servant. In a few years, if you are forced into a marriage, you’ll remain a servant forever. Come with us—you know my temperament is gentle, and Lord Jia treats you well. In a year or two, if you bear a son and a daughter, you’ll be right at my side. In our household, who wouldn’t follow you? If you remain unappreciated by your master all your life, then you’ve missed your chance. Now, what if he were to lay hands on you? That would be a disaster indeed.”  Yuan Yang coldly laughed, “What nonsense! I simply won’t go.”  Ping’er interjected softly, “Sister, you need not worry. We’ve already reached a consensus. I’ll tell you everything later.”  Mrs. Xing, smiling broadly, then rose and said, “Now, go and attend to your own duties. I’ll have dinner prepared and then come back.”  Fengjie, overhearing all this, thought to herself, “Yuan Yang has always had a generous heart. Even if I propose this, will she agree? I must go first; then, once Mrs. Xing arrives, if she complies I’ll smoothly withdraw. But if not—if Mrs. Xing suspects and then uses her influence to cause trouble for me—I’ll be in a pickle. In that case, I might as well go together with them. If she agrees, no one will suspect a thing.” Smiling to herself, she added, “Just now, my aunt sent over two cages of quail, which I had ordered fried to be served with Madam’s dinner.
Everyone else remained unaware, letting the conversation move on. Soon Baochai and Wang Xifeng departed. Daiyu whispered to Baoyu, “Now you’ve found a better sparring partner—I can’t hold my own. Not everyone is as soft as I am, letting you say what you please.”  Baoyu, still feeling abashed from his exchange with Baochai, grew even more dejected. He longed to answer Daiyu but feared stoking her indignation, so he suppressed his anger and slinked away. That day was the Dragon Boat Festival (端阳佳节). Everywhere, people wore protective herbs, pinned mugwort on their doors, and tied decorative charms on their arms. By midday, Lady Wang hosted a small banquet with Aunt Xue and the others. Baoyu, out of sorts, spoke little. Lady Wang, guessing he felt awkward about “yesterday’s business with Jin Chuan’er,” barely acknowledged him. Daiyu, for her part, assumed Baoyu was glum over how he’d offended Baochai, so she herself kept aloof; her manner, too, was listless. Wang Xifeng, aware of how Lady Wang disliked any mention of the matter, likewise avoided jokes and kept quiet. Yingchun, Tanchun, and Xichun, seeing everyone so subdued, also lost interest, and they all dispersed early. Daiyu, by nature, disliked gatherings. As she often reasoned:  “If there’s an assembly, it must at some point disperse. You enjoy the bustle for a time, but then the quiet after everyone leaves can be so desolate—why not avoid these gatherings altogether? It’s like a blossom: lovely while in bloom, yet withers to become a source of sorrow. Better if it had never bloomed.” And so, she remained indifferent. But Baoyu, who liked constant gatherings and lamented the inevitable dispersal, felt especially morose as the party ended so soon. He went back to his room, sighing deeply. Happening to see him in one of his pensive moods, the maid Qingwen came in to change clothes. By chance, she fumbled and dropped a fan, snapping one of its ribs. Baoyu, startled, blurted:  “How careless—just as I was lamenting, you go and break that fan. Someday, if you have a household of your own, will you manage it so carelessly?” Qingwen, feeling stung, gave a cold laugh, “You’ve grown quite harsh lately—always scolding. Just the other day, you even struck Xi Ren. Now, over a broken fan, you blow up again. Why the fuss? It’s only a fan. Far bigger things have been broken before—porcelain jars or glass bowls—and you never gave a second thought. So why erupt now? Maybe you’re tired of us—fine, then dismiss us kindly. No need for a tantrum!”  Her words angered Baoyu so much he shook all over. “Then you had better leave soon enough,” he seethed. “If you despise me that badly, tomorrow I’ll see you’re thrown out.” Xi Ren, overhearing from the next room, rushed in:  “What’s going on, for heaven’s sake? I step away a moment and it’s all raised voices.” Qingwen sneered, “Oh, Sister Xi Ren, how convenient you show up—everyone praises your skill at waiting upon him! Yet you got kicked the other day. Now it’s my turn for scolding. If he’s so fed up with me, let him strike me or dismiss me. Just do it properly and be done!”  Hearing Xi Ren’s name, Baoyu realized how his ill-temper with Xi Ren might re-emerge. Furious at the tumult, he snapped:  “If you’re so unhappy, then indeed, I’ll speak to Mistress tomorrow and send you away. Might that suit you? I cannot stand this endless quarreling—life was never this full of bickering!” Xi Ren tried restraining him:  “You mustn’t bring the Mistress into it. With strangers listening, you’ll only upset her, and it does neither you nor Qingwen any good. Let’s solve it quietly, or you’ll only make everything worse.” Qingwen choked back tears:  “I never said I wanted to go.

Let’s solve it quietly, or you’ll only make everything worse.” Qingwen choked back tears:  “I never said I wanted to go. But a few scoldings, or a mere broken fan, and you talk of sending me away? Fine—go, get the Mistress. I can throw myself against a wall and die if I must, but I won’t step out of these gates by choice!” Seeing how dire this had become, Baoyu muttered, “I am sick of it. Perhaps I’ll go to Mistress so it’s over with.” Xi Ren dropped to her knees, pleading, “If you won’t relent for my sake, then think about the gossip—this is no small scene. Wait until tempers cool; we can talk it through. Must you rush to blow it up?”  Baoyu, seeing Xi Ren kneel, was taken aback. He helped her up, sighing as he sank onto the bed, tears pricking his eyes: “My heart is torn, yet none sees. Even you must kneel to me. What is there to do?” Xi Ren’s own eyes brimmed with tears. Qingwen, too, had been crying, on the verge of speaking, when Daiyu entered. Startled, Qingwen slipped out. Daiyu, smiling faintly, asked: “Why such tears on a festive day? Are you quarreling over who gets to eat the biggest dumpling?” Baoyu and Xi Ren, forced to laugh, tried to compose themselves. Daiyu teased Xi Ren: “Oh, dear sister-in-law—tell me, did you two have a couple’s spat? Let me mediate.” Xi Ren, blushing, waved her off: “Don’t joke, Miss. We’re only servants.” Daiyu responded with a grin, “But you are my sister-in-law, as I see it.” Baoyu interjected, “Now let’s not provoke talk. If folks overhear, it’ll cause more trouble for her.”  Xi Ren smiled, “Aye, if I truly offended you, let me die and be done.” Daiyu mock-sobbed, “If you died, I’d cry my own life away.” Baoyu added with a laugh, “If you died, I’d become a monk.” Xi Ren exclaimed, “That’s enough now!” Daiyu feigned annoyance, “Ah yes, you said that about me as well—how many times do you plan to become a monk?” She wiggled two fingers. Baoyu realized she was reminding him of his earlier vow and, feeling awkward, hastily changed the subject. Daiyu giggled, letting the matter drop, then left as well. Soon a servant announced, “Young Master Xue invites you.” Baoyu had no choice but to go, drinking with Xue Pan until evening. Returning with some drink in him, he headed to his courtyard. In the yard, stands and mats were arranged for fresh air, but on the main couch lay a person, apparently sleeping.
