Come forth, come forth, my maidens, ’tis the day of good St John, It is the Baptist’s morning that breaks the hills u pon, And let us all go forth together, while the blessed day is new, To dress with flowers the snow white wether, ere the sun has dried the dew, Come forth, come forth, &c. Come forth, come forth, my maidens, the hedgerows all are green, And the little birds are singing the opening leaves be tween, And let us all go forth together, to gather trefoil by the stream, Ere the face of Guadalquiver glows beneath the strengthening beam, Come forth, come forth, &c. Come forth, come forth, my maidens, and slumber not a way The blessed blessed morning of John the Baptist’s day; There’s trefoil on the meadow, and lilies on the lee, And hawthorn blossoms on the bush, which you must pluck with me, Come forth, come forth, &c. Come forth, come forth, my maidens, the air is calm and cool, And the violet blue far down ye’ll view, reflected in the pool; The violets and the roses, and the jasmines all to gether. We’ll bind in garlands on the brow of the strong and lovely wether, Come forth, come forth, &c. Come forth, come forth, my maidens, we’ll gather myrtle boughs, And we all shall learn from the dews of the fern, if our lads will keep their vows. If the wether be still, as we dance on the hill, and the dew hangs sweet on the flowers, Then well kiss off the dew, for our lovers are true, and the Baptist’s blessing is ours.* Come forth, come forth, my maidens, ’tis the day of good St John, It is the Baptist’s morning that breaks the hills u pon; And let us all go forth together, while the blessed day is new, To dress with flowers the snow white wether, ere the sun has dried the dew.
Fernando, King of Arragon, before Grenada lies, With dukes and barons many a one, and champions of em prize; With all the captains of Castille that serve his lady’s crown, He chaces Zagal from his gates, and plucks the crescent down. The cross is reared upon the towers, for our Redeemer’s sake; The king assembles all his powers his triumph to par take, Yet at the royal banquet there’s trouble in his eye — Now speak thy wish, it shall be done, great king, the lordlings cry. Then spake Fernando, Hear, grandees! which of ye all will go And give my banner in the breeze of Alpuxar to blow? Those heights along, the Moors are strong, now who, by dawn of day, Will plant the cross their cliffs among, and drive the dogs a way? Then champion on champion high, and count on count doth look; And faultering is the tongue of lord, and pale the cheek of duke; Till starts up brave Alonzo, the knight of Aguil lār, The lowmost at the royal board, but foremost still in war. And thus he speaks : I pray, my lord, that none but I may go; For I made promise to the queen, your consort, long a go, That ere the war should have an end, I, for her royal charms, And for my duty to her grace, would shew some feat of arms. Much joyed the king these words to hear—he bids Alonzo speed — And long before their revel’s o’er the knight is on his steed; Alonzo’s on his milk-white steed, with horsemen in his train — A thousand horse, a chosen band, ere dawn the hills to gain. They ride along the darkling ways, they gallop all the night; They reach Navada ere the cock hath harbinger’d the light; But ere they’ve climb’d that steep ravine the east is glowing red, And the Moors their lances bright have seen, and Christian banners spread. Beyond the sands, between the rocks, where the old cork-trees grow, The path is rough, and mounted men must singly march and slow; There, o’er the path, the heathen range their ambuscado’s line, High up they wait for Aguilar, as the day begins to shine. There nought avails the eagle eye, the guardian of Ca stille, The eye of wisdom, nor the heart that fear might never feel, The arm of strength that wielded well the strong mace in the fray, Nor the sheer mail wherefrom the edge of faulchion glanced a way. Not knightly valour there avails, nor skill of horse and spear, For rock on rock comes rumbling down from cliff and cavern drear; Down—down like driving hail they come, and horse and horsemen die, Like cattle whose despair is dumb when the fierce lightnings fly. Alonzo, with a handful more, escapes into the field, There like a lion stands at bay, in vain besought to yield. A thousand foes around are seen, but none draws near to fight; Afar with bolt and javelin they pierce the stedfast knight. An hundred and an hundred darts are hissing round his head; Had Aguilar a thousand hearts their blood had all been shed; Faint and more faint he staggers upon the slippery sod, Then falls among a lake of gore, and gives his soul to God. With that the Moors plucked up their hearts to gave upon his face, And caitiffs mangled where he lay the scourge of Africk’s race; To woody Oxijera then the gallant corpse they drew, And there upon the village green they laid him out to view. Upon the village green he lay, as the moon was shining clear, And all the village damsels to look at him drew near; They stood around him all a-gaze beside the big oak tree, And much his beauty did they praise, tho’ mangled sore was he. Now, so it fell, a Christian dame, that knew Alonzo well, Not far from Oxijera did as a captive dwell, And hearing all the marvels, across the woods came she, To look upon this Christian corpse, and wash it decent ly. She looked upon him, and she knew the face of Agui lar, Although his beauty was disgraced with many a ghastly scar, She knew him, and she cursed the dogs that pierced him from a far, And mangled him when he was slain—the Moors of Alpu xār. The Moorish maidens, while she spake, around her silence kept, But her master dragged the dame away—then loud and long they wept, They washed the blood, with many a tear, from dint of dart and arrow, And buried him near the waters clear of the brook of Alpu xarra.
The shades of night are hastening down, To steep in blue the mountains brown, The sky is cloudless, and se rene; The winds are pillowed; and the scene So beautiful, so wild, so sweet, Where forests, fields, and waters meet, Is bathed in such delicious hues, Beneath the twilight’s falling dues, That man, afar from Sorrows sphere, Might muse away his anguish here; While, o’er his erring thoughts sub dued, That quiet—tranquillizing mood, That tone of harmony would steal, Which poets feign, and angels feel. Earth answers to the hues a bove — The music ceases in the grove; While not a breeze, in wandering, stir The branches of the silent firs, That stretch their azure cones on high, And shoot into the lucid sky. There is no living motion round, Save, that, with meek and mellow sound, The shaded river murmurs on, ’Tween banks with copsewood over grown; Athwart its bed, the willow throws The brightness of its pendent boughs, And hangs, with melancholy air, And languid head, its tresses there; Like Guilt, that feels remorse en dure, Performing penance to be pure.— Lo! in the south, a silver star, With amber radiance, shines a far;— The eldest daughter of the night, In glory warm, in beauty bright. Thou diamond in the pathless dome Of azure, whether dost thou come?— Far—far, within the orbless blue, A tiny lustre twinkles thro’, With distant and unsteady light, To catch the eye, then mock the sight; Till—as the shades of Darkness frown, And throw their viewless curtains down, The very veil, that mantles earth, Awakens thee to brighter birth, And bids thee glow, with purer ray, A lily on the tomb of Day! With outlines palpable, and clear, And, ’mid the lowering darkness drear, Above the forest, rise sub lime The gothic towers of olden time; Thro’ lattices, unframed, looks forth The calm, pure azure of the North, Unbroken, save, where, dark and down, The ivy tendrils hang, and frown; And Time, with mimic finger, weaves A natural latticework of leaves. What marvel, then, that trembling fear, In many a grot, and cavern here, Should hold her solitary reign, To scare the natives of the plain, And people every lonesome glade, With many a mute, and wandering shade. Lo! in the convent’s dewy cell, What time awoke the vesper bell, The homeward-stalking peasant hears, Beneath the moonlight of the spheres, Strange music on the breezes swim, A low—a wild—a wailing hymn, Soaring, and sinking, like the breeze. Among December’s leafless trees; Nor backward is his mind to dream, In passing, that strange faces gleam From every frowning cranny there — As throbs his heart, and stirs his hair, With quickened step he hastens on, For well he knows in ages gone, When sack-cloth-vested abbots swayed, And Rome was mighty and o beyed That there unholy deeds were done, Perceived by few, and told by none, And oft the restless spirits sweep, When storms are dark, and night is deep, Amid the gothic aisles, where rest, In charnel cell, their bones un blest. The blue horizon circles round This silent spot of fairy ground; So hushed, that even my very breath Intrudes upon the still of death! No trace of mind or man is here, The sight to win, the heart to cheer; Like him, who, on Fernandez, sate, Lamenting o’er his lonely fate,— While, in the hush of winds, the roar Of Ocean thundering on the shore Was heard, the only living sound, To break the deep, and dull pro found,— So here I rest; no tempests roll Above my head, or in my soul, A musing heart, and watchful eye, Conversing with the earth, and sky.
These lame hexameters, the strong-wing’d music of Homer! No—but a most burlesque barbarous experiment. When was a harsher sound ever heard, ye Muses, in England? When did a frog coarser croak upon our Helicon? Hexameters no worse than daring Germany gave us, Barbarous experiment, barbarous hexameters!
Afar, oh Ladye fair, a far From thee, and these delightful scenes, Beyond the restless Ocean’s jar, On former bliss my spirit leans. When all that was my heaven be low, Hath vanished from my vacant view, Then Hope shall hold her glass, to show, As wont of yore, thy spirit true. True as the needle to the pole, Pure as the thoughts of saints a bove; Ah! fairer form, and purer soul, Were never sanctified to Love! When in the west the sun de clines, And twilight reigns in blue ar ray, When in the south a planet shines To herald the departing day, Oh, gaze upon it—warmly gaze, Too conscious, far beyond the sea, That one regards its silent rays, And has no other care but thee! How drearily the time will run, No bliss-fraught moments strewed be tween, When wakes the morn, and sinks the sun, And thou art silent and un seen! Thou!— ah! it was my chief de light, Thy mind to scan, thy form sur vey; To dream about thee all the night, And linger near thee half the day. And shall it then be thus no more? No more, beneath the shades of eve, Shall I, the form that I a dore, With pleasure meet, with sorrow leave? Yes! thus it must be; but the sands Of envious Time shall never run, Which—tho’ it finds divided hands — Shall find our bosoms more than one.
Elijah with his mantle smote the waves Of Jordan to the right hand, and the left, Which, parting, sundered like a breaking cloud When vernal breezes wanton in the sky; And onwards with his master, thro’ the sands, Without a word, in that mysterious calm, Elisha passed. The fated hour was nigh, The hour of consummation; loneliness Hung o’er the hills and vallies, like a shroud; Dashing the bridled waters closed behind, And all was still;— sombre the forests lay, A mass of pitchy darkness, in the scowl Of that dim sky—a solitude of death! The elements of Nature seem’d asleep; And, in their place, mysterious agencies At work, to overthrow the rolling world. Within Elijah’s glance a piercingness Which was not of this earth, upon his face, Shaded with raven locks, a darkening hue, As if reflective of the frowning sky, Was visible; when, lifting up his voice, “ It is the hour,” he said, “ before we part, To meet no more upon this lower sphere; What would’st thou of me?” Then Elisha prayed For a double portion of his master’s soul Prophetic. And a flaming chariot came, A fiery chariot, drawn by steeds of fire, Treading the clouds beneath them in their march. And breathless silence, like a wizard, held Spell-bound the breathless elements in awe, While forky lightnings flash’d among the clouds; And they were parted by invisible arm!— Elijah entered,—and a whirlwind rose, And took him to the skies, and—he was not!
Dark lowered around the canopy of clouds; Winds sang, and thunders rolled, and lightnings flashed; The fear-struck sailor clung unto the shrouds, As o’er his head the warning billow dashed; And while the rain, a sheety torrent, lashed The tortured sea, each mountain wave bet ween, The ship, and all its shrieking crew, were seen! They thought of Joppa,—of their pleasant home! Despairing e’er to view its walls a gain; And, drifting o’er the circumambient foam, Saw but the skies commingling with the main; Then, deeming labour lost, and effort vain, They threw their merchandize into the sea, And each called on his God, and bent his knee. When lo! reposing on a plank be neath, As on the sward, below a summer sky, With countenance serene, and placid breath, They viewed a passenger in slumber lie; On him the master gazed with wondering eye, And roused him from his trance, and wildly cried, “ Call, sleeper, on your God, to calm the tide!” Then each did gaze distrustfully on each, Imagining that, for some grievous sin, Heaven doomed the land they never more should reach, But all should perish Ocean’s womb wi thin. They thought them then of lots, and did be gin — While silently each weighed his failings well — To cast them, and the lot on Jonah fell! Hope, like a sunbeam, over every face Began to play; they asked him whence he came, His occupation, and his dwelling- place, His unshrived sin, his country, and. his name; Then as he patiently endured the blame;— “ I am a Hebrew,” Jonah said, “ by birth, And worship God, who made the seas and earth!” Then were they terrified, for he had told, That from the presence of the Lord he fled; And, while without the foaming billows rolled, Within, there was the silence of the dead; But, boldly stepping forward, Jonah said,— “ For me hath risen this tempest—all for me — “ Then spare me not, and cast me to the sea.” Yet did they make delay, compassio nate, And plied, with dextrous hand, the bending oar, Fain had they saved him from impending fate, And hard they struggled to approach the shore; But more tempestuous grew the main, and more; And every wave, with crest of tawny brown, Threatened to whelm them o’er, and suck them down. They saw it was in vain—and then they prayed, They prayed of Heaven forgiveness of his blood, And cast him to the sea, deprived of aid; But lo! as by the vessel’s side they stood, They saw leviathan, amid the flood, Gape for his victim wide, who shrunk in fear, Then dive amid the waves, and disap pear. Then, as by magic spell, the sea was calm, And ceased its raging; its tempestuous roar Was stilled; and winds, with pinions dipped in balm, Blew gently o’er them from the flowery shore; The skies their crown of azure glory wore; And beautiful the sun-beams bathed the deep, As on its breast the vessel seemed a sleep.
With smiling cheek, and eyes of cloudless light, His garments glowing ’mid the shades of night — The angel of the Lord before me stood, When lo! a vision burst on soli tude; And things, surpassing Nature’s earthly law, Beneath his guardian eye, secure, I saw. With low and melancholy sigh, the breeze Just kissed, in passing by, the myrtle trees, Between their sombre boughs, a rider rear’d His stately head, and straight a steed ap pear’d; Blood-red its colour, like the clouds that stand O’er morning’s car, portending storms at hand, And horses throng’d behind, a varied sight, The roan, the bay, the speckled, and the white. Deep admiration struck me, and I stood, Gazing perplex’d, in reverential mood, When thus the angel,— “ These are they that go “ ’Mong men and nations, journeying to and fro.” Then answered they submiss,— “ From east to west “ Our steps have roam’d, and all the world hath rest; “ O’er every region, where the shining day “ Sheds forth a powerful glow, or feeble ray, “ Our long, long course hath been : contentions cease, “ Air sitteth still, and earth is hush’d to peace.”
“ A pawkie auld kimmer wons in yon glen, Nane kens how kimmer can fight and fen; Kimmer gets bread, and kimmer gets cheese, And kimmer’s uncannie e’en keep her at ease. Kimmer can sit i’ the coat-tail o’ the moon, And tipple red wine in Brabant brewn; Kimmer can sit, and say, “ E’en be it sae!” And red rowes the Nith between banking and brae; I creeshed kimmer’s loof weel wi’ howdy fee, Else a cradle had never been rocked for me.”
‘ Turn round, thou bit o’ the rarest timmer Ere bore a bud to the dew o’ simmer, Thou wert nursed in a cleugh o’ blood and strife, I’ the mirkest nook o’ the haunted Dryfe; Nor wert thou plucked by steel or airn, But by the cauld hand o’ a strangled bairn, When the stars fell sick, and the moon grew dull, By the will-o’-wisp gleam frae a dead man’s skull. ‘ Thou ae best friend i’ my starkest need, That grinds my corn, and bakes my bread; That frae the bawk the fat hen wiles, And milks the kye for a thousand miles; That keeps me cozie, and brings to me, The bird frae the bush, an’ the fruit frae the tree; That reaps me riggs I never plowed, And melts men’s hearts like minted gowd ‘ ’Gainst the flight o’ the sun, as I spin thee a bout, A thousand lights i’ the earth gae out.— As I turn thee around wi’ the warld, I win A thousand lives to this land o’ sin. Muckle dool hast thou done —an’ gory wark, To unbaptized brows, and the cruel Turk; Muckle dool hast thou done, and may do mair To th’ unwelcome foot in thy owner’s lair. ‘ A bonnie ship o’er the Solway went, An’ snored through the brine wi’ her white sails bent, I turned my timmer, the shriek frae the sea Came far up Criffels’ green mountain to me — I turned it back, with a moistened wing, Away shot the ship, and I heard the men sing, An’ the maids o’ Colvend, with a startling laugh, Grat an’ shouted for joy to see her safe. ‘ There was dool to win—there was dool to pu’, Frae the bird o’ the fiend this sooty woo. A strange black raven, wi’ croak and peck, Poud this lock at midnight frae a black tup’s neck; I turned my timmer—and now I twine My thread, an’ sing i’ the bonnie sun shine; But I hae a darg i’ the dwine o’ the moon, To do, an’ syne my song is done.’
‘ From Burnswark top to deep Gle nae, Carlaverock bank to Drumlanrig brae, A bauld race ruled—the Morisons brave, They travelled the earth, and they stemmed the wave, They bore the red cross—they barefoot trod Jerusalem’s sands, and they gallantly rode In the ranks of war, when the sword had trust Of the Church’s fame and the martyrs’ dust — It is rife in tale and in minstrel story, The Morisons’ might and the Morisons’ glory. ‘ But in the battle, when shafts flew thickest, And the Morisons sword fell sheering quickest — But in the church, when prayers were longest, And the Morisons voice prayed loud and strongest — But in the field, when the lilies were springing — When the bridal bells were bedward ringing — When the hunters horns were merriest blowing — When the ladies bosoms were heaving and glowing — In court—in camp—in church or hame An ancient curse still clung to their name,— ‘ It is sad to hear—though its brief to tell, How the curse that maun cling to their name be fel — It came with a lass—it maun gang wi’ a lass, In sorrow and shame!— and away let it pass — This throbbing heart, and this eye in sorrow — Shall be mute and be dry ere the sun-rise of morrow, And she that sings this sang o’ their shame Is the last of the Morisons’ lineage and name — But rife in tale and the minstrel story Is the Morisons might and the Morisons glory.’
Should’st thou detect a smother’d sigh, Or some faint drooping of the eye, Or stronger pressure of the hand, Lady, or ere thou leav’st the land; Or should my failing accents tell How ill my tongue can bid “fare well,” Still let no thought approach thy mind, Thou leav’st a burning heart be hind. May they experience never prove That they may grieve who cannot love; —That he may sigh thy loss the while Who, should’st thou stay, could never smile. That face, that form, howe’er di vine, Beam not the day that once was mine, Yet leave, when they are seen no more, My night as rayless as be fore. Mistake me not;— though in mine eyes Thou see’st unusual light a rise, ’Tis not the feeling that should shine Reflected from such charms as thine ’Tis but a light that gleams a bove Th’ untimely grave of early love,— Such ghastly meteors still in fest The tombs whose tenants cannot rest. Yes, though the canker’d hand of hate, Or rivals’ breath, or glance of fate, May from the struggling bosom tear The treasure that is coffer’d there,— Although the crushing weight of ill The bleeding heart may seem to kill, The love that in the soul doth lie, Like it, can never wholly die,— But ever o’er the ’nighted mind Roams, like a spirit uncon fined, Haunting some unfrequented shade, Where all its buried wealth is laid; And at the spell of witching eyes The melancholy sprite will rise, As fond to hover near a scene, Like those where it in life hath been.
When I that form no longer view, I shall not smile, as some can do, Nor blush to mourn the bosom gone, That mine so oft has lean’d u pon. ’Tis sad to think our love should last No better than the former past, And sad to think that future bliss Must haply find an end like this; Yet had our flame been truly hearted, Surely we could not thus have parted, And had it never touch’d the heart, We should not thus have had to part. Indulge thy tears—they now are sweet, Though, haply, if again we meet, We both may hold our sorrow cheap, And smile to think that we could weep. I know that many a girl may wear As laughing lips, as glossy hair, As smooth a cheek, as fair a brow, But yet I cannot think so now : Those gentle eyes, so kind the while, I know that I must miss their smile; That voice, which sooth’d so oft be fore, I feel that it shall sooth no more. The bliss that thou couldst stilll be stow, If yet again my breast may know, Still, equal bliss bestow’d a gain Requites me not for present pain; The kindest heart beneath the sun Can charm no more than thou hast done, Nor e’er so true an after- vow Repay the pang of parting now.
“ By each one Of the dear dreams through which I have travelled The cup of enjoyment from none Can I take, till the spells, one by one, Which have withered ye all, be unravelled. My God! with what words can I dare, Without a presumptuous seeming, To say that, from thee, who hear’st prayer, Life’s prospects with blessings are teeming? I talked of a “ spell” that had bound Each sense, and benumbed every feeling; Though my joys in their forms might be found, Which had all their fine essence been stealing. I was widowed of love—tho’ pos sessing One whom my sad heart fondly sighed, By the tenderest, dearest ca ressing, To own as its mistress and bride. I was childless—yet children were given, Whose innocent charms might in spire All that ever reminded of Heaven The heart of a fortunate sire : And I said, of the manifold “ spells ” Which withheld from my senses the taste, Of the exquisite transport which dwells With gifts which my lot in life graced. The demoniac “ spells,” “ one by one,” That lay on the path which I travelled, “ The cup of enjoyment from none I take, till they all are un ravelled.” And surely I may, without fear, Call my Maker to witness my truth, That, for many a tedious year, While receded the visions of youth, Never, never from hue, shape, or sound, From word, never smile or ca ress, This bosom an instant e’er found A respite from cleaving di stress, ’Till the “ spell” which lay o’er my dear ones, By a mighty invisible hand — ’Till the heart’s pangs, the only se vere ones Were snapped as a sorcerer’s wand. I, now, in a smile that has greeted My eyes both in sorrow and glee — In a smile that has never re treated, Tho’ it met with no welcome from me, Can experience the thrilling de light, Which it gave me in days are gone! Though ’twas ever the same to my sight, Yet it fell on a bosom of stone! My children—they now can im part Not only the claims which, from duty, They well may enforce on my heart; But in all its most exquisite beauty, Like soft music, the fond gush is given To my soul, from the rapturous tie, Reproducing those blest days when Heaven ’Bout our path, bed, and table, doth lie! My wife! and my children! dear names, Which awaken my heart’s deepend love, As earnest such treasure pro claims Of “ the day-spring which comes from” a bove! When the throbs that await on the plea - sures Which owe to yourselves their cre ation, Are heightened by spiritual treasures, They receive then their last conse cra - tion! And I feel it—that these, the sure pledges Of Heaven’s love, are thus heightened and blest! Whatever the sceptic al leges, A pure joy, a pure source must at test! As well might one doubt the report Of the senses of sight, touch, and taste, As believe not the joys that resort To the soul where God’s “ secret” is placed. No! a seal there is set to that feeling Which can be decyphered by none, Till a new sense, with mystic re vealing, Informs us that seal is our own!
Come, join me, British landsmen, dragoons and grena diers, While I sing the tars of England, and the battle of Al giers. I have seen your sabres flashing, and heard the din of blows; I have mark’d the edge of bayonets that swept away your foes; But here the sword was idle, asleep the cutlass lay, The mighty cannon roar’d alone, and sailors won the day. ’Twas in the morning early, the north wind bore us down, And spread the British crescent’s arms around the Moorish town, Then wav’d on every war-ship throughout the bending line, Before the face of infidels, the cross of Christ di vine. Our van of floating batteries the noble Pellew led, And bravely dropp’d his anchor a~breast of the Mole- head. “ Now yield thee, prince of pirates, and terror of the sea, Give up thy plunder’d treasures, and set the captives free. The sulphur-cloud of vengeance is gathering on the tide, And the bolt of injured nations will blast thee in thy pride. The city rose above us as white as mountain snow, And grim the rampart-girdle hung o’er the wave be low; Beneath the yawning embrasures for action clear’d we lay, And thrice five hundred cannon were pointed at the bay. The summer sun was westering as the work of death be gun; It sunk in cloud and darkness before the fray was done. Then ye heard the crash of bulwarks that tumbled from their height, And saw the rockets streaming red athwart the vault of night, And blazing barks dismasted came wildly drifting nigh, And, midst the pause of thunder, ye heard the heathen cry. “ Now hold thee, gallant admiral, I bow to God’s dec ree; I yield the virgin city, the empress of the sea; Renounce my plundered treasures, and set the captive free.” “ Now shout, my lads,” quoth brave Pellew, “ now shout for victo ry.”
See’st thou, my friend, how white with snow, Towers in mid air Soracte’s brow; How with their load the forests bend, And frost the torrent’s force has chain’d! The season’s chilling cold to chase, Bid on thy hearth huge faggots blaze; And from the twin-ear’d pitcher pour Thy inmost bin’s time-mellow’d store. Leave to the Gods all cares be side : Soon as their voice has quell’d the pride Of storms wild-raving o’er the sea, Stirs not a breath the aspen- tree. To trace to-morrow’s doom fore go, And count as gain each granted Now; Nor then the joys of love’s young morn, Or dance of sprightly damsels scorn, While still with gray unstain’d thine hair. Now to the public mall re pair, Assiduous; in the appointed bower — Now breathe thy tale at eve’s soft hour — Dear now the titter arch which tells What nook the ambush’d maid con ceals, Sweet from the struggling yielding fair The ring or bracelet-pledge to bear.
Ihate the Persian banquet’s pride : Boy, fling that gaudy wreath a side; Nor seek in what lone dell the rose, To form th’ autumnal chaplet, blows. Asks nothing more the myrtle band; Add not a leaf, ’tis my com mand. Well fits it thee, that simple braid, Me, quaffing in the vine’s green shade.
He who to Pindar’s heights would soar, Ventures on wing like that of yore Glued to the ambitious boy, who gave His name to Græcia’s glassy wave. As mountain stream, by tempests fed, Swells foaming o’er its wonted bed, So Pindar boils, so pours a long His deep illimitable song. Around his brow be wreathed the bay, Whether the dithyrambic lay He roll, in fierce poetic heat, Where mingle numbers wild and sweet; Or gods, and god-descended kings, Who smote the centaurs, grace his strings — Smote with just stroke, and quell’d the ire Of dread Chimæra, breathing fire; Or round the victor’s palm-crown’d head, On Pisa’s plain for strength or steed Renown’d, he twine one chaplet more, To which the bust, the pillar’s poor; Or helpless bride his lyre re cord, Entirely widow’d of her lord; His golden truth, his matchless might, Redeeming from oblivion’s night — Light buoyant through th’ empyreal air, The Theban swan strong breezes bear; While I, with tiny indus try, I, like the toiling matin bee, (Whose wing o’er many a thyme-bed roves, Untired,) ’mid Tibur’s bowery groves, Or by its dripping banks re main To meditate my lowlier strain. But thou, my friend, in bolder verse, Shall laurell’d Cæsar’s praise re hearse, Follow’d by captive hordes, what time His car the Sacred Hill shall climb; Cæsar, than whom indulgent Heaven No nobler boon to man has given, Nor e’er shall give, though backward roll’d, The age resume its garb of gold. Be thine Rome’s transports to re cord, For Cæsar to her vows re stored, And grateful games, and truce-closed war, Waged whilom by the wrangling bar. Then, too, if aught of power be mine, This voice shall fondly chime to thine, And hail the day, with gladsome airs, Which grants Augustus to its prayers. As on thou sweepest, oft a round Shall echo the triumphal sound : Rome, Rome shall swell the loud ac claim, And incense at each shrine shall flame. For thee ten bulls, ten udder’d cows Oblation fitting shall com pose; My vow the weaned calf shall pay, Now in green pastures frisking gay; Whose front a snowy crescent bears, Such as the third night’s Cynthia wears, Save that ah mark, in all be side, Unspotted is his tawny hide.
Hark! Italy’s music Melts over the sea; Falling light from some lattice, Where cavaliers be : And sweet lady voices Steal over the deep, To hush all around us The billows to sleep. Our gondola gently Goes over the wave : As though it were dreaming To sounds that en slave :— We listen—we listen! How blessed are we, Who hear this dim music O’er Italy’s sea!
Were this a feather from an eagle’s wing, And thou, my tablet white! a marble tile Taken from ancient Jove’s majestic pile,— And might I dip my feather in some spring, Adown Mount Ida, thread-like, wande r ing :— And were my thoughts brought from some starry isle In heaven’s blue sea,—I then might with a smile Write down a hymn to Fame, and proudly sing! But I am mortal; and I cannot write Aught that may foil the fatal wing of Time. Silent I look at Fame : I cannot climb To where her temple is—Not mine the might :— I have some glimmering of what is sub - lime — But, ah! it is a most inconstant light.
Ionce had thought to have embalm’d my name With Poesy :— to have served the gentle Muses With high sincerity :— but Fate re fuses, And I am now become most strangely tame, And careless what becomes of Glory’s game — Who strives—who wins the wondrous prize —who loses! Not that the heavy world my spirit bruises; But I have not the heart to at Fame. Magnificent and mental ima ges ‘Have visited me oftentimes, and given My mind to proud delights—but now it sees Those visions going like the lights of even : All intellectual grandeur dimly flees,— And I am quiet at the stars of heaven!
“ —— A black eye in a recent scuffle, “ For sometimes we must box without the muffle.” All punish’d and penitent down on the knee, I bend to thee, Kate, to avert an a dieu : Oh, let not thine eyes, love, look black upon me. Because mine are forc’d to look black upon you. Am I worse in your eyes, for being worse in my own? Are the women to punish, as well as the men? I thought you’d have brought, when you found me a lone, Opodeldoc and smiles to restore me a gain. You know I love sparring and poesy, Kate, And scarcely care whether I’m hit at or kiss’d; You know that Spring* equally makes me e late, With the blow of a flower, and the blow of a fist. You know as you walk’d one damp evening of late, With your beau at your side, that a bow in the sky Arch’d its colours ethereal, and surely my Kate, This must be the rainbow I had in my eye. Forgive me, and never, oh, never a gain, I’ll cultivate light blue, or brown ine briety; I’ll give up all chance of a fracture or sprain, And part, worse thin all, with Pierce Egan’s so ciety. Forgive me, and mufflers I’ll carefully pull O’er my knuckles hereafter, to make them well bred; To mollify digs in the kidney with wool, And temper with leather a punch of the head. And Kate!— if you’ll fib from your fore - head that frown, And spar with a lighter and prettier tone; I’ll look,—if the swelling should ever go down, And these eyes look again,—upon you, love, a lone!
Go back to Brummagem! go back to Brum - magem! Youth of that ancient and halfpenny town! Maul manufacturers; rattle, and rum mage ’em; Country swell’d heads may afford you re - nown; Here in Town-rings, we find Fame very fast go, The exquisite light weights are heavy to bruise; For the graceful and punishing hand of Be lasco Foils, and will foil all attempts on the Jews. Go back to Brummagem, while you’ve a head on! For bread from the Fancy is light weight e nough; Moulsey, whose turf is the sweetest to tread on, Candidly owns you’re a good bit of stuff : But hot-heads and slow hands are utterly useless, When Israelite science and caution awake; So pr’ythee go home, Youth! and pester the Jews less, And work for a cutlet, and not for a stake Turn up the raws at a fair or a holiday, Make your fist free with each Brummagem rib; But never again, Lad, commit such a folly, pray! As sigh to be one of the messmates of Crib, Leave the P. C. purse, for others to handle Throw up no hat in a Moulsey Hurst sun; Bid adieu, by the two-penny post, to Jack Randall, And take the outside of the coach,—one pound one! Samson! forget there are such men as Se roggins, And Shelton and Carter, and Bob Burns and Spring; Forget toss for sides, and forget all the floggings, While shirts are pull’d off,—to make per - fect the ring. Your heart is a real-one, but skill, Phil, is wanted; Without it, all useless by bravery begs; Be content that you’ve beat Dolly Smith, and been chaunted, And train’d,—stripp’d—and pitted,—and hit off your legs!
“ Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew Thee from report divine, and heard thy name, Did he not tremble for this lovely frame, This glorious canopy of light and blue? Yet ’neath a curtain of translucent dew, Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame, Hesperus with the host of heaven came, And lo! creation widened in man’s view. Who could have thought such darkness lay con cealed, Within thy beams, O sun? or who could find, Whilst sky and leaf and insect stood re vealed, That to such countless orbs thou mads’t us blind? Why do we thus shun death with anxious strife? If light can thus deceive, wherefore not Life?”
“ None but himself can be his parallel!” With marble-coloured shoulders—and keen eyes, Protected by a forehead broad and white — And hair cut close lest it impede the sight, And clenched hands, firm, and of punishing size — Steadily held, or motion’d wary- wise, To hit or stop—and kerchief too drawn tight O’er the unyielding loins, to keep from flight The inconstant wind, that all too often flies — The Nonpareil stands!— Fame, whose bright eyes run o’er With joy to see a Chicken of her own Dips her rich pen in claret, and writes down Under the letter R, first on the score, “ Randall—John—Irish Parents—age not known — “ Good with both hands, and only ten stone four!”
Oh! pretty Polar lady! Doth thy bearded bosom beat, That breast so sweetly shady, With an unaccustomed heat? Dark, oily, Polar woman! Lay aside thy freezing airs, And take to something human, In the room of boors and bears. I’m an officer! my jacket Will tell thee what I am; No master of a packet, My pretty Polar dame! But a sailor with old Jervis, A man of royal blue; Kings send me on their service, And their service send to you. Thy Husband, from his swooning At thy flight will soon a rise; And go about har pooning The sorrow from his eyes : And he’ll be no more a rubber Of wet sockets; but he’ll seek, With a wiser kind of blubber, To pacify his cheek. Thine eyes are dark and roving, My pretty Polar sun! Oh, they’re very full of loving, And extremely full of fun. The mate attracts thine ogling; But, oh, my fair! thy fate Don’t now be after boggling; But take me for thy mate, The ruby tide is rushing To that shadowy cheek; and, oh, So heavenly is that blushing, It shames the ruby snow. All things thine eye doth snatch at With a kind of amorous fear; Ah, do not steal the hatchet; My pretty Polar dear! Give up ice-fields, where no hedges Are full of bloom or birds, Give up bear-skins, give up sledges, Give up all thy barking herds : Come to England, let me marry thee, And trees shall be thy own; And a neat post-chaise shall carry thee From Chatham up to town.
“ —— And muttered, lost! lost! lost!” ’Tis vain to grieve for what is past, The golden hours are gone; My own mad hand the die hath cast, And I am left a lone : ’Tis vain to grieve —I now can leave No other bliss—yet still I grieve! The dreadful silence of this night Seems breathing in my ear; I scarce can bear the lonely light That burns oppress’d and near ) I stare at it while half re clin’d, And feel its thick light on my mind. The sweetest fate have I laid waste With a remorseless heart; All that was beautiful and chaste, For me seem’d set a part; But I was fashion’d to de fy Such treasure, so set richly by. How could I give up her, whose eyes Were fill’d with quiet tears, For many a day—when thoughts would rise, Thoughts darken’d with just fears, Of all my vices!— Memory sees Her eyes’ divine remonstran ces. A wild and wretched choice was mine, A life of low de light; The midnight rounds of noise and wine, That vex the wasted night; The bitter jest, the wearied glee, The strife of dark socie ty. To those who plung’d me in the throng Of such disastrous joys, Who led me by low craft a long, And stunned my mind with noise — I only wish they now could look Upon my Life’s despoiled book. When Midnight finds me torn a part From vulgar revel ry, The cold, still Madness of the heart Comes forth, and talks with me; Talks with me, till the sky is grey With the chill light of breaking day. My love is lost—my studies marr’d, My friends disgrac’d and chang’d; My thoughts all scatter’d and im pair’d, My relatives es trang’d : Yet can I not by day re call My ruined Spirit from its thrall.
And must I perish thus?— a nameless tomb Where few shall weep :— some days of writhing pain, Ere yet I sink :— some hopes that still re - main Though Reason mock at them :— is this my doom?— Oft have I sate in silence—then the mind Was busy, and its images se rene Seemed some dim outlines of the future, seen In the deep distance, shadowy, unde fined : Then did I weep in very weari ness Of Earth, and wished, how longingly! to leave This cheerless world, and, having ceased to grieve, For ever dwell in realms of blessed ness! Heaven hears the prayer, and hastes the boon to give, The wasting victim sighs and prays— to live!
If I might choose, where my tired limbs shall lie When my task here is done, the Oak’s green crest Shall rise above my grave—a little mound Raised in some cheerful village-cemete ry — And I could wish, that, with unceasing sound, A lonely mountain rill was murmuring by — In music—through the long soft twilight hours; And let the hand of her, whom I love best, Plant round the bright green grave those fragrant flowers, In whose deep bells the wild-bee loves to rest — And should the Robin, from some neigh - bouring tree, Pour that dear song of her’s—oh, softly tread, For sure, if aught of Earth can sooth the Dead, He still must love that pensive melo dy!
——————— ego sanus ab illis, Perniciem quæcunque ferunt : mediocribus et queis Ignoscas, vitiis teneor.—Ubi quild datur oti, Illudo chartis. Hoc est mediocribus illus Ex vitiis unum : cui si concedere nolis, Multa poetarum veniat manus, auxilo quæ Sit mihi; (nam multo plures sumus.) Stand upon thy guard, and see if all the skill of fencing France, Or thy Italian practice, cowardly Bravo, Can ward this flash of lightning from thine eyes. Our celebrated Jurist, long a go, Coined twenty rhymes in praise of Mr Packwood; But for a worthier name my verse shall flow, And every sounding stanza end with Blackwood. Fierce brushy hairs on chins that bristled big, Jem Packwood’s razor shave off smooth and smack would; But for each bristling hair, a bustling Whig; Sinks ’neath the keen victorious sweep of Blackwood. Long ruled a Tyrant Fiend the Northern sky, Impious and cruel, whom no hand at tack would; Till pitying Heaven a stern Avenger, high And bold, upreared in thee, illustrious Blackwood! No cautious war thy hand would deign to wage, At once thy spunck the fortress storm and sack would, With sheer close thrust the tyrant to en gage, Alone might suit the energy of Blackwood. At first high-seated in his old pa vilion, Fain scorn the unwonted foe the fiendish quack would, And pass for pride before the subject Million, The fear that made him shun the wrath of Blackwood. But soon, I knew, thou’dst strip the thin dis guise; I knew—not long so crouse the Tyrant crack would, Exposed in batter’d plight to vassal eyes, All bleeding from the vulture beak of Blackwood. The coxcombries of their blaspheming cant, Full soon I knew to earth he hew and hack would, And on the ruins of the unrighteous plant The godly trophies of the march of Blackwood. I knew thy thumps to quell the vauntings priggish, Of pert and impious upstarts find the knack would, And paleness mantle every visage whiggish, At the bare echo of the name of Blackwood. I knew the weight of thy o’ermastering digs, Soon teach the pompous Swells to shout a lack! would; I knew they soon, (these infidels and whigs ) Not blue and yellow look, but blue and black would. I knew thou would’st run Leslie such a rig, That he no more, like some fierce Don Cos sack, would Against the tongue of Moses shake his wig, Cow’d into reverence by the rod of Blackwood. I knew thou’dst find a whip for such a pig, I knew full soon he stop his impious clack would, And be constrained to dye his whitening wig, By chemic tricks disguising dread of Blackwood. I knew he—(grant for once he were a chemist As great as Thomson, or as Gay Lus sac) would Ne’er make his ugly bristles look the trimmest — I knew the world would smell his funck for Blackwood. The Galovegian Stot, (I mean Mac culloch ) I knew your nose the monster’s progress track would, I knew you’d find a blinker for the Bullock,* And for his cloven hoof a clog of black wood. I knew the captive brute, compelled to stand, Foam in his fury like a cata ract would, Braying and bellowing, tearing up the sand, And howling to the winds for sport to Blackwood; Till, weary of the din, the Master’s sign The Baiters’ wrath unwearied counte ract would,†— Leave the base Beast at freedom to re cline In his own bed of dirt, and growl at Blackwood. I knew your fist would be the end of Broug ham, I knew you’d pummel him, and may-be smack wood, Till both should yelp in terror for the doom That waits the victims of victorious Blackwood. To shew how Harry, in his early days, Gladly on all their Whiggery turn his back would, And for Pitt’s pudding give great Pitt his praise;— Such glamour-might is thine—I thank thee, Blackwood! How Pitt the Renegado scorned, and swore That such Upholders ne’er his banner lack would — How Addington the fine French letter tore — The world had never known—without my Blackwood. Watch, jealous Guardian of old Scotia’s weal! How dance these lads (enfeebled were thy thwack) would! Watch, hero! with thy righteous rod of steel — Let nought decrease thy vigour, peerless Blackwood! If any doubt my deep prophetic strain, Right glad a pound I bet against a plack would, That time will shew my words were not in vain, When I foretold the widening sway of Blackwood. The Edinburgh Review has now no sale — Friend Constable’s spare copies build a stack would, While on, prevailing still and to pre vail, The certain circulation moves of Blackwood. Judicious people banish from their houses Much sooner Æsop, Gay, or Tele maque would, Than not enrich their children and their spouses, With monthly stores of loyal wit from Blackwood. Luxurious people rather want Cham paigne, Lafitte, Hocheimer, Grave, Sauterne, Bar sac would, Than on the glorious twentieth gape in vain For the rich treat of treats that streams from Blackwood. The ancient Damsel in her elbow- chair Less miss her tea and toast (or Cogni ac) would, Less ball and route would miss the younger fair, Than the gay cordial of the page of Blackwood. The poorest Shepherd on the Yarrow- hill Much rather want his mouthful of ta back would — Caddies themselves would sacrifice their gill, Rather than hear there was no more of Blackwood. Were the whole nation poll’d, I dare to say The brightest mark in Britain’s Alma nack would Be placed against the Twentieth —the glad day That gives the longing world the page of Blackwood. Nay, Ebony’s great fame the channel crosses : German Professors rather bivou ack would, Than want the monthly versions which the Vosses And Müllners publish of the cream of Blackwood. Parisian Incroyables also read him — The run at Galignani’s table slack would Could that superb Traiteur no longer feed ’ em, (I mean their minds)—with tid-bits à la Blackwood. I might enumerate more names with ease : The bearded Russ himself, and shorn Po lack would Rebel against their Autocrat’s de crees, If his tariffs should check the sale of Blackwood. I’m told he’s now republish’d at New York; And in Savannahs read, and swamp, and back-wood, Even Indian tribes, that munch sans knife and fork, Have taste enough to like the jokes in Blackwood. There are some utter idiots, and I know it, These most the merest balderdash at tract would; These Burns of Paisley prize above the Poet, And Baldwin’s John above the James of Blackwood. To Fearman, though I think he trick’d us basely, What answer better far than “ Pontef ract would ” I will point out for once— “ Old Tales or Leslie;”— That “ Series ” I’ll review myself in Blackwood. And though his Jedediah is no genius, Sagaciously he such a work re dact would; If he declined, Knowles, author of Vir ginius, Perhaps would try, lured by the praise of Blackwood. But vainly Fearman with John Ballan tyne, Essay another hazard of tic- tack would; Impostors seldom in the upshot shine, Witness your foes, O Ballantyne and Blackwood. ’Twas said, some weeks ago, that Ballan tyne Hop off in some affection iliac would; But, thanks to Dr Baillie’s skill and mine, John’s now quite well—though not so stout as Blackwood. Should John depart, how all “ the genial Muses ” Lament that grievous blow, that hopeless wrack would! Not often such a man our planet loses — All edged with black would issue the next Blackwood! I could find rhymes for twenty stanzas more, If I look o’er some book proso diac would; Our tongue is not so thankless nor so poor As to give only fifty rhymes to Blackwood. And as for subjects, I, from what has been, Is, and shall be, with ease my song pro tract would, Lashing the dolts, who’ve read the Maga zine, Yet joined the base Whig splutter against Blackwood. True, though some fearful tricks I knew, I ne’er The archives of remembrance old ran sack would, To drive some paltry creature to despair;— We’d smile at ‒——’s feckless spleen, my Blackwood. Nor would I mention Hypocrite-Tre panners, What Sandy calls his Head though that dis tract would; No! I would ne’er offend against good manners; But wish your foes were all as weak, my Blackwood. In short, however great might be my zeal, Not willingly I come into con tact would With bodies that have not the sense to feel Such gentle skelps as are bestowed by Blackwood. Such “ an idea I would repro bate, I never gibbet a small spruce gim- crack would;— The “ only literary Bailie’s”* pate — I would just touch it with your fan, Miss Blackwood! Yet I would hang a symbol up before him, That make him half a hypochondri ack would — An Ebon Switch to dangle in terro rem, And make such geese not cackle about Blackwood. In future years, if men, not yet be got, Sons of our sons, with equity ex act, would Assign their proper stations to James Scott, And other famous bards that write in Blackwood. All, I’m quite sure, that relish what is plea sant, Applaud my prosody elegi ac would;— Especially what I’m about at pre sent, My testimonium— Blackwood. I do not mean that closely coi ncide With all my sentiments they snick-for- snack would, But my pure verse and skill they’d laud with pride, And Bipliopoles unborn would envy Blackwood! Each wish he had of Wits a band as strong, Beneath his banner, in some snug bar rack would; And burn, new ages and new tribes a mong, To fill once more the glorious shoes of Blackwood — Which are ( sub rosa ) any thing but slippers — Few covet, of that post, a lengthened tack would; Among Field Marshals look, or Greenland Skippers, If you’d find nerves to match t‚he nerves of Blackwood; Or ’mong the Lavenders and Vickerys look, With Radicals that scorn the least com pact would; That Thistlewood’s base gang so bravely took, Just as the Barber’s must be seized by Blackwood. But stop! though rhymes on rhymes would come like butter, I fear you take me for a mani ac would, Should I go on—whereas no stuff I utter, Sound Solid Sense inspired this hymn to Blackwood. If any Whig dispute my word, right willing I with that Sceptic gentleman co ntract would, To furnish him a stanza, (price one shilling ) Each day for twenty years in praise of Blackwood. Approving much this novel style of song, We’ve promis’d Doctor Scott “ a mint o’ siller,” To make another, by next Month, as long, Each stanza to conclude with “ Bobby Miller.”
Queen Juno does an artful wile, ’Gainst Jupiter employ; And hinders him, by aid of sleep, From giving help to Troy. The golden-throned queen of heaven be held The arduous conflict from the Olympian height; Well pleased she saw, upon th’ ensanguined field, King Neptune toiling in the glorious fight : But Jove she viewed not with the like de light On wat’ry Ida’s loftiest peak re clined; The goddess, filled with hatred at his sight, Stood pondering long what method she could find, With artful wile to cheat th’ Almighty Thunderer’s mind, Thus she resolves at length; to go to Ide, Adorned with all-the aiding powers of art There on the force of beauty she re lied, To win the Ægis-bearing monarch’s heart; Then from the fight to turn his eyes a part, Bending his lids with sleep’s oblivious load; Pleased with the thought she hastens to de part, And speeds her steps to gain her own a bode, Built by her favourite son, Valcan the artist God. Then to her secret bower she bent her way, None, save herself, its threshold ever passed; Its doors she oped with her mysterious key, Then entering, closed the splendid portal fast : O’er her fair form ambrosial streams she cast, And oil, soft, fragrant, grateful to the sense; Its powerful perfume from the chamber past Through the whole dome; the gales conveyed it thence, O’er all the heavens and earth new fragrance to di spense. This labour done, she wreathes her heavenly hair, On her immortal head in curls to twine; Then round her casts the robe of beauty rare, Which Pallas wrought with many a rich de sign; Its folds above bright golden clasps con fine, A circling zone close binds it at the waist, A zone round which a hundred tassels shine, A splendid fringe; then in her ears she placed Her sparkling rings of gold, with three fair brilliants graced. Next her fine form the mantle’s folds sur round, New-woven, of splendour dazzling as the sun; Her sandals last upon her feet she bound, And then the pleasing cares of dress were done; Straight from her bower to Venus has she gone, Whom she addressed, withdrawing her a part; “ Say, daughter dear, shall my request be won? “ Or wilt thou scorn my suit, enraged at heart “ That I espouse the Greek, and thou the Trojan part?’ Fair Venus gave the queen a mild reply, “ Be thy request, imperial Juno, made, “ Nor fear that Venus will the suit deny; “ If I can grant thy bidding is o bey’d.” With artful wile the heavenly sovereign said : “ Grant that I may those powerful charms di splay, “ By which the sons of heaven and earth are swayed; “ For I to earth’s far limits bend my way, “ Where Ocean, sire of Gods, and ancient Tethys sway. “ Me to their realms my mother Rhea sent “ Where I was bred beneath their fostering care; “ Where Saturn, under earth and ocean pent, “ Resigned to Jove the empire of the air. “ I haste to reconcile the ancient pair, “ Since angry quarrels have disturbed their peace; “ No more the genial couch of love they share, “ But if my voice should bid the contest cease, “ How would their former love, for such kind care, in crease.” “ Could I refuse,” the queen of smiles re plied, “ The regal consort of the Almighty Sire?” Then from her breast the cestus she u ntied, In which was stored whate’er can love in spire; In it was tender passion, warm de sire, Fond lovers’ soft and amorous inter course, Th’ endearing looks and accents that can fire The soul with passionate love’s resistless force, ’Gainst which the wisest find in wisdom no re source. Into Saturnia’s hand she gave the zone, And said, “ Conceal this cestus in thy breast — “ Such is th’ embroidered girdle’s power, that none “ Can e’er refuse to grant thee thy re quest.” Gladly the queen received it, and ex pressed Her heartfelt pleasure by a gracious smile; Quick to her bosom she the girdle pressed :— Fair Venus sought the Thunderer’s lordly pile, And Juno left the skies to seek the Lemnian isle. Above Pieria’s realms the goddess speeds, O’er fair Emathia, o’er the mountains steep Of snowy Thrace, renowned for generous steeds; Nor touched the earth. She then descends to sweep From Atho’s summit o’er the billowy deep; Lemnos, where noble Thoas held com mand, Quickly she gains, and meets the god of sleep; Death’s drowsy brother taking by the hand, She urges thus her suit in accents soft and bland :— “ Sleep, whose dominion gods and men o bey, “ If to assist me thou did’st e’er in cline, “ Assist me now. I grateful shall re pay, “ If Jove’s bright eyes to slumber thou con sign, “ While in his fond embraces I re cline. “ A golden throne Vulcan my son shall mould, “ In recompence for this, with art di vine; “ A throne and footstool of the purest gold, “ Which will thy shapely feet at the gay feast up hold.” Sleep thus replied : “ Saturnia, queen su preme, “ On any other should my influence fall “ Among th’ immortals, even upon the stream “ Of ancient Ocean, parent of us all, “ But not on Jove, save when he deigns to call. “ At thy request I ventured once be fore “ In my soft bonds his senses to en thral, “ What time his conquering gallies from the shore “ Of subjugated Troy the great Alcides bore. “ Around his soul my balmy influence cast “ Lulled into sleep th’ all-seeing eyes of Jove; “ While, roused by thee, the terrors of the blast “ Against his son in tempest fury strove, “ And into populous Cos his vessels drove “ Far from his friends—when Jove awaked a gain “ He hurled th’ immortals through the halls a bove; “ Me chief he sought, to ’whelm me in the main, “ Did not resistless Night his ’vengeful ire re strain. “ To her, who spreads her unsubdued con trol “ O’er men and gods, I bent my hasty flight, “ Jove then forgave, though angry in his soul, “ For he revered the power of ancient Night. “ Then canst thou me forgetful thus in vite, “ Rashly again the sovereign’s wrath to dare?” “ Let not such idle thoughts thy soul af fright,” Juno replied, “ Has Jupiter such care “ For Ilium’s haughty sons, as for his valorous heir. “ Can they to him their lofty lineage trace? “ But come, I’ll gift thee with a heavenly bride, “ Pasithea, the fair, the youthful Grace, “ The maid for whose bright charms thou long hast sighed.” She ceased, o’erjoyed the slumberous god re plied, “ By Styx, inviolable river, swear; “ Let one hand touch the ocean’s level tide, “ Let fruitful earth the other hand up bear, “ That the dark gods below the solemn vow may hear. “ That they may witness, from the depths of space, “ Where round old Saturn circled they re main, “ That thou wilt gift me with that heavenly Grace “ For whose bright charms I sigh so long in vain. “ Fair Juno took the oath; in solemn strain By name invoking from the realms be low The subtartarean gods, the Titan train, That they the sacred covenant might know, Thus was the contract made, and ratified the vow. Then bent on speed, the Imbrian shore they leave And wrapt in darkness, for Mount Ida make; Arrived at Lectos, springing from the wave, Aloft in air their soaring course they take; Beneath their feet the lofty forests shake, As o’er their topmost boughs in haste they flew And where the branches formed a veil o paque, Somnus remained, to shun the Thunderer’s view, Perched in a lofty fir, the tallest there that grew, Changed to a mountain bird, concealed from all, Close nestling in the shadowing boughs he lies, (The shrill-toned bird which men Cymindis call, Calchis the immortals name it in the skies ), Meanwhile to Gargarus Saturnia hies, And there she met the cloud-compelling Jove : He saw! he loved! such beauties met his eyes, That all his soul love’s warmest transports move, Not warmer did he feel when first he learned to love. Not even when first in her encircling arms, In sweet, in stolen embraces, he re clined; Seized with desire, enraptured with her charms, He thus addressed the queen in accents kind : “ Why didst thou leave thy car and steeds be hind, And thus on foot from far Olympus stray?” Him Juno answered, with dissembling mind, “ To Earth’s far limits I direct my way, Where Ocean, sire of Gods, and ancient Tethys sway. “ In youth they reared me with parental care, “ And now to them I hasten as a friend; “ For filled with wrath, the couch no more they share, “ And much I wish the angry strife to end; At Ida’s foot my steeds and car at tend, Seated on which o’er land and sea I speed; But ere on this long tour my course I bend, I ask thy leave; for quarrel it might breed, Did I, unknown to thee, to Ocean’s streams pro ceed.” Her answered thus the cloud compelling Jove :— “ That task, fair queen, another time per form; But now devote the precious hours to love; For ne’er did mortal on immortal form My soul ere this with such fierce passion warm : Not even Ixion’s wife, from whose em brace Pirithous came, had such a power to charm;— Not even fair Danae, maid of matchless grace, From whom brave Perseus sprung, noblest of human race! “ Not so I loved the royal maid of Tyre, From whom just Rhadamanth and Minos came; Nor did Alcmena’s charms such love in spire, Who bore Alcides, chief of glorious name; Not so did Semele my soul in flame, Who Bacchus, joyous god to mortals, bore; Not so I loved Queen Ceres, fair-haired dame; Nor Leto—no, nor even thyself be fore, As now with fond desire transported I a dore.” With artful words Queen Juno answered Jove, “ What dost thou thus, impatient king, pro pose? Wouldst thou the sacred mysteries of love On Ida’s top to open view ex pose? What would ensue if, ere from sleep we rose, Some God should view me locked in thy em brace, And to the Immortal Powers the tale dis close? Ne’er to thy dome could I my steps re trace, Arising from thy couch, confounded in dis grace. “ But if to love thy wishes be dis posed, To thine own bower, by Vulcan built, re pair; His art the solid doors has firmly closed, And there the genial bed of love we’ll share.” “ Nor God nor man,” cried Jove,” “ (dismiss that care ) Shall view us here; for such a dusky cloud Of gold shall darken the surrounding air, Not even the sun shall pierce th’ obscuring shroud, Whose beams with brightest powers of splendour are en dowed He spoke, and round the queen his arms he flung. Beneath them Earth her freshest herbage threw; For their soft couch the hyacinth up sprung, The saffron flower, the lotus bathed. in dew; Upraised on this they lay concealed from view; A golden cloud enveloped them a round, Distilling dew-drops of resplendent hue; The monarch’s arms his lovely spouse sur round, On Gargarus’ lofty top, in love and slumber drowned. Thus Jupiter with Juno here, Forgot the fight be, While Ajax, helped by Neptune’s might, Does Hector overthrow.
Firm is the genuine patriot’s soul : Him nor the mob’s malign con trol, Nor furious despot’s frown com bined Stirs from the purpose of his mind. Lightnings may flash; o’er Adria’s wave The South-wind’s tyrant force may rave; May rend, may sink th’ o’erarching skies — Fearless amidst the wreck, he dies. With hearts so strung, to heaven’s re pose Pollux and tost Alcides rose; ’Mid whom ’tis Cesar’s bliss to sip The nectar’d bowl with ruby lip. And thee thus gifted, Bacchus, too, Chafed by the yoke thy tigers drew : And, gifted thus, great Ilia’s son On Mars’ steeds ’scaped Ache ron. Pleased, the high synod heard heaven’ Dame Pronounce, ‘ Troy, Troy is wrapp’d in flame, By judge corrupt foredoom’d its wall, And foreign beauty’s lure to fall : To mine and to Minerva’s levin Its fraudful prince and people given, Then, when in vain their bargain’d meed The builder-Gods solici ted. Glitters no more in Phrygian vest Adulterous Helen’s lustful guest : No more, upheld. by Hector’s hand, The perjur’d towers of Priam stand. Fed by our feuds, the war ex pires, And with it die this bosom’s fires! My hated kin, whom Ilia bore, For Mars’ sake I hate no more. Be his, to tread this star-paved plan; His, the bright wine of Gods to drain; And his, to live—I not gain say — Rank’d with our care-free’d hosts for aye. So the broad ocean roll be tween Their Rome and Troy’s detested scene, Reign they—where’er the exlies’ lot — In proudest state! I murmur not. So the wild herds mock Priam’s pride, And in his tombe the litters hide Secure—her Capitol may tower, And Parthia ae beneath its power. And wide extend her name of dread, Wide as the midland billows spread, Which from fair Europe part the Moor — Or where old Nile’s rich torrents roar. “ Of gold in its dark ceme try, So better hid—disdainful, she Drags not the buried mischief forth, With impious hand, from mother Earth. Where’er the world’s far limit stand, Visit that bourn her conquering bands; Rejoiced ’mid tropic fires to glow, Or firth and freeze in polar snow. Bind but the hero-race this law — That them nor pride of triump draw, Nor fatal piety en snare, The shatter’d domes of Troy to rear Should Troy afresh her turrets raise, Again the ill-starr’d pile should blaze; The victor-hosts again I’d move, Dread wife and sister I of Jove. Should Phœbus self thrice build the wall Of sturdiest brass, it thrice should fall, My Argives’ prey; and thrice, with deep Long wail, her captive dames should weep.” But these are themes for lighter shell Unfit : my Muse, bethink thee well; Nor dare the strains of Gods re hearse, Degraded by thy humble verse.
Jove’s power the thunder-peal pro claims : Britain’s and Parthia’s hated names, Inscribed ’mid Cæsar’s victo ries, Exalt the hero to the skies. And has thy soldier, Crassus, wived With barbarous consort, meanly lived? Beneath a Median standard ranged (O senate shamed! O manners changed!) Mail’d in a foreign sire’s ar ray, Has the stern Marsian’s brow grown gray — Vesta, race, robe, and rites for got, As if great Rome, dread Jove were not? This, patriot Regulus fore knew; And spurn’d, to home and honour true, The terms whose chronicled dis grace Would paralyse each rising race — If they, who bore to live in chains, Lived not unwept. “ In Punic fanes Rome’s captive banner hung (he cried ) These eyes have witness’d; from a side Gash’d by no wound the sword re sign’d, And Roman arms base fetters bind; Carthage unbolted, and her field (Erst our rich spoil) securely till’d. Hope ye more brave a ransom’d race? Ye couple damage with dis grace. Alas! once tinctured for the boom, Ne’er will the fleece its snow re sume; Nor valour, sullied by a stain, Shake off its taint, and glow a gain. If stag released will brave the fight, Then count upon that soldier’s might, Who once has bow’d to treacherous foe : Then trust he’ll strike heroic blow, Who once has felt the hostile cord, And quiver’d at a Punic sword. Of life’s true guardian reckless, he Sought in base peace securi ty. O mighty Carthage, rear’d to fame On ruin of the Roman name!? And thus, his wife’s caress de clined, And round his knees his infants twined Pushing away, in sternest mood (His eyes unraised) the warrior stood : Till he the wavering senate bent With counsel beyond prece dent, And ’mid his weeping friends’ dis may, Illustrious exile! hied a way. Though well, alas! he knew what woes Were meant him by his Savage foes : Through kin, through crowds before him cast, With foot as firm the hero past, As if composed each petty broil Of humble friends, from civil toil He turn’d to some Venafran dome, Or sought Tarentum’s distant home!
This March-day incense, at the door Fuming of me a bache lor; These flowers, on living turf this fire — Surprised, What mean they? you in quire, Skill’d in the lore of Greece and Rome : —Know, when the tree near seal’d my doom, A snow-white goat to Bacchus I Vow’d grateful, and carousal high. And ever as that day the year Brings round, from rosin’d cork I clear The flask, in mellowing chimney placed When Tullus last the fasces graced. Mæcenas, to thy rescued friend Toss off an hundred bumpers. Blend With orient dawn the taper’s ray : Be noise, be quarrels far a way! Dismiss thy cares about the state : The Dacian, Cotison is beat; And Parthia, vex’d with civil arms, No longer works thy Rome a larms. Our ancient foes, the sons of Spain, At length put on the tardy chain : And Scythia’s hordes prepare to yield, With bow unstrung, the battle- field. Left to itself the public weal, Awhile from private interests steal : Forsake the toils and cares of power And snatch, and use, the present hour.
While Lydia, I to thee was dear, And round that neck—so soft, so fair — No arm more welcome dared to twine, More blest than kingly lot was mine. While, still to me thy love con fined, Thy Chloe left me not be hind, Poor Lydia’s glory then stood high; More famed than Ilia’s self was I. Me now the charms of Chloe sway Skilled in sweet sounds of lyre and lay; For whom stern Death I’d gladly brave, To snatch the maiden from the grave. And me young Calais in spires Whose bosom burns with mutual fires; For whom stern Death I’d doubly brave, To snatch the stripling from the grave. What if the yoke, though sunder’d we As erst to wear again a gree! Should I shake off sweet Chloe’s chain, And take my Lydia home a gain!— Though fairer he than eve’s bright star Than Adria’s gulf thou stormier far, And light as floating cork—yet I With thee would live, with thee would die.
Fount of Bandusia, glassy spring, Worthy of hallow’d offe ring, Of scatter’d flowers and sweetest wine! A kid to-morrow shall be thine, Whose budding horns threat love and war — Falsely, alas! poor wanto ner! To-morrow with his heart’s red tide Thy stream, fair Fountain, shall be dyed. Thee not the dog-star’s fiery ray Visits with unrelenting day : Th’ o’er-labour’d ox, the roving kine, Glad in thy cool fresh shade re cline. Rank amid noblest streams shalt thou, Whilst in my song the oak shall grow Based on the rock, with sparkling flash Whence down thy headlong waters dash.
Wedded to needy Iby cus, Cease, wanton Chloris, loosely thus — Fitter for burial thou, than ball! To bound, at each gay festi val; Descried ’mid blooming maids at play, Like black cloud on the Milky Way. That well may grace bright Pholo e, Which ill beseems such crone as thee. Fitlier thy daughter would be come, Like Bacchante roused by beat of drum, To storm young gallants’ doors, or fired By Nothus, frisk as goat un tired. Thine age Luceria’s fleeces suit And distaff, more than lyre or lute, Or flask drain’d dry, or round the brow Entwined the rose’s damask glow.
If the New Moon thy hands but see Rear’d heavenward, rustic Phidy le; And incense, and fresh fruits ap pease, And a fierce sow thy dei ties : No blight thy fertile vines shall feel, On thy corn-field no mildew steal; Nor thy sweet charge the season fear, When Autumn’s orchards load the year. The victim, which ’mid woodlands green On snow-capp’d Algidus is seen, Or crops in Alban meads its food, May stain the pontift’s axe with blood — Befits not thee to steep the ground In gore of slaughter’d offerings : crown’d With rosemary’s and myrtle’s pride, Thy little gods are satis fied. Press but from hand that’s pure their shrine A simple cake, the Powers Di vine Costlier oblation less will win, When tender’d by a heart un clean.
Whither, Bacchus, full of thee, Am I rapt in ecsta sy? In what caves, what bowers a mong Fluttering, shall be heart my song; Lifting Cæsar, earth a bove. To the stars and state of Jove? Strange and wonderful, of yore Undivulged the lay I pour. Such the gaze they priestess throws, Roused from sleep o’er Tracia’s snows Hebrus and while Rhodo pe Trod by frantic foot. I see Marvelling, as I onward rove, Towering cliff and lonely grove. Lord of Naiad, Baccha nal Train uprooting ashes tall! Tame, or low, or mortal I Nought will sing. ’Tis sweet to try Perils scorn’d, the God to trace, Whose brow the vine’s green tendrils grace.
Of late a swain to maidens known, In love’s soft fields I won re nown. The age of that fond war gone by, Upon yon wall my engin ry Shall hang, at sea-born Venus’ side — My lyre, my flambeaux flaring wide, My battering bar, and bow, of yore Levell’d against th’ excluding door. O Queen of happy Cyprus thou, And Memphis free’d from chilling snow; Once, Goddess, with thy lifted lash, Once, lightly, haughty Chloe dash.
The bitch or fox with young, or jay, Ill-omen’d charterer! marks the way To villains; or, athirst for blood, The dun wolf from Lanuvium’s wood : Or serpent, where their journey leads, Shoots arrow-like, and scares their steeds. I with presaging skill en dued, Where friendship sways me for the good, The raven hoarse with anxious vow From the auspicious east will woo; Before the crow his stagnant fen, Herald of tempests, seeks a gain. Be happy wheresoe’er thou art, Galla, nor throw me from thine heart! No boding pye thy voyage stays, Thy course no warning crow de lays. —Yet see, how prone Orion heaves, Tremendous, the vast world of waves! Adria’s grim bay too well I know, Where breezes fair but fatal blow. O in our foes—their wives, their race — Wake the blind South-winds blast a maze! For them the blackening ocean roar, And strike with frantic surge the shore! Thus her false bull Europa rode Courageous, till amid the flood Dire monsters met her shrinking view : The wile detected paled her hue. She who o’er flowery meads had roved, To twine a wreath for those she loved, In the dim night could nought des cry, Save tossing seas and starry sky. Soon as her footstep press’d the shore, Where, Crete, thy hundred cities tower; “ O sire’s, O daughter’s name de fied! O duty phrenzy-whelm’d!” she cried : “ Whence come I? Whither? Ill shall one Poor death a maiden’s crime a tone. Wake I, my foul offence to weep; Or mocks my innocence a sleep Same dream, through ivory gate con vey’d? Deem I it happier to have stray’d O’er all this length of seas, or roam Cropping fresh flowers, ah me! at home? Would to my rage by righteous Heaven That bull, that guilty bull, were given! How would I gash his beauteous neck! His once-loved horns how strive to break! Shameless my father’s halls I’ve fled, Yet shameless fear to join the dead! Grant me, some listening God, to stray Naked, where lions prowl for prey : Ere furrow’d yet by meagre lines Withers this bloom, this plumpness pines, Or time has dared these charms to steal, Make me the tiger’s luscious meal. I hear my absent father cry; ‘ Lost girl! why linger thus to die? That ready zone with gripe of fate, This ash, thy shame may expi ate. Haply yon crag invites thee more, Round whose rough base the tempests roar : Brave, then, the storm—if rather thou Prefer not menial task and low; Or poorly, sprung of kings, to shine In some rude court, slave-concu bine!’ ” As thus she raved, with playful tongue Came Venus, and (his bow un strung ) Sly Cupid. Much the wily Dame Rallied the mourner on her flame : Then, “ Cease to scold that hated bull; Those horns,” she cried, “ again to pull It shall be thine. Thy sobs give o’er : Fits not Jove’s consort tears to pour. Learn thy great fortune well to bear : Thy name shall grace an hemi sphere.”
Othou of royal ancest ry, A cask of wine unpierced for thee I keep, and wreaths of roses fair, And essences to dew thy hair. Hie then to Tibur’s dripping shore, Rich Æsulæ’s green slope ex plore; And those sweet hills, where reign’d and died Telegonus the parri cide. Quit, quit thy cloying luxu ries, And turrets that invade the skies : Nor longer Rome’s gay scenes ad mire, Her smoke and opulence and stir. A charm in change the wealthy feel; And oft the simple cottage- meal, From tapestried halls and purple far, Has smooth’d the furrow’d brow of care. Bright Cepheus now his fire dis plays, Now Procyon pours his raging blaze; With madden’d beam the Lion burns, And all the thirsty year re turns. And now his fainting herd the swain Drives languidly o’er swelter’d plain, To bosky bourn or cooling lake, Though not a breeze it’s silence wake. Yet you still anxious guard the state, Mæcenas, still antici pate (Wakeful for all, your patriot cares ) What the discordant East pre pares. But Heaven, wise Heaven, from human sight The future shrouds in thickest night; And smiles, when self-tormentors feign Of woes to come a horrid train. The present hour spend frugal ly : The rest in Tiber emblem’d see, Now to the main calm gliding on; Now tree uprooted, shatter’d stone, And floating flocks and structures strong Whirling in one wild sweep a long; With echo of the hills and woods, When torrents vex the sleeping floods. Lord of himself and blest is he, Who when bright Phœbus seeks the sea, Can truly boast; “ I’ve lived to day. Tempest to-morrow as he may Dread Jove, or spread the skies with blue, Even he may not the past un do; O’er that, not Heaven itself has power : ’Tis gone—and I have had my hour. Fortune, ’mid sternest ravage gay, And bent her haughty game to play, Quick her capricious honours shifts; Now me aloft, now others lifts. I praise her stay but if her wing She shake, her gifts away I fling, Wrapp’d in my own integri ty, And blest with dowerless pover ty. When groans the mast, it is not mine, Poor grovelling mendicant! to whine With stipulating vow, and crave Redemption from the greedy wave For my rich cargoes. Some soft gale May gently fill my little sail; And safe, beneath the Twins, shall ride My skiff across the billowy tide.”
“ Roman Virgil, thou that singest Ilion’s lofty temples robed in fire, Ilion falling, Rome arising, wars, and filial faith, and Dido’s pyre; Landscape-lover, lord of language— more than he thatsang the Works and Days, All the chosen coin of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase; Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and heard; All of the charms of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word; Poet of the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beechen bowers; Poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers; Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be, Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earch and oarless sea; Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind; Thou Majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind; Light among the vanish’d ages; star that gildest yet this phantom shore; Golden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to rise no more; Now thy Forum roars no longer, fallen every purple Cæsar’s dome — Though thine ocean-roll of rhythm sound for ever of Imperial Rome — Now the Rome of slaves hath perish’d, and the Rome of freemen holds her place : I, from out the Northern Island sunder’d once from all the human race, I salute thee, mighty Mantuan, I that loved thee since my day be gan, Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.”
Down the aisles of the Abbey, in gathering night, I saw the majestical marbles loom; And the gorgeous panes in the pale twi light Shed a filtering fire on the pavement’s gloom. Like the stream of the light my memory streamed, And the shadows grew deeper the longer I dreamed! From statue to statue I wandered oft, And gaunter and ghostlier still they frowned; When a mighty peal from the organ loft Thundered, and deluged the air with sound, Then a light, like a star, gleamed out a bove, And a silvery note like the call of the dove. ‘ Will you play?’ they asked. And my fingers leapt With joy to the five-fold, serried keys! And I called from the place where their music slept The voice of the trumpets, the sound of the seas! In billow on billow the melody rolled, While the twilight gathered the strains to her fold! The towering arches shivered and swung, As the storm of the music doubled and spread : The vaults of the ages open sprung; The cavernous graves gave up their dead! And the blood of the martyrs for centuries slain Came back to the withered veins a gain. I saw the Christ on the bitter rood, Now crowned in glory, apparelled in light : The saints misjudged, misunder stood : God’s army, re-ordered to claim its right : Weeping they rose from their prison of stone, Weeping they passed, to seek their own. Grey-browed Resentment, the Hatred of years, The brood of Sorrow, the spawn of Hell! All that is bartered for blood and tears, All that the angels strive to quell,— They passed, as the dew on a desert land, While the Abbey shook like a palsied hand! Then the music changed to a pitiful cry, To the beating pulse of a twilit sea : The aisles grew greyer; but still the sigh And sob of the grief of Eterni ty! For the glorious army of martyrs came, And their murderers quailed ’neath the finger of shame. They clung to the pillars whereby they were scourged, They pointed the tree and the ladder of death! The organ crashed, and a shriek e merged From its bursting heart, like a dying breath. And there, in the twilight’s after glow, I was one with the chorus of deathless woe. Then the music died, and the wailing lone, And, like shadows sweeping the marble floor, The mighty army sank back into stone, And slept on the bosom of earth once more; And all they had suffered, and hoped, and prayed, Found silence at last in the Abbey’s shade! My heart, my heart is the Abbey grey! My heart has its altars and graves of white; Where the voice of music, in Memory’s lay, Recalls my gods to the lower light! O hearts I have cherished, awake, a wake! Live again in my song for your own sweet sake! See, the figures of light arise and throng, Throng back with a smile, my smile to greet; I can hear the strains of their gentle song! I break thro’ the darkness we meet! we meet! I can feel their breath with my tresses play; But their eyes and their heart are far a way! My heart, my heart is the Abbey high, The Abbey wide, with its hidden nooks! Where nothing can perish, where nothing can die, Where Fame is inscribed in God ’s Doomsday Books! Where the marble’s warning is cold and grey, For the souls that sleep are awake for aye! I cling to the pillars where once I bled, For these are the pillars that bear my life : They shiver for thought of the grief that is dead, For they know where my heart broke down in the strife. But the graves of the past open still to the strong, And my dead shall live—in my burning song!
Blood lies on the valley, blood lies on the mountain; Blood lies in the green glen, and flows in the fountain;— Has the red-deer been there as the shaft left the quiver? No, that blood cries to heaven for ever and ever. Lo! him who has spilt it, I hearken him crying, As a babe at the birth time, beneath the sword dying :— Lo! him wh o decreed it, while nobles were kneeling, His robe is a rag, and his palace a shealing. O ye proud one’s of Scotland, dark woes are pre paring, God’s hand o’er the necks of the mighty is baring; The avenger in heaven has hung out a token, For the spilt blood of saints, and for covenants broken. O mourn for the gray dame, and weep for the daughter, The hooded crow’s screaming to stoop on the slaughter; In thy best blood the war-horse shall swim like a river, And Sorrosyke-moor shall bring sorrow for ever. And yet, though I weep for the nobles’ revilement, The scoff of thy crowned one—the Church’s defilement, Oh a warmer tear comes when I think that thy glory Shall set like yon sun, and be silent in story.
May Cameron, my loved one, my best and my fairest, What long robe is this which thou, weeping, pre parest? White, white as the snow which the dark rain’s de filing — Such robes are not worn by the living and smiling. The maiden sat mute—through her long and her slender Pale fingers, the warm tears cam dropping, and tender She sighed, yet she spoke not, the robe white and limber Shook, as the maid sobbed, like the leaf of Sep tember. May Cameron, my loved one, remember— remember — Thy sighs in green July, thy vows in December; The winter snow falls, and the winter wind’s singing, But I shall come back when the lily is springing — There shall be men’s shouts, and the bright eyes of women Shall gladden our hall when the bridal-light’s gleaming! The maiden sat mute—her locks trembling and waving On pale cheeks betokened the wo she was braving. May Cameron, my loved one, why dost thou sit weeping? As the roe of the desart thy heart should be leaping; The Lord’s voice is heard over mountain and river, Come whet your swords sharper, and fill every quiver. The proud hearts of mid-day, all cold at the gloaming, Shall lie like reaped corn ’mongst their war-horses foaming, As harmless as babes—flocks asleep in their pasture! The maiden sobbed loud and wept faster and faster. May Cameron, hearest thou not our war-horses prancing; May Cameron, markest thou not our steel helmets glancing; Stern Claverse is coming; now may my heart sever From thee and from heaven for ever and ever, If I live, and that chieftain escape from the slaughter, My my name be a hissing, a curse, and a laughter! And his bosom heaved proudly against his iron mailing; But still the sweet maiden sat weeping and wailing. May Cameron, May Cameron, all silent and weeping, I leave thee, and fly, for the grain lacketh reaping; Nith and Annan are here; but the Tweed, wide and deeper, Lets the Lord’s sickle rust, and has not sent a reaper. Is this thy bride-garment? Oh woman, vain woman! Thinkest thou I shall turn me from this evil omen; This shroud, or the desart’s brown sod shall me cover.— She shrieked, and her white arms she would round her lover. Yestreen, sick of heart, and mine eyes dim with weeping, I lay on my couch atween waking and sleeping, And there came a light in, for the moon of De cember Was down, and the glory-flood filled all my chamber; And my father’s voice came, saying, 'sleepest thou my daughter, When thy loved one goes down as a lamb to the slaughter.’ I awoke, and I shaped my bride garment, and nearer She grew to his breast, and clasped dearer and dearer. May Cameron, he says, and his darkened brow brightens, Like heaven’s deep hollow when it thunders and lightens, This body’s but dust, and the free soaring spirit, Must deserve the bright home it is doomed to in herit; Evil dreams I dread not, and dark omens a bounding, Leave my heart when the trumpet of Scotland is sounding, Whither blythe as a bridegroom, or bloody and shrouded, Like my father’s, my fame shall be clear and unclouded.’
Who, standing on this rural spot, With groves above, and fields a round, Would, pausing, e’er indulge the thought, That armies thronged the lower ground; Or image neighing steed, or fear That trump or drum salute his ear; Or think this leafy screen en folded, A being of as tragic fate, As lovely, and unfortu nate, As Nature ever moulded! Traced like a map; the landscape lies In cultured beauty stretching wide; There Pentland’s green acclivi ties; There Ocean, with its azure tide; There Arthur’s Seat; and gleaming thro Thy southern wing, Dunedin blue! While, in the orient, Lammer’s daughters, A distant giant range are seen, North Berwick Law, with cone of green, And Bass amid the waters. Wrapt in the mantle of her wo, Here agonized Mary stood, And saw contending hosts be low, Opposing, meet in deadly feud; With hilt to hilt, and hand to hand, The children of one mother land For battle come. The banners flaunted Amid Carberry’s beechen grove; And kinsmen, braving kinsmen, strove Undaunting, and un daunted. Silent the queen in sorrow stood, When Bothwell, starting forward, said, “ The cause is mine—a nation’s blood, Go, tell yon chiefs, should:not be shed; Go, bid the bravest heart ad vance In single fight, to: measure lance With me, who: wait prepared to meet him!” — “ Fly!— Bothwell, fly!— it shall not be.”— She wept—she sobbed—on bended knee Fair Mary did en treat him. “ I go,” he sighed— “ the war is mine, A Nero could not injure thee;— My lot on earth is sealed, but thine Shall long and bright and happy be!— This last. farewell—this struggle o’er, We ne’er shall see each other more — Now loose thy hold! poor broken- hearted —” She faints—she falls—Upon his roan The bridle reins in haste are thrown.— The pilgrim hath de parted. Know ye the tenor of his fate?— A fugitive among his own; Disguised—deserted—deso late — A weed on Niagara thrown; A Cain among the sons of men; A pirate on the ocean; then, A Scandinavian captive fet tered To die amid the dungeon gloom : If earthly chance, or heavenly doom Is dark :— but so it mat tered. Daughter of Scotland! beauti ful, Beyond what falls to human lot, Thy breathing features rendered dull, The visions of a poet’s thought. Thy voice was music on the deep, When winds are hushed, and waves a sleep, In mould and mind by far ex celling, Or Cleopatra on the wave Of Cydnus vanquishing the brave, Or Troy’s replendent Helen! Thy very sun in clouds a rose, Delightful flower of Holy rood! Thy span was tempest-fraught, thy woes Should make thee pitied by the good. Poor Mary! an untimely tomb Was thine, with prison ease of gloom, A crown, and rebel crowds beneath thee, A lofty fate—a lowly fall! Thou wert a woman, and let all Thy faults be buried with thee!
Behold, already from the southern sky, While rapidly the hue of day de clines — Down on a peaceful world, with golden eye, O’er a white cloud the star of evening shines. How silently the beams of crimson light, Decaying, leave the oak’s umbrageous pride. How silently the mantle of the night, Outspread, is deepening on yon mountain side. Who e’er would think, whose peace-enraptur’d eye Broods on the gloom of this o’erreaching wood, That battle swept with rustling garments by, And dying groans disturbed its soli tude! Yes! ’mid these fields the standard was un furl’d, And serried spears were glittering in the sun; Loud neighed the war-steeds, and the west wind curl’d Locks, that were bloody ere the fight was done! And ’neath the very turf on which ye tread, All bright with bloom, the bones uncoffin’d lie, Of such as, bent upon heroic deed, Were by opposing weapons doomed to die. Yes! many a mother’s pride, and father’s joy, Here, by disastrous fate, from earth was swept; And, while they marvell’d what delayed their boy, On each cold grave her dews pale Evening wept. And from these vallies many a maiden fair Look’d—languished for the youth belov’d in vain; Till hope, long baffled, yielded to des pair, And welcome death relieved the heart from pain. And yon small streamlet, limpid now and clear, ’Mid woven wild flowers winding on its way Thro’ waste and trodden paths, with slaughter drear, Ran dark and bloody thro’ the livelong day. * Long centuries have circled round since then; And they, who fell, or triumph’d on that day, Alike are hid in death’s unfathom’d den, Melted from sight; and mouldered into clay! Victors and vanquish’d—both are vanish’d now! Like doom hath swept pursuers and pur sued; Above their bones hath pass’d the vernal plow, Or cypress shades their church-yard soli tude. Yes! gallant spirits, that have proudly thought To earn the meed of everlasting fame, Have pass’d unhonour’d by the prize they sought, Nor left behind one vestige in a name! Oh! would that Man would kneel at Wisdom’s shrine, And Truth aside the shades of Error rend; That Sin would list “ the still small voice” di vine, And thoughtless hearts regard their latter end! The sheep-bell’s tinkle on the breezes borne, With Music’s dying strain, salutes the ear; And, save the rustle of the ripening corn, No other sounds can aw’d Attention hear. What see’st thou now, resplendent Evening Star? Nought but the quiet woods, and darkened stream; The shadowy azure mountain-tops a far, And clouds yet bright with day’s departing beam. Peaceful and silent, Pinkie’s turrets peer Above the summits of the twilight grove; And History’s tongue alone records that here The war-cry sounded, and the mighty strove. Here may the Moralist, at even tide, Slow-pacing, thoughtful, o’er the quiet lawn Regret the weaknesses of human pride, And sigh that men should be the foes of man!
Let Fortune frown; let Sorrow reign; Thou, ever smiling, meet’st my sight; Thy bosom’s sunshine can dis dain To yield its empire to the night. Of change thy mind no shadow knows, Thou art superior to its sway; Mild as the dawn, when orient glows, And tranquil as the eve of day. Without thy smile to gild the scene, And bid the shades of sorrow flee, Life had a rayless vision been, And earth a wilderness to me!— What more than thee could passion seek?— In vernal softness ever fair, There is a lustre on thy cheek To bless the eye that gazes there : And thou hast that which charms no less, A link ’tween heaven and earth be low, A heart that melts in tender ness; At every tale and tone of wo! I would to heaven thou could’st for get, There e’er was such as me on earth, I would to heaven we ne’er had met, If only grief reward thy worth : Oh! often, it hath pained my heart, Desponding with its load of care, To think in it thou bor’st a part, And never changed, and still would’st bear : Like some benign, supernal power, To cheer my bosom by its beams, For ever, on my lonely hour, The lustre of thy spirit gleams; For ever, in my evening walk My footsteps undirected stray, To where, in fondly whispered talk, We oft have lived the eve a way! The eglantine perfumes the air, The hawthorn blossoms on the spot; I think of thee—who art not there; I listen—but I hear thee not; I pass my hand across my brow, And muse on days that we have seen, Contrasting the unhappy now, With all the raptures that have been! I turn me to the happy years, When first our hearts together clung; When ardent hope o’ermastered fears, And love was warm, and life was young : I turn me to the glowing scenes, It was our happy lot to share;— A lapse of darkness inter venes, Triumphant o’er the joys that were : But still, upon my mind, they rise In autumn sweetness, rich and warm, As when they first did bless mine eyes; As when they first my heart did charm! Oh! think upon the lovely nights — For we have roamed on many such; Oh! think upon our lost de lights, And do not deem a tear too much! When, thro’ the heavens, the cloudless moon, Careering, cleaves the pathless sky, Around thee gaze, and think how soon The summer of the soul can fly! How soon, before unwelcome truth, The rapturous dreams of hope can fade; How fast the visions of our youth, Sink from the sunshine to the shade! Is happiness the aim of man, The end, and object of his care? How doth he waste his little span, On empty trifles, light as air! His are the selfish aims of life; For these he sacrifices rest; His years are an eternal strife, ’Tween promised joy, and hope un blest. Oh! could he list to Wisdom’s tongue, And give the reins to Nature’s hands, And let his heart be ever young, To sink, or swell, as she com mands : Then, then a happier, nobler race Would tread the weary walks of earth; And Vice would shrink from Virtue’s face, And Wealth subservient be to Worth. My time below has not been much; But I have witnessed storm and shine, And never tasted blessings such As those my heart hath shared with thine. And thou, in proud fideli ty, Hast stood my beacon through the night, And shed, athwart the moonless sea, Thy faithful and unfailing light : And, when the waves of error drove My bark upon the deep to roam, Thou ever wert the sheltering cove To bid the wanderer welcome home. And since the charm will never break Which bound, and binds my heart to thine, If grief and joy our portion make, Oh! be the sorrows only mine! For thine a constancy hath been, Which could the shafts of wo en dure; In doubt that ever stood. se rene, In trial and temptation pure. Tho’ many a change, since first we met, Hath, frowning, come to mar my lot, Thou wert too noble to for get, And too well loved to be for got. And, though no earthly recom pense To thy benignant heart be given, Thou hast thy treasure far from hence, And thy reward awaits in heaven!
Keep thou thy native white Simplici ty; Who would that seldom setting smile dis place? Who would not love the blushes of that face, Which speak so well thy feelings pure and free? Thus ever look—and, as thou look’st, so be; Preserve thy nature’s sweet unconscious grace, Still bloom, as no, within this true em brace, Dearer than all the pride of art to me.— —Within its gay parterre, yon splendid Rose May dazzle the sophisticated eye; But where the modest Honey-suckle blows, The early Bee is ever seen to fly — He finds its simple leaves a sweet en close, Which art oft spoils—but never can sup ply.
Loud laugh’d the Soldier; when the Reeve, who now In sullen silent guise had sitten long, With doubtful eye, bent head and moody brow, The whiles the glee and laughter waxed strong, As if it gaul’d him sorely, seeing how Thus ladies gent were treated with such wrong, With accents rather low, and somewhat hoarse, Began, in gentle phrases, his dis course. Ah! Sirs, quoth he, were I to tell a tale For every lying legend ye have told, Invented, at a gentle sex to rail, By those whose heads are hot and hearts are cold, Believe, my store of praise would never fail, Tho’ I should parable till I were old; But this that I am going to re late Shall serve for many, sith it is so great. Of woman’s love, which is so hard to woo, When woo’d, how strong, full many proofs there be, And how immutable and fearless too — “ My love, thro’ all the world I’ll follow thee,” So Juliet says——; the bird that cries “ cuc koo,” His small mate followeth thus from tree to tree, From bough to bough—nay e’en from spray to spray,— Still restless, thro’ the merry hours of May. And while our Love hath nurture, to en dure And burn, like radiant beacon, seen a far, Thro’ untried seas a streaming Cyno sure, At once our Matin and our Vesper star, No marvel it abideth strong and sure, Amid the turmoils of this worldly war, A constant pilot, and a guiding light, Thro’ storms by day, and rocks and shoals by night. But when, to feed the fire, it once is seen That fit material doth not much a bound, Or that no fuel, save or damp or green, Or else cross-grain’d or knotty, can be found, And the flame waxeth rather thin and mean, And yieldeth an uneasy, crackling sound, Flickers, looks blue,—looks red—or waves a bout, Now very smoky, and now nearly out; Then, mid the storms of ill-contrasted temper, Where neither hath a tittle of sub mission, This semper idem, that eadem semper, For ever crossing, always in at trition, (‘Twould puzzle metaphysic Kant, or Kempfer, To bring about a moment’s coa lition,) Then, that such souls as these should still love on, That is a miracle for Love a lone! It springeth like that low and unseen Rose That on the mountain summit dares to grow, Where Autumn hardly thaws the ling’ring snows, And storms unheard, and unknown whirlwinds blow; There, where the weary, journeying clouds repose, And the moon climbs, with long ascent and slow, And fays and lesser spirits play at even, Like harmless lightning in a summer’s heaven. ’Tis like the Petrel that the sailor eyes With dread,—o’er treach’rous seas condemn’d to roam,— That still is met beneath the stormiest skies, And on the desert waters hath its home; Above the curling billow still it flies, And sleeps well cradled in the fleecy foam, Lull’d by the discord of the whistling squall, And rock’d to rest on hills that rise and fall. And this is none of your glib para doxes, That only serve the wags for mysti fying, As conj’rors do with double-bottom’d boxes — Behold a couple for each other dying, (Unless the author of the hist’ry mocks us ) Who all their lives in quarrel had been frying. Their matrimonial pudding was of Batter, With scarce a plumb to sweeten it;— no matter.— Oh! miracle! (—a greater can there be —?) To see how Love can shed his holiest balm, Within a circle none dares walk but he —; Where all are sick, fresh and without a qualm; So underneath the depths of the wild sea, Ev’n in the loudest storms,— there is a calm, But truce to hopes—my story must be sped, John met with Joan, lov’d, woo’d, and they were wed. One small objection, either they o’er passed, Or else despised, when it was brought in view; He was an alkali, and she an acid, And this, when ’twas too late, they found too true, The longer still the more, they effer vesced, As more confirmed, by time, their tempers grew,— A sort of fizzing, sputtering comm union, Sir Humphrey Davy calls “ a chemic union.” Like that small, wooden pair that stand, so sly, To tell us what the weather is a bout, Where Gammer comes and curtsies, when ’tis dry, And Gaffer, when it rains, doth make his lout, So sometimes they might have a clearish sky, But ’twas when he was in, and she was out;— As for the couple that arrange the weather, God knows, they never are at home to gether. So, long, this loving, most unhappy pair Liv’d, like a brace of angry adders fang’d, So piteous of each others’ woes they were, One could have borne to see the other hang’d, (Altho’ that sight were worse than death to bear ) Each for the others’ sake!— —as they ha rangued, One day, upon the sorrows of their yoke, John, in a happy hour, resolv’d and spoke. “ Sweet Joan, thou know’st that I would die for thee, “ And well I know that thou for me would’st die.” And here he twinkled, pitiful to see;— Joan gave a sort of “ heigh!”—’twas scarce a sigh, “ But wast thou gone, what maid would look on me, “ With grief an’ labour worn, and crabb’d and dry, “ But thou, dear Joan, when faithful John hath died, “ May’st have a chance again to be a bride.” “ And, so my loving Joan, my dear—dear, Cony, “ Since there is nothing but a choice of ill, “ Since I cannot afford thee ali mony, “ And would be loath by quarrelling to kill, “ (Thou know’st my love, my heart was never stoney ) “ Oh! come and see me die—for die I will — “ Die for the love of thee, my darling, die,— “ Yes;— quickly in the horsepond will I lie.” “ Let not the bitter drops, my gentle Joan, “ Bedim the lustre of thy cheek and eye, “ For since the springtime of our life is flown, “ And winter comes, and summer passeth bye, “ Beneath the waters, peaceful and a lone, “ E’en like the torpid swallow, will I lie, “ The cutting show’r unfelt—the storm un heard, “ And men shall say that John—hath disap pear’d.” “ They ask—where goeth he that disap pears? “ But who can tell where he migra ted? “ Hold but thy tongue, my Joan, and dry thy tears,— “ For trust me, Sweet, most vainly they are shed; “ How can they reach a heart that’s proof to fears, “ In Love’s strong fortress, shut and shel tered? “ What boots that haildrops down the chimney come, “ Hiss on the hearth, or patter round the room?— In short, John’s flights of eloquence re fined, Joan’s answ’ring eloguence—by nature taught her, I could not copy, were I in the mind; Nor can I tell you if her helpmate caught her, Less contradictiously, than wont, io dine Suffices it to say, they reach’d the water, Together—tho’ not arm in arm, I think,— But there they were, and stood upon the brink. John hover’d on the brink, in silent mood, And look’d and sigh d, and sigh’d and look’d a gain, And gaz’d with wistful visage on, the flood, While, doubtfully, as pitying his pain, Joan, with her apron at her eyelid, stood; At last, he seem’d to come into the vein, And turn’d, as if to take a final kiss, Before he plunged into the brown a byss. But still a kind of look—not that of fear, Nor hope—play’d round his mouth, and cheek, and chin; His eye chang’d not; and, softly in her ear, He whisper’d Joan— “ Ah, me! self-murder’s sin — Could’st thou not take a little frisk, my dear, As if in play, and gently push me in; Nay, take a longer run—further, my life — There now—now stoutly push me, dearest wife.” O Couple! e’en in death affectio nate, Not Arria and her Pœtus are before ye! Joan, fearful of the welfare of her mate, Resolving that his soul should be in glo ry, And rest, at least, when in another state, In love and strong affection (saith the sto ry ), Drew back from him, some portion, not a little, Obeying her dear husband to a tittle; Then ran, with Amazonian reso lution : But whether John had only half con sented, Or fear was really in his consti tution, Or in the very nick he had re pented; Or whether Fate herself was in con fusion, Or Fortune took a whim, or Chance re lented — How ’twas, I cannot tell you, for my life, But John a sort of—dodg’d;— in splash’d his wife. With open mouth, and saucer staring eyes, John for a second stood like any stone, Then lifted up his hands, in wild sur prise — “ For love of me didst thou go in, dear Joan, Or did’st thou slip thy foot?— what signi fies? There are no slips; and since ’tis done, ’tis done; Folks only can remark, since thou art gone, ’Tis Joan hath disappear’d, instead of John.” “ If there be any scandal, John shall bear it — Bear it he must, so even let it fall.” Then (after some half hour), that all might hear it, “ I’ve lost my Joan—help!” John began to bawl; And in a trice, his cause of grief to share it, Came trooping young and old, and great and small; They dragg’d the piece of water, it is said, And so Joan was not lost, but she was— dead. She died—nor did her John long time sur vive, Tho’ folks have wonder’d what should John des troy; Some said that with his grief he could not strive, Whilst others whisper’d that he died of joy; Some say the juice which, when she was a live, They took to soothe their woes, was his an noy; But both are gone—nor is a stone sup plied, To teach how this good couple liv’d and died.
Itrust, O gentle reader, you’ll ex cuse A rhyming novice, if he dare re hearse The promptings of a sad, a sorry muse, As sorrow is the subject of his verse; And that your readership will not a buse A style allowed to be both sweet and terse, Nor if in anger will resentment fire on A metre now immortalized by Byron. Although some gentlemen decry Don Juan,* And shun him as a most indecent fellow, I still believe that of our poems, few, one Will find in harmony so rich and mellow; Heavens! how unlike the riff-raff cockney crew, one Finds praised in Scotch review the blue and yellow,† Give me the poet who can fire your soul, To drain your eye-lid or to drain your bowl. And such art thou, Don Juan, Corsair, Childe, Whichever title please thy godlike soul, Thou who can’st call up stormy passions, wild As the bleak winds, which howl around the pole, Or the warm tear upon the cheek, as mild As when light zephyrs o’er sweet violets roll, And can at times induce us to be friskey, Like our kind sweethearts, or our native whiskey. “ Yet mark one caution, e’er thy next review Spread its light wings of saffron and of blue.” Hold! there’s another fav’rite of the nine, For whose droll page I long have used to hanker, Whose vein of poetry is quite a mine, As witness his facetious, crazy Banker; Long may it live to build the lofty line, To Constable’s poor rogues a thorn and canker, I’m sure you know the gentleman I mean, Wastle, himself a moving Maga zine. On these two poets then I lay the blame, Lord Byron and Will Wastle, if that I, Should in my story prove too dull or tame, And from the field be forced to turn or fly; For they have earned so vast, so fair a fame, That it would be a pity not to try And lay up for myself some shreds of glory, The preface thus despatch’d—now to my story. It happen’d once, some fifty years a go, That in the town of Bantry lived a man Named Patrick Blake, an oily, round-faced beau, A steady worshipper of pipe and can; Upon his nose there shone that ready glow, That seems as if ’twould always need a fan; In short he was a man, who, jest a part, Would guzzle ale and smoke with all his heart. And better liquor was it than the slops, (Receipts for which sage Accum’s* book con tains ) Which fill our stomachs from the druggist’s shops, With Gentian, Quassia, and outlandish grains; In Pat’s time beer was made of malt and hops, And brewers were contented with fair gains; I wonder much the faculty don’t buy sense, And furnish men who physic with a li cence. In times we speak of whiskey too was made, They call’d Potheen, and sold so very cheap, So sweet and wholesome, none were much a fraid, Of head or purse to drink themselves a sleep, Or raise it to the lips of modest maid, ’Twas mild as dew-drops that the roses weep, But such stuff now will give a man the colic, ’Tis so bedamned with acid vitri olic. The ale was like the Edinburgh ale At Johnnie Dowie’s† or the High-street Amos, “ Oh Dowie’s ale thou art the thing Gars mak us crack, gars mak us sing, And frae us a’ our cares to fling Awa wi’ anger.” When not too fresh or altogether stale, But just a month in bottle, ’tis so famous, That we’d prefer it to the musca tel Of Gallic plains, no epicure would blame us, But straightway purchase dozens for his throttle, Could he but taste the drainings of a bottle. But to return—Poor Paddy had a wife, The very plague and torment of his soul, The harbinger of battle and of strife, And, what was worse, the filcher of his bowl; In truth he led a very sorry life, And often to the “ mountain daisy ”* stole Where freed from Beck, the gayest of the gay, He’d drain his mug, and puff the hours a way. Delightful herb! Tobacco, lord of plants, How grateful is thy fragrance to the soul! Who harbours care, or true enjoyment wants, When round his head thy airy currents roll; When circling wreath the ascending wreath sup plants, Till every nook is filled and every hole; While through the dark the tiny spark will rise, Like fairy meteor in its cloudy skies? But darkness reigned here : the brilliant moon Threw lovely lustre o’er the scene to- night, The climbing woodbine round the lattice strewn Reflected back its silvery rays of light; Oh! ’twas so clear, so chastened, not at noon Could forms appear more purely or more bright : And there was Paddy gazing from wi thin The cozy parlour of a country inn — The “ mountain daisy ” —’twas a far-fam’d spot, And nature’s worshippers regard it still; Though levell’d now the jasmine and the cot, There still remain the clear and bubbling rill, And high o’ertopping mountains—’twas a grot, The best of grottos, where a man may fill His scrip with cheese, his belly with good ale, His soul with glee from joke, or song, or tale. There was a pretty lawn before the door, Where many a sport and active feat was tried, Where oft the pipe or fiddle brought a score Of tight-bound maidens, widow, wife, or bride, To seek the dance or gypsy’s mystic lore, Or willing kiss to true love ne’er de nied; And oft, in emulation on the green, Some youthful buffer’s sinewy arms was seen To fling the thump—like him of mighty powers, The late Sir Daniel—terror of the ring, Still mourned by Erin, and embalmed with flowers Of sweetest poesy, that fragrance fling Around his honour’d tomb—while the swift hours, With thrilling harmony on noiseless wing, Still chant his deeds, set forth by him we’re proud in, The soft, the sweet, the soul-subduing Dowden.* On Sunday morning, ’twas the rendez vous Of such as, loosed from city toil and dust, Seek the green fields in preference to the pew, To air their buttons after six days rust, With baskets cramm’d, in some the savoury stew, In others ham—in others——; but I must Not waste my paper on such flimsy rhyme, I’ll give enough of that some other time. Here sometimes clubs of ancient maidens chose, Sitting beneath some widely-spreading oak, To sip the old maid’s beverage—God knows Their real pleasure was the biting joke, The daily scandal—no one can sup pose How maids of fifty love such filth to croak; But blame them not, they’re curious, and they trade in Such ware as drove dame Eve from out of E den. There was a club of gentlemen be side, Who once a week upon a Monday met, To read, mark, learn, and readily de cide On all the news contained in the Ga zette, The only paper which the town sup plied; And pleasant ’twas to hear th’ important set, Discuss in style grave, comic, or i ronical, The stale contents of that well handled chronicle. But come, I’ve done this troublesome di gression, I promise to go on quite smack and smooth; But being now a rhymer by pro fession, I think it would appear, at least, un couth, To put at once my readers in pos session Of this my tale—I cannot say, in sooth, How much I reverence this sort of rambling, ’Tis just as sweet as comfits got by scambling. But where is Paddy all this tedious while We’re handling folly with a ready pen? Just where we left him, trying to be guile The minutes till the cuckoo-clock strike ten; That was the wished-for happy moment, when His old companion Daniel, with a smile Of broad-faced humour, when his toil was done, Came to partake of pipe, of ale, and fun. I’ve brought my readers just thro’ verses twenty, Which number makes a very good be ginning, And if with patience bless’d, they shall have plenty Of good advice against that kind of sinning By some call’d tippling—let it con tent ye, Good readers, if I here decline the spinning Out of a sermon—but it is in tended To speak upon the matter e’er I’ve ended. But I can vouch, that Daniel and his friend Were much addicted to that style of going, And many a wintry evening did they spend, While round the house the roaring wind was blowing, Not minding whether the next blast would send The roof upon their heads—no! they were growing More happy as the tempest grew more strong, Roaring the thunder down with boisterous song. In summer ’twas the same—the sultry eve Still saw them at the “ daisy ”—with this change, That in hot weather they took care to leave The parlour for the meadows cooler range. O! Many a goodly epicure would grieve To think of dogs so happy—I’ll ar range Something like this—I wish that friends who read, May taste their pleasures and adopt their creed. Well! who is Daniel? will be asked by such As must feel anxious in our hero’s fate, I’ll introduce him soon—but I fear much My pen has waddled sadly in its gait, And jostled subjects that it need not touch; While for the story folks impatient wait; I’m sorry for it—but it is my plan to Give honest Dan the whole of Second Canto.
Iwandered forth when all men lay sleeping, And I heard a sweet voice wailing and weeping, The voice of a babe, and the wail of women, And ever there came a faint low screaming; And after the screaming, a low, low moaning, All adown by the burn-bank, in the green loaning, I went, and by the moonlight, I found A beauteous dame weeping low on the ground. The beauteous dame was sobbing and weeping, And at her breast lay a sweet babe sleeping, And by her side was a fair-haired child, With dark eyes flushed with weeping, and wild And troubled he held by his mother, and spake, “ Oh mither, when will my father a wake;” And there lay a man smitten low to the ground, The blood gushing forth from a bosom wound. And by his side lay a broken sword, And by his side lay the open’d ‘ Word;’ His palms were spread, and his head was bare, His knees were bent—he had knelt in prayer; But brief was his prayer, for the flowers where he knelt Had risen all wet, with his life’s blood spilt;— And the smoke of powder smelled fresh a round : And a steed’s hoof prints were in the ground. She saw me, but she heeded me not; As a flower she sat that had grown on the spot; But ever she knelt o’er the murdered man, And sobbed afresh, and the loosed tears ran — Even low as she knelt, there came a rush Like a fiery wind, over river and bush, And amid the wind and in lightning speed, A bright Rider came, on a brighter steed — “ Woe! woe! woe!” he called, and there came To his hand, as he spake, a sword of flame;— He smote the air, and he smote the ground, Warm blood, as a rivulet, leapt up from the wound, Shriek followed on shriek, loud, fearful, and fast, And filled all the track where this dread one passed; And tumult and terrible outcry there came, As a sacked city yields when it stoops to the flame; And a shrill low voice came running a broad, “ Come, mortal man, come, and be judged by God.” And the dead man turned unto heaven his face, Stretched his hands, and smiled in the light of grace.
‘ And will ye forsake the balmy, free air, The fresh face of heaven, so golden and fair, The mountain glen, and the silver brook, And nature’s free bountith and open book, To sit and worship our God with a groan, Hemmed in with dead timber and shapen stone? Away—away—for it never can be, The green earth and heaven’s blue vault for me - Woe! woe! to the time when to the heath- bell The seed of the Covenant sing their fare well, And leave the mount written with martyr story, The sun beaming bright in his bridegroom glory; And leave the green birks, and the lang flowering broom, The breath of the woodland steeped rich in per fume; And barter our life’s sweetest flower for the bran, The glory of God for the folly of man.
Arise, ye slain saints, from the moor and the flood, Arise and rejoice in your garments of blood; Mark Wilson, awaken, with harp and sweet strain, Thou Bard of the light whom stern Bonshaw has slain; Rejoice where ye sleep, neath your covering of flowers, The scarf of brown heath and the shade of green bowers; Gather round, lo! and number your foes as they lie, With their face to the earth and their back to the sky. This morning they came with their brass trumpets braying; Their gold pennons flaunting, their war horses neighing; They came and they found us—the brand and the spear Soon emptied their saddles and sobered their cheer; They came and they sounded—their trumpet and drum Now give a mute silence, their shouters are dumb; The chariot is smote, and the charioteer sleeping And death his dark watch o’er their captains is keeping, Oh! who wrought this wonder?— men ask me—this work Is not of man’s hand for the covenant kirk; Few—few—were the saints ’neath their banners ar raying, Weak, hungry, and faint, nor grown mighty in slaying — And strong, fierce, and furious, and thirsting and fain Of our blood—as the dust of the summer for rain — Came our foes—but the firm ground beneath their feet turned Into moss and quagmire—above their heads burned Heaven’s hot and swift fires—the sweet wind to-day. Had the power for to blast, and to smite, and to slay. Then laud not yourselves, nor put faith and firm trust In sharp steel and strong sinews, but stoop in the dust And humble your hearts—all your witnessing hands Hold in bloody sign up, you fulfilled His com mands;— Now arise! see the ways cumbered with spoil, Lo! gather—divide the reward of your toil; But leave these dumb Dagons to rot on the sward They defiled—then come, sing a new song of the Word.
Istood and gazed—from Dalswinton wood To Criffel’s green mountain and Solway flood Was quiet and joyous. The merry loud horn Called the mirthsome reapers in bands to the corn; The plaided swain, with his dogs, was seen Looking down on the vale from the mountain green; The lark with her note, now lowne, now loud, The blue heaven breasted through the white cloud, Round a smiling maid, white as winter snowing, The Nith clasped its army, and went singing and flowing — Yet all the green valley, so lovely and broad, Lay in black-nature, nor breathed of a God. And yet it was sweet, as the rising sun shone, To stand and look this fair land u pon, The stream kissed my feet, and away to the sea Flew, where the wild sea-fowl went swimming free. In the town the lordly trumpet was blowing, From the hill the meek pipe sent its sweet notes flowing, And a fair damsel sat her brown tresses a- wreathing, And looking of heaven, and perfume breathing, And, stretched at her feet, despairing and sighing, Lay a youth on the grass, like a creature dying. But mocked was the Preacher, and scorned was the Word, Green Nithsdale, I yield thee to gunshot and sword. And yet, green valley, though thou art sunk dark, And deep as the waters that flowed round the ark; Though none of thy flocks, from the Nith to the Scaur, Wear Calvin’s choice keel or the Covenant’s tar — Come, shear thy bright love-locks, and bow thy head low, And fold thy white arms o’er thy bosom of snow, And kneel, till the summer pass. with its sweet flowers,— And kneel, till the autumn go with her gold bowers,— And kneel, till rough winter grows weary with flinging Her snows upon thee, and the lily is springing, And fill the green land with thy woe and com plaining; And let thine eyes drop like two summer clouds raining — And ye may have hope, in the dread dooms-day morning, To be snatched as a brand from the sacrifice burning. But if ye kneel not, nor in blood-tears make moan, And harden your heart like the steel and the stone, Oh! then, lovely Nithsdale—even as I now cast My shrunk hand to heaven, thy doom shall be passed; Through thy best blood the war horse shall snort and ca reer — Thy breast shall be gored with the brand and the spear — Thy bonnie love-locks shall be ragged and reft — The babe at thy bosom be cloven and cleft; From Queensberrie’s mountain to Criffel be low, Nought shall live but the blood-footed hawk and the crow! Farewell thou doomed Nithsdale—in sin and a sleep — Lie still—and awaken to wail and to weep. I tried much to bless thee, fair Nithsdale, there came Nought but curses to lay on thy fate and thy fame! Yet still do I mind—for the follies of youth Mix their meteor gleams with the sunshine of truth — A fair one, and some blessed moments; a boon, Gleaming down the green mountain gazed on us the moon, The kisses and vows were unnumbered and sweet, And the flower at our side, and the stream at our feet Seemed to swell and to flow so divinely.—Oh! never, Thou lovely green land, and thou fair flowing river, Can man gaze upon you and curse you. In vain Doth he make his heart hard.—So I bless you a gain.
Ye green glens of Nithsdale, ye brown dales of Dryfe, Ye green banks of Annandale, busk for the strife, Come fix firm the helmet, and sharpen the brand, The Kirk cannot take sloven work from your hand. Ye Kyle men, ye Carrick men, men of Glen luce, Who conquered with Wallace, and triumphed with Bruce, A brighter cause now calls your hands to the hilt, A Covenant broken, and pious blood spilt. Tis not for your flocks—for the wealth of your home, Or your chaste lovely daughters, the spoiler is come, Then empty the quiver, and strive till the sword Works the good work full surely, the work of the Word. May him, whose cold blood sleeps like water, to hear The loud cry of righteousness sound in his ear; May no maid call him love, no good man call him brother, And the son of his heart prove the son of a nother. Come pluck up your banner, the green pleasant land Of the west calls the chosen-with Bible and brand, The spoiler a feast ’mongst the mountains has made, I have blessed it, come carve it with bayonet and blade.
O Banner! fair Banner! a century of woe Has flowed on thy people since thou wert laid low; Hewn down by the godless, and sullied and shorn, Defiled with base blood, and all trodden and torn! Thou wert lost, and John Balfour’s bright steel-blade in vain. Shed their best blood as fast as moist April sheds rain — Young, fierce, gallant Hackstoun, the river in flood Sent rejoicing to sea with a tribute of blood; And Gideon Macrabin, with hible and brand, Quoted Scripture, as Amelk fell ’neath his right hand — All in vain, thou fair Banner, for thou wert laid low, And a sport and a prey to the Covenant’s foe. Fair Banner! ’gainst thee bloody Claver’se came hewing His road through our helms, and cur glory sub duing; And Nithsdale Dalzell—his fierce deeds to re quite, On his house darkest ruin descended like night Came spurring and full on the lap of our war, Disastrous shot down like an ominous star. And Allan Dalzell—may his name to all time Stand accurs’d, and be with nought nobler than rhyme — Smote thee down, thou fair Banner, all rudely, and left Thee defiled, and the skull of the bannerman cleft. Fair Banner, fair Banner, a century of woe Has flowed on thy people since thou wert laid low. And now, lovely Banner! led captive and placed, ’Mid the spoils of the scoffer, and scorned and dis graced, And hung with the helm and the glaive on the wall, ’Mongst idolatrous figures to wave in the hall, Where the lips, wet with wine, jested with thee pro fane, And the minstrel, more graceless, mixed thee with his strain, Till the might and the pride of thy conqueror fell, And the owl sat and whoop’d in the halls of Dal zell. O thou holy Banner! in weeping and wail Let me mourn thy soiled glory, and finish my tale. And yet, lovely Banner! thus torn from the brave; And disgraced by the graceless, and sold by the slave, And hung o’er a hostel, where rich ruddy wine, And the soul-cheering beverage of barley di vine, Floated glorious, and sent such a smoke—in his flight The lark stayed in air, and sung, drunk with de light. Does this lessen thy lustre? or tarnish thy glory? Diminish thy fame, and traduce thee in story? Oh, no, beauteous Banner! loosed free on the beam, By the hand of the chosen, long, long shalt thou stream! And the damsel dark-eyed, and the Covenant swain, Shall bless thee, and of dread Bothwell a gain.
Blue is the vault of heaven—the gems, The thousand flaming dia dems, That deck the midnight throne of June, Are glittering silently—the moon, To silver o’er the eastern wave, Leaves not her interlunar cave — All, all is still—no wandering breeze Disturbs the air, or stirs the trees; The wings of silence over spread Alike the living and the dead, And darkness o’er the land and sea Hangs down her shadows gloomi ly. Yes, there are times when thoughts of rest Are banished, and the vacant breast, To meditation prone, in stils A heavier sense of mortal ills; When couches cannot yield re pose; When slumber cannot mantle woes; When o’er the agonized brain Comes Memory, with her busy train Of hopes and visions, cherish’d long — A look—a thought—a word—a song — That conjures up the past, can make A fire, that water cannot slake; A tempest fierce to roar and roll; A wild volcano of the soul : Yea, in a dream, this very night, Hath Recollection held her light, Her flaming torch, above the past, Years fled-—joys vanished—hopes o’er cast — Affections blighted—seasons lost — And earth itself a desart coast! Nor easier do I breathe, though now The chill of night salutes my brow. ’Tis sweet, beneath the catar act To sit, and watch the drizzly rack That reascends, and then re news Its mazy fall in trickling dews; To see the waters flash and foam In darkness, to their central dome, Amid the sable rocks, which frown Like genii o’er the waters brown; To hear them roar, with mighty crash, And onwards rush, and downwards dash, Beneath the hazel trees, that throw Their shadows o’er the chasms be low — ’Tis sweet to gaze upon the sky, And turn a fond and wistful eye Upon the stars of twinkling ray, Upon the lucid milky way, Upon the long, long vistas, through The trackless paths of placid blue — And why? ’Tis Fancy rules the brain, And draws the thoughts from present pain, And leads us to a lonely spot Where Passion’s voice awakens not. Dim hang the shadowy forests round, Their canopies without a sound, Gigantic—towering—shadowy— drear — Along whose paths quick stalking Fear, With indrawn breath all trembling steals, And dreams Destruction at his heels. The lofty elm its giant boughs Of leafy darkness o’er me throws, And at its base I lay me down, Upon the furze of golden brown, Until returning light shall bring My quiet, and the morning spring.
The clouds frown dark upon the sky, And the night wind moans as it rustles by; The stream runs down with a heavy sound, And all is dreary and dull a round. Fitful, between the parted shroud Of the rifted, melancholy cloud, A bright star twinkles, and then is hid Beneath the moving pyra mid. ’Tis a gloomy landscape, and all is still, Save bleat of lamb from the distant hill, Save the watch-dog’s hollow bay on the breeze, And the night-wind tossing the sullen trees, The long weeds hang o’er the massy gate Of the watch-tower, ruined and deso late, Its idle door no menial bars, And with every blast it creaks and jars. Desponding, and dreary, and full of strife, Are the thoughts that brood o’er our human life; The blood runs cold as the hemlocks wave. With ominous sound o’er the lowly grave!
Oh! may these trees be ever green, Perpetual spring en wreathe them, May bloom on every bough be seen, And lovely flowers be neath them! Be fresh each leaf, be strong each form; No biting winds im pair them; And may the red wing of the storm Pass ever by, and spare them! ’Twas here, in boyhood, that I strayed, When not a care mo lested; With her I loved, beneath this shade, On summer eves, I rested. I feel those years revive a gain, So sweet and far de parted — Ah! thoughts like these are worse than vain, They mock the broken- hearted! It is a melancholy scene, To view the woodlands yellow, And Winter’s snow, where late ser ene Waved Autumn’s harvests mellow : But ’tis a more desponding truth, To feel that we must sever From all that gave delight to youth, Despairing, and for ever!, As in a mirror, vanish’d years This well-known view is raising; With lightning glow the past ap pears, As thoughtful I am gazing! May no rude hands this spot de form; No biting winds im pair it; And may the red wing of the storm Pass ever by, and spare it!
Afar from native plain and grove, To smoothe my unforgettful brow, Fair lineaments of her I love! Ye are my only solace now! I cast mine eyes around, and feel That far my steps are doomed to range; But when a glance to thee I steal, I know my heart can never change. As Eastern pilgrim, from the streams Of childhood distant many a mile, Toils through the desart, while his dreams Repose on Mecca all the while; So I, amid the tem pest’s jar, Revert to thee a long ing eye, The loveliest and the bright est star In Retrospection’s glow ing sky. In sorrow I have wandered long, And sown in hope to reap in grief, And found, amid the busy throng, That care is much and pleasure brief. To look upon thy shade a gain, On thee, in all the pride of yore, Awakens visions worse than vain, And dreams that long are past and o’er! It stirs the thoughts of happy years, With silver pace, in silence flown, Beyond the reach of prayer and tears, For ever perished, past, and gone; Before, with sacrilegious strife, The world had ruined simple joy, And all the loveliness of life, Had left the man that ruled the boy. The world is changed—our hearts are changed, Since long ago we met and loved; And hopes are sunk, and joys es tranged, That then in ardent glory moved. The brightest meed that earth be stows, Though yielded now, were nought to me; For proffered worlds, I would not lose A single thought that turns to thee! To see thee once again—to hear The accents of thine angel tongue — The sight—the sounds to memory dear, When hope was warm, and life was young — To sit with thee, as I have sate — To con to thee some touching tale, And mark how lovers’ luckless fate Could o’er thy tender heart pre vail — To roam with thee the flowery glade, What time the Evening Star on high Gleamed o’er the twilight forest’s shade, And caught thy rapture-beaming eye — It may not be—it may not be; Yet shall it sooth this cheerless scene, Beloved shade! to dote on thee, And all the pleasures that have been!
The beautiful, the powerful, and the proud, The many and the mighty, yield to Time; Time that, with measured pace and noiseless wing, Glides on and on—the ruler of the world. With what a glory the refulgent sun, Far from the crimson portals of the west, Sends back his parting radiance; round and round Stupendous walls encompass me, and throw The ebon outlines of their shadows down Upon the grassy floor : the eastern pile Receives the chequered darkness of the west, In mimic lattice-work and sable hues. Rich in its mellowness, the sunshine bathes The marble epitaphs of them who died Before this breathing generation moved, Or wantoned in the bright eye of the sun. The sad and sombre trophies of the tomb; The tablet grey, with mimic roses bound; The angled bones, the sand-glass, and the scythe; These, and the stone-carved cherubs, that impend With hovering wing, and eyes of fixedness, Gleam down the ranges of the backward aisle, Dull, ’mid the crimson of prophetic light. This is a men and a scene to hold Discourse, and purifying monologue, Before the silent spirit of old times! The gilly-flowers, upon the broken arch, And from the time-worn crevices, look down, Blooming, where all is desolate. With leaf Clustering and dark, and light green trails between, The ivy hangs perennial. Yellow-flowered The fresh dandelion shoots her juicy stalks, Amid the thin transparent blades of grass. In rank luxuriancy the nettles spread Behind the massy tablatures of death, Hanging their pendent heads and seedy grains Above the graves of famous men unknown, Whose memories have decayed—whose very bones Have mouldered down to ashes and to earth. The grey and time-worn pillars, toppling o’er, Throw from their lichened pedestals a line Of sombre darkness far, and chequer o’er The floor with shade and sunshine. Hoary walls, Since first ye rose in splendour and in pride— Since first ye frowned in majesty of strength— Since first ye caught the crimson of the morn On western slope, and glittering lattices Of many-coloured brightness, Time hath wrought An awful revolution. Night and morn, The hymn of gratulation and of praise Rung through yon caverned arches; sandalled monks, White with the snows of eld, or warm with life, With cross and crosier, mass and solemn rite, Frail, yet forgiving frailties, sojourned here, When Rome was in her splendour, and obtained— Though Cæsars and though Ciceros were not The rulers of her camps and cabinets— A second empire o’er the minds of men. What art thou now, oh! pile of olden time? The sparrow chatters on thy buttresses Throughout the livelong day, and, sportively, The swallow twitters through thy broken roofs, Fluttering the whiteness of its inner plumes Through shade, and now emerging to the sun. The night owls are thy choristers, and mope Amid the darkling dreariness of night. The twilight-loving bat, with leathern wing, Finds out a crevice for her callow young, Amid dilapidated halls, on high, Beyond the unassisted reach of man; And on the utmost pinnacles, the rook Finds airy dwelling-place and quiet home; Oft, with her voice of dissonance, she calls On Echo, slumbering in the nether vaults— Vaults where the relics of ancestral dust Crumble. When Winter throws his tempests down, The whirling snow-flakes, through the open roof Descending, gather on the tombs beneath; When sweeps the night-gale past, on rapid wing, And sighs amid thy portals desolate, The alders creak, with melancholy sound, The ivy rustles, and the hemlock bends, With locks of darkness, to its very root, Springing above the grassy mounds of those Whose tombs are long since tenantless. But now, With calm and quiet eye, the setting sun Beams mellowness upon the wrecks of Time, Tinges the broken arch with crimson rust, Flames down the gothic aisle, and mantles o’er The tablatures of marble. Beautiful, The ruined altar, and baptismal font— The wall-flower crested pillars, foliage-bound— The shafted oriels, and the ribbed roofs— Labour of circling years and cunning hands. Thy governors have vanished—silence reigns, Save that, beneath, amid the danky vaults, Impervious to the lustre of the day, Is heard, with fitful melancholy sound, The dew-drops frequent plashing—silence reigns, Save that, amid the embowering forest green, With clear melodious throat, the blackbird trills His song—his soft and melancholy song— Dirgelike, and sinking on the moody mind In tones prophetic. Through the trellis green The purpling eve looks dusky; and the clouds, Shorn of their edgework of refulgent gold, Spread whitening o’er the bosom of the sky. Monastic pile! farewell!— not more on thee, Than on the busy highways of the earth, Dwells Solitude. On many a lonely eve My thoughts have brooded on the vacant world, Gazed at it through the microscope of truth, And found it, as the King of Israel found, All Vanity. With ken reverting far, Amid the Eden of departed years, Here Contemplation, from the tones of life Estranged, might treasure many a homily, And view, with unsophisticated eye, The lowly state, and lofty destiny, The pride and insignificance of man.
Owelcome home, my marshal, my col - league true and good, When under brave Napoleon we dabbled long in blood; Who brought you back to Paris in Bour - bon’s royal days? Was it Madame Bonaparte’s man, our own Monsieur De Cazes?* With thee I robbed thro’ Prussia, thro’ Por tugal and Spain; With thee I marched to Russia, and then— marched back a gain; With thee I faced the red-coats awhile at Water loo; And with thee I raised the war-song of jolly† sauve qui peut. I took the oaths to Louis, and now with face of brass, I bawl against the royalists all in the Cham - bre Basse; But you, my lad, were exiled, a mighty cruel thing, For you did nothing surely, but fight against your king. Then drink a health to th’ Emperor, and curse Sir Hudson Lowe;* And decorate with stolen plate your honest - earned cha teau; And merrily, my marshal, we shall the gob - let drain, ’Tis a chalice† that I robbed one day out of a church in Spain. Fill, fill the bumper fairly, ’tis Chambertin,‡ you see The Emperor’s favourite liquor, and chant in pious glee, A song of Monsieur Parny’s,§ Miladi Mor - gan’s bard, And curse the tasteless Bourbons who won’t his muse re ward. Then, with our wigs all perfumed, and our beavers cocked so fierce, We’ll throw a main together, or troll the amorous verse; And I’ll get as drunk as Irishmen, as Irish - men mor bleu, After six-and-thirty tumblersǁ in drinking healths to you.
Of old, in Scottish land, a Sire there lived, Whose toil in youth had stores prepared for age, Who now from care, though scarce from toil rep rieved, With earthly thoughts an easier war could wage, And less of fear or favour felt the edge : His children grown, had sought employment round, As different toils their various tastes en gage, And he, though scarce by need to labour bound, Yet loved to tend his team, and till the fruitful ground. On slope of sunward hill his cot was placed, In cultured holm, ’mid furze-surrounded scene, Where isles of corn were gained from Alpine waste, And ’mid enclosing rocks were pastures seen; Before his door was spread. the daisied green, Where browzed the cottage nurse, his brinded cow, By grandchild led, the furzy knolls be tween, Who sought the spots where sweetest daisies grow, And lesson conned the while, along that mountain’s brow. That wealthy cot of rude-exterior seemed, Its charms the dwellers, not the gazers, found; In eyes romantic scarce befitting deemed, To grace the blooming wilds that laughed a round : And all within to antique modes, was bound; The hearth amid the central floor was placed, Where sire and sons might sit in circle round; And up the spacious vent, with wicker braced, Might school-boy grandchild mark each zenith star that passed. One southward window looked adown the green, Where wont his daughter young her wheel to ply, And view the roses round her casement sheen, Or tulips bright in tidy garden nigh, Whose flowers might Sunday’s ornament sup ply, Or lie, for mark, beside her pastor’s hymn; Here too, when snowy loured December’s sky, She lov’d to see, through window frosted- dim, The blackbirds peck her crumbs, or round her garden skim. To fairy lake was there a streamlet spread, Whose grassy banks were bright with purest green, And here, when June his brightening influence shed, The housewife’s pearly webs were bleaching seen, From seed to cloth that still her care had been; There, too, the maid betrothed might stranger view, In satin snood and kilted kirtle clean, Her linen stores prepares of lilied hue, Pure like her virgin self, the married couch to strew, Apart, on airy knoll, his stacks were seen, Y-thatched with broom, with twisted sedges bound; And garden here was stretched in chequered green, With ranks of leafy trees protected round; And here his leisure hours employment found — To tend the sunny hives, the soil to feed, For various plants to fit the equal ground, To trim the walk, to root the envious weed, Or rill, by sedges choked, in purer stream to lead. Here, too, on Sunday morn, in corner green, Where branching lime her shadowy arches raised, He loved to sit : where through the leafy screen The humming bees, with honeyed blossoms pleased, Like hymn from distant church, innumerous praised. The God to whom his morning prayers were said; And here, at times, from weekly tasks re leased, Around his knee, his youthful grandsons played, Or glad in sacred lore their infant skill dis played. This wight’s fair fame the Elder’s charge had won, And well his equal life such trust ap proved — By haughtiest wealth as independent known, By poorest toil as fellow-labourer loved; His praise was dear to all; if he re proved, Nor frowned the rich, nor jealous railed the poor; From him, whose life in equal toils has moved, Will poverty severest truths en dure, And who, nor needs nor fears, with wealth shall chide se cure. The reverend man my earlier years have seen, On Sunday morn the church-way gate be side, (An antique porch, with ivy mantled green, By beech’s earliest boughs o’ershadowed wide,) There stood the Patriarch gray, and near his side The entering peasants laid their friendly mite For brethren’s wants : while each, with grateful pride, From his applauding eye the warm de light Received, of charity “ twice blessed,” of kindness done a right. I’ve seen him, too, at times the boon di vide, By pitying brethren thus collected kind, Yet few were those, I wot, whom kindred’s pride To general pity careless then re signed — For not as now was wealth to few con fined, Who owned no kindred tie with lowlier toil — But far diffused; each peasant then could find, (While smaller farms left free th’ enriching soil ) Some kind relation near, whose wealth relieved his coil. Yet those whom poverty reluctant sent, With kindest care the Elder’s hand re lieved, As patriarch old within his evening tent, The pilgrim’s wearied footsteps glad re ceived; No fears were there, lest charity de ceived, Should nourish listless vice with boon pre pared For humble want; in equal toils had lived, Both he who dealt and he the boon that shared, And wasting idler there, of welcome still de spaired. Bright from his cottage lay, far stretched be low, A chequered valley, rich in woods and corn, Where many a hamlet’s light was seen to glow At darkening eve; where soft at earliest morn From many a cot the spiry smoke was borne, First mark of man a-stir; a village wide, Where gardens broad the straggling cots a dorn, Was near below; shone verdant down be side, Where lowed the milky herd, the hamlet’s common pride. How sweet at eve, when loom and anvil’s sound, That thro’ that village day had ceaseless rung, Was hushed; when forth from busiest sheds a round, Their tasks performed, the eager tradesmen flung, To drink the breeze of heaven in joyous throng, And pleasure seek in healthful change of toil : Some feed their cherished cows; with hatchet strong Some fuel-store prepare; in softer moil Some prop the blooming pea, and court the genial soil. And some, when now those leisure cares are done, Beneath some elm on western slope con vene, Where name-carved bench is placed for evening sun, And northern grove protects the quiet scene; There many a rustic theme consumes the e’en, And all of ill or good that peasants feel From laws and wars and kings is heard be tween; Some tell their wrongs, the cause would some re veal, And some, sagacious more, propound the means to heal. And here the Elder too might oft be found, Here loved at eve to list the eager theme, To hear the peasants deal their praises round, Or cast on “ ruling powers” their whispered blame; Could oft, with word revered, allay the flame Of vexed complaint: his glance, with anger fired, Could break the young declaimer’s airy dream (By lawless books, those whispering toads, in spired ) That soars to freedoms wild, of slow experience tired. Yet small the charm declaimer’s theme can bring (If public wants not pinch the peasant’s store, And teach him jealousy) to village ring, That meets to tell the rustic business o’er And themes of home. Their fond attention more Was won (while yet such kindred theme was given ) While Elder scanned th’ assembled preachers’ lore, Whose rival eloquence had fondly striven To win the hearts of men, and deck the rites of heaven.* They loved to hear how ’mid some mountain dell Where emerald grass with pearly daisies shone, And blooming furze diffused its fragrant smell, While o’er some neighbouring grove on hillock lone By ancient church the wandering eye was won — How mingling here with breeze’s fading sound, Was heard in cadence mild, like hermit’s tone, The preacher’s voice; and how innumerous round Delighted hearers sat, in fond attention wound, How there that preacher stood, like him of old, Who, ’mid the wilds of Judah’s desart plain, To gathering thousands awful warning told Of high Messiah’s dread approaching reign; How there, like him he poured his eager strain ’Mid lonely dell of far sequestered height, Repentant hearts for christain life to gain, And trembling souls to fit for awful rite, Where Saviour’s dying love bursts full on mortal sight. When rose their choral hymn’s aerial tide, How sweet the mellowed sound apart to hear, Beneath some mountain grove’s o’ershadowing side, Like songs of Eden poured on Adam’s ear From groves where angels walked; while, listening near, By hillock green, young wedded pair was seen, Who soothed, with fond caress, their infant’s tear, Lest childish wail invade the listening scene, And break those sounds of praise where angels heark to men. Such theme the peasant loved : such scene sub lime By grandsire’s foot he oft had tripped to see, And recollections fond of earliest time, And charms beloved of native scene ry, Were mingled there with rites that holiest be; And round the Elder oft, such tale to hear, They eager thronged beneath their village tree; To them than senates’ lore that tale more dear, Or all of war and fight that fills the city’s ear. So passed their eve : and then would Elder stray To neighb’ring cot, where, lov’d and welcome guest, He whiled in rural talk the hours a way : The father’s serious tale, the youngster’s jest, The damsel’s song, the child in frolic blest; Each gay, by turns amused the cheerful sire : The young enjoy their mirth, the old their rest, And all to please their honoured guest con spire, While, mid the jovial ring, gleams bright their bickering fire. And might, at times, misfortune’s frown se vere Such gladsome scene to hopeless sadness turn; Did pinching want extort a murmuring tear, And bid their wearied hearts in silence mourn, Or urge despair in angry words to burn; While stranger’s kindness half-degrading seemed, And tore their wounded pride with newer thorn :— The Elder’s step was ne’er intrusive deemed : Familiar oft before, for kindness still es teemed. And oft when frightened wealth in vain-had tried Each wonted art the peasant vexed to sooth, Had smiled, and glozed, and half-concealed his pride, And mingled promise fair and speeches smooth, Yet met but sullen looks in every booth; The Elder’s voice, in all its words sin cere, Could lull to peace his brethren’s passions wroth; Their sufferings just in patience taught to bear, Or shewed by rightful path to reach their ruler’s ear. Even she, that maid, around whose youthful breast Consumption’s serpent coils were firmly wound, Whose feverish heart each visit now op pressed, While shrunk her startled ear from every sound, The Elder’s converse still delightful found; While he, to win her ear, would cheerful tell Of evenings spent her parents’ hearth a round, Where friend to friend was joined in social spell : Then led her thoughts from earth on bliss supreme to dwell. How different he, the haughty pastor, sent Amid this humble flock “ the Word” to preach! Who ne’er within such humble threshold went, Save (yearly task) some stern advice to teach, Or, called perchance, at death’s impending breach : Can dying men of such regard the care, Whose tardy steps with death the port but reach? A signal known, his visit speaks des pair, Alarms the feverish heart, and thought bewilders there. When reapers keen on harvest fields were met, This wight for many an useful deed was loved : Disjointed limb his ready skill could set, And wound from sickle rough his salve re moved; Whene’er the youngster’s mirth too freely roved, One little word from him its flight re strained; And maid that, blushing, half that flight ap proved Yet blessed his care for purer mirth re gained, And youth in freedom met—thus age preserved un stained. At Harvest-home he loved the mirthful feast, Where master’s welcome servants’ cares be guiled, Where met the youth in mutual kindness blessed, Who late in rival strength had eager toiled : When down the dance the maiden grateful smiled On him whose care her harvest’s toil had eased; When rustic mirth flung round in antics wild, And youth rejoiced from yearly toils re leased, While age sat gladsome near, like guardian angel pleased. And much he wont th’ ungenerous pride to blame Of masters stern, to mushroom riches grown, Who thus to mix with labour deemed it shame, And gave for wonted feast the sordid boon; ’Twixt youth and age the bait for discord sown, That neither pleased, and both with strife de filed; For careful age will hoard the pittance thrown, And youth, of age’s decent care de spoiled, Will seek unsanctioned mirth, to sinful joys be guiled.* With bitterest smile the Elder oft would list, When men of wealth, in piteous mood, com plained Of peasants now depraved, of virtues ceased, And rural manners old, with vice di stained, And schemes of pride where simplest order reigned — Alas! themselves the cause! their pride of shew To mix with lowlier toil has long dis dained — Each jealous rank repels each rank be low, Familiar guardian once, a stern inspector now. How far the ill descends! the farmer’s hall, Where lived the servants once, beneath the care Of master kind—the friend, the guide of all — Is changed and lost; reigns pride unbending there, And forth to cheerless booth must servants fare, Their hasty mess unblessed, alone to snatch, And meet unguarded every youthful snare; While master’s stern advice, or hated watch, But fires their rival pride, his wealthier vice to match. Yet why in bitter words thus speak se vere? Thus ne’er the Elder’s voice would harshly chide; Oft stubborn vice would draw his secret tear, And oft his care would indignation hide, Lest stern reproof might wake the sinner’s pride, And shut the angry ear to all ap proach : By kindness still he loved the heart to guide, On sad remorse would careful ne’er en croach, And jealous pride could lull, yet waken self-re proach. As through the western pane of mountain cot, Where maiden sings and plies her evening wheel, Across the floor is sunny raylet shot, Where child pursues the atoms’ glittering reel, And grand-dame loves the sunny warmth to feel; While sparkling light the beamy wanderer throws On all that housewife’s care would fain con ceal, And o’er her dusky shelves resplendent glows, And playful pleases still, while every speck it shews; Thus playful still his kind reproof was shed, Thus unoffending every fault could shew :— Nor less to generous deeds his precepts led; As when at dawn from orchard’s blooming bough Some feathered songster’s notes melodious flow, And sleeping maid awake to cheerful toil, Who trims her parent’s cot ere forth she go, To milk her cows or join the harvest’s moil;— Thus he to deeds of worth, the heart could wakening wile. No words sarcastic e’er defiled his tongue, Those poisoned arrows shot by ambushed pride; Such oft in sly rebuke the heart have stung, Oft driven the penitent his faults to hide, But wanderer ne’er regained to virtue’s side; From lily fallen he dried remorseful shower, Nor let the worm despair beneath it bide; And oft with kindly touch revived the flower That cold neglect or scorn had thrown to vice’s power. No angry satire guided e’er his speech On class of men a general blame to throw — Of kings or mobs, or good or ill to teach :— For men, he’ said, in common frailty grow, By weal corrupted some, and some by woe; As mid some rocky cavern’s darksome hall, Where stalagmatic veins exuding flow, Wild shapes arise as drops incessant fall, Thus men unconscious change, thus custom works on all. Such truths the Elder taught; but most he loved Of wayward youth the devious paths to guide; Their generous warmth to duteous deeds he moved, And lured their pride of heart to virtue’s side : And many a wanderer bears his memory wide, Thro’ distant lands where Scotia’s sons are loved, And tells on Indian shore with grateful pride, How first the Elder’s praise, to deeds ap proved, Amid his native hills, his youthful bosom moved. But if from roamings far such wanderer come, And bend his path the Elder’s cot to find; Alas! no more is there the sage’s home; Along the hill all lonely sweeps the wind, Nor mark is there of social human kind; Of scattered sheep is heard the tinkling bell, And shivering lad is there, by rock re clined, To watch his flock, that seeks on desert fell, Some spot of greener sward, or kindlier sheltered dell. That shepherd points afar the sacred ground, Where now the Elder sleeps in silent grave; And leaves his flock, to guide the wanderer round The site, where once the cot its shelter gave; Where now some lonely trees their branches wave, Sole remnant left of all that there had been,— Which he who crushed the rest had deigned to save, To deck, perchance like ancient tomb, the scene, To wanderer’s grieving heart, memorial sad I ween.
She look’d as Ariadne, when she lay Beside the waves that traitor Theseus bore Far from her straining eyes and voice a way, Lost in a trance of grief, upon the shore; Or like Andromeda, when soft she slept, In safety, from the fatal rock un bound;— Or like the wearied nymph, who light hath stept, The livelong day, first in the festive round. And bending o’er my Cynthia’s slumbers calm, Late from the joyous throng, and flush’d with wine,— I felt her breathe around a heavy’nly balm, And borrow’d fragrance from her lips, for mine — One hand beneath her quiet head was plac’d, The other seem’d to shade her sleeping eyes,— And kneeling by the couch, in silent haste, Near and more near, I drank those fragrant sighs; And then my flame those gentle breezes fann’d So high, and such deep draughts of bliss I drew, That fain I would have mov’d that guardian hand, To kiss the lips from whence they issued, too. But Love upon mine arm his finger laid, And fear forbade the daring wish to rise — So, Argus-like, I gaz’d upon the maid, Till all my soul was living in mine eyes. And sportively the Chaplets from my head I took, that still were twin’d, forgotten, there,— “ Roses to Roses,” inwardly I said, And hung them by her cheek, and in her hair. My lilies her soft-heaving bosom grace, I see their snowy leaves—less white—ex pand; I wreathe her slender arm, and flow’rets place, Idly, in her unconscious sleeping hand :— And if, perchance, a deeper sigh she draws, I stop and gaze on her more fixed ly, And read her face, and image forth the cause — Oh! can she dream—and dream of aught but me? When lo! th’ admiring moon, with amorous rays, In sudden splendour thro’ the casement breaks, They kiss the lids where I dare hardly gaze, She opes her eyes, and murmurs as she wakes “ Ah! Ingrate art thou here? False one—but how — With riot flush’d, thy shameless orgies o’er;— Nay, and methinks I scarce should see thee now Wast thou not exil’d from another door. “ Let her, at least, enjoy oblivious rest, Who but to grief and vain regret must wake; Cruel—wouldst thou forsake me quite, ’twere best, And scorn the heart thou only wait’st to break. “ Long had the kindly, hovering sleep pre par’d To lend my cares the cordial they re quire, But with the teazing spindles’ noise I scared, Or charm’d him from his purpose with the lyre. “ And still I watch’d, and wept, and thought of thee, And still upon my couch he would at tend, Till in his gentle arms he folded me, As if aware he was my only friend.”
Whate’er the man, who first thy portrait drew, Oh, Love! his hand and eye were true, I deem; And well thy moonstruck worshippers he knew, Who live in air, and perish in a dream. In happy hours, those fragile plumes he gave For truly is the God with wings de sign’d, Whose vot’ries are more restless than the wave, The common pastime of the wanton wind. With fatal grace that polish’d bow he bears, His arrows on a Gnossian quiver lie; But, Parthian-like, they strike us una wares, And ere we know our enemy—we die. I felt his darts—e’en now I feel their stings, Too well my heart the wayward Boy dis plays; But, oh! in me the God hath lost his wings, And leaden sorrow on my spirit weighs. Love, wilt thou ever lacerate my breast? There are thy pow’r who never yet o bey’d — Strike them—and let my wearied bosom rest, Nor wage inglorious warfare with a shade. Oh! spare thy Bard—what poet of the quire Like him, who cold and silent soon must be, Shall sing thy triumphs? for his trembling Lyre Could hardly softer sound, e’en touch’d by thee.
O, fools, with foolish hopes e late, Who seek to trace the paths of Fate, And stare into Phœnician skies, To see if happy stars a rise! For whether ye with Parthia war, Or cross the main, to Britain, far, By desert sand, or hostile bark, Your deaths are blind, your fate is dark. Go bravely, nor inquire your doom, Nor when nor whence the blow may come; Endure whate’er the pow’rs re quire, Be it or poison, steel, or fire. Alone, the boding lover sees The end—all of his desti nies; And meets, with no repining sigh, The chosen death that he shall die. All other perils he de fies Of deadly foes or hostile skies; His lov’d one only moves his mind; Not stormy war nor stormy wind. E’en should he tread those ghastly shores, And hear that Phantom’s coming oars, His voice could snatch him from the wave, Pow’rful or to destroy or save. Embalm’d in this my living line, Cynthia, a lasting name is thine, And all thy charms shall flourish long, Reflected in as soft a song. Nor tow’rs, nor pyramids su blime, Can ’scape the crumbling touch of time, Nor fanes that emulate the sky — Nay, e’en our very tombs must die.
Orpheus, ’tis said, thy ancient lyre Could sooth the parched lion’s ire; ’Tis said that thy persuasive lays The listening waves would calm or raise. Amid the rocks the music crept, And from their stubborn base they lept And stood obedient to the call Around thy Thebes, a rocky wall. E’en Polypheme, thy song to hear Would Galatea bend her ear, And bridle her impatient steeds, To listen to thy plaintive reeds.— When wine and Phœbus aid the strain. Then, Cynthia, can I sing in vain; Or is it such a wondrous thing That maids are melted when I sing? No gold around my cornice gleams — No marble walls— no cedar beams — No orchard mine like forest wide — No grot with silver rill be side. But with the muses I re hearse The gentle magic of my verse, And bright Calliope in spires The music of my trembling wires. The ponderous arm of Age shall thrust Their proudest honours in the dust; Their boasted splendour shall ex pire, And blacken in remorseless fire. The name the poets’ lips can give, Amid the wreck alone shall live; And all whereon they breathe, that breath Enfranchise, and redeem from death.
Raise, Athens, raise thy loftiest tone! Eastward the tempest cloud hath blown, Vengeance hung darkly on its wing, It burst in ruin—Athens ring Thy loudest peal of trium phing; Persia is fallen; in mouldering heaps Her grand, her stately city sleeps, Above her towers exulting high, Susa has heard the victors’ cry, And Ecbatana, nurse of pride, Weeps where her best, her bravest died. Persia is sad, her virgins’ sighs Through all her thousand states a rise; Along Arbela’s purpled plain Shrieks the wild wail above the slain : Long shall her widows curse the day, When, at the voice of despot sway, Her millions passed o’er Helle’s wave, To chain, vain boast, the free, the brave. Raise, Athens, raise the triumph- song, Yet, louder yet, the peal pro long; “ Avenged at length our slaughtered sires, Avenged the waste of Persian fires! And these dear relics of the brave Torn from their shrines by Satrap slave, The spoils of Persia’s haughty king Again are thine—ring, Athens, ring!” O Liberty! delightful name, The land that once has felt thy flame, That loved thy light, but wept its clouding, Oh! who can tell her joys’ dark shrouding; But if, to cheer the night of sorrow, Memory a ray of thine should borrow, That on her tears and on her woes Sheds one soft beam of sweet re pose, O, who can tell her bright re vealing, Her deep, her holy thrills of feeling? So Athens felt, as fixed her gaze On her proud wealth of better days. ’Twas not the tripod’s costly frame, Nor vase that told it’s artist’s fame, Nor veils high-wrought with skill di vine That graced of old Minerva’s shrine, Nor marble bust; where vigour breathed, And beauty’s living ringlets wreathed; Not these could wake that joyous tone, Those transports long unfelt, un known; ’Twas memory’s vision, robed in light, That rushed upon her raptured sight, Warm from the fields where freedom strove — Fresh from the wreaths that freedom wove — This blessed her then, if that could be, If aught is blest that is not free. But did no voice exulting raise, To that high chief, the song of praise? And did no strain exulting ring For Macedonia’s conquering King? Who wide o’er Persia’s prostrate might, On victory’s pinion winged his flight — Who from the foe those spoils had won, Was there no shout for Philip’s son? No warrior! what’s thy vaunted name? What is thine high career of fame, From its first field of boyhood pride, Where valour failed and freedom died, Onward by wild ambition fired, Till Greece beneath its march ex pired? Let the vile herd, to whom thy gold Is dearer than the rights they sold, In secret to their lord and king That foul unholy incense fling; But let no slave exalt his voice Where hearts in, glory’s trance re joice; O breathe not now her tyrant’s name — O wake not yet Athenæ’s shame! Would that the hour when Xerxes’ ire Had wrapt her ancient walls in fire, All, all had perished in the blaze, And that had been her last of days, Gone down in that bright shroud of glory, The loveliest wreck in after story. Or when in exile forced to roam, Freedom their star, the waves their home, Near Salamis’ immortal isle, Her sons had slept in victory’s smile; Or Cheronæa’s fatal day, While fronting slavery’s dark ar ray, Had seen them bravely, nobly, die, Bosom on weltering bosom lie, Piling fair freedom’s breast-work high, Ere one Athenian should re main To languish life in captive chain, Or vassals wield a freeman’s sword Beneath a Macedonian lord. Such then was Greece; though conquered, chained, Some pride, some virtue yet re mained; And as the sun, when down he glides Behind the western mountains’ sides, Leaves in the cloud that robes the hill His own bright image burning still, Thus freedom’s lingering flushes shone O’er Greece, tho’ freedom’s self was gone. Such then was Greece, so fallen, so low, Yet great even then—what is she now? Who can her many woes de plore? Who shall her freedom spoiled re store? Darkly above her slavery’s night The crescent sheds her lurid light; Upon her breaks no cheering ray, No beam of freedom’s lovely day; But there—deep shrouded in her gloom, Their urn is Greece—a living tomb : Look at her sons and seek in vain The haughty brow, the high dis dain, With which the proud soul drags her chain. The living spark of latent fire, That smoulders on but can’t ex pire, That, bright beneath the lowering lashes, Will burst at times in angry flashes. Like Ætna, fitful slumbers taking, To be but mightier in its waking. Spirits of those, whose ashes sleep For freedom’s cause in glory’s bed, O! do ye sometimes come and weep, That that is lost for which ye bled! That e’er Barbarian flag should float O’er your own land in victory’s pride! That e’er should ring Barbarian shout, Where wisdom taught, and valour died. O, for that Minstrel’s soul of fire That breathed, and Sparta’s arm was strong; O, for some master of the lyre To wake again that kindling song. And if, sweet land, aught lives of thee, What Helles was, what Greece could be, Freedom—like her to Orpheus given, Might visit yet her home—her heaven.
Is there a place where the souls of the just, Forsaking mortality’s loathsome dust, In purity rest till that awful day, When this sorrowing world shall pass a way? When after this short life’s terrible close, And after death’s icy and dark re pose, The good and the guilty that trump shall hear — A summons of joy, or a sound of fear — That last loud trump, whose awakening call Shall proclaim the eternal doom of all. Is there a place where the spirits of bliss Can look down on a world so sad as this? Where, with purest love, they behold the worth Of the faithful hearts whom they left on earth? Or can the soul’s intellectual flame Lie torpid, and cold with man’s mortal frame, Like that in corruption’s arms to a wait, An endless pain, or a happier state? Can the mind of man, the immortal soul, Which on earth seems bounding from earth’s con trol — Can that spirit by death to flesh be linked, All its ardour quenched, and its hope ex tinct? Oh, no! there’s a bright and a blissful sphere, Where it soars when freed from its bondage here; And it soothes the mourner’s heart to think, While in tears he bends o’er the cold grave’s brink — It soothes his sorrowing heart to know, Though the form he loved may moulder be low — The spirit he loved—the immortal part — The truth, and the love, and the goodness of heart, And the faith which raises the mind to God — These never can rest in death’s dark a bode : And though mortal eyes cannot pierce the gloom, The mysterious realms beyond the tomb — Though we know too well, that when life is o’er The loved ones depart, and are seen no more — Yet we feel (and there’s comfort in feeling thus ) They live, though unheard and unseen by us; And we think, though freed from all earthly ill, They hover in pity around us still. Oh! who that has roved by the pale moon’s light, In the deep repose of a summer’s night — When the gray mist rests on the meadows green, And the distant mountains are dimly seen — When the sea in its rage resounds no more, But in murmuring whispers seeks the shore, As calm, as if ever at rest, it flows, The faithless calm of a lion’s re pose — When the tranquil wind is so soft and weak, That there’s warmth in the breeze that fans your cheek — When nothing is heard but the sea-bird’s note, Or a lively song from a fisherman’s- boat, Or the rills which, gushing through arching caves, At intervals drip in the dark blue waves :— Oh! who that has roved in a night like this, And thought of the phantoms of boyish bliss — When every thought must have caused a sigh, And a burning tear for days gone by — Oh! who has not gazed on the clear sky then, With thoughts never uttered, though felt by men, Till his heart was sad, and his eyes were dim, And the scenes of this world were lost to him; And, unaided by sight, he seemed to view Realms deep in the sky’s dark beautiful blue — Realms brighter than all he had thought most bright — Delightful, exceeding this world’s de light; With all that his youth thought purest and best, Made purer and better—by angels blest. With feelings like these, I have often stood Near the ocean, in night’s calm soli tude, And gazed from the beech and its sounding surge, To the misty horizon’s utmost verge, Where one softened tint is perceived a lone, And water and sky seem to melt in one; And then while the tremulous moonbeams shine On the waves, in a dazzling and golden line, Which, unquenched and glowing, appears to glide Like a lava stream through the darker tide : Then, whilst on the waters I mutely gaze, I think of the pleasures of other days; And the faces and forms so sadly dear; And the words I heard, but no more can hear; And the tales that can never again be told; And the pressure of hands that now are cold;— ’Tis then we encourage the fond be lief, That those whom we grieve for behold our grief; That from them we receive the Hope, which takes The severest pang from a heart that aches; And when we remember that they are blest, And that we are in sorrow, we feel ’tis best To follow their steps in Death’s awful track, Without one selfish wish to call them back.
Alike the mean and mighty fall, The prince and peasant die; Time, like a tyrant, levels all, And sweeps unheeding by! Down to oblivion and de cay, The countless thousands pass a way, For one, whose honours high Remain—a morning star—to shine, With light undying, and di vine. True—that the world is sunk in crime; That error walks a broad; Yet Virtue ever soars sub lime O’er every pressing load. A cloud may veil the lord of Day, But glows he, when it glides a way, Less brightly than he glowed? Or can opposing tempests bend The giant from his journey’s end? Thus is it with the great in soul, The mighty of our race, Who onward pant to glory’s goal, Their only resting place. Amid the sapient, and the brave, Thy destiny survives the grave, Nor e’er shall time ef face The halo round thine honoured urn, Immortal chief of Bannock burn! Five centuries have rolled a long In silence o’er man kind, Since thou, in youthful vigour strong, As danced upon the wind Thy war-crest on the battle eve — Did’st to the chin De Bohun cleave, And all the hosts be hind Shouted, and hostile camps did view With wonder, and with trembling too! But yet thy fame hath nobly stemmed The cataract of years; In Honour’s sacred temple gemmed Thy kingly worth ap pears; For thou wert not of those, who take Delight in impious war, and slake Their wrath with human tears; So, when the sword was sheathed, thy mind Was gentle as the summer wind. Thy Scotland shall forget thee not, Brave champion of her right! Thou art her praise; to every Scot A glory and de light; And countless thousands yet to come, Shall kneel in reverence at thy tomb, And kindle at the sight, To think that there the dust re mains Of him that broke his Country’s chains!
How beautiful the scenes of youth Awaken to the mind! Scenes, like the summer ocean smooth, Serener—fairer far, than Truth On earth shall ever find! Time is a tyrant—months and years Pass onward like the sea, that leaves A solitary isle, which rears Its passive bosom, and ap pears Between the rolling waves In life there is no second spring — The past is gone—for ever gone! We cannot check a moment’s wing; Pierce thro’ futurity; or bring The heart its vanished tone! Resplendent as a summer sky, When day-light lingers in the west, To Retrospection’s loving eye, The blooming fields of childhood lie, By Fancy’s finger drest A greener foliage decks the grove; A brighter tint pervades fie flower; More azure seems the heaven a bove; The earth a very bower of love, And man within that bower! And ever, when the storms of Fate Come darkening o’er the star of life, We backward turn to reno vate Our thoughts with freshness, and cre ate An antidote to strife. Thus dead and silent are the strings, As legends say, of Memnon’s lyre; Till, from the orient, Phœbus flings His smiles of golden light, and brings Life, harmony, and fire!
From cloudless skies, the sun o’er hung With crimson fire the western main; In shadows deep and verdure young, The woods and fields smiled back a gain; It was a luxury to breathe The very air, so pure and clear; Vales, like a map, were spread be neath, And far withdrawing hills seemed near. Afar from paths of men I strayed, With raptured eye and glowing heart; And felt, that every field and glade Could fresh delight and love im part;— The running stream, with flowers o’er hung; The trees that seemed to woo the air; The bees that humm’d, the birds that sung,— ’Twas too much for the mind to bear! The city’s noise was left be hind, Remote its azure spires ap peared; And human strife, thus brought to mind, The rural quiet more en deared. Beside the stream, I threw me down Amid the flowers all fresh and fair, And, shooting from its banks of brown, A wild rose spread its boughs in air; Its leaves so beautifully green, Its cups so delicately blue, Awakened thoughts of many a scene, Far banished from my vacant view! Thoughts, that have long been veiled in sleep; Hopes, that allured but to de part; And recollections buried deep Within the shut and silent heart. Wrapt in the mournful reverie — Of shadowy thoughts a crowding throng; Before the glass. of Memory, Like restless sprits, trooped a long; And, for a while, absorbed in thought, From prospects drearily o’er cast, A solace and relief I sought Amid the sunshine of the past! Frail beings are we! following still The rainbow hopes that lure a far; By night and day, for good or ill, With others, or ourselves at war! We cannot stop—we will not try Contentment in our lot to find; We dare not rest; tranquilli ty Is worse than discord to man kind! Well—’twill be over soon!— the strife Of being, and the fond re gret; The visions of exalted life We cannot reach, nor yet for get. Chained down, and fixed to present care — Like exiles to their native shore We look behind us; but des pair To find the bliss that charmed be fore! Then come the rack—the searching pains — The rankling of the poisoned wound — And, like Prometheus, from the chains, With many a coil, that gird us round, We strive to rise—or, like the bird, That beats in vain against the wires, Until no more its wings are heard, And, palsied with its toil, ex pires!
Throughout the watches of the night, The feathery snow, in silent flight, Has left the regions of its birth, And, falling, sought the realms of earth : The mantled mountain heaves on high Its forehead to the morning sky, On which the distant lord of day Shoots forth a horizontal ray;— The fields, that lately bloomed and smiled, Are flowerless, desolate, and wild, Cold as Despair’s unceasing tears, And silent as departed years. With bending branches hangs the wood, A lonely, leafless soli tude; The Spirits of the North have swept Its pride away, the snows have leapt On every dark outstretching bough; And if the passing bird a light, With fearful, fluttering pinions, lo! Comes down a frequent shower of white, Which falls within the roaring stream, That rushes on, and hears the call That urges to yon water fall, Down, from the inland mountains, down, With swelling tide, and waves of brown. Look up unto the rocks, on which, Beyond the power of mortal reach, Falls dashing down the drisly spray, And works along its foaming way, Thro’ clefts, and o’er the rocks, where sprung The water-lilies, bright and young, Beneath the willow-boughs, which hung Their pendant tresses, like a mother Above the cradle of her child, When one fond thought succeeds a nother, And Fear is hushed, and Wo be guiled; Behold the crags, the rocks, the shore, With icicles are crusted o’er; Ten thousand crystal pillars bright, Tinged with the lovely morning light, Pendant and twining glittering ly, Like amethysts of purple dye; From bank to bank—from rock to rock — In rows they stretch, as if to mock The meagre range—the narrow span — The pride of art—the hand of man; A passing smile—a holy shrine — By Nature’s finger wreathed di vine; Reared in the lapses of a night, And, as the morning chill relents, Dissolving in meridian light, And mingling with the e lements; So, fostered in seclusion, rise The dreams of youth—so quickly dies The magic rainbow, that o’er hung The days to come, when life was young, Receding, and illuding ever, Like fairy climes by poets sung, But in existence welcomed never.
We met and parted on an autumn eve, When moonlight, with its beauty, steeped the vale, Silent, and not a cloud was seen to sail Athwart the azure firmament. Be lieve, Ye who have felt the ecstasies of love, What were my feelings, when I gazed on her, Whom—absent—life had nothing to confer; Whose presence rendered earth like heaven a bove! Upon a rock, above the murmuring sea, Linked arm and arm, in thoughtfulness we stood; And, as I marked our shadows on the flood, I dream’t that Fate intended us to be United always—’twas a dream; and, lo! Between us mountains rise, and oceans flow!
’Tis night, and Darkness o’er the land and sea Outstretches gloomily her ebon wings; Downward, with biting breath, the tempest flings The whirling snow-flake, dancing giddi ly. What is my thought? —the traveller on the moor, Benighted, lonely, urging on his steed, Where all is solitude, and none to heed. What is my thought? —the ocean’s awful roar Recalls the wandering mariner, a far Upon the rayless deep, whose flashing gun, The signal of distress, is heard by none, Save Him, who placed in heaven the evening star. What is my thought? —that feeling is dis tress, And human life a wintry wilder ness.
Oh! I have loved thee with a boundless love, Through all the wayward changes of my fate! Thou wert the star, whose rays could dissi pate My gathered gloom, and bid all clouds re move : Our passion grew from childhood; with our days It strengthened, and it prospered, and be came, Within our souls, an Ætna of pure flame, Warm as the sun, and quenchless in its blaze : The master-current of my mind was bowed To thine—like rainbow o’er a mountain- stream, When Evening shines upon the silvery cloud, Stealing, and lending beauty in its beam; Thou wert the idol of my heart a vowed, And life, without thee, was a troublous dream!
Thrice happy land, where order keeps the rein, Tho’ faction fret, and fierce sedition strain, Where “ public weel,” regardless of her ire, Sees private discontent in fumes ex pire; Where every meanest subject, Briton- born, May hold his Prince’s ministers in scorn, Canvas their measures, praise or censure lend, Attack, refute, investigate, de fend; In chair of judgment seated, fix the doom Of Whig and Tory, Castlereagh, or Brougham, On King and Queen, as whim or conscience draw, Impress the “ ηαλα ” and the “ αγα θα ” Far hence the time when turbulence shall cease, And terror’s death-like silence shall be peace, When all the foul fire damp of rage shall ly In muttered threats, and vengeance-sparkling eye, And Britons shall be Frenchmen—dark and still — (Like thunder cloud that hung upon the hill In breathless silence lours), till waked at once The wasting passions howl—the murderous weapons glance. A Galen’s head, amid the rotten thatch, Exalted thus for “ customers” to watch, The window stoned with vials red and green, Where lizard, snake, and swimming fish are seen, These emblems speak, than “ lettered board,” more clear, That “ Allan Breck” is “ surgeon druggist”— here. He is the Horn-book of this village small, Itch, rheumatism, bats, he cures them all,— For rats and other vermin, mixes doses — For coughs and colds, a pectoral pill com poses — And thus, so great the reach of Allan’s skill, He can, as suits you best, or cure or kill. The “ Scotsman” here by nightly guest is read, And proofs of state-delinquency are led.— “ Our king has servants, harbingers of woe, To whom, so he decrees it, we must bow; Our means they basely pilfer, we must say God bless the hind that reaves our means a way. Our freedom is disposed of, we must stand To see corruption subjugate the land,— Or if we dare to murmur, under neath Oppression’s load, ’tis banishment and death; They tell us of our rights—and will they feed Our starving children that implore for bread; They boast of their protection!— thus the Ass Is kept for drudgery and fed on grass. Base beast of burden, loaded, beat, and starved, And only for its usefulness pre served. The harvest comes; o’er many a fruitful field, Whose labour taught, the sullen soil to yield? The splendid mansion proves the right of those By whose laborious art the mansion rose; Let us withdraw our labours, we shall find The great more humble, and the rich more kind. “ Where mere ‘ equality,’ blest state of man, Primeval state ere misery be gan, Ere princes, lords, and ministers com bined To mar the happiness of human mind. Ere ‘ wealth’ erected high her pillared dome, And ‘ power’ declared the stately hall his home, Drove o’er the free-born soul his hateful way, And cursed mankind with ‘ an imperial sway.’ “ Our priests are leeches swelling into blood; Where now the spare thin ‘ holy man of God?’ They fatten on our ignorance, and speak, Just what they think will gull us, week by week; Whilst we, dull fools, with lengthened visage hear, Subjected to their purposes by fear Of hell—by hope of everlasting bliss — What madness half so desperate as this — ’Tis time we stir us powerfully, and thus, As I this stopper, cast their cords from us; Who would not die, oppression’s bonds to break — Who would not!— let him die,” says Allan Breck. Thus reasons “ Allan Breck,” whilst every eye Beams “ insubordination” in re ply; The grinding teeth, and trembling lip com pressed, The curse and furious rap, proclaim the rest.
You mark the plan of God, in “ mercy” laid, That plan in Heaven devised, on earth dis played, You see the Saviour meek, and low, and mild, In power a Deity—in heart a child; You drink his words in “ meekness” as they flow, Breathing compassion for a world of woe; “ Forgive ’—the lesson ever taught by Heaven, “ Forgive, ” vindictive man, and be for given — “ As you by God’s free proferred “ mercy” live, “ Oh learn the heavenly wisdom to “ for give;” “ In harsher bosoms pain shall never cease, “ But mercy’s ways are pleasantness and peace.” Thus from the cross, the words of mercy fall On all mankind, for they were meant for all,— But “ vengeance” steps between, and high in air Exultant waves the signal of des pair, O’er dale and heath her fiery steps have passed, More swift than cataract, or mountain blast, Nor stops she short, till through the peaceful vale, Of horror burst the scream, of death ascend the wail! Beneath that fading beam, what deeds are done, To startle solitude, and veil the sun! Around that livid flame, what shapes of hell, At studied interval repeat the yell!— Here stalks the Indian in his native garb, Armed with the scalping knife, and poisoned barb, Around the broiling captive takes his walk, And deep in “ Vengeance” bathes his toma hawk, The spirit of his Father smiles on high, Beams from his fleecy cloud, and passes by!— Beneath our eyes, amidst the “ village crew,” What kindred characters arise to view.— “ A Lusty Boy!” —the midwife hands him round, The listening gossips chuckle at the sound, And to augment a fondling mother’s joy, Each “ queasy dame” repeats,— “ A Lusty Boy.” Now twelvemonths old, this lusty little man, To stand erect, and mark his feet, be gan — Anon he walks, with veering trembling pace, Now forward shooting, falls upon his face, Laments his woes in sorrow-breathing squalls, And for “ commiseration” loudly calls : Commiseration is a mother’s part, ’Tis her’s to sooth the grief, to heal the smart, ’Tis her’s to punish what can feel no pain, ’Tis her’s to strike what cannot strike a gain, And thus with thoughtless cure, and method strange, In her own infant’s breast implant “ re venge,” Thus early sow the thistle seeds of strife, And make a howling wilderness of life. Not quite an infant, and not quite a boy, How will this tiny youth his hours em ploy? Let him remain in combat, game, or race, The little boisterous tyrant of the place. O’er cats and kittens daringly pre vail — Of drowning puppy laugh to hear the wail — Of chirping sparrows’ brood arrest the breath, Rejoicing in the agonies of death!— And should he scorn his mother, where’s the crime; These “ little errors”’—will correct in time, One cannot always beat, and if one could, Eternal beating, might do little good. And now to school he plods his noisy way, To spell, to count, to trifle, and to play, To scorn the teacher, disregard the laws, “ Revenge ” to meditate beneath the “ taws,” To combat fiercely, his address to shew, And fairly prove his talents by “ a blow.” Determined, bold, impetuous, and strong, His youth like mountain-torrent sweeps a long, O’er Nature’s sweets the poisoned waters flow, And where the daisy bloom’d unseemly briars grow. Now is he smith apprenticed, and he knows On heated iron to descend in blows — The bellows pour their breath, with brightening glow The metal softens into wax be low. Awhile his youth and inexperience bind The native darings of a restless mind; Awhile his couch in nightly sleep is pressed, And, tired with ten hours’ work, he sinks to rest; Awhile he bears reproof, nor risks re ply, Beneath the lourings of a master’s eye; But nature will return, although you strive, With fork to ward her off, with force to drive. A “ cock-fight” was announced, and caught the ear Of one to whom all “ cruelties” were dear. The distance great—but then such sports were rare; The day was short—his master had a mare; His master saw no cause, nor would he lend Consent or aid to such unworthy end. “ Denial in my need!— but time shall try, Who shall repent this usage—you or I.” These accents struggled in the swelling throat, Nor was this lowly-muttered threat for got; For scarce three weeks had passed, when, with a glare Of dumb affright, a horror-speaking stare, The master’s eye bespoke “ his mangled mare!” We may not reach perfection in a day — The moon of night succeeds the twilight ray — And, step by step, the ladder we as cend, Whether to heaven we rise, or towards a scaffold tend. Our hero—what’s his name?— (why, that is true, ’Tis fit he had a name—so call him “ Hugh,”)— Hugh stood amazed : “ The act he would not deem A human act—did he behold, or dream? Some wandering miscreant sure, some Irish rogue, He marked indeed last night, a surly dog; He did not like his aspect at the time, But little thought he then of such a crime.” And thus the villain’s wondering part he plays, By downright artifice his guilt be trays; Disgraced, dismissed, where can he now re pair! He seeks a secret pass, and “ murders” there His master—basely “ murders”—shrieks, and flies; Is taken—tried—convicted—shrieved—and dies! Dies on a scaffold, cursing, in his death, The breast that gave him strength, the hour that gave him breath!
Whate’er I be, old England is my dam! So there’s my answer to the judges, clear. I’m nothing of a fox, nor of a lamb; I don’t know how to cheat, nor how to leer : I’m for the nation! That’s why you see me by the wayside here, Returning home from transpor tation. It’s Summer in her bath this morn, I think. I’m fresh as dew, and chirpy as the birds : And just for joy to see old England wink Thro’ leaves again, I could harangue the herds : Isn’t it some thing To speak out like a man when you’ve got words, And prove you’re not a stupid dumb thing? They shipp’d me off for it : I’m here a gain. Old England is my dam, whate’er I be. Says I, I’ll tramp it home, and see the grain : If you see well, you’re king of what you see : Eyesight is having, If you’re not given, I said, to glutto ny. Such talk to ignorance sounds as raving. You dear old brook, that from his Grace’s park. Come bounding! on you run near my old town : My lord can’t lock the water; nor the lark, Unless he kills him, can my lord keep down. Up, is the song-note! I’ve tried it, too : — for comfort and re nown I rather pitch’d upon the wrong-note. I’m not ashamed : Not beaten’s still my boast : Again I’ll rouse the people up to strike. But home’s where different politics jar most most. Respectability the women like. This form, or – that form — The Government may be hungry pike, But don’t you mount a Chartist platform! Well, well! Not beaten – spite of them, I shou; And my estate is suffering for the Cause.— Now, what is yon brown water-rat about a bout, Who washes his old poll with busy paws? What does he mean by’t? It’s like defying all our natural laws For him to hope that he’ll get clean by’t. His seat is on a mud-bank, and his trade Is dirt : he’s quite contemptible; and yet The fellow’s all as anxious as a maid To show a decent dress, and dry the wet. Now it’s his whisker, whisker, And now his nose, and ear : he seems to get Each moment at the motion brisker! To see him squat like little chaps at school, I can’t help laughing out with all my might, He peers, hangs both his fore-paws : bless that fool, He’s bobbing at his frill now!— what a sight! Licking the dish up, As if he though to pass from black to white. Like parson into lawny bishop The elms and yellow reed-flags in the sun, Look on quite grave : — the sunlight flecks his side; And links of bindweed-flowers round him run, And shine up doubled with him in the tide. I ’m nearly splitting, But nature seems like seconding his pride, And thinks that his behaviour’s fitting. That isle o’ mud looks baking dry with gold. His needle-muzzle still works out and in. It really is a wonder to be hold, And makes me feel the bristles of my chin, Judged by ap pearance, I fancy of the two I’m nearer Sin, And might as well commence a clearance. And that’s what my fine daughter said : — she meant : Pray hold your tongue, and wear a Sunday face. Her husband, the young linendraper, spent Much argument thereon :— I’m their dis grace Bother the couple! I feel superior to a chap whose place Commands him be neat and supple But if I go and say to my old hen : I’ll mend the gentry’s boots, and keep dis creet, Until they grow too violent, — why, then, A warmer welcome I might chance to meet : Warmer and better. And if she fancies her old cock is beat : And drops upon her knees – so let let her! She suffered for me :— women, you’ll ob serve, Don’t suffer for a Cause, but for a man. When I was in the dock, she show’d her nerve : I saw beneath he shawl my old tea- can Trembling.... she brought it To screw me for my work : she loathed my plan, And therefore double kind I thought it. I’ve never lost the taste of that same tea : That liquor on my logic floats like oil, When I state facts, and fellows disa gree. For human creatures all are in a coil; All may want pardon. I see a day when every pot will boil Harmounious in one great Tea- garden! We wait the setting of the Dandy’s day, Before that time!— He’s furbishing his dress — He will be ready for it!— and I say That yon old dandy rat amid the cress,— Thanks to hard labour!— If cleanliness is next to godli ness, The old fat fellow’s Heaven’s neighbour! You teach me a fine lesson, my old boy! I’ve look’d on my superiors far too long. And small has been my profit as my joy. You’ve done the right while I’ve denounced the wrong. Prosper me later! Like you I will despise the sniggering throng, And please myself and my Cre ator. I’ll bring the linendraper and his wife Some day to see you; taking off my hat. She they ask why, I’ll answer : in my life I never found so true a dem ocrat. Base occu pation : Can’t rob you of your own esteem, old rat! I’ll preach you to the British nation.
Long had the cheek, by seeming health o’er spread, Through parent’s breast, delusive pleasure shed; The fevered pulse, the spirit-lacking eye, Had swelled, in that sad breast, the stifled sigh; By hope and fear her soul alternate swayed, Had lingered in decline the “ village maid.” The wedding-day was fixed the mother knew; The secret joy had whispered to a few; And all the village, all the country near, Had joyed or grieved the whispered tale to hear. Consumption crept with silent pace a main, She felt no sickness, and she owned no pain; Yet listless passed the lately joyous day, And all her roses hastened to de cay. At each successive step become more bold, The spoiler now unveils his deadly hold; Life’s vitals grasps, till all the boiling blood Pours o’er the burning cheek its crimson flood. I met her noon-day steps along the plain, She moved with heaviness, and breathed with pain; And ever and anon, with “ blade of knife,” Upturned the grassy sod in quest of life, Inhaled the fresh’ning influence with care, Nor of the passing stranger seemed a ware. There needs no more the features to pour tray Of youth and beauty hastening to de cay; A parent’s grief suppressed, a lover’s wail, Sum up the burden of my mournful tale; Whilst Recollection, o’er the passing bier, In silence stoops again, and drops a tear. The hour is twelve—but few, and far be tween, Th’ invited mourners slowly gather in,— Await the “ Service” with attentive eye, And prove their sympathy by many a sigh. Now Elder Jonathan, with bonnet blue, Veils his devotion meekly from the view — In accents slow—lugubrious—loud—and long, Pours the discursive fervours of his song. This mournful prelude past, the circling glass, Short-bread and bun, in quick succession pass; A while in pairs, with whispering tone, they tell How harvests ripen, and how cattle sell; What accidents last market evening knew, How “ Sutor John” was beaten black and blue,— Till all its power resumed, the loosened tongue With rustic jest and merriment is hung. “ They lift ”—the bed resigns its coffined clay, Which, in slow moving march, is borne a way; And now, with bending step, and starting tear, The father takes his station at the bier — Once more supports his daughter’s drooping head, And lowers it gently to its narrow bed. The closing grave resumes its promised trust, And all a parent’s hope returns to dust, Meanwhile the village dames in crowds re pair, The female grief’and female pint to share — O’er Jenny’s fate sad lamentations raise, And fuddle all their senses in her praise.
Approach the bed—the doors wide open throw — Give air, and light—give all thou canst be stow;— The chamber clear of every cottage breath, And watch the features of approaching death. Does age expire, whilst o’er the placid eye The shades of death in softened twilight lie? Thro’ all the youthful frame does fever hold His fitful revelry of heat and cold? Alas! the sufferer’s years forbid de cay — Insulted reason still maintains her sway; ’Tis “ Conscience” holds her grasp, and thrusts her dart, In grinning triumph to the sinner’s heart. “ How many Sabbaths—ah, how many tell, Did I my time and better reason sell In worse than folly—worse than madness live, Forgive, oh God of mercy, yet for give. “ The hour of pardon past—all hope is fled — My sentence sealed—the messenger has sped! Before my aching eyes I see him stand,— My condemnation waving in his hand. “ My wife—my dearest wife—withstand his power — Oh children, shield me in this fearful hour. My God protect, They may not—cannot come, I am, oh fearful thought, I am un done. “ Deserted—dragged to never-ending night, Unseemly darkness ever on my sight. I know—I hear—I feel the vengeance due, And hell unfolds her horrors to my view. “ Expectant shapes attend in dread ar ray, To bear me in their closing fangs a way. No longer can I breathe, no longer live. Forgive, oh God of mercy—yet for give.”
The sun In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations. Light wanes; dark clouds come hovering o’er The bosom of the silent sky; And harvest fields, a yellow pride that wore, In twilight shadow lie. A gloom o’erspreads the forests green; The sullen river, with a roll, Rushes to the sea, its goal; And the far distant hills are seen, As if the fleecy robes of Eve were strewed be tween! The breezes are asleep; the world at rest; And silence to the east and west Gazes, but in vain, to see One leaflet moving on one single tree! The birds forsake their singing, and a round, Nought but the cattle’s low—a lonely sound, Disturbs the solitude. Be hold, Withdrawn from human eye — Far in the sullen solitary sky, The sun hath quench’d his radiant orb of gold. A deeper, and a deeper gloom Succeeds, as if the day of doom Were come, and earth should quake a round, At the angel’s trumpet sound! As if at once, like molten glass, Earth and Heaven away should pass; And to darkling chaos roll, Crackling like a folding scroll! Oh! Thou, that far beyond the starty sky,— Thy glances piercing through eterni ty,— Omniscient,—and invisible,—a lone,— Sittest on thy jasper throne, Hearken to us, frail mortals, when we cry! Hearken to us,—although but for a day — We are—and pass a way! Hearken to us —although we have pre ferred Sin’s darkness to truth’s light; And, wandering from thy sight, Have in the paths of folly ever erred : Hearken to us, although ungrateful we, Like prodigals, have wandered far a stray From virtue’s everlasting way, And in our pride of heart forgotten thee! A deeper gloom, a darker dye, Mantles o’er the dismal sky; Sailing o’er its breast, like phantom ships, The severing clouds revolve, and lo! With a faint and feeble glow, Looks out the mighty sun in dim e clipse; Like a lunar crescent beaming, And a ghastly splendour streaming Upon the broken clouds, in many a fold, Around, like pillars of a ruined fane, In awful wildness rolled! Hearken again, oh! Thou whose boundless power Extendest far beyond our limited thought, Through worlds, that in a twinkling thou hast wrought, And in a twinkling can in wrath de vour! Thou that hast made, and can com mand; Thou that the depths of chaos broke — That touchest mountains, and they smoke; And takest, in the hollow of thy hand, The heaving and immeasurable main, As if it were a drop of rain! Hearken to us, and hear, With unaverted ear, Our supplications, as with faces prone, And folded hands, we bow before thy throne! Because, with quenchless light, and daily force, Brightening the orient, from his chamber starts The red-haired giant, whose proud looks are darts Of living fire—rejoicing in his course — Because the pale-eyed moon, with silver smile, Walks forth in beauty through the evening dim, And round her path the constellations swim, Shorn of her beams, with fainter light the while; Because, with regular pulse the ocean throbs, Covering, and leaving wastes of yellow sand; Because the green-rob’d spring o’erspreads the land; Because the summer’s cheek is russet brown — And autumn’s features waxing to a frown, Melts into winter’s age with tears and sobs; Because a thousand gifts are daily poured By thee, oh Father, mighty, and a dored, (if in our warmth of spirit we may call Thee, Father, who art sovereign overt all;) Because thou givest us, from thy liberal hand, Raiment, and food, and health, and all We ask, or can enjoy, our hearts ex pand With insolent pride, and to rebellion fall. Forgive us! oh, forgive us! turn not thou With anger stamped upon thy brow, But look towards us, and re lent, As thus in dust and ashes we re pent! Not in the hour of pleasure are we borne To thee, in gratitude,—thou mak’st us mourn, Hiding thy face, and then our spirits fall, And on thy name imploringly we call : On earth the muffled sun looks down With dim and melancholy frown, Opaque and. dismal, of his glories shorn, In crescent shape, with sharp and pallid horn; A type of that tremendous day, When sea, and earth, and sky shall pass a way, And when the angel, ’mid the tempest’s roar, Shall swear by heaven that “ time shall be no more!” Awful and solemn is the hour! Foreboding gloom, and doubtful fear, O’er the throbbing bosom lower, And tell how weak we are, how mighty is Thy power! Oh! may not, unim proved, This hour of warning fleet a way, And like the clouds that paint an April day, Pass, and from memory ever be re moved — But, graven on the mind, oh, may it bring Thoughts that are high, and feelings that en dure, To keep, ’mid tainted paths, the bosom pure Which grief can reach not, nor repentance sting : And, walking ’mid mankind, oh, may we be From wickedness and wayward errors free, And rising o’er the ills that mock us here, Think on the splendours of a happier sphere, Where, veiling, with their wings, their faces bright, Amid insufferable light, The seraphim and cherubim a dore Thy glory ever more!
‘ Nor shroud can hap, nor the marble hide, For the Morisons dust has a living one’s pride; They walk the earth, and they seek i’ the flood, To cleanse their right hands from the red red blood. And if ye maun wi’ a Morison wed, Frae nae mortal lips shall yere doom be read; Sir Allan look’d thrice to the lift and the linn — Come forth and appear ye shapes o’ sin. ‘ Sir Allan looked thrice to the rushing flood, And the stream seemed changed to a stream of blood; Sir Allan looked thrice to the lift a boon; And a dark shape sailed between him and the moon; Again he gazed down to the torrent be neath, And the stream lay as quiet and mute as death; Sir Allan stood there to ask and to prove, If May Morison and he would be blessed in their love. ‘ The linn seem’d changed to a mourning hall; The rough rocks gleamed like a marble wall; The Morisons forms were ranked a round; And their looks were of wrath and their dark brows frowned. A deep groan came from the dark deep flood — The shuddering river all bubbled with blood — And Sir Allan’s true love, in a wreath of reek, Sailed past with a wave of her hand, and a shriek. ‘ And then a grim form, from the haunted linn, Came up with a stride—’twas a shape of sin; And brave as he was—yet its shape and its look, Were such as Sir Allan did shudder to brook; For it seemed so like his true love’s brother, And it took one long stride after a nother. But for every mute stride that the vision took, Lord Herbert took one, and his dagger he shook; For he sought the fair lady with love all un holy To cast her pure spirit to sin and to folly. ‘ Cold, dark, and disdainful, and fierce in its pride; The spectre sprung up, and stood stern at his side — Sir Allan-all dauntless—dark vision, he said, I am a true knight, and I love a leal maid. With an eye streaming light, waxing fiercer of mood, And raising its dagger, the dread vision stood; And raising his dagger as fierce and as fell, Lord Herbert stood near, with an aspect of hell. ‘ Sir Allan knew not his love’s brother was near — Now vision, tell me, is my bride’s bed or bier The meetest—Yet, oh, but its blissful to wed, If maid, like May Morrison, blesses my bed. The vision’s bright dagger came down with a gleam — And down came Lord Herbert’s—The fair moonlight stream Ran moaning, and heaven waxed dark, while his blood Reeked up to the stars, as it mixed with the flood.
‘ The corn may shake owre ripe on the rigs, The Queensberry gimmers may rot on their legs, The swan forhoo the flood and the lake, The elf-shot crummie may die at the stake, The maiden may moil in vain at the kirn, For gruesome death has won us a pirn — We have paid the grave a golden kain, The life o’ the sie our cummer, is gane. ‘ Frae the pulpit we weel might spare the priest, And spare the black-cock frae the mountain- crest — Spare the sweet May wind, though it decks our bowers, And showers us lilies and rains us flowers — Spare the sang o’ the thrush, though its sang is sweet — Lend a month o’ winter to summer’s heat — Bid the singing burnie do nought but mane — The life o’ the land, kind cummer, is gane. ‘ And o’ her wanton tricks and her pranks, How the flooded burns leaped over their banks — How the bonny sloops on the Solway faem,; Through the sundering brine, came snoring hame; But dule to the ship that sailed the saut sea, And broughtnae cummer her bountith and fee — Now the waves whelm, and the widows mane, The ruler o’ waves, our cummer, is gane ‘ She’s sained, and shrouded, and doomed to the mools — Now wanton hizzies and cutty stools Will swarm i’ the kirks, and there will be wailin ’, For cummer, in cottage, in manor, and mailen; The dainty bridegroom may stint in his pride, Wha will dish out in lily-white linens the bride, And whisper a cannie kind word in her ear, When she’s blushing blude-red wi’ maidenly fear, And spae the fate o’ the braw knave wean, Since kind and cantie auld cummer is gane. ‘ When the brown bees on the braes are swarming, And the early maid and the lark sing charming; When the summer moon ’mang the clouds is roaming, And sees me musing on some sweet woman; When my purest thoughts on a loved one tarry, On thee, my mild Cameronian Mary; Oh! then I shall miss thee as autumn wad summer, My kind, and cantie, and cannie cummer. ‘ Let John Macmukle love still to be sighing, That Quarrelwood’s more like Gomorrah than Zion, And Francie Mackittrick mourn that the lord O’ creation’s as steeve as the steel o’ his sword; Let Willie Dargavel sigh on to be sinning Wi’ a rosie lass in landered linen; And wee Jamie Dobie like to be roaming Whare the cakes are brown, and the flagons foaming; And Mary Macmukle’s bright eyes cease to rain Love owre the wide earth, and make silly man vain; And Annan, and Nith, and the sweet simmering stream O’ Ae, be as mute and gone by as a dream; Birds may leave the pure air, fish may fly the clear river, But my cummer’s proud name lives for ever and ever.
Ye citizens of London towne, And wyves so faire and fatte, Behold a gueste of high re nowne, Grete Whyttingtone his Catte. The king hathe ynn hys towre of state, Beares Lyons and alle thatt — But hee hathe notte a beste so grete, Ass Whyttingtone hys Catte. This Catte doth notte a Catte ap peare, Beeying too bigge fore thatt, But herre attendants all do weare Som tokyn off a Catte. The one hath whyskerrs thicke as burres, Most comelye to looke atte — Another wears a gown of furres, The liverye of the Catte. She doth not creep along the floors, But stands, or else lies flatte, Whyles they must gamebol on all foures, Whoso would please the Catte. A cunning monkey of the law, As by the fire he satte, To picke hys nuts out, used ye paw Of Whyttingtone his Catte. But Whyttington discovered plain What this vile ape was atte — Who failed thus his nuttes to gain, And only singed the Catte. &c. &c. &c.
Deep in the earth the foundation is planted, Gaily I work, but more blocks here are wanted. Here they are, master, here they are plenty, We can supply them twenty on twenty; Hither we waft, on our high-soaring pinion, The very best blocks of the Cockney do minion. Here’s Hunt, with a crown of a scattery irra diance, Which holds all the bards of Bow-bell in alle giance. This, studded with pimples, is Lecturer Hazlitt, Stinking and sparkling, as if ’twere with gas lit. Here’s Corny Webb, and this other, an please ye, Is Johnny Keats;— how it smells of mag nesia. Here is a block, and few blocks can be greater, Mr Leslie, the glorious refrige rator. Here is another, in shape of a bullock, By his dim dirty eye you may know ’tis M‘ Culloch. Here’s Parr (alias Pore ) a block of much merit; This low-looking lump is poor common-place Terrot; This little bunch, by its weight, seems a bailie; And here is a hamper that never will fail ye, The hardest, the heaviest blocks ever seen, sir, For I’ve brought all the beasts of John Scot’s Maga zine, sir; But we are losing our time in de scribing, Here at a slap we throw the whole tribe in; We tried their value while hitherward flitting, For in London, by luck, were the Aldermen sitting. There, with our lumber, a short time we stood, sir, To weigh it ’gainst Aldermen Waithman and Wood, sir; But the blocks of the Row, to all others su perior, To the weights of Guildhall I own are in ferior; And a by-standing Irishman, one Patrick Deasy, When he saw us comparing them, cried out, Be easy, Your blockheads are very good blockheads, but faith man, They will ne’er be such blockheads as Wood or as Waithman. Ho! bring me mortar, my building to fasten. Here, with a compost, we merrily hasten; ’Tis a mash of the gin-bibbing clubs’ resolutions, Which in alehouses meet, to concoct revolutions. Here are the oracles too of the sots, man, Statesman, Examiner, Black Dwarf, and Scotsman, Republican, Register—all of the rabble Who in country or town spit their venomous gabble. Hunt threw in, to season this worshipful mash, a Hamper of coculus, gentian, and quassia; * † Sir Dick gave the dung that he ventures to mute on The glories of Europe, our Wellesley and Newton; Wax was added by Preston, that patriot of leather, And pestleman Watson then brayed all to gether. Ho! a stone from the north! a strong stone for the corner! Here is a stone which, when wrought by a Horner, Sparkled in colours of yellow and azure, As the best bit of glass you e’er bought from a glazier : But now ’tis grown cloudy; I much am a fraid, it Mourns its brilliancy gone, and its fine colours faded, And the lip of contempt has been showering its spittle Upon it of late, which has wet it a little. Ho! for the cornice bring ornaments suiting! We, in the shape of reviewers went rooting, And here have brought up, from the modern Par nassus, The principal flowers of its principal asses; False figures, false tropes, false language, false reason, True venom, true blasphemy, very true treason, Mixed with true affectation, true mimini pimini, In fact, what you find in Endymion and Rimini. Here’s Apoller, and Windar, and Hannar, and Laurar, And phrases which strike all the muses with horror. Here’s a gay whistling brine, and ships swirling upon it; ‡ And here’s a jerked feather that swales’in a bonnet, Come, stick them up, you will find them as fine a’, As gingerbread-gold, copper-lace, of cracked china. Who brings me diamonds, or emeralds, or rubies? Here’s what’s as good for bedazzling the boobies; We bring a thousand impressions so proper Of his Majesty’s visage in good-looking copper; We were attending a radical meeting, Where nine-tenths were gulls, whom the one-tenth was cheating; At the end, says the chief, in dispersing the poison, “ Come, come, subscribe, ’tis to carry the cause on, Down with your cash, all I ask is a penny;” And the pence were put down by the chucklepate many. We genii, you know, in a moment de tected The laugh-in-the-sleeve of the rogues who col lected, And followed unseen, ’till we saw them all seated, Full of hopes of the spoil, but these hopes were soon cheated, For among them we swooped, and away in a minute We whipt with their box, and the coppers all in it, And left them all dumb, both with grief and a mazement, Looking, some up the chimney, some out of the casement; At last, off they sneaked, puzzled, thirsty, and hungry, And swore this was worse even than base borough mongry. Who brings me pictures of dainty de vising? Here they are friend, far superior to pricing. This sketch of a woe-begone gang of ban ditti, Whose looks more you fear; yet incline you to pity, Is the famed all the talents, the great oppo sition, The Tory’s contempt, the Reformer’s de rision; How well done is each face! Indeed ’tis well known, Sir, * That Methuen and Freemantle painted. their own, Sir, Look, there’s Peter Moore! He is wisely pour trayed in : The part of great Bottom by greasy-pate Haydon; The ass-head is so like in expression and feature, You must see it was Peter who sat for the creature. Here’s—but in describing my talent is scanty, Go send to Auld Reekie to fetch Dille tanti. Who brings me gold for the purpose of framing? Patience! Here’s gold! Yellow gold! see ’tis flaming, With a bright shining lustre. ’Tis I who was lucky In following Birkbeck beyond far Ken tucky; The wealth of old Crœsus, the wealth of the fairies Is nothing compared with the wealth of the prairies. Though the climate is sickly, the land foul and swampy, The day-hole you live in, cold, dirty, and dampy, The society vile, the mere scum of cre ation, A fraudulent runaway base popu lation, ’Tis the country of gold—gold grows on its mountains, Gold paves all its streets†—and it springs from its fountains; You must own it is true, for friend Birkbeck de clares it, Flower vouches the fact, Mr Madison swears it, Then believe it, my lads, or confess you are asses, When you see in our hands such huge native gold masses. Silk! bring me silk to bedeck the in terior! Here’s paper, an ornament vastly su perior, Here’s a ton of petitions, and, what can be sager, Drivelled forth by the dam ‘ of reform, the old Major; Here’s a speech full of ignorance, nonsense, and blunders, By that great rhetorician‡ feu Lord Maire de Londres; Here’s another by Becher,§ which snapt in the middle Like Hudibras’ tale of the bear and the fiddle; Here’s a bundle of sheets (from a snuff-man. we got ’em ) Filled with only four words from the top to the bottom, You scarcely need ask who had wind to in vent ’em, For ’tis plain at a glance it was Jeremy Bentham : And here are some thousand unsaleable numbers, Whose weight Mr Constable’s warehouses cumbers. Who for the palace-gate brings me fit pillars? Astride of *M‘Culloch we pranced from Bob Miller’s, And galloped in paces most lubberly antic To our beast’s favourite pasture across the At lantic, O’er the grave of Tom Paine, we saw going to rob it, The Atlas of England, P. Porcupine Cobbett; He broke it all up in as sad a con dition As he broke in his grammar the head of old Priscian, And he trotted away with the bones and the coffin † Of him against whom he so long had been scoffing; ‡ But we tore them away from the back of the schemer, And have brought you the bones of the brandy bla sphemer; So stick up for your pillars each mouldering dry bone, Backbone, and breastbone, shankbone, and thighbone. And here are some grinders, a fit deco ration, Which we tore from the jaws of the Whig popu lation; The party is now just as mumping and toothless,§ As it always was heartless and faithless and truthless; We called to untooth them your friend the gay dentist, Dr Scott, the best poet that ever was ’ prenticed. I must beat the curst grinders as strait as an arrow. Ho! of brass for the roof bring me quick a whole barrow. Here’s a cartload of brass of the very best colour, Which we gleaned from the faces of Hunt, Hone, and Wooler; Here’s another, which we with much science have taken From the front of a certain chirurgical deacon;ǁ From their patrons in parliament, too, we have some, Sir, Got from Lambton and Tierney, small Newport, and Brougham, Sir. Poor devils! since now all their brass is ab stracted, How shabbily each of their parts will be acted! But on crossing the channel, if great Dan O’ Connell, ¶ Or Oriflam Dromgool, or ** ’Neas M‘ Donnell, Will indulge them by rubbing their foreheads to theirs, Sir, They soon will resume their superb brazen glare, Sir, For so touched every face will shine forth, aye will it, As bright as the base of a new copper skillet. Who a fit spire for the turret has got to carry? We, from the hands of a cockney apothe cary, †† Brought off this pestle, with which he was capering, Swearing and swaggering, rhyming and vapouring; Seized with a fit of poetical fury, (I thought he was drunk, my good sir, I as sure ye ) With this he was scattering, all through the whole house, Gallipot, glisterbag, cataplasm, bolus; While the poor ’prentices at him were staring, Or perhaps in their minds a strait waistcoat pre paring, Loud he exclaimed, “ Behold here’s my truncheon; * I’m the Marshal of poets—I’ll flatten your nuncheon. Pitch physic to hell, you rascals, for damn ye, a — I’ll physic you all with a clyster of Lamia.” Scared at the name, in a moment we darted, Whipt the pestle away, and from cockney-land parted. Here on the top of the palace I place it, Such a building requires such a finish to grace it.
“ Wandering about in forests old, When the last purple colour is waxing faint.” Blue is the bosom of the sunless lake, O’er which the laden pinnance gently glides; The living waters sparkle round its sides, As if instinct with spirit, and a wake; In crimson light the peak of Benve nue Is mantled o’er; the wooded Trosachs frown, And throw, with cumbrous gloom, their shadows down, Like giants girt with sackcloth : softly blue, A beauteous canopy of sky im pends; While, ’mid the temple of the glowing west, Piercing the cloudless element, a scends Benlomond’s conic spire and lordly crest, And nought disturbs the breathless silence, save The night breeze murmuring thro’ the goblin cave.
Oh! who would think, in cheerless soli tude, Who o’er these twilight waters glided slow, That genius, with a time-surviving glow, These wild lone scenes so proudly hath em bued! Or that from “ ‘ hum of men” so far re mote, Where blue waves gleam, and mountains darken round, And trees with broad boughs shed a gloom pro found, A poet here should from his tractless thought Elysian prospects conjure up, and sing Of bright achievements in the olden days, When chieftain valour sued for Beauty’s praise, And magic virtues charmed St Fillan’s spring; Until in worlds, where Chilian mountains raise Their cloud-capt heads, oak souls should wing Hither their flight to wilds, whereon I gaze.
Alight breeze curls the Leven’s silver tide, Spread like a sheet around yon rocky isle, Whereon, in ruined hoariness, a pile Uprears its massy walls in castled pride; The sunbeams, shooting o’er a morning cloud, Fall on it, and display the shrivelled trees Blasted and tall, their thin leaves in the breeze Fluttering, like plumes above a funeral shroud : The blue-winged sea-gull, with a wailing shriek, Sails round it; and, on high, the sable rook Perches in peace—no more ’tis doomed to brook Man’s domination—but, with aspect meek, Crumbles to ruin, year, and month, and week, Voiceless, and with a melancholy look!
Aspirit hath been here—the dry bones live — A magic halo round these towers is spread; Each tree uprears a green and branching head; And bells to the evening wind their curfew give — Lovely, in Recollection’s gifted eye, Sits Mary—while, around, her faithful train, To cheer her prisoned solitude, in vain Many an artifice unwearied try. ’Tis night—the postern gates are locked, and lo! A crowded small boat stretches for the shore — The warder, turning to the flood be low, Listens, and starts to hear the plashing oar — The gun rebounds—and by its flash is seen, Upon the midnight lake, the escaping Queen!
“ The hoary druid saw thee rise, And planting there his guardian spell, Sung forth the dreadful pomp to swell Of human sacrifice.” How beautiful, beneath the morning sky, The level sea outstretches like a lake, Serene, when not a zephyr is a wake To curl the gilded pendant gliding by :— Within a bowshot druid Icolm kill Presents its time-worn ruins, hoar and grey, A monument of Eld remaining still, Lonely, when all its brethren are a way. Dumb things may be our teachers; is it strange That aught of death is perishing! Come forth, Like rainbows show diversity of change And fade away—Aurora of the north! Where altars rose, and choral virgins sung, And victims bled, the sea-bird rears her young!
Amid this vast, tremendous soli tude, Where nought is heard except the wild wind’s sigh, Or savage raven’s deep and hollow cry, With awful thought the spirit is em bued!— Around—around, for many a weary mile, The Alpine masses stretch; the heavy cloud Cleaves round their brows, concealing with its shroud Bleak, barren rocks, unthawed by summer’s smile. Nought but the desart mountains and lone sky Are here;— birds sing not, and the wandering bee Searches for flowers in vain; nor shrub, nor tree, Nor human habitation greets the eye Of heart-struck pilgrim; while around him lie Silence and desolation, what is he!
Where Indian village ’mid the grove of palms, Her shadowed cots conceals; and devious path Now guides the traveller past the peasant’s door; Where sable child, amid his eager play, Disparts from sparkling eye his clustered locks, To gaze at man of Europe passing strange;— Now winds through garden rich with trees of fruit, Where slenderest arec* waves her silvery stalk Amid her brethren palms; or widening leads Where eager damsels crowd the morning well, Their earliest, coolest, draught unsoiled to draw; And Indian beauty shews her sable charms, In sylph-like grace, not undelightful seen, Or speaks in downcast eyes, as traveller looks, Her ebon-mantled blush : There, built apart, Where opener site invites the seaward breeze, A neater house mid verdant garden stands; Whose herbs and flowerets, watered due at eve, Defy the sun, and thrive in arid sand. There lives a man of Europe; brown with toil, And many a fiery climate; hoar with age, Yet cheerful, healthy; living now at ease, A soldier long; receiving here reward Of many a day of toil and scene of blood : For years on upland Indian plains has lived, With men whose unaccustomed ears would shrink To hear an English word: has fought the wars Of England, only Englishman, the rest A band of sable warriors, trained to know The arts of British battle; Veteran now— In childhood came to Ind : can recollect But few and faint the early scenes of home; Where born, he scarcely knows: a wood, a hill, Perchance a glittering lake, recalls to mind, Or antique spire of grove-embosomed church; On these with fondness dwell his thoughts entranced, As men recall the faintly imaged face Of mother dead in early infancy; Or like the dream mid reaper’s hour of rest, Who sinks to sleep beside his gathered sheaves, And wakes, by comrade called to join the toil Of harvest’s eager field;— from beauteous dream, To busy work aroused. His Indian cot Is deck’d with pictured scenes of British clime; Perchance some church on verdant hillock placed, With space of sacred ground, where frequent stands The monument of village ancestry; Or, haply, scene of many a childish sport, Some frozen lake by skaiters lightly skimmed, Where high cascade from wintry rocks is urged, And forms its spray to thousand glittering shapes Of caves and forests wild; by Indian guest Oft deemed the magic halls to Genii given, Where shadowy trees with jewels sparkling bloom. And oft the Veteran’s dreaming fancy seeks, Amid these random scenes, resemblance faint, Of youthful haunts by flickering memory loved In age and foreign land. Of earliest friends That with him left their native English shore, But one, perchance, or two are now alive, And those in other kingdoms; all the rest, Like snowdrop flowers that fade from warmer sun, Have withering died; and yearly crowds of more Have since arrived, and withered too like them— Leaving few relicts; like the aged trees, That, scattered lonely o’er some range of heath, But shew where ancient forest once has been; Or, like the isles that mid some flooded land, Rise, monuments of countries drowned beneath. Sad relicts they! through many a peril come Of battle, siege, and long and deadly march In burning sun, or floods of Indian rain; And often snatched from brink of yawning grave, When sickness raged destroying; grateful some, Expectant still of death; while others live And careless laugh, and think their frames are made Of stuff too hard for Indian clime to wear. Not he of whom I speak; his dangers past Have taught that Heaven has power to try him still; For hard adversity had tamed his youth, And discipline instilled; as cautious hind ( When round his infant wheat the wintry frost Has bound protecting soil, and guards its roots ) Sends forth his eager flock, the ranker shoots To tame; and sees, when comes the softening spring, Its roots more deeply firm, its verdant blade To stronger height, and richer harvest grown. Thus Heaven had Hubert’s young luxuriance tamed By many an ill; and thus had kindly given For suffering youth, a firm and wiser age. Through many a soldier’s danger he had passed, Where hard escape had trained his grateful heart To thoughts submiss; had lived in deathful lands Where chilly night descends with wings of ice On plains still faint with heat of feverish day — Where sluggish morn reclines in aguish pain, Amid her gathered mists, till saddened sun, Seen through the vapoury mass slow rising dim, Bids shivering men rush forth from couches chill, To catch his earliest gleam, whose waxing heat, Soon sickening grows, and scorches all the air. Here fever’s serpent fangs had stung the camp, Like fiery snake, winged viewless through the air; And round him, dropping fast, had comrades fallen. Oft,—very oft,—from march of fainting day, To gladsome rest arrived, one friendly hand With him had reared the tent, had strewed the couch, Had spread their wearied camel’s store of food, Then sat to talk of British home beloved, Till eve’s repast; yet, ere the hour had come So near esteemed, the burning shaft of death, That friend had felt,—slow carried forth a corse Beyond the camp; whose every nightly site, Might Indian wanderers know by range of graves Amid their desart seen. Such dangers passed, Had taught the Veteran old to own the hand Of God in all, and still entreat his care : And, next to Heaven, with grateful heart he tells Of friends of former days; among them all Her dearest, whose connubial care had soothed His bitterest ills; in sickness dressed his couch, Contrived some kindlier drink, some easier food, When loathing heart had long rejected all, And fainted, sick of life; had watched his bed When death seemed watching near her; fanned his face With cooling air, and warded off the fly, That, ominous of death, alighting pressed His moveless lips. What though her cheek was dark? Though Moorish prattle mixed with English word, Spoke quaintly oft? And though her Indian modes Seemed oft demure and shy? Was love like her’s Deserving less of all an English heart Can grateful give? Or can her fondling pride In English husband less affection meet From him whom thus she loved? Beside him now, At sultry noon, she loves at ease to sit, Beneath the cooler shade, and, pleased, beholds Her friends and Indian neighbours crowd to seek His aid or counsel, him advise or help, And sometimes chide—superior still to all, And still beloved—by her beloved the most. Here too, at times, the Veteran’s daughter comes The young Phoolranee,* bred from earliest youth In modes demure of Indian maid to live, And all retired their haram-veil to wear : Yet had the damsel’s heart in childhood learned, ( In tales of wonder told by British sire,) Of dames who lived in England’s freer world, The friends, not slaves of men; as hears the nun, With beating breast, some strange and glowing tale Of fields and groves, where maids are free to roam, And swains return their love. Her bounding youth Had thus been taught the Eastern chains to mock, That wrap in ignorance the female heart, And bind its manners cold; her sparkling eye Told what her breast had from her sire acquired Of British fire, and laughed, with maiden’s scorn, At many an Indian lover’s proffered suit, Whom, sportive, yet she loved at times to hear, In tongue familiar, speak the words of love, And pour, in mellowest voice, her native songs To British lips denied : but all his arts, Mere flitting pastime, fled her altered mind When tale sincere of British love was told, By him her father loved. Phoolranee thus, Like playful fawn, had passed her maiden life— A matron now, she brings at eve her son To meet her parents near their cottage tree, And sooth, with filial care, their lonelier day Of setting age. There, too, her father loves To fondle o’er his grandchild, loves to trace The hues of Europe brightening o’er his cheek, And think himself restored again to home In this sweet child of hope; whilst near his knee The young Phoolranee sits, and, smiling, asks, If her young Henry’s brow be not as fair As was his grandsire’s? thinks her careful eye May sap his youth untinged by Indian sun, And see him bloom as did his sire, when first From England come, the ruddy vision pressed Those pallid shores. For much Phoolranee’s heart Around her Briton clung; and well she loved, When he, from war’s wild roaming toils released, Could wend with her at eve, to sooth with talk Of Britain’s distant land her aged sire, And teach his lisping son the words of home. And he too fondly loved; for here, at last, From roamings wild, o’er many a region far, The wandering youth had found again a home, And hearts to yield him love. His country left, Where step-dame’s frown had chilled his father’s hearth, And sent, unfledged, the younglings forth to stray, A cheerless path the erring youth had trode, Amid the desart world; like traveller lone Amid the dreary sands of barren Zaar, Who, fainting, thinks that here his bones shall bleach Before the lonely sun; when lo! at morn Some green oasis, ’mid the sea-like waste, Appears to bless despair, whose trees of shade And fields of verdure, more delightful seem To wanderer’s feverish heart and eyes inflamed. Thus he once roamed; and thus, at last, had found Amid the wild a home. Phoolranee’s love Had soothed his wandering heart, and given him here Sweet resting place. Her reverend sire to him Was more than father: skilled to sooth the mind By long unkindness torn, and scarce withheld ( To wild defiance urged of men’s repute ) In fierce excess forgetfulness to seek— He stood the wayward orphan’s generous friend; And mildly thus his long-neglected youth To inward peace and soft content reclaimed; And gratitude and love gave high reward :— The Veteran gained a son, the youth a sire, And young Phoolranee’s love endeared the bond. At eve before his cot the Veteran sat, In cheerful talk with all his gladsome groupe :— His wife beloved, his young Phoolranee’s child, And her, his idol late ( who now but gave Divided love ), beside her husband placed; And there, while beamed affection’s tranquil smile In every eye, loved each, with grateful heart, His train of ills endured, in turn to tell, Which thus to wearied minds had brought repose. And first, to friends around, the veteran loved To trace the wide campaign his steps had passed, His hardships felt, his train of changes seen; And long, and strange, I wot, the various tale, In wonders rife, and versed in names deceased. On many a feat of war his youth had gone With old commanders, now forgotten all; And many a favouring witness he could cite Of young exploits, and arduous duty done, From names his younger auditors but know In history; so fleet the passing crowds Arrive, perform their parts, return, or die, On stage of Indian life. His age prolonged, Has seen each circle, man by man, decay, And every place by newer men supplied, Till all the ranks were new—and new again— Like crops of withering leaves successive shed! What contrast strange the passing years have brought To Hubert’s hoary age! he tells of wars With hostile princes, whose successors now Are Britain’s firmest allies :— vanquished kings That private now in peaceful splendour live, Forgot as kings—with British merchants long Familiar neighbours :— tells of marches far, Through foeman’s land, to countries lying now Embosomed round by Britain’s sole domain; Of castle, gained by long and fierce assault From warlike bands of prowling ravagers, That now, dismantled, sleeps on rocky hill, Unnoted seen from villages secure; While ’mid its ruined walls the scrambling goat Seeks, perched on hinder legs, at leisure round The tufts of grass from mouldering crevices, ’Mid breach once moistened red with soldier’s blood; And ’neath its arch, whose threatening portals once Were wont to pour abroad the greedy bands Of swarming robbers, now from upmost stone The hiving bees, like bunch of ripening grapes, Wave pendulous unharmed, as glides the breeze Along that grass-grown porch : around its tank Where ready bandits mustered once their steeds, To sweep in thunder down the trembling vale, The herdsman stalks at noon, and marks the depth Where bathes his sluggish buffalo, concealed Beneath the level flood, absorbing glad The watery coolness through his mammoth bulk, A quiet ruin all; where Hubert once Had seen the demon terror hold his den, And send his minions forth to work of death, How changed the better scene!— The troublous wars ( That once in chaos wide had strewed the plain With wrecks of kingdoms) now have cleared a place Where British skill has reared, in giant strength, Mid Indian anarchy, the bulwarks high Of civil order. Hubert’s youth had passed With those who, mid the fierce turmoil of war, Those bulwarks high (like him who Salem’s walls* Amid her foes erected) watchful built, With girded swords, and warders set to watch Marauding foemen’s spear; and now he saw The splendid structure raised to firmest strength;— Saw kings, that once in proud defiance fought To baulk the rising power, imploring now Her friendly shield, to check marauding storm By former allies poured, whose plundering sword As yet untamed, its choicest riches seeks In spoils of peaceful vale or labouring town. And oft th’ exulting Veteran loved to point Where daily still the choice of India’s tribes From all her troubled countries, seek the shade Of British power, industrious there to ply, Unawed by despot greed, their arts of wealth. As flock from beating waves and seas of foam The frightened ocean-birds, to some-vast rock That rises safe amid the wildest storm. Such theme the Veteran told. Then loved his wife ( Goonkulee once, the maid of Indian cot, Now Mary† named) to paint the various scenes Of all her chequered life. How peaceful first, With sire and mother loved, her life had passed. In native cot on Agimerian fields; Where level plains bid gladdened farmers spread Wide inundation feeding all the land, For ricy culture rich; while safely stored Mid loftiest arms of branchy village tree, ‡Their gathered corn defies the flooding rain, In yearly wealth :— There o’er the boundless plain The white pagoda meets the onward view, O’er guava groves and fields of marshy rice, Bright glittering seen from all the fruitful plain, Like distant sail on ocean’s edge descried. There too, in playful youth she oft had marked, Upraised on tree mid village-garden placed, Blue hills, emerging low, like clouds of eve, Afar beyond the plain; and oft had shrunk (Rejoicing still in native home secure) As matrons told how mid those mountains far Wild men held savage dens, who (aided oft By a of genii) rushed on fields beneath With wings of fire, and gave in plunder all Their quiet homes to death. Alas! the storm Whose pictures oft, in fancy’s wildness dressed, Had pleased with wondrous tale her childish years, In horror real approached. Some rajah’s band, Whom hill-closed wilds had fed to savage strength, Burst every bar that wont of yore to stop. Their fierce descent, and rushed along the plain To sweep their prey, and spoil with track of fire The peopled country far—whose scattered cots By wreaths of rising smoke might now be marked, Erst hid by groves of fruit. Her hapless sire, With all his infant children, driven from home, Had wandered houseless far; o’er toilsome hills And roaring mountain-streams, to her unknown, And strangest seeming all, their paths were urged; Dark height of rocks and depth of savage vales Had hid their restless flight, when death itself Seemed less terrific far than such escape, When chanced her Hubert—stranger then—to spy ( As came his friendlier troop to chase the foe) Amid the rugged hills their tattered booth, With palm-tree’s gathered boughs for shelter made, And peeping low from forest’s wild recess; While she in terror near the portal sat, Repast to cook of herbs, uncertain culled Amid the wilderness. He came—and smiled, As she, with all her crowd of sisters young, (Who sought from her the care of mother lost) Fled stranger’s* kind approach : but soon her sire From search of fruits returned, his friendship knew, And she, by kindness won, had learned to love The Christian stranger. Thence had peaceful rest Returned to bless her sire; for Hubert’s love Had taught his age the sure protection given Beneath the British power, and all her friends Mid scenes of thriving toil had placed secure; While she through years of many a troublous war Had shared his love, and grateful soothed his cares; On battle’s eve had washed his bleeding wounds; In lands where strangers die had shewn the herbs To Indian matrons known; on rugged march Had washed his feet, and cooked his eve’s repast, And waited duteous near; nor, oft though urged In kindred’s home to live, had left his side In toil or fear. His day of honoured rest Had now arrived, and she with him enjoyed Reward and peace. No name of kindred else She sought, and none remained : her aged sire, Content and glad, had long at ease remained Beside his sons, and loved to see their wealth In hoarded savings grow; till came the tale, That peace at last had blessed again his home, And slept its wealthy peasant now secure Beneath the British shield; then late revived The slumbering hope that there his length of days Yet glad might end : his children, too, rejoiced, Of gathered wealth enjoyment there to find, And o’er those scenes to walk, whose fostered charms In song or tale their sire had loved to paint, To sooth their infant years in stranger’s land. As thus she spoke, seemed saddest thoughts to cloud The youthful Briton’s eye: her words had led His wandering mind to England’s native shore, Where he must ne’er return! The love of home Burst o’er his opening heart like pouring flood, And swallowed every thought. The walks endeared Of earliest days, the scenes of youthful love, Like living pictures rose. As mid the wild, Where fainting traveller speeds with Arab guide, And through the sun-beat desert looks in vain For place of sheltering rest, the sudden scenes Of towns and fields in airy vision rise Before his wondering eye;* he sees the spires, The river’s busy throng, the bustling streets, And gay surrounding walks, of beauteous town, His destined place of rest; and listening tries To catch the wonted hum that meets the ear, From busy city near. Alas! the scene, Mere shadowy form, by wandering radiance shown, But cheats with idlest hope his wearied heart, And mid the desart melts again to air! Thus o’er the Briton’s heart the thoughts of home In memory’s vivid trance came pictured bright, Recalling wild each hope and latent wish, That erst had slept unknown. His wife, his child, So long belov’d, seemed now but chains to bind His eager steps. The wish was all suppressed, But, half unconscious, thus his ardent soul Betrayed to eye of love its working thoughts. Sweet hopes of native home! how many a heart That pines in cities vast or climes afar Is soothed by thee! Amid the various crowds Whom Britain’s fame around her Indian marts Continual draws, what heart but fondly looks To some dear home for rest! The Arab’s eye, With love more deep than even his prophet asked, To Mecca daily turns :† the Persian’s heart Sends fondest wish with every ship that seeks His lov’d ‡Iran : to wild Tibetian hills, ǁFar Erzeroum, and China’s guarded coast Or rich Malaya’s isle-bestudded sea, How many an anxious sigh is daily sent, By strangers met on Britain’s thronged bazars! Not all the kind protection there bestowed, Can fill the wistful heart that pants for home, And seeks but riches here that home to grace. Such hopes as these the stout Telinga cheer, Amid his days of toil : the sire, the wife, Are all intent to earn; each eager hand To full employment called, the door is latched, And all the busy family abroad, Save grandam blind, or sire of silvered hair : Even softest damsels ply the willing thrift, Allured by hopes of home; and eager toil Beneath the mid-day sun in cheerful groupe, While gladdening song recalls the scenes beloved Of native mountains dear, and vallies wild. Such song the traveller stills his pace to hear, But may not gaze—for, like the cuckoo wild, Whose fairy note from prying footstep flies, Their bashful ditty shuns the stranger’s gaze, And drops to timid silence. Busier ply The maiden groupe their toil, as traveller charmed, Awaits their syren note, unconscious they Of all the free simplicity of dress That gives their forms unveiled a softer grace In stranger’s eye, and bids his fancy dream Of primal times of innocence and love. But near the bashful groupe of damsels young, Some aged matron sits, of mien composed, And careful eye, to awe unlicenced gaze— And, haply too, some infant child to guard, Whose new-wed mother plies her customed toil Amid companions yet of maiden life; While oft with fondest care her eye is turned To where her infant sleeps, and lists her ear If chance the sable urchin whimpering wake. But all in careless sleep that infant lies, From slanting poles in airy hammock swung, Secure from speckled snake, and shaded cool By densest leaves of banian’s spreading bough— And thence at times, with head upraised, he peeps To catch his mother’s smile; as high from nest, Amid the rocky steep securely placed, The swallow’s youngling eyes its coming dam, And looks with wondering gaze on all the scene Of world as yet untried—where many a wing Thrids swift and strange the airy space below. Thus thought the youth, but sooth even whilst he thought His purpose all was lost; amidst the words, Where first his wandering speech had found its theme, His eye had met Phoolranee’s gaze of love, That seemed in anxious grief to scan his thoughts, And know his hidden wish for home beloved, Herself but hindrance felt; and whilst she gazed, Her child, that saw her grief, had left his lap To wipe her starting tear, and kiss her cheek, Inquiring why she wept. The infant’s deed Was more than strong reproof; and love like her’s What dream of native land could e’er restore? He owned her worth, and bade her terrors cease— Her land was now his home. Old Hubert smiled In sympathy with him, and love to her; Then sought in cheerful tale his son to lead To gladder thoughts; or kindliest sought to tell With what attentive hand his country tries To bless the age of veterans old and worn, Whose faithful years in her encounters spent, Have all those hopes of blissful home forgone That bid the exile mourn,—whose countries far In youth or childhood left, are now estranged, Nor hold one heart, whose pulse would beat with love, To grant the wanderers home. And oft he sought, As came the punctual day of month elapsed That gives such hoary band the stipend due Of age released from toil, his son to lead, To meet their gathered groupe. * O’er village plain To neighbouring wood they speed, whose shadowy depth Is scarcely yet by glimmering dawn illumed, There waits the veteran band their destined meed By British hand dispensed. At distance seen Romantic seems the view like fairy scene, Where walk the forms of strange Arabian tale, In world for genii framed. Amid the grove, Some lean by shadowy banian’s rooted bough, With turbaned listeners drawn attentive round; † Whilst some by low enchannelled wall recline, That guides the hoarded rill from neighbouring tank The plantains green to feed; by naked tree, Whose reddening blossoms deck the leafless branch, One waiting groupe is seen; whilst others walk, In lonely meditation, down the ranks Of tall columnar palms. Like shadows all In silence gliding dim, with languid step Of grave-approaching age, and decked with robe Of patriarchal time, they seem the ghosts Of strange Elysian field, to hero shewn Mid regions wild of death. But nearer come, And mingling thro’ the crowd, the pictured scene That pleased the idle eye, is sudden lost In living sympathy : appears around In social groupes, a venerable band Of aged men, in every various garb Of India’s hundred tribes, from many a field And many a lengthened war the remnants left; Like dropping leaves that clothe December’s oak, When all the forest round has long been stripped. They meet and talk; each face recalls to each A thousand gone; and all the ceaseless hum That floats along the breeze from aged tongues In words of former years, and names of men Long dead. The present world of living things Is there forgot; while hoary memory tells Her ghostly tale, and all the ancient groupes Commix their stories wild of other years And generations gone. Old Hubert sees In each an ancient friend, and passing reads In every face a history, where else, As strangers see in armies ranged for shew, Were merely pictures dumb. His ready tale Thus bids his son the various soldiers know That pass around. Yon dark Telinga old, Whose ebon cheek is decked with silvery beard, Like glade of snow ’mid hill of wintry pines, Has o’er Malayan seas and Bornean Gulf, Through every lurking bay and islet wild, The pirate chaced. There, leaning o’er his staff, He boasts to listening crowds, that now secure, Protected safe by ship where he has fought, The weak Chinese may steer his crowded bark With curious riches fraught, thro’ every strait Where savage Buggis haunted once the creeks, And darted plundering forth. Of lighter tints Yon tall Mahratta seems, on upland plains A mountain soldier bred; his veteran eye, Tho’ dimmed by age, yet glows with parting fire, Like beacon shining far amid the gray Approach of cloudy morn; his ardent youth On Ras-ol-Khyma, den of pirates, saw The British thunder burst. See, both are met, Their tales to interchange of British war On China’s Yellow Seas, or Yemen’s Red, From orient Timor’s far and wildest bound To Afric’s haunted shore, where ocean’s width Of pirate bands was cleared. See, lonely stalks Yon Rajahpoot, on northern mountains bred, By age not lessening strength released from toil, Whose tribe’s whole craft is arms,—whose fathers passed Their unrewarded lives amid the bands Of Indian prince :— he boasts his better fate, That rose in British camp to rank and wealth, And now in honoured age enjoys the meed To faith and valour due; his children, called To join the war where late their father fought, Await, like him, the soldier’s fair reward, Or wealth, or honoured death (the prospect sole Their tribe requires) nor desperate need to join, As wont their sires of old, the lawless chief, Whose hated bands were fed to savage strength For plundering war. One veteran walks apart, Whose cheek in thinner garment careless wrapped, Scarce heeds the chilling morn; he smiles to mark His shivering comrades muffled close from air, With turbands folded thick, and mantles drawn Around their heads.—Observe his fairer hue, That tells his mountain birth, and youth inured To hills of Rohilcund and Indian snows. Through many a clime his riper years have passed Of insalubrious name; o’er wilds of Cutch, Where sluggish flows the Run; Barodrah, hid Amid the full Nerbuddah’s aguish plain, The Jungles* deep of southern Malabar, And arid plains that parch the traveller’s life In Middle Ind. All these his years have seen And traced in all the fierce Pindarrie’s* haunt, Yet triumph still in sinews unsubdued. Yon man of stooping age, whose shivering limbs Scarce patient seem the chilly morn to bear, Was once a soldier stout : the Ebon staff, Where press his leaning hands, is trophy ta’en From arbor, loved by old Tippoo Sultaun, In triumph half, and half in pity kept. Yon Moslem old, from earliest chiidhood bred Amid the British camp, scarce deigns to own A different kindred; flows the English tongue Like native Hindoostānee o’er his speech; And oft with pride the hardy veteran tells How side by side he stood with English bands, To meet on isles of France the Frenchman’s sword,† And drive him headlong back. That glory shared Yon dark Hindoo, whose mien, subdued and mild, Seems scarce for soldier meet; yet firm and brave, By Briton’s side he met the shock of fight Like Coral—soft amid its native deeps, Yet charmed to firmest strength in upper air. And see where stalks, with folded arms and slow, Yon tall Bungalla : trained to all the skill Of British war, he joined the fierce assault That burst Batavia’s iron lines, and tamed, Thro’ smoke and blood, Cornelis desperate. fort :† A faithful soldier he; yet strict to hold Each rite of Brahman faith : with proud contempt The newer sects he views, from Indian faith By stranger’s arts allured, as traveller sees The crumbling stones by idle Arabs torn From vast Egyptian pyramid, whose heighth, Through countless time, yet unimpaired remains. Thus through the various groupe the veteran’s tale Discursive roved; and oft with grateful heart Would bid his son remark, how through the gloom Of feeblest age each soldier smiled content, And rested gladsome o’er his staff of Eld, Secure in British faith, where waning years For youthful toil with large rewards are paid. And then would Hubert piteous seek the groupe Of soldier’s widows near :— —Some wandering lone Amid the distant trees, or leaning sad Beneath the Jaca, laden with giant fruit;‡ With orphans some, a mournful burthen, charged, Their hope at once, and grief; and childless some, With no consoler near, save soldier-old, Their husband’s ancient friend, who oft had shared In wounds with him, and pestilence of camps Their nursing care.—Now, silent here and lone, With none to yield them love, and none to seek With fond caress their soft connubial care, They droop forlorn : and yet, whate’er the hand Of power can do, the widow’s heart to cheer Is here in kindness tried; no bitter fear Of haggard want shall haunt her feeble Eld, And bid her children weep; her husband’s lord Is her protector still, and fills her hand With competence : And here perchance she meets With other widowed dame, whose youthful son Has won her daughter’s love, and led her forth To share his fate, and like her mother sooth Amid the toil of camps the soldier’s cares. How fair the bonds of love! the mothers too Are thus conjoined, and each, in lonely Eld, Finds pleasures new by kindness interchanged, And hopes commingled fond in grandchild born. But ’mid the veteran bands, one friendlier voice Meets Hubert’s ear, and bids his step return :— The aged Nursoo, long his comrade loved In days of war. For Nursoo’s faithful years In British warfare many a clime had seen From green Ceylon to Kgypt’s northern lands; And many a fight the proud medallions told Had decked his breast. With him the veteran loves Beneath the shadowy grove, where sweet at morn The juicy palm-tree pours her Indian* wine, Too scan the wars and intervals of peace That pleased their youth. Old Nursoo loves to tell Of days of calm amid his native glens, When sent with English arms to guard the vale Where passed his youth, he met her kinsmen old With welcome throned in every brightening eye; And saw the peasants urge their toil secure, Or yield their thanks for his protection given, Where war late raged, and where his youth had seen, Beneath each fieldward tree the ploughman’s arms, Who, trembling, strewed his field with hopeless seed, While lurked the plunderers near. Nor less the heart Of English Hubert loves to trace the time When ’mid those Indian vales his days had passed In sweet respite from war; his sole employ The beaten foe from rocky towers to watch, And guard with Sepoy† band the peaceful vale; While all the love the grateful Indians bore To generous England, centered sole in him, Lone English slater mid their wondering crowds. Unblessed their rites of village splendor seemed, Ere came their English guest the scene to view;— Each marriage-feast with fondest care was decked, When his expected presence graced the cot;— And every village elder’s kind Salam, And smiling peasant’s daily gift of fruit, To softest kindness soothed his grateful heart, And wakes remembrance kind. But theme like this Of idling peace, old Nursoo less delights, Than tale of battles gained where Sepoy bands With faithful step unshrinking, urged advance Where’er the boldest British heart could lead, As troop the sprites of witched Arabian lamp Where’er the Sovereign Genie calls their aid. Nor less that veteran Nursoo loved to tell Of magic powers, by sprites attendant wrought (For Indian men beheld) which round her camp Still showered for Britain’s troops abundance down, And strewed Bungalan harvests o’er the wild To feed secure her banded armies vast. Then launched he forth in grateful word to shew, How ’mid the crowded camp, where black disease Filled every soul with fear, the British art Spread o’er the soldier’s life her wings of health, And tended careful all his tedious ills.— What contrast strange to scenes of Indian war! (For Nursoo’s youth had Scindia’s campments seen) Where misdirected valour useless raged, And each rebelling soldier blamed his chief, While plague and famine gnawed their armies strength. And oft the aged veteran blessed his gods That, since their hands had formed his fate for war, Their kind decrees had sent him forth to fight Beneath the buckler hung on British arm. Nor undelighted lists the partial ear Of aged Hubert, hearing thus the praise Of native England spoke by Indian tongue. For,—distant far from home,—his sleeping wish By no fond hopes ere waked to seek return— His country’s fame to him was country now, And those who owned to Britain grateful love, His opening heart as countrymen received. And oft with them the patriot veteran loves To sooth the moodier thoughts that haunt the hours Of aimless age, when turns the languid mind To thoughts of youthful days, and wild regret, With saddening cloud, bedims the cheering gleam That o’er his eve of life all brightening plays.
“ Now my own delights I make, My thirst at every rill can slake, And gladly brandy can partake, At thee, sweet Daisy! As the sun moves to rest below the wave, With streams of dazzling lustre at his feet; As sinks to death, the generous and the brave, Whose bright career, tho’ glorious, was but fleet; As when the ship whose sides the billows lave, Parts sorrowing friends in hope again to meet, So Canto first will disappear from view, When merry folks have scanned it thro’ and thro ’. But this fair sun, to-morrow’s dawn, will rise, In splendour rivalling his setting ray, The warrior, tho’ beneath the turf he lies, Will thro’ his son, still bear the palm a way : The ship that now with swelling canvas flies, Soon will return to greet its well-known bay, Thus Canto second on your view will burst, In type more perfect than did Canto first. We left, if I mistake not, Paddy Blake Waiting most anxiously for Mr Dan, Whose jolly face, expected long, would make The milk-white froth again o’ertop the can. To say the truth, our Paddy could not take His drop alone—but, as the story ran, With jovial friends, he valued not a feather To have a pull, long, strong, and all to gether. The cuckoo-clock now pointed half-past ten, And sad forebodings darken’d Paddy’s brow, His very nose grew pale, and paler, when He pictured to himself some ruffian row, Or white boys close concealed in lonely glen, Fellers alike of Christian and of cow, If Dan, thought he, be met by such as these, No ale to-night he’ll taste, nor bread, nor cheese. That times are honester must be con fess’d, For these marauders prowl about no more, The carder, caravat, and shana vest,* Have lost the knack of bursting in your door. I never could behold (at least with zest ) From wretches’ backs the bleeding fibres tore; Yet such was long the practice of this school, To card up backs as combers card your wool. A well-known knock dispell’d his rising fears, And oped the rustic portal—slowly in Dan trots, well laden—as if press’d with years, His breast was in close contact with his chin; His burden in a twinkling disap pears, While his whole face is coil’d into a grin, For fear, combined with joy, some writers say, Will often make a face look quite ou trée.† “ Why what the deuce! how came you Dan by this? A good full anker”— “ Hush!— I’ll tell you all, But sharks are out—It will not be a miss To get a drink first,—we will haye a haul From out this chap—’tis mild as milkmaid’s kiss The sailors tell me—stop you there, I’ll call For pipes and mugs, a little cheese to eat, For we’ll be merry here at any rate.” Then Mistress Mulshinane, the Daisy Queen, Brought forth a stool to prop the anker on, Placed pipes, tobacco box, and mugs be tween Our worthy pair—the giant cheese u pon The polished table, frequently was seen To bear the knife—while ever and a non, The cups of brandy, unalloyed and pure, Followed each other swift, though very sure. “I just had passed by Darby Murphy’s farm, On my way here, (quoth Dan) had cross’d the green, Whistling right merrily to keep me warm, And scarce had got half way down Con’s bo reen,* When some one from behind me, quite un seen, Tapp’d on my shoulder;— Turning in a larm; I Sdind: his business;— ” do not be faint- hearted, If brave, I’ll make your fortune e’er we’ve parted.’ “ I now had time to look; ’twas an old dog, A sailor-chap, who told me, if I’d go And help his comrades, I should have more grog Than I could drink, or bear away in tow; To make my story short, beneath the Hog, † The smuggler’s liquor I worked hard to stow, And when we settled every thing quite handy, He gave me this—a guinea—this, the brandy. “ Then now let’s send this trash of ale a way, And take to what is purer and much stronger, And while that creature there, the moon, will stay, We’ll stick together aye, or even longer.‡ For by my faith, my friend, ’tis many a day, Since such we’ve tasted,—Give us how a song, or A proper toast,”— Here goes—I’ll give your daughter — A flowing cup—Pshaw, never mind the water.” Ah! Mr Dan, I’m sure you little know, What mischief now you’re doing to your sto mach, How many plagues, how many torments flow, From drams—that seem as mild to you as some hock; Believe me, for this joke your blood will flow, And you’ll toss, turn, and tumble on your ham mock, Oh! think in time! from this temptation flee! And shun pill, bolus, draughht, and doctor’s fee. Brandy’s deceitful liquor, by mine honour, It mounts so quickly to the captious brain, And like a young mare, when you first get on her, It speeds like lightning till you reel a gain; ’Tis true perhaps that, on occasions, one or Two jolly bumpers may be safely ta’en, Such as when damp or frost has made you shiver; But even then ’tis hurtful to the liver. ’Tis pity Daniel had not such ad vice;— (Hold—I must not anticipate my story ), But Cogniac, when smuggled, will en tice Most sober livers; from the man that’s hoary It is the moon, I ken her horn, She’s blinkin’ o’er the lift sae hie, She shines sae bright to wile us hame, But by my sooth she’ll wait a wee. To the young babe, such poisonous stuff is nice;* Your soldier sometimes will it help to glory, But oftener to black eyes, and foolish quarrels, And thus is foe to body and. to morals. But there is liquor too, (sound sense must teach ) Fit for all f I therefore would not lack Such wine, if I had guests, as would suit each; To lawyers I would give the sharp Bar- sac,— To attorneys rich canary,—and I’d reach To doctors vin de Grave, (they like the smack,) To sailors Port,—and Parsons should grow misty On good Lac Virginis, or Lachryma Christi. The kilted Highlander would seek for Mountain,— The soldier— Tent, and noisy Musca tel,— The fancy— Claret, streaming as from fountain,— And dandies—lots of Cape love mighty well; No schoolmaster would find his fair ac count in Declining Hoc —warriors in sack ex cel; Excuse these puns—but if you’d know the truth, I learned them from Jack Curran in my youth. Thus Daniel and his friend sat face to face, And from the anker drew their mellow store; The bumpers quickly one another chase, ’Mid merry song, and laugh, and boisterous roar; No wonder that their mirth should thus in crease, For Dan ne’er felt such happy hours be fore; He thought this night the proudest of his life, And dreamt not once of home, or child, or wife. Our worthy Dan at last began to think His head was not so steady as it ought; And now and then his eye-lids gave a blink; The furniture quite civil, too, he thought, For chair and picture bow’d to every wink; And the low candle into two was wrought; But my coy muse won’t tell—although I’d thank her, Whether they finished all was in the anker. All around Daniel was a boggy waste, No spot for human footstep, save one stone On which our hero found he had been placed, But how he knew not—from his heart a groan, A piteous groan proceeds— “ I must have faced The east instead of west”—another moan! “ Ohone! ohone! I’ve surely lost my way, Oh! what will Jude and all the young ones say. Tho’ Daniel gaz’d ’till gazing was in vain, He still prolonged his lamentation sad, “ Oh! a’nt I to be pitied?— not a grain Of land but this cold stone is to be had, O! Daniel, Daniel, it is now quite plain You drank too much, and stagger’d here, my lad; That Mountain Daisy, and that Paddy Blake — Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! my heart will surely break!” He look’d again, around him and a round, Nothing but bog, like sea of silvery light, Could meet his view. The moon full, bright, and round, Shone the pure mistress of the wild to- night, And all was calm as death;— no living sound Disturbed the deep repose. Poor luckless wight! Save when at distance croaking in the bog Dan heard (like Leslie) some old bluff bull- frog. And now he thought upon the hours he’d spend ’Till death would end his sorrows; for no chance Had he of ’scaping, and he could not send For help or succour; there was no ad vance, Retreat, or hope, for him; no man could bend Hither his way; when as a hasty glance He threw above, he saw a body skim, Dimming the light, between the moon and him. And wondrous was th’ eclipse, a murky cloud Blotted the moon’s fair visage from the sky, And all in motion scem’d the awful shroud, Towards the sad spot where Dan was forced to lie; And hark! he hears thick pinions rustling loud, And while he gazed with terror-stricken eye, Down swoop’d a bird. “ I see, quoth Dan, my dear, That you’re an eagle come to see me here.” And now the thunder-clapping of his wings Had ceased, the bird had perch’d close by a stream, The glorious bird of Jove! the bog still rings With the loud echo of his mountain scream; His glossy feathers, midnight-dark, he flings In majesty around him; a bright gleam Of moonshine sparkled on his mighty head; He spoke—next month I’ll tell you what he said.
Rude Corsica, thou worse than desert land, Held by thy rough Phocæan-race the while; More narrow than Sardinia’s little strand, Only less wild than Elba’s iron Isle : —Oh! streamy Corsica, whose flood-worn stones, Still whiten as thy fiercer summer’s burn, Lie lightly on my banish’d—buried bones, Nor violate the exile’s living urn. With these harsh rocks, my harder fates ac - cord; Upon the desert earth my head is laid, No sunny fields, no dark’ning groves af ford My winter sustenance, my summer shade; No spring approaches here with cheering smile, No golden flow’rs, no herbs these deserts own, No —not the fire for the last funeral pile; —The outcast and his prison—are a lone!
Thou, not content to see my bitter doom, Who at the very dead thy dart hast hurl’d, Beware;— a voice may issue from the tomb, To blast thy name and give thee to the world. Believe, ev’n death itself takes not a way The vital essence that existence gave, And honour, trampled in the very clay, Will vindicate his title from the grave. Hear, Envy, hear; the Powers above com mand, My spirit cries upon thee from the dust; Oh! let my tomb be sacred from thy hand,— Nor desecrate my inoffensive dust.
My Corduba—with wild, dishevell’d hair, Pour forth lamentings—let thy drooping head And tear-soil’d face exhibit a de spair, As if, in sooth, thy banish’d son were dead. I know thy grief, methinks I see it all; Not louder could thy voice of anguish swell When fated Cæsar girt thy trembling wall, And Pompey shook thy ramparts ere he fell; Not on that night for slaughter’s work too brief, When death exulted, hand in hand with fate; Not when that Lusitanian robber chief Hurl’d his ignoble jav’lin at thy gate. He, that was once thy pride, thy stay—a las! In exile on a barren-rock must lie; Chain’d as of yore the wretch Prometheus was, And bound, like him, to live and not to die. Oh! Corduba—far in the lovely west, Fast by the ocean-strand of pleasant Spain, Be thankful —; distant, thow art still at rest — Nor hear’st of storms—save those upon the main.
Whate’er we see, do, hear of— all A prey to hungry Time must fall; Time, of all strengths, the only strong — And that which is, shall not be, long. The gasping Rivers shall run dry; The Ocean from his sands shall fly; The Mountains pine to dwarfish size, And shrink beneath the threat’ning skies. Those Skies shall in their turn, ex pire, Burn’d in their own rebellious fire — That death we fear, and would pre vent, Is Nature’s law—not punish ment.
Is this Mendoza?— This the Jew Of whom* my fancy cherished So beautiful a waking dream, A vision which has perished. “ Superfluous lags the veteran on the stage,” Said Samuel Johnson many a year a go, In stately verse; and now its truth we know When we behold Mendoza, bent with age, Throw up his hat at Banstead,* and en gage Tom Owen!— That the diamond of the ring In eighty-nine, the eastern star, the king Of scientific pugilists, in the page Of Boxiana, hymned by Fancy’s pen As one long swathed in glory, should fore go His old renown, appears to thoughtful men Most †ominous! O Daniel, Daniel O!‡ Why, when you cried, I go to fight Ow- en, Did no kind genius echo back N— O.§
The morn is on the hill; the Eastern red Breaks, blushes, burns, o’er Heaven and Earth is spread; The breeze, that at the dawning lightly gave Its gentle motion to yon purple wave, Just shook the myrtles on the mountain’s side, Just breathed along the vale—the breeze has died. There is a living calmness on the air, So deep, the very soul grows calmer there. A Parian temple crowns the mountain’s brow, Impassive, bright, severe as sculptured snow;— Proud wheels the golden pinnacle a bove, One solitary bird, the bird of Jove;— The purple wave just kisses its bright shore, One curl, one sweet, low murmur, and ’tis o’er. ’Tis silence all, all splendid, fresh, and still, On yale, and wood, on wave, and holy hill. But hark the voice of flutes! In beauty rise, The virgin train for morning sacri fice, Winding like vision’d forms, successive, slow, Through the rich cloud of leaf, and bloom be low; Flowers on their locks, the bosom’s silver globe, Half-beaming from the jewel-cinctured robe; In their slight hands the lyre, and marble urn, Where thro’ the rose-wreaths myrrh and sandal burn, Solemn as statues from the vale they move, To where the shrine in sunlight tow’rs a bove, And now those noiseless feet, and eyes pro found, Have up the primrose tuft their pathway wound, They lovely as a dream, like it are gone, And the eye looks on loveliness a lone. The Temple-valves unfold.—In fragrance rise Wreath upon wreath, the clouds of sacri fice; And sweet as dew-fall on the valley dim, Spread the rich echoes of their melting hymn. Slow stalking from his leafy bed the deer Pauses, with glistening eye, that sound to hear; Still wheels the eagle o’er the odorous cloud, As if to catch the holy sweetness bowed, Then to its wing the last deep chorus given, Mounts on the breeze, and bears its charge to Heaven.
Cousins —as a boy and girl, we watched The glow-worm and the star, Made mimic trenches on the sands, And gathered shell and spar; We built the snow-man in the drift, We nutted in the park; I called her, shyly, “ Little wife,” And kissed her in the dark. For years our paths lay wide apart— As wide as sun and sea,— And when we met again, she seemed Half strange, half shy, with me; But, guests together at the farm, We soon recalled to life The memory of those early days, When she was “ Little wife.” A whisper at a wedding dance—, A blushing, bending face,— And then I heard the welcome word That gave me cousin Grace,— That gave me her whose love dispelled The shadow on my life, Who lays her hand in mine to-night, And is—my “ Little wife.”
To thee, to thee, sombre Persepho ne, Dread goddess with the sanguine pomegra nate Clasped in pale hands, and slumberous eyes of fate Forth-gazing o’er unsunned infini ty; We from the whirlpool of life’s troubled sea, Where passion tires and love is quenched by hate, And cries ascend to scornful heaven too late, And hope is merged in helpless mise ry : Bring this last prayer, Lady of dreams and death; Pay this last vow, Empress of sleep and hell; Breathe this last utterance of our spirit’s breath; Hang round thy altar-horns sere waifs and strays Plucked from the grave of self beloved o’er- well, And crown thy mute cold shrine with blasted bays.
Now pipers the thrush, dear messenger of spring To the coy white-robed snow-drop whispe ring; To the blue violet sweet-breathing near, And primrose, “sweet pale” flower of Imogen, Warbles his carol clear! The crocus, in her crown of glory bright, Purple and gold, gleams blushing in the light, And bashful courts the glances of the sun : Nature smiled grand in simple majesty, Her reign be gun. Welcome again, first minstrel of the year, Fair buds, our childhood’s playmates, doubly dear, And harbingers of soft sunshiny hours. Oh, after winter, ever welcome spring, First bird! first flowers! But shall no parallel, no sweet life- scene, Look fair as this? No allegory mean These birds, these flowers of the infant year, That sound the silver chord of Nature’s harp, So sweet, so clear? Yes, yes, to ye the tender heart-thought roams, Golden-haired darlings of our English homes, Our buds of promise, dearly, doubly ours, The chirping child-voice and the baby rose, Life’s birds! life’s flowers!
Hail to our brother Ga briel! Now we, thy brothers, Mi chael, And Ra phael, And U riel, Hail thee, come home from Is rael. I saw among the lilies dwell Mary, our Queen : who pleaseth well The Spirit of our God. All hail, Mary, our Queen! sing, thou in mail, Lord Michael! Sing, Uriel, thou, Clothed with the sun upon thy brow! And sing thou, Hail! whose pilgrims now Shall climb the glad ways out of Hell, Joy of poor pilgrims, Rapha el! I, Captain of the Lord God’s Host, Give glory to the Holy Ghost : And give to Mary, loved of Him. I, brightest of bright Cheru bim, Give thanks to Mary : and to Him, That Holy Child, Who shall be born, King Jesus Christ, on Christmas morn. I, Prince of burning Sera phim, Give praise, give praise, to Mary Queen : With whom the Grace of God hath been. Now play through Heaven the Angel bell : Make music of the Ange lus! The King is come, to Isra el : The Queen of Heaven is found, for us.

The accomplished Raphael, he, whom prevalent Grace Largely endued, with certain power to scan, And know, the various worlds of God, and man, That he, from art, all error might e rase, Beheld thee. Yea, within this very place, This Umbrian valley, thou, perchance while ran Thoughtless the moments by, didst raise those wan, Deep, folded lids upon him, face to face. Thou dost forget : but still in memory, he Holds the calm features, whence, to daily flower Breaks, from his pencil, as from Aaron’s rod, The secular image, which abides with thee In many a secret, and devoted hour, The face of Mary, mother of thy God.
Only one voice could sing a right His brother poet, lost in night : His voice, who sleeps not far a way; The pure and perfect voice, of Gray. The sleep of lowly men, he sang : For whom the solemn church bells rang, Over their silent fields and vales, Whence no rude sound their calm as sails. He knew their melancholy rest, And peaceful sleep, on earth’s kind breast : Their patient lives, their common doom, The beauty of their simple tomb. One thing, he left unsung : how some, To share those village slumbers, come : Whose voices filled the world with joy, Who made high thoughts, their one em ploy. Ah, loving hearts! too great, to prize Things, whereon most men set their eyes : The applauding crowd, the golden lure Of wealth, insatiate and un sure; A life of noise! a restless death; The sanctities of life’s last breath Profaned, with ritual pride and state; Last pageant of the little great! But these; to whom all crowns of song, And all immortal praise, be long; Turn from each gairish sight and sound, To lay them down in humble ground : Choosing that still, eternal sleep, To be, where kindly natures keep : In sound of pleasant water rills, In shadows of the solemn hills. Earth’s heart, earth’s hidden way, they knew; Now on their grave, light falls her dew : The music of her soul was theirs; They sleep beneath her sweetest airs. Beside the broad, gray Thames, one lies, With whom a spring of beauty dies : Among the willows, the pure wind Calls all his wistful song to mind; And, as the calm strong river flows, With it his mightier music goes : But those winds cool, those waters lave, The country of his chosen grave. Go past the cottage flowers; and see, Where Arnold thought it good, to be! Half church, half cottage, comely stands An holy House, from Norman hands; By rustic Time well taught, to wear Some lowly, meditative air; Long ages of a pastoral race Have softened sternness, into grace : And many a touch of homelier use, From Norman strength, hath set it loose. Here, under old, red fruited yews; And summer suns, and autumn dews; With his lost children at his side, Sleeps Arnold. Still those waters glide, Those winds blow softly down their breast : But he, who loved them, is at rest.
What is Love? Is Love in this, That flies between us, in a kiss? Nay, what is Love? Is Love the zest, That wakes, when I unloose my breast? But what is Love? Say now : who knows, Or where he lurks, or how he shows? Celia, Truth is harsh, I fear : Love, as yet, can scarce be here. Love is poor; nay, Love is sorry; Tears, not kisses, chiefly stay him : His sad weeds best tell his story; Vain delights befool, be wray him. Truth, alas! is hard to bear : Know, as yet, Love is not here. But, when the evil days are come, If those same lips, which kiss you now, Still make your tearful eyes their home, And chide the sorrow from your brow, Then say to your own heart, my dear : Abide, poor heart, for Love is here. Love is a light, in darkened ways; Love is a path, in pathless lands; Love is a fire, in winter days; A staff, in chill, unsteady hands. Speak to your heart, my own, my dear; Say : this is Love, and Love is here.
Oh! for a day of Spring, A day of mirth and folly, Of birds that pipe and sing And childhood’s melan choly. I would not grudge the laughter, The tears that followed after. Oh! for a day of youth, A day of strength and passion, Of words that told the truth And deeds the truth would fashion. I would not leave un tasted One courage while it lasted. Oh! for a day of days, A day with you and pleasure, Of love in all its ways And life in all its measure. Win me that day from sorrow And let me die to- morrow.
Blow gently over my garden, Wind of the Southern sea, In the hour that my Love cometh And calleth me! My Love shall entreat me sweetly, With voice like the wood-pi geon; “ I am here at the gate of thy garden, Here in the dawn.” Then I shall rise up swiftly All in the rose and grey, And open the gate to my Lover At dawning of day. He hath crowns of pain on His forehead, And wounds in His hands and feet : But here mid the dews of my garden His rest shall be sweet. Then blow not out of your forests, Wind of the icy North; But Wind of the South that is healing Rise and come forth! And shed your musk and your honey, And spill your odours of spice, For one who forsook for my garden His Para dise!
Amid the tender boughs of green The young sun laughs for joy : be tween Slim, silver, mottled, stems of birch A throng of saffron butter flies, New born to greet the morning, search, Where the pale bluebells’ sweetness lies. How still they settle, softly float, To music of the blackbird’s note! To undertone of early bees, That hum from flower to flower, and quaff New nectar! Insects, blossoms, trees, Alert to greet the sun-god’s laugh! Awake, my soul, arise, re joice! Join universal nature’s voice In glad Te Deum for the Spring! Forget the Winter’s miry ways! Forget the least uncleanly thing, That saddened, soiled, those vanished days!
Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Lost is lovely Adonis! The Loves respond with lamenting. Nay, no longer in robes of purple recline, Aphrodite : Wake from thy sleep, sad queen, black-stoled, rain blows on thy bosom; Cry to the listening world, He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! The Loves respond with lamenting. Lovely Adonis is lying, sore hurt in his thigh, on the moun - tains, Hurt in his thigh with the tusk, while grief consumes Aphrodite : Slowly he droops toward death, and the black blood drips from his fair flesh, Down from his snow-white skin; his eyes wax dull ’neath the eyelids, Yea and the rose hath failed his lips, and around them the kisses Die and wither, the kisses that Kupris will not relinquish : Still, though he lives no longer, a kiss consoles Aphrodite; But he knows not, Adonis, she kissed him while he was dying. Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! The Loves respond with lamenting. Cruel, cruel the wound in the thigh that preys on Adonis : But in her heart Cytherea hath yet worse wounds to afflict her. Round him his dear hounds bay, they howl in their grief to the heavens; Nymphs of the woodlands wail : but she, the Queen Aphrodite, Loosing her locks to the air, roams far and wide through the forest, Drowned in grief, dishevelled, unsandalled, and as she flies onward, Briars stab at her feet and cull the blood of the goddess. She with shrill lamentation thro’ glen and thro’ glade is carried, Calling her Syrian lord, demanding him back, and demanding. But where he lies, dark blood wells up and encircles the navel; Blood from the gushing thighs empurples the breast; and the snow-white Flank that was once so fair, is now dyed red for Adonis. Wail, wail, Ah, Cytherea! The Loves respond with lamenting. She then hath lost her lord, and with him hath lost her celestial Beauty; for fair was he, and fair, while he lived, Aphrodite : Now in his death her beauty hath died. Ah, Ah, Cytherea! All the mountains lament, and the oaks moan, Ah for Adonis! Streams as they murmur and flow complain of thy griefs, Aphrodite : Yea and the springs on the hills, in the woods, weep tears for Adonis : Flowers of the field for woe flush crimson red; and Cythêra, Thorough the dells and the glens, shrills loud the dirge of her anguish : Woe, woe, Ah, Cytherea! He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Echo repeats the groan : Lost, lost, is lovely Adonis! Kupris, who but bewailed thy pangs of a love overwhelming? She, when she saw, when she knew the unstanchable wound of Adonis, When she beheld the red blood on his pale thigh’s withering blossom, Spreading her arms full wide, she moaned out : “ Stay, my Adonis! Stay, ill-fated Adonis! that I once more may approach thee! Clasp thee close to my breast, and these lips mingle with thy lips! Rouse for a moment, Adonis, and kiss me again for the last time; Kiss me as long as the kiss can live on the lips of a lover; Till from thy inmost soul to my mouth and down to my marrow Thy life-breath shall run, and I quaff the wine of thy philtre, Draining the draught of thy love : that kiss will I treasure, Adonis, E’en as it were thyself; since thou, ill-starred, art departing, Fleeing me far, O Adonis, to Acheron faring, the sad realm Ruled by a stern savage king : while I, the unhappy, the luckless, I live; goddess am I, and I may not follow or find thee. Persephone, take thou my lord, my lover; I know thee Stronger far than myself : all fair things drift to thy dwelling. I meanwhile am accursed, possessed with insatiable sorrow, Weeping my dead, my Adonis who died, and am shaken and shattered. Diest thou then, my desired? and desire like a dream hath escaped me. Widowed is now Cytherea; the Loves in her halls are abandoned; Perished with thee is my girdle. Ah, why wouldst thou hunt, over-bold one? Being so beautiful, why wast thou mad to fight with a wild beast?” Thus then Kupris mourned; and the Loves respond with lamenting : Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Tears the Paphian shed, drop by drop for the drops of Adonis’ Blood; and on earth each drop, as it fell, grew into a blossom : Roses sprang from the blood, and the tears gave birth to the wind-flower. Wail, wail, Ah, Cytherea! He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! He is lost to us, lovely Adonis! Now in the oak-woods cease to lament for thy lord, Aphrodite. No proper couch is this which the wild leaves strew for Adonis. Let him thy own bed share, Cytherea, the corpse of Adonis; E’en as a corpse he is fair, fair corpse as fallen aslumber. Now lay him soft to sleep, sleep well in the wool of the bed - clothes, Where with thee through the night in holy dreams he commingled, Stretched on a couch all gold, that yearns for him stark though he now be. Shower on him garlands, flowers : all fair things died in his dying; Yea, as he faded away, so shrivel and wither the blossoms. Syrian spikenard scatter, anoint him with myrrh and with unguents : Perish perfumes all, since he, thy perfume, is perished. Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! The Loves respond with lamenting. Lapped in his purple robes is the delicate form of Adonis. Round him weeping Loves complainand moan in their anguish, Clipping their locks for Adonis : and one of them treads on his arrows, One of them breaks his bow, and one sets heel on the quiver; One hath loosed for Adonis the latchet of sandals, and some bring Water to pour in an urn; one laves the wound in his white thigh; One from behind with his wings keeps fanning dainty Adonis. Wail, wail, Ah for Adonis! The Loves respond with lamenting. Wail, wail, Ah, Cytherea! The Loves respond with lamenting. Every torch at the doors hath been quenched by thy hand, Hymenaeus; Every bridal wreath hath been torn to shreds; and no longer, Hymen, Hymen no more is the song, but a new song of sorrow, Woe, woe! and Ah for Adonis! resounds in lieu of the bridesong. This the Graces are shrilling, the son of Cinyras hymning, Lost is lovely Adonis! in loud antiphonal accents. Woe, woe! sharply repeat, far more than the praises of Paiôn, Woe! and Ah for Adonis! the Muses who wail for Adonis, Chaunt their charms to Adonis.—But he lists not to their singing; Not that he wills not to hear, but the Maiden doth not release him. Cease from moans, Cytherea, to-day refrain from the death - songs : Thou must lament him again, and again shed tears in a new year.
With faces bright, as ruddy corn Touched by the sunlight of the morn : With rippling hair; and gleaming eyes, Wherein a sea of passion lies; Hair waving back, and eyes, that gleam With treasures of perpetual dream : With full lips curving into song : With shapely limbs, upright and strong : The youths on holy service throng. Vested in white, upon their brows Are wreaths of roseal wilding boughs : And flowers, they strow along the way, Still dewy from the springs of day : So to each reverend altar come, They stand in adoration : some Swing up gold censers; till the air Is blue and sweet with smoke of rare Spices, that fetched from Egypt were. In voices of calm, choral tone, Praise they each God, with praise his own : As children of the Gods, is seen Their glad solemnity of mien; So fair a spirit of the skies Is in their going : and their eyes Look out upon the peopled earth, As theirs were some diviner birth; So clear and courtly is their mirth. Lights of the labouring world, they seem : Or, to the tired, like some fresh stream. Their dignity of perfect youth Compels devotion, as doth truth : So right seems all, they do, they are. Old age looks, wistful, from a far, To watch their beauty; as they go, Radiant and free, in ordered row; And fairer, in the watching, grow. Fair though it be, to watch un close The nestling glories of a rose, Depth on rich depth, soft fold on fold : Though fairer be it, to be hold Stately and sceptral lilies break To beauty, and to fragrance wake : Yet fairer still, to see and sing, One fair thing is, one matchless thing; Youth, in its perfect blosso ming. The magic of a golden grace Brings fire, and sweetness, on each face : Till, from their passage, every heart Takes fire, and sweetness in the smart : Till virtue lives, for all who own Their loveliness, in them a lone : Till careless hearts, and idle, take Delight in living, for their sake; Worship their footsteps, and a wake. To be their friend, the common throng Would dare all bounds of right and wrong : To win their welcome, clasp their hands, Would lie in wait for their com mands : But vain! In no unlovely pride, They hold together, side by side : How should they love the crowd of men; Whose nobleness is now and then; With nothing gracious in their ken? Where now is death? Where that gray land? These fearless eyes, these white brows grand, That take full sunlight and blithe air, With rapture, just and debo nair; These have not known the touch of death! The world hath winds : these forms have breath. But, should death dare, should dear life set, Calm would each go : Farewell! for get Me dead : live you serenely yet. Beside the tremulous, blue sea, Clear at sundown, they love to be : Yet they are never sad, but then. For sorrow touches them, as men, Looking upon the calm of things, That go; that cast foreshado wings Of holy and of ancient awe; The charm of immemorial Law : What we see now, the great dead saw! But the red sun is gone : and beams Of gracile moonlight waken dreams, Dreams, and the mysteries of peace : Shall this fair darkness ever cease? Here is no drear, no fearful, Power : But life grows fuller with each hour, Full of the silence, that is best. Earth lies, with soothed and quiet breast, Beneath the guardian stars, at rest. At night, behold them! Where lamps burn By moonlit olives, how they turn Full faces toward the sailing moon, Nigh lovelier than beneath high noon! Throw back their comely moulded throats, Whence music on the night wind floats! And, through the fragrant hush of night, Their lustrous eyes make darkness bright : Their laugh loads darkness with de light. Almost the murmuring sea is hushed : Their eyes on fire, their bright limbs flushed, They dominate the night with love : While the stars burn and flash a bove, These kindle through the dark such flame, As is not seen, and hath no name : Can night bear more? Can nature bend In benediction without end, Over this love of friend for friend? The music of their sighing parts The silence : and their beating hearts Beat to a measure of de spair : So great it is, to be so fair! So strange it is, to be so young! While fire consumes them, lo! hath sprung The morning to the heart of night : Day comes with solemnizing light : Calm takes them; and they stand up right. Magnificent in early bloom, Like Gods, they triumph over gloom : All things desirable are theirs, Of beauty, and of wonder, heirs : Their cities, vassals are; which give Them thanks and praise, because they live : Strong, they know nothing of di smay; Fair, they serve beauty every day; Young, the sun loves to light their way. See them! the springing of the palm Is nought, beside their stately calm : The rippling of cool water dies To nought, before their clear re plies : The smile, that heralds their bright thought, Brings down the splendid sun to nought. See them! they walk the earth in state : In right of loveliness, held great : On whom, the powers of nature wait. No sceptre theirs, but they are kings : Their forms and words are royal things. Their simple friendship is a court, Whither the wise and great re sort. No homage of the world, they claim : But in all places lives their fame. Sun, moon, and stars: the earth, the sea; Yea! all things, that of beauty be; Honour their true divini ty.
The wavelets plash on the lonely strand, In the light of the moon’s mild beams; A fair knight rests on the silvery sand, Begirt with happy dreams. The beautiful fairies, fairy-be dight, Rise out of the great sea’s deeps; They softly draw near to the youthful knight, And they think that he really sleeps. Then, one with curious finger feels The feather that deck his bonnet; Another close to his shoulder-knot steals, And plays with the chain u pon it. A third one laughs, and with artful hand Unsheathes the sword from its keeper, And, leaning against the glittering brand, She watches, well-pleased, the sleeper. A fourth goes flutt’ring about and a bove, And sighs from her little bosom : "Ah, me! that I were thy true, true love, Thou beautiful human blossom! "A fifth the knight’s fair fingers clasp’d, Fill’d with love’s longing blisses; A sixth plays coy for awhile, but at last His lips and cheeks she kisses. The knight is crafty, nor thinks he soon To open his eyelids wary, But lies quite still, to be kiss’d in the moon By fairy after fairy.
On Carlisle-Gate the moon shines clear, Up-rising o’er the lea; On Carlisle-Gate the sun burns red, Slow sinking in the sea. On Carlisle-Gate their rays light soft A young man’s blanching face, Its long fair hair, its drooping lids— On the neck a crimson trace. By Carlisle-Gate a watcher sits, Nor heeds each passer- by : In lonely tryst, at prime and eve, Close-veiled from every eye. By Carlisle-Gate the stranger waits— They know not whence she came — They speak of Rizpah, as they mark The Maid without a name. By Carlisle-Gate on Him she looks With eyes that cannot weep; They slew Him when Prince Charles had fled From yonder Castle- keep. By Carlisle-Gate the sundown saw The Watcher and the Dead; By Carlisle-Gate no dawn beheld The Maiden or the Head.
Go forth, go forth, my dearest; The world is wild and wide, But ’tis not that thou fearest — Not that can us di vide. I bless the cross upon thy breast, I kiss thee—lip and brow : Go forth upon thy saintly quest, And keep thy knightly vow. Go forth, my bravest, boldest — My own, my heart’s de light; This tear that thou be holdest Stains not thy armour bright : The Christian armour, bright as strong, In which I made thee dress, The sword, to hew down mortal wrong, The breastplate, righteous ness. Go forth, my best be loved! And trust in God’s dear grace, That, every foe re moved, Thou’lt meet me, face to face; But if He not that guerdon gives, Die, as a good knight dies; I, living as a true maid lives, We’ll meet in Para dise.
Let others sing the country’s charm : The whispering trees; the tangled lane; The perfume-burdened air; the trills Of lark and nightingale; the wain, That homeward brings the scented hay, When evening’s peace absorbs the day. Let others laud those primal cares, Which fill the country hours with bliss : The timely rest; clear eyes, that greet Earth waking ’neath Aurora’s kiss; The easy, sauntering, walk; the toil, That waits upon the bounteous soil. Let others paint with fresh delight The country maiden’s cheek of rose; Her lover’s artless, amorous, gifts, Which pure affection’s heart en close; The children nestling round their sire At night-fall, by the winter’s fire. For me, for me, another world’s Enchantments hold my heart in thrall : These London pavements, low’ring sky, Store secrets, on mine eyes that fall; More curious far, than earth or air By country paths can make ap pear. The stern reformer scowls aghast, Mid the doomed city’s trackless woe : Apelles veils his shuddering gaze, Its ugliness “ offends him so ” : The dainty-eared musician dies In torment, of its raucous cries. Yet are there souls of coarser grain, Or else more flexible, who find Strange, infinite, allurements lurk, Undreamed of by the simpler mind, Along these streets, within the walls Of cafés, shops, and music- halls. ’Twixt jar of tongues, at endless strife On art, religion, social needs, How many a keen thought springs to birth In him, this dubious book that reads! For curious eyes no hours are spent, That bring not interest, con tent. I’ll call not these the best, nor those; The country fashions, or the town : On each descend heaven’s bounteous rains; On each the impartial sun looks down. Why should we gird and argue, friend; Not follow, where our natures tend? The secret’s this : where’er our lot, To read, mark, learn, digest them well, The devious paths we mortals take, To gain, at length, our heaven or hell : Alike in some still, rural, scene, Or Regent Street and Bethnal Green.
This poor flower of the rose; All its pride, its fashion, spent; Shrivelled up; bereft of scent; Once such sweetness; could un close! This sad blossom, that hath lain, For an hour or so of grace, Twixt her bosom and her face! Dare we treat it with dis dain? Dainty was its shell-like hue, As her shell-like ears, I vow. Dainty texture, tincture, now Vainly for your grace we sue! Think of all, that Nature wrought, Studious of this pretty flower; Prodigal of sun and shower; Careless, though its end be naught : Careful only it should grow Into worthiness to deck, Fair itself, a fairer neck; Flourish there an hour, and go. Dropped amid the dancing feet! Saved to turn a verse like this! Lay it gently, with a kiss, ’Mid the fire’s absorbing heat : Into elemental dust Watch it purely burn a way. Julia, when we’ve had our day, Chastely so we’ll pass, I trust!
Dear, let me dream of love, Ah! though a dream it be! I’ll ask no boon a bove A word, a smile, from thee : At most, in some still hour, one kindly thought of me. Sweet, let me gaze a while Into those radiant eyes! I’ll scheme not to be guile The heart, that deeper lies Beneath them, than yon star in night’s mysterious skies. Love, let my spirit bow In worship at this shrine! I’ll swear, thou shalt not know One word from lips of mine, An instant’s pain to send through that shy soul of thine.
Ah! Lesbia, by that name at last Love calls you, for Catullus’ sake! The million kisses of the past Are pledge of millions yet, to slake His thirst unquenchable, who lies Beside the quenchless depth of those dear eyes. Lie closer, Girl! how silent, dark, Is this withdrawn abode of love! Some far-off murmurings only mark, Where restless human beings move Along the gas-lit, midnight, street : Oh! what delicious silence, darkness, Sweet! Even our love, that scarce might find One short, fierce, rapturous, hour a go, Words wild enough to speak its mind; Light clear enough our joys to show : Even Love’s self has sunk to rest, As a tired child, twixt close-drawn breast and breast. Over his head our lips may meet, Yet soundless is the kiss they frame : And, as our souls in union greet His presence, still they breathe no name : In the deep heart of heaven, where wells God’s central spring, ’tis Silence only dwells.
Poor, worn-out, mortals! here you lie, Stretched on your sandwich-boards, a sleep! Unconscious of the passers by; Unheedful of what miseries steep Your waking hours, without, wi thin. To rouse you, were a sin. In yonder street the sun’s a blaze : I catch the river’s glittering light At end of it : their careless ways The crowds go on; in sin’s de spite, In sorrow’s neighbourhood, con tent. You’re lost in wonder ment? He made us all, whose name is Good : He counts each hair upon our head : He marks the inmost spirit’s mood : On every soul his grace is shed. You think these beggars give the lie To such theolo gy? Look! the dim coolness of this place, How soothingly it’s lulled to rest Each unwashed, haggard, hungry face! No child upon its mother’s breast Sleeps sounder. All life’s troubles cease! What deep, oblivious peace!
And all amid that fair enchanted ground, A lovely minstrel’s lovely strain was heard, High on his bending bough, a beauteous bird, With gorgeous wings unfolding, poured the sound : And wondrous was the song that bird did sing, For speech it seemed, and ye the words might know, Yet like a wild bird’s warbling did it flow, That ear, heart, soul, were won with his sweet carol ling. “ Ah! see, deep-blushing in her green recess, The bashful virgin rose, that half-re vealing, And half, within herself, herself con cealing, Is lovelier for her hidden love liness. Lo! soon her glorious beauty she dis covers : Soon droops :— —and sheds her leaves of faded hue : —Can this be She,—the Flower,—erewhile that drew The heartof thousand maids, of thousand longing lovers? So fleeteth, in the fleeting of a day, Of mortal life the green leaf, and the flower, And not, though Spring return to every bower, Buds forth again soft leaf, or blossom gay. Gather the rose! beneath the beauteous morning Of this bright day, that soon will over cast. O gather love’s sweet rose, that yet doth last! Love, in Youth’s lovely prime! ere aged love meet scorning.
Isat to bask, one sunny morn, Beneath a silvery blooming thorn, All near a pebbly rill : The yellow whins perfumed the ground, In all their golden splendour round, On side of rising hill; Aloft in air were lav’rocks singing, Hid far in bluest sky, And all around their notes were ringing, Themselves concealed on high; Till stopping, and dropping, With sottly-bending fight, They try there, to spy there, Some daisied turf to light. A little linnet there was seen, Alighting glad on grassy green, To wash its breast in dew, Or seeking near some rose to perch, For glittering drops the leaves to search, And quench the thirst that grew, Then swift with chirrup clear she went, Again to gather food, For all the happy hours she spent, To feed her growing brood, And near her, to cheer her, Her mate sung sweet and kind, And aided and guided, The best of food to find. And hid secure on leafy bough, Where hawthorn’s lilied flowerets blow, I saw her younglings fair, With down their plumage still was white, And all too weak their wings for flight, Along the bristling air; Their arbour’s opening gave to view, The little timid row, Now shaking off the dropping dew, Now pecking blossomed bough. Now flitting, now sitting, Now trimming little feather Now sleeping, now cheeping, Now calling on their mother. The mother came, and each in turn, Glad shook its wings for share of corn, Forth stretching little bill, Again she went, again she came, And I was pleased to see the same, Scene innocent and still; But all beneath the branch the while, Where chirping younglings sat, I noticed not the traitor wile, Of mischief-footed cat, Slow creeping, and peeping, With close and steady eye, Still higher and nigher, She marked them for her, prey. And now the nearest branch is gained, And now her traitor limbs are strained, For fierce and greedy spring, The younglings close are chirping low, All huddled soft on flowery bough : Undreading treacherous thing : With villain force I saw her dart, The tender group to seize She snatched their lives with sudden start, And hurried through the trees; Bereft now, and left now, Their mother came with food, And madly, and sadly, She cried to miss her brood. I saw her wildly circling round, I saw her madly skim the ground, With hurried plaintive scream, But now for all her parent care, Is left but blank of sad de spair, A dark and bitter dream; And such the scene to me is left, Amid this life of woe, And such the deeds of watchful craft, That forced my tears to flow; Unheeding, undreading, I careless played a round, Till wrapped, entrapped, Their fangs were o’er me bound.
Come wind the horn of the harvest— hark! The harp strings thrill, and the pipes at wark; And the festal light gleams through the door, And the snooded dames bound to the floor; And the dancer tries his deftest craft, And the roof wags its remotest raft; No thought of reap-hook and ripe grain, They shake the sweat from their locks like rain. Bound to the strings! it is gladsome wark, The clasp o’ the hand, and the kiss i’ the dark; When the willing lips must in secret meet — I hae tried it, and never was ought so sweet; The hoary men gaze, and they smile de mure At their blythe bairns bounding on the floor; And there is shout, and scream, and smack Of lips—and full cups come empty back. O’er my simmer of life’s come a nipping frost — And worried wi’ eld, and this kirk-yard hoast; I maun gaunt and glower when the piper’s croon, An’ beat time wi’ the end o’ my crutch to the tune, And my frozen blood begins to creep When the grass-green gowns come by with a sweep; Oh, prayer, and fast, and penance, and pain, Canna bring youth’s golden days a gain. My auld limbs streeked ’neath the round cauld moon, I maun pore on the stars, and sift how soon, The Ae shall come down wi’ a foam and a dash — And the loosened winds shall our ripe rigs thrash; How mony ripe kimmers, “tween beltane and yule, Shall faut and grace the repentance- stool — All this I can learn as I streek my shanks On the dewy grass, by the bonnie burn banks.
When the morn beam’s clear by bonnie Car lisle, The carle amang his ripe corn may smile. When by bonnie Carlisle the lift is brown, A dropping drought is near, quoth the clown. When bonnie green Criffel seems growing and towering, The cloud is preparing for dropping and showering. When bonnie green Criffel seems little and less, And the grasshopper’s descant is sweet in the grass, These tokens of warmth the wise farmer will bless.
ὄρνις γάρ οἱ ἐπῆλθε περησέμαι μεμαῶτι αἰετὸς ὑψιπέτης “ The Eagle, lord of earth and sea, Stooped down to pay him fealty. Wie Hogen rechts, wie flogen links Gebirge, Bäum, und Pecken! Wie flogen links, und rechts, und links Die Dorfer, Stadt’ und Flecken. Have any of my readers ever seen A grisly ghost, or goblin of the tomb, Or in calm midnight’s solemn silence been, Where these grim nothings fill the dreary gloom? (I ask them all, from sixty to six teen, From cheek of wrinkles to the cheek of bloom;) If there be one, he’ll judge what terrors broke On Daniel’s soul, as thus the Eagle spoke :— “ Good-morrow, Dan! from yon high mountain’s peak, Where I sat brooding o’er my unfledged young, I saw you here in sorrow : every shriek Of woe you utter’d, drops of pity wrung From out my heart; and knowing every creek, And hole and corner, these dark wilds a mong, I’m come to help you homeward, if I can; But tell me first, what brought you here, my man.” “ O Sir,” says Dan, “ I left my home, an’ please ye, To meet my neighbour, Paddy Blake, to- night, At our ould trysting place, the Mountain Dai sy, With heart at ease, and spirits gay and light; Ohone! Ohone! misfortunate and cra zy, I drank raw brandy, and was bother’d quite; And, ’pon my soul, I cannot tell quite clear, The how or why I find myself just here.” “ It is apparent,” quoth the Eagle strait, “ That you’ve been fuddled, Dan, and more’s the shame, To see a decent man of forty- eight, Stagger along, and lose the road he came; Upon my word, ’twere well to let you wait, And bring your neighbours to behold your shame; For of all vices on the earth, I think The worst consists in appetite for drink. “ I knew you once, Dan, when you’d shrink a ghast, At sight of dram, or pint, or deadly noggin, When every saint’s and lady day you’d fast, And for your sins inflict the wholesome flogging; I fear me much these goodly days are past, Since drink has stuck you (penance fit!) a bog in; My friendly hints, I fear, will go for nought, If this night’s cooling will not lend you thought. “ However, as this bog is very wide, And you are still an honest sort of chap — Have never robb’d birds’ nests, nor ever tied Cosses * to dogs or cats;— I could, may hap, If you mount up upon my back a stride, Keep good look out, and shun the treach’rous nap, Bring you, if flight your senses don’t be wilder, Straight home to Judy and the little childer.” Dan listen’d as all culprits mostly do, More to the comfort than the good ad vice; And after sobbing forth a sigh or two, Told his kind friend “ he’d mount him in a trice, If he would promise, that in case he flew Too quick”—a pause— “ Old Nick would oft en tice Men in the shape of birds and beasts, so I With him, (though Dan) no step to-night will fly.” But when around the bog he cast a glance, His home and fire, keen hunger and slow death, Across his mind, in quick succession dance; He sickens, trembles and pants hard for breath, “ If could think,” (with bow and slight ad vance,) “ That you were not”—(a sly look under neath For cloven foot,) “ If I could think, I say, There’s no foul work, I’d gladly pelt a way.” The Eagle, with a look of high dis dain, Rustled his pinions loudly for the flight, Nor deigned one word in answer—’twas in vain For Dan to linger; here, for many a night, Must he in chilling damp and cold re main, No living thing to cheer his aching sight, Unless he strode, a plan not quite en regle, The glossy back of this majestic Eagle. He groan’d assent. The bird stoop’d down in haste, And Dan began his saddle to. di spose — His foot upon a master-feather placed, Mounted with care, and straigthen’d out his toes — Clung close his knees, and heartily em braced The bird’s proud neck, e’er he to flight a rose; Then sticking both his heels into his side, He soared aloft—let good or ill be tide Up, up into the sky, a glorious flight, In many an airy whirl the Eagle sped — And gallant ’twere to see the grace and might With which the bird his sail-broad pinions spread, Cleaving, with feathery oar, the sea of light, Which all around the silver moon-beams shed; While on his back bold Daniel clung as stiff As Sir Astolfo on his Hippo griff. “ I’ve often heard of spirits in the air,” Quoth Dan, “ but now I find ’tis all a lie; Devil a drop can I see any where, To wet my lips that grow so hard and dry; Stop, Mr Eagle, stop, for I de clare Your journey now is over, if you’ll fly Down to that dunghill yonder, for I see My poor wife, Judy, looking out for me.” “ Away, away, my steed and I,” so sung Mazeppa’s chronicle; but Arab steed, Nor that on which reluctant Gilpin hung, Could fly with so much vigour or such speed; Now skimming strait, now darting up they sprung, As light as on the whirlwind floats the reed; And as the bird still upward bravely flew, Poor Daniel’s Jude and dunghill fade from view. “ Oh! stop, my Lord,” (he thought it best be mild ) “ You’ve past my house, I tould you so be fore, Oh! an’t I to be pitied?— wife or child, Or home, or Daisy, I’ll ne’er visit more; The bog was bad, but sure ’twould set one wild, To be brought here upon the clouds to soar; Fly down, for God’s sake, down there upon Whiddy;* I’ll surely fall, my head has grown so giddy. But answer came there none. The Eagle seemed Bent for some distant quarter of the sky, And well our luckless hero might have deem’d, That he to earthly things had bid good- bye; For no one in their senses could have dream’d Of such a journey. Here Dan gave a sigh; For now strait upward was the eagle speeding, His prayers and lamentations little heeding. Still on they fled; and creature on the way, Living or lifeless, to be found was none, Except the Eagle and his rider; they Pursued their airy voyage all a lone; But if the flight had happened in our day, They might perhaps in company have gone With Mr Wordsworth, who last year, I ween, In crescent boat on the same track was seen ( You’ll find his flight described in Peter Bell, Published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, I own I like that poem passing well, Though by your wits ’tis laughed at and cried down. Cheer up, Great Poet, loud thy fame will swell, When thy detractors’ names shall be un known, When all forgotten is the tiny crew, Who quiz thee in the Edinburgh Re view.) Oh! what a view! how noble is the sight! Beneath them stretch’d the broad and rock girt bay, And broader ocean, sparkling with the light Of thousand stars, soon far behind them lay. Hungry’s† high head, and near it, dark as night, Glangariffe’s cliffs, and deep embowered way; “ Oh! Lord,” says Dan, “ unless my eyesight fail, Yonder’s the battery of ould Kin sale.”‡ Soon earth, and sea, and mountain high were gone, Nought was below them but the scudding cloud, And still the bird was journeying gaily on, And Dan still wept his sad mishaps a loud; And higher as they fled, still brighter shone The queen of night in vestal lustre proud; They near the moon;— Now Dan indeed may quake, All hope is past; his very eye-balls ache. And well they may, as round was light Intensely strong;— and every spot of Heaven Sparkled and glitter’d in our hero’s sight, As tho’ to be a sun each star was given; He saw the planets rolling on in bright And steady course,—(to one he counted seven Little round moons :) In short, with most ’twould pass, That the whole firmament was lit with gas. And here I’ll take upon me to cut short Our Eagle’s flight, for ’tis not my in tention To weary out my readers, and ex tort Unwilling patience; suffice it to mention, In course of time (the hour precise n’im porte ) He reached the moon, his limit of a scension; “ I’m tir’d,” quoth he, and feel as if I’d swoon, So Dan dismount, and rest there on the moon.” “ And who the devil asked you, was it I, To tire yourself a flying thro’ the air? Sit on the moon! good Lord! what, up so high To perch myself on that round body there!” “ Cease,” said the Eagle,” you had best com ply, Or with one shake I’ll send you, I de clare, Back to the earth, and falling, you will shatter, With mighty crash, your skull and bones to batter.” “ Stretch out your hand and throw your leg a stride, I’ll leave you there a moment at the most, I sorely want to rest my weary side, Demur another second and your lost;” Dan cursed him in his heart, but strait com plied, Seated himself as upright as a post, And looked much like (astronomers may snarl ) A jolly Bacchus on a full-bound barrel. He straddled as I said, and clasped it hard, In momentary terror of a fall, While the malicious bird, to fly pre pared, And leave his rider on the lunar ball; Quoth he, “ stay there until your brains are aired, I’ll hardly come to help you if you call; You shot a chick of mine last year, so Dan, I think I now have paid you off—my man.” Away he fled, and left poor Daniel there, Cursing and praying very piteou sly; Away he fled along the fields of air, Down tow’rds the regions of the western sky, Where thunder clouds were gathering; tho’ else where The sky was cloudless. Daniel saw him fly Fearless along the flashing mist, and fling ǁ The innocuous lightning from his sable wing. He watched him as he lessened in his flight, Gazing with anger, agony and dread; Until he vanished wholly from his sight, And then in sorrowing accents, thus he said “ Oh! am I not a luckless man the night! What shall I do?” (and then he scratched his head,) “ Oh! if I once was home, upon my word, I’d ne’er again set leg across a bird.” How long he staid upon his airy seat, I have not time at present to di sclose; What wondrous things, if any, he did meet, And whether he was hail’d by friends or foes; Whether he set on earth again his feet, My readers fain would learn, I may sup pose; He saw, ’tis true, what none e’er saw be fore;— But we reserve them all for Canto Four.
Long summers have smil’d, and long winters have frown’d Since last, in this time-hallowed bower, With eglantine wreath’d, and with jessamine crown’d, We sigh’d through the soft twilight hour; And many a pleasure hath lured me in vain, And many a sorrow hath past, Since the eve that, long lingering in anguish and pain, From thee, love, I parted the last! Though the billows of danger my course have de lay’d, When the wind rav’d along the dark sea, Through the lands of the stranger my footsteps have stray’d, But my visions were ever with thee. And now, ’mid the scenes of our youth we have met, In the bower where before we did part, And I feel that the Star of my being shall set, With thine, oh beloved of my heart!
O ’tis delightful, on a vernal eve, Within the tranquil and embower’d recess Of a green arbour to recline alone, While gentle rains, descending from the sky, Make pleasant music on the thirsty ground; And there indulge that pleasing pensiveness, That languor of the meditative mind, Which broods upon the ocean of the past, Slow sailing onwards. O ’tis sadly sweet, To hear the small drops plashing on the stems Of succulent herbs, and on the opening buds, While, gently murmuring past, the west wind sighs To and fro, waving, in the twilight air, The broad expanse of melancholy leaves; To see the swallow, ’mid the falling shower, Darting aloft, and wheeling ’mid the sky; And buzzing home, the startled humble-bee, Journeying, in mazy flight, from flower to flower. Then doubly sweet, and doubly touching then, If, from the distant light-green groves, be heard Soft Music’s dying, undulating fall; As if, again, the Pagan deities, Pan or Sylvanus, for one season more, Had sought the empires of their ancient reign : And, turning from the concord of sweet sounds, Gaze on the lovely blossoms, pink and white, Of pear and apple tree; the varied bloom Of varied herb; the many-tinctur’d flowers, Recumbent with the weight of dew, between Their girdles of green leaves; the freshened coats Of evergreens; the myrtle, and the box, And cypress, ’mid whose darkly-clustering boughs The blackbird sits. Such melancholy eyes Have nameless charms for me, too deep for words To utter and unbosom. Feelings dwell Deep, in the inner shrine of human hearts, And sheltered from the rude and passing shocks Of common life, that need the electric spark To fire them,—and at once the soul is flame! To him, who sojourns ’mid the busy crowd Of cities; where contention’s jar is heard For ever dissonant; whose pathway lies Mid tumult, yet whose Poa hath passed away,— His earlier, better years—in privacy, Sequestered from the rude shocks of the world, Mid hills, and dales, and woods, and quiet lawns, And streamy glens, and pastoral dells; to him, Who, every eve, listed the blackbird’s song, And, every morn, beheld the speckled lark Ascend to greet the sun; to him an hour Like this, so pregnant with deep-seated thought, Thought kindled at the shrine of earlier years, Long quench’d, is more delightful than the mirth Of smiling faces, ’mid the perfum’d vaults Of echoing halls majestic, where the pride Of Art emblazoned forth, extinguishes The glow of Nature in the human heart! Oh! not the most intense of present joys Can match the far-departed loveliness Of vanish’d landscapes, when the wizard Time Hath spread o’er all their clefts and roughnesses His twilight mantle, and the spirit broods On what alone is beautiful, and soft, And pure—as summer waters in the sun Sleeping, when not a cloud is on the sky. Oh! not the gorgeous splendour that invests The evening cloud, when, from his western tent, Resplendent glows the setting sun, and beams O’er earth, and sea, and sky, his glorious light, As if to show us, with derisive smiles, How sweet a paradise this world can be— Oh! not the mid-day brightness, nor the blush Of crimson morning, have the deep delight, The state, the grandeur, the impressiveness Of this most intellectual hour, which draws The feelings to a focus, and restores— As native music to a wanderer’s ear, In foreign climes afar beyond the sea— The lightening vista of departed years. There runs a current through the ocean depths, A current through the ocean of the soul, Made up of uncommunicable thoughts— It is in vain, we cannot utter them— Like lava in the bowels of the hill, They dwell unseen—like lightning in the cloud, They hold no concourse with the passing thoughts Of common being, nor communion hold : With what is passing round us; like the rays Of broken sunshine, they illume our paths; Like relics snatched from paradise, they rise Before us, telling us of something fair, Which is not, but which hath been; to the soul They are familiar, but we know not where, Nor when their first. acquaintance-ship began; All speak a language soothing to the heart, Even from their voiceless silence; the thin smoke Bluely ascending from the cottage roof, Through the still air; the sombre, quiet sky; The shelving hills, whose green acclivities Rise in the distance; the umbrageous woods, Forming a canopy of gloom, beneath Whose ample cope the sheltered cattle rest; The paradise of blossom round; the tints Of freshened flowers; the dark and dewy ground; The fanning of the zephyr in its path, Telling of perfume; the melodious hymn Of birds amid the boughs; and far away, Scarce heard, the murmurs of the cataract.
Here sit thee down,—give o’er that peeling wail, And as we quaff, beneath our vineyard’s screen, I’ll tell thee, lover, why I am se rene,— Whilst thou appear’st so pensive and so pale; Behold yon clusters—from the summer’s gale They seem to shrink with apprehensive mien, And midst the leaves, as fearing to be seen, E’en from the Sun, their blushing beauties veil; Despite their coyness, with unsparing hand, Their leafy, green asylums we mo lest, And with this rosy juice, of magic bland, And potency celestial, so, are blest —— I tell thee, I would have thee under stand, That lips, like grapes, are moulded to be prest.
Dry moralists still rail at drinking— let them — They might rail better, could we but per suade them To let the juice of eloquent virtue aid them; They might be witty, had they this to whet them. Oh! let arch Bacchus’ wiles but once be set them, How well their courtesy would be re paid them, How would they shine, when witching wine di splay’d them; Your wits still sparkle more, the more you wet them; Just as the pebbles of the mountain river, Nature’s mosaic, darker dyes and lighter, In wild variety, as the current bore them,— How beautiful may be their hues so ever, Look ten times richer, more than ten times brighter, Beneath the sunny stream that glances o’er them.
The autumnal sun, with melancholy ray, Towards the approach of twilight, from the west Faintly shone out; some specks of fleecy cloud, Scarce coloured by his glory, hover’d round; The wind was not : and, as the shadows threw Their darkness far, the pausing spirit felt The deep impressive stillness of that hour! Sure never place was more forlorn :— I saw, Sole image of existence, the grey hawk Perch’d on an antique stone, once character’d With figures, now all lichen-overgrown.— Four-sided rose the walls around me, dark, And sprinkled with the moss of many a year, Grey mouldering lime, and iron weather-stains, Piled in old times remote, by artisans Long perished, leaving not a trace behind.— Hard by, in ancient times, a hamlet stood Fair, as tradition tells :— its habitants, Sequester’d from the scenes of city life, Were simple, and were peaceful, like the men Of patriarchal days; in love they dwelt, In hope they died, and here were laid to rest. Arising with the lark, at morn they drove Their team a-field; or, on the neighbouring hills, From wanderings and from danger kept their flocks, The long blue summer through; and when the snow s O’erspread the verdant pasture, by the hearth ’Twas theirs to sing amid their household tasks; Friendship together knit their willing hearts; Nor was Love distant, with her rosy smile, And laughing eyes, to bless the younger train.— Now, where the hamlet stood, the fern and moss Spread thick; with prickles arm’d, the bramble throws Its snake-like branches round; the broad-leav’d dock Shoots rankly; and uncheck’d the nettles spring Luxuriant, with their tufts of hanging seed. Silent—alone—one melancholy tree, With rifted rind, and long, lean, hanging boughs, Like skeleton arms, upon the wither’d heath Stands desolate; and with its quivering leaf, That, as in mockery, saws the twilight sky, Whispers, how spareless Time hath triumph’d there! How silent!— Even the beating of my heart Feels an intrusion here :— the sward is dim With moss and danky weeds, and lichen’d stones That seem, as if from immemorial time, Upon the same spot to have lain untouch’d. The very graves have moulder’d to decay, Tenantless—boneless—clods of common earth : The storms, the piercing winds, and plashing rains, So long have beat upon them, and the snows, Melting in spring, so often soak’d them through And through, that every undulating swell Is levell’d. Oh! how dim, how desolate!— The aspect of mortality is press’d Like lead upon my soul :— that human things Such as I am, and others are, and such As those were, who of old were buried here, Should lie and rot amid the damp, wet, mould, Moveless, and voiceless, senseless, silent, still, To nourish for a while the earth-worm’s brood,— Then pass to nothing, like a morning mist,— Nor leave one token, nor one trace behind! Musing, I stand a breathing creature here In loneliness, beneath the twilight sky, Silent, and circled with forgotten graves!— A hundred years have come, and passed away, Since last a fellow mortal in this field Did make his bed of rest; a hundred years, Eluded, have the drilling insects bored Their passage through the sterile soil, nor found Aught new to be a banquet for their brood;— No kind descendant, kindling with the fire Of ancestry, in filial reverence comes Hither to gaze, where his forefathers lay; Their generation, their descendants, all That knew them living, or might weep them dead— Their thoughts, their deeds, their names, their memories, Have floated down the stream of time, to join The ocean of oblivion, on whose breast Of their existence not one wreck appears.— Silently as the clouds of summer heaven, Across the skies of life they fleeted by, And were not; like the flaky snow, that falls Melting within the ocean stream;— the mist That floats upon the gentle morning air, And dies to nothingness at glowing noon; Like valley flowers, which at the sunrise ope Their golden cups, and shut at eventide! A remnant from the flock of human kind They lie cut off—a solitary tribe : Now o’er the spot, where erst their ashes lay, The dews may fall, the rains may beat unknown, The winds may journey, and the weeds may spring,— None heed them, and none hear them—all is still.
The clouds pass away, and are leaving the sky, A region of azure, unclouded and bright; And the star of the twilight, with tremulous eye, Comes forth, like an angel that heralds the night. Not a zephyr is curling the breast of the stream, Not a zephyr is stirring the leaves on the tree, And low hollow sounds, like the hum of a dream, Steal over the vale from the voluble sea, All is tranquil and still, save the spirit of man, All is peaceful and pure, save the dreams of his breast. And the fanciful hopes, that illumine his span, Draw him on, like a spell, from the mansions of rest. When around there is joy, then, within there is strife, On his cheek is a smile, on his bosom is care; And daily, and hourly, the waves of his life Dash, breaking in foam, on the rocks of des pair!
Oh were I laid In the greenwood shade, Beneath the covert of waving trees, Removed from woe, And the ills be low, That render life but a long di sease! No more to weep, But in soothing sleep, To slumber on long ages through; My grave turf bright With the rosy light Of eve, or the morning’s silver dew. I ask no dirge — The foamy surge Of the torrent will sing a lament for me; And the evening breeze, That stir the trees, Will murmur a mournful lulla by. Plant not—plant not Above the spot, Memorial stones for the stranger’s gaze; The earth and sky Are enough, for I Have lived with nature all my days. Oh were I laid In the greenwood shade, Beneath the covert of waving trees, Removed from woe, And the ills be low, That render life but a long di sease!
Astripling tyrant of unyielding look — Unskill’d in manners—learned by the book, Just ’scaped the chastisement he now be stows, Armed in the terrors of unceasing blows — Here stalks the Village “ Master”—in his school, Holding o’er murmuring Wights his rigid rule. A silken handkerchief around his neck — Arrests attention, and commands re spect — Adown his breast in flowing grace, it spreads, And vast importance o’er his presence sheds; A ruffled shirt—his luxury and pride Demands the unbuttoned waistcoat, opened wide — With broad-round brim, like spreading wing of hat, Extends his vast circumference of hat. With air important, solemn, and de vout, The “ Chair of Majesty” is wheeled a bout; Its nicely balanced back a prop sup plies To folded arms, and Heaven-directed eyes — “ The Prayer,” in whispers, quickly circles round, And silence strives to lord it over sound; With half-averted look, and manner sly, With scarcely moving lip, and watchful eye, Each knowing Urchin, through the crowded school, Commits his question—cons his grammar rule, Or, wisely provident of future need, “ Explaining lessons”— now essays to read. This prelude o’er, a solemn pause en sues, As each, with darkened face, his fellow views — Till dire suspense, to certainty gives way, And up the Urchins march, their tasks to say, Around the chair, the “ Armed chair” of state, With open books, they tremblingly a wait, The circle widened by the master’s wand, On one unhappy wight, he lays his hand, Who destined to begin —with beating heart, And tear—confounded eye, essays his part. “ Well—well—and well, sir! make a little haste, Look, blockhead—read; the noun is there mis placed; But where’s the verb, and where the adverb — next, Was ever loggerhead so much per plexed! Now into order put the words at once — The vocative stands foremost still, you dunce; Nay, this is past endurance, bare your breech, And I’ll instruct you in the parts of speech.” And now the “ Taws,” sad prelude of mis hap, Rudely alight in reckless “ Mary’s” lap; A while she eyes the messenger of fate, Then, with unfeigned reluctance, leaves her seat; Around her neck, the hated badge she bears, And takes her woeful pilgrimage with tears. Poor luckless Mary! thou didst only look, One little thoughtless moment off thy book, Thy Brother ’s breech might warmly plead thy cause; That breech which smarted sore beneath the Taws, Thy brother’s tears, and anguish-speaking moan, That momentary “ glance” might well a tone, But thou art doomed a Tyrant’s rage to crave; Thy youth, thy sex, thy beauty, cannot save; Then Nature be thy friend, and let him know, How many “ fountains spring” at every blow.
From house to house, with nicely papered hair, Why roams each busy and ecstatic pair? And why these marks of some unusual feat, That hum, and bustle, through the village street? Why walks the Dame in nicely-platted Toy, And why, in Sunday doublet, struts the boy? Why dresses Tibby, in her best at tire, Whilst gaping gigglement surrounds the fire? His dusty visage why does labour clear, And sports the evening in. his newest gear? A “ Village Wedding,” by the setting. sun, Already is the merriment be gun; Blind Davie Daw has plucked the sounding string, Attuned his fiddle, and away they spring. For “ Dainty Davy,” here the cummers cry, With “ Jenny Nettles,” there the lads re ply; They set, they flap, they loudly beat the ground, With closing arms, they wheel each other round, The maddening music gains upon their feet, So with their hands, a symphony they beat. More rapture still in every reel ap pears, They almost seem suspended by the ears, So high they leap—so knowingly they spring, With so much suppleness and breadth of fling, That skinless heels and: trodden toes en sue, And Jamie swears, his shins are black and blue, While haverel Jean her hanging stocking ties, And to the dance with maddening fury flies. Thy scraping slack, thy bow in mercy draw, Have pity on the “ Lassies,”—Davie Daw. How swell these sides beneath the tightened dress, How pants the Miller’s blooming daughter Bess, Fat Tibby’s cheeks are blown into a fame — If ought befall the Lassies, thou’rt to blame. And now on Lover’s knees, the Cummers sit, Scorning their partners—with provoking wit Backwards their heads in jeering mood they throw — And what the fools are after, beg to know, They flounce, they giggle, and their necks they twist, And spite of all their flummery are kissed.— The cheering punch goes round in caps and jugs, And freely in the drink they lay their lugs. ’Tis tongue, and tug, and mimic flight, and squall, And love, and heat, and palpitation all! Apart upon a broader board ’tis fit The wiser few in conversation sit — Here gaucy Wives with aprons new are seen, Commixed with “ would-be Women,” of thir teen! And aged cronies bent upon their tale, Fill up each pause with lengthened draughts of ale. Again the youngsters fill the floor at once, Arranged and partnered for a “ Country Dance;” Some “ Fat Gudewife” of more than forty years, Dragged to the top, to lead the dance ap pears — In vain she struggles, scolds, protests, and tries, To gain the leave, her Partner still de nies The “ Soldiers Joy,” one clamouronsly de mands,— They wheel, they caper, and they cross their hands, All tongues are busy, every limb em ployed, All time, all order, and all rule des troyed, This way and that, like troubled ocean tossed, All figure, plan, consistency, are lost — Thus fared it once, ere order kept a school, Whilst Nature lumbered in chaotic pool; And struggling atoms through the dark ex panse, From dateless ages kept their “ Country Dance.”— Now kissing seems no more of stealth but law, And squeaking lassies nestle in the “ straw.” Along the dale and up the mountain side, Of noise and merriment, there drifts a tide, And name to name returns, and shout to shout, As onward swells the glee, and revel rout, More distant still the circling echoes come, As each his several way diverges “ home.” Poor hapless Tibby much the Muse be wails, The glee that softens and the night that veils, The lying, coaxing, treacherous jeers that win, Thy all of future life to woe—and sin! Unhallowed Boyhood, raw, blood driven and blind To all of rational that marks thy kind, Oh, pause, and shiver through each boiling vein! The risk contemplate—estimate the gain,— Thy bark, once stranded on that fatal shore, Thou ne’er mayst spread the swelling canvass more. In vain we preach, in vain the truth ap ply, With manner warm, and vice-confounding eye — In vain we pour the sacramental wine, And proffer to the soul the draught di vine. In vain the sigh, the humbled soul that speaks, The drops fast coursing o’er the sinner’s cheeks, The fervours that exalt, the thoughts that pant, The all that speaks the “ young Communi cant.” One “ Wedding Night,” with all its tipsy fun, And each truth-hallowed sentiment is gone. Effaced and banished every pious thought, And every good resolve reduced to nought. We need no “ Trials ” * to corrupt the land — No Surgeon candidate† for place to stand — Our “ penny weddings” do the thing as well, And book full many a candidate for hell.
’Twere endless task, in numbers to re late The ceaseless wanderings of old “ Archy Tait ”— His lonesome travels thro’ the trackless moss — His hair-breadth accidents-adventures cross — His stories frightful, meaningless, and odd — Of ghostly visions on his mighty road — Of voices bursting from the darksome glen — “ Of tumbling amries,” and of headless men — Of sheeted ghosts, and death-foreboding specks Of spreading lights on horse’s ears and necks — Of nightly rap—eluding sick man’s ear — But shaking every limb of nurse to hear — †† Of coffins hammered at the noon of night — Warning of morning job the quaking wright — Of wraiths that take our form, to let us know What hours of future life the fates be stow — Of fires that cross the doubtful travellers’ way, And blaze, to lead his homeward steps a stray — And he would speak of elves, all clad in green, On fairy knowe, or green-sward valley seen, Their airy march has passed him on the lea — The gingling steed, the peal of jolli ty. Of changling Imp—he spoke, no care could rear, Which backward seemed to orp, from year to year. From morn to night some hellish trick that planned, And from a nine years cradle cursed and banned — Which trail’d its toad-like form around the fire, Or crawled on knees and elbows through the mire, At even-tide upset the milk-maid’s pail — Tied up the littered cattle, tail to tail — Then held its sides, and yelled, to hear the roar, And see the rushing milk-maid tumble o’er, And he has heard the wizzard Curlers ply Their gleesome game beneath a wintry sky, As up the nightly Rink, the viewless stone, With sweep, and shout, and booming speed, has gone. Of “ Brownie,” he could tell, his airy strength Across the midnight hearth-stone laid at length — The corn he threshed—the various work he did — The peats he hurled at lazy varlet’s head — His hatred of deceit—the means he chose To punish her who tasted “ Brownie’s broze.” Oh, I have sat from eve to early morn, On Archy’s endless stream of “ stories” borne — Eyed every movement—listened every sound — Called into forms of meaning shapes a round — Yet, still intent to learn each tale of dread, Tho’ deepening o’er my cheek the safron spread — The fading ingle urged into a blaze, From every rafter seen a Terror gaze; The bounding line of light and darkness scanned, And sudden flight ’gainst sudden danger planned Rest to thy spirit “ Archy”—peaceful rest — Amidst thy fellow-spirits of the blessed — And ne’er may’st thou, with ghostly visage come, Around this earth, in “ spectre guise,” to roam — With thy unearthly presence, to af fright Some future wandering “ Archy ” of the night.
The Water-Wraith shrieked over Clyde, The winds through high Dunbarton sighed, When to the trumpet’s call re plied The deep drum from the square; And, in the midnight’s misty shade, With helm, and cloak, and glancing blade, Two hundred horsemen stood ar rayed Beneath the torches’ glare. Around a huge sepulchral van They took their stations, horse and man — The outward gateway’s bolts with drawn, In haste the drawbridge fell; And out, with iron clatter, went That sullen midnight arma ment, Alone the leader knew where bent, With what—he might not tell. Into the darkness they are gone :— The blinded waggon thundered on, And, save of hoof-tramp, sound was none :— Hurriedly on they scour The eastward track—away—a way — To none they speak, brook no de lay, Till farm-cocks heralded the day, And hour had followed hour. Behind them, mingling with the skies, Westward the smoke of Glasgow dies — The pastoral hills of Campsie rise Northward in morning’s air — By Kirkintilloc, Cumber nold, And Castlecary, on they hold, Till Lythgo shows, in mirror’d gold, Its palaced loch so fair.* Brief-baiting time :— the bugle sounds, Onwards the ponderous van re bounds Mid the grim squadron, which sur rounds Its path with spur and spear. Thy shrine, Dumanie, fades on sight,* And, seen from Niddreff’s hazelly height, The Forth, amid its islands bright, Shimmers with lustre clear.† The Maiden Castle next sur veyed, Across the furzy hills of Braid, By Craig-Milor, ‡through Wymet’s glade To Innerese they wound;§ Then o’er the Garlton crags a far, Where, oft a check to England’s war, Cospatrick’s stronghold of Dun bar In proud defiance frowned.‖ Weep, through each grove ye tearful rills! Ye ivied caves, which Echo fills With voice, lament! Ye proud, free hills, Where eagles whee! and soar, Bid noontide o’er your summits throw Storm’s murkiest cloud! Ye vales be low, Let all your wild-flowers cease to blow, And with bent heads de plore! Ye passions, that, with holy fire, Illume man’s bosom—that in spire To daring deed, or proud de sire, With indignation burn! Ye household charities, that keep Watch over childhood’s rosy sleep, Ashes bestrew the hearthstone,— weep As o’er a funeral urn! On—on they speed. Oh dreary day, That, like a vampire, drained a way The blood from Scotland’s heart—de lay, Thou lingering sun to set! Rain, twilight! rain down bloody dews O’er all the eye far northward views; Nor do thou, night of nights! re fuse A darkness black as jet. Heroic spirits of the dead! That in the body nobly bled, By whom the battle-field for bed Was chosen, look ye down,— And see if hearts are all grown cold,— If for their just rights none are bold,— If servile earth one bosom hold, Worthy of old re nown? The pass-word given, o’er bridge of Tweed The cavalcade, with slackened speed, Rolled on, like one from night-mare freed, That draws an easier breath; But o’er and round it hung the gloom As of some dark, mysterious doom, Shadows cast forward from-the tomb, And auguries of death. Scotland receded from the view, And, on the far horizon blue, Faded her last, dear hills—the mew Screamed to its sea-isle near. As day-beams ceased the west to flout, Each after each the stars came out, Like camp-fires heaven’s high hosts a bout, With lustre calm and clear. And on, through many a Saxon town Northumbrian, and of quaint re nown, Before the morning star went down, With thunderous reel they hied; While from the lattices a loof, Of many an angled, gray-stone roof, Rose sudden heads, as sound of hoof And wheel to southward died. Like Hope’s voice preaching to De spair, Sweetly the chimes for matin prayer Melted upon the dewy air From Hexham’s holy pile; But, like the adder deaf, no sound, Or stern or sweet, an echo found ’Mid that dark squadron, as it wound Still onwards, mile on mile. Streamers, and booths, and country games, And brawny churls, with rustic names, And blooming maids, and buxom dames,— A boisterous village fair! On stage his sleights the jongleur shows, Like strutting cock the jester crows, And high the morrice-dancer throws His antic heels in air. Why pause at reel each lad and lass? A solemn awe pervades the mass; Wondering they see the travellers pass, The horsemen journey- worn, And, in the midst, that blinded van So hearse-like; while, from man to man, “ Is it of Death”—in whispers ran — “ This spectacle for lorn?” Bright are thy shadowy forest- bowers, Fair Ashby-de-la-Zouche! with flowers; The wild-deer in its covert cowers, And, from its pine-tree old, The startled cushat, in un rest, Circles around its airy nest, As forward, on its route un blest, Aye on that waggon rolled. And many a grove-encircled town, And many a keep of old re nown, That grimly watched o’er dale and down, They passed unheeding by : Prone from the rocks the waters streamed, And, ’mid the yellow harvests, gleamed The reapers’ sickles, but all seemed, Mere pictures to the eye. Behold a tournay on the green! The tents are pitched—the tilters keen Gambol the listed lines be tween — The motley crowds a round For jibe, and jest, and wanton play Are met—a merry holi day; And glide the lightsome hours a way In mirth, to music’s sound. And hark! the exulting shouts that rise, As, cynosure of circling eyes, Beauty’s fair queen awards the prize To knight that lowly kneels. “ Make way—make way!” is heard a loud — Like Red Sea waters part the crowd, And, scornful of that pageant proud, On grinding rush the wheels! Hundreds and Hamlets far from sight, By lonely granges through the night They camped; and, ere the morning light Crimsoned the orient, they By royal road or baron’s park, Waking the watchful ban-dog’s bark, Before the first song of the lark, Were on their southward way. By Althorpe, and by Oxen don, Without a halt they hurried on, Nor paused by that fair cross of stone, Now for the first time seen, (For death’s dark billows over whelm Both jewelled braid, and knightly helm!) Raised by the monarch of the realm, To Eleanor his queen.* Five times through darkness and through day, Since crossing Tweed, with fresh re lay Ever in wait, their forward way That cavalcade had held; Now joy!!! for, on the weary wights, Loomed London from the Hampstead heights, As, by the opal morning, Night’s Thin vapors were dis pell’d. With spur on heel, and spear in rest, And buckler’d arm, and trellised breast, Closer around their charge they press’d — On whirled, with livelier roll, The wheels begirt with prancing feet, And arms,—a serried mass com plete, Until, by many a stately street, They reached their destined goal. Grim Westminster! thy pile se vere Struck to the heart like sudden fear;— “ Hope flies from all that enter here!” Seemed graven on its crest. The moat o’erpassed, at warn of bell, Down thundering the portcullis fell, And clang’d the studded gates,—a knell Despairing and un blest. Ye guardian angels! that ful fil Heaven’s high decrees, and work its will — Ye thunderbolts! launched forth to kill,— Where was it then ye slept — When, foe-bemocked, in prison square, To death fore-doomed, with dauntless air, From out that van, A shackled man — Sir William Wallace stept!
Aglorious amphitheatre, whose girth Exceeds three-fold th’ horizons of the north, Mixing our pleasure in a goblet wide, With hard, firm rim through clear air far des cried; llumined mountains, on whose heavenly slopes, Quick, busy shades rehearse, while Phœbus drops, Dramatic parts in scenic myste ries; Far-shadowing islands, and exulting seas With cities girt, that catch, till day is done, Successive glances from the circling sun, And cast a snowy gleam across the blue;— A gulf that, to its lakelike softness true, Reveres the stillness of the syren’s cell, Yet knows the ocean’s roll, and loves it well; A gulf where Zephyr oft, with noon-tide heat Oppressed, descends to bathe his sacred feet, And, at the first cold touch, at once re viving, Sinks to the wings in joy, before him driving A feathery foam into the lemon groves;— Evasive, zone-like sands and secret coves; Translucent waves that, heaved with motion slow, On fanes submerged a brighter gleam be stow; Fair hamlets, streets with odorous myrtles spread, Bruised by processions grave with soundless tread, That leave (the Duomo entered) on the mind A pomp confused, and music on the wind; Smooth, mounded banks like inland coasts and capes, That take from seas extinct their sinuous shapes, And girdle plains whose growths, fire-fed be low, In bacchanal exuberance burst and blow; A light Olympian and an air di vine — Naples! if these are blessings, they are thine. Thy sands we paced in sunlight and soft gloom, From Tasso’s birthplace roamed to Virgil’s tomb. Baia! thy haunts we trod, and glowing caves Whose ambushed ardours pant o’er vine-decked waves. Thy cliffs we coasted, loitered in thy creeks, O shaggy island* with the five gray peaks! Explored thy grotto, scaled thy fortress, where Thy dark-eyed maids trip down the rocky stair, With the cast backward, laugh of playful scorn, And cheek carnationed with the lights of morn. The hills Lactarean lodged us in their breast : Shadowy Sorrento to her spicy rest Called us from far with gales embalmed, yet pure; Her orange brakes we pierced, and ranged her rifts ob scure. Breathless along Pompeii’s streets we strayed By songless fount, mosaic unde cayed, Voluptuous tomb, still forum, painted hall, Where wreathed Bacchantes float on every wall; Where Ariadne, by the purple deep, Hears not those panting sails, but smiles in sleep; Where yet Silenus grasps the woodland cup, And buried pleasure from its grave looks up. Lastly, the great Vesuvian steep we clomb; Then, Naples! made once more with thee our home. We leave thee now—but first with just re view, We cast the account, and strike the balance true — And thus, as forth we move, we take our last a dieu. From her whom genius never yet in spired, Or virtue raised, or pulse heroic fired; From her who, in the grand historic page, Maintains one barren blank from age to age; From her, with insect life and insect buz, Who, evermore unresting, nothing does; From her who, with the future and the past No commerce holds, no structure rears to last : From streets where sere and jesters, side by side, Range the rank markets, and their gains di vide; Where faith in art, and art in sense is lost, And toys and gewgaws form a nation’s boast; Where Passion, from Affection’s bond cut loose, Revels in orgies of its own a buse; And appetite, from Passion’s portals thrust, Creeps on its belly to its grave of dust; Where Vice her mask disdains, where Fraud is loud, And naught but Wisdom dumb and Justice cowed;— Lastly, from her who planted here un awed, ’Mid headen-topped hills, and waters bright and broad, Lacks heart to gather, and lacks strength to bear, From these, one impulse of the free and fair; And girt not less with ruin, lives to show That worse than wasted weal is wasted woe,— We part; forth issuing through her closing gate, With unreverting faces, not in grate.
Do you see that stately caxon, Which looks with all its whiteness, Like a bush o’erlaid with snow; And the curls, which range be low, Stand stiff in frosty brightness. Come, melt some sweet pomatum— And, for powder do not stint us; Draw your irons from the stove; And, Dicky, quickly move, To make my old wig as por tentous, Don’t ask of to-morrow’s matters, Since them, nor you, nor I, know; Mind your shop, my boy, nor spurn From customers, to earn, For scraping their muzzles, their rhino. 1 Show yourself a wise wig-maker, For sure you’ve enough to handle, As long as folks don’t wear Their own untrimmed grey hair, Without heeding the whispers of scandal. Yet ah, those ears so itching! My muse can not res train ’em; Should a laugh come from the street, Comb and razor you would quit, Nor longer could your fingers re tain ’em.
Oloved by him whom Scotland loves, Long loved, and honoured duly By all who love the bard who sang So sweetly and so truly! In cultured dales his song pre vails, Thrills o’er the eagle’s aëry,— Ah! who that strain has caught, nor sighed For Burns’s “ Highland Mary?” I wandered on from hill to hill, I feared nor wind nor weather; For Burns beside me trode the moor, Beside me pressed the heather. I read his verse—his life—alas! O’er that dark shades ex tended :— With thee at last, and him in thee, My thoughts their wanderings ended. His golden hours of youth were thine— Those hours whose flight is fleetest; Of all his songs to thee he gave The freshest and the sweetest. Ere ripe the fruit, one branch he brake, All rich with bloom and blossom; And shook its dews, its incense shook, Above thy brow and bosom. And when his Spring, alas, how soon! Had been by care sub verted, His Summer, like a god repulsed, Had from his gates de parted; Beneath the evening star, once more, Star of his morn and even! To thee his suppliant hands he spread, And hailed his love “ in heaven,” And if his spirit in “ a waste Of shame” too oft was squandered, And if too oft his feet ill-starred In ways erroneous wandered; Yet still his spirit’s spirit bathed In purity e ternal; And all fair things through thee retained For him their aspect vernal. Nor less that tenderness remained Thy favouring love im planted; Compunctious pity, yearnings vague For love to earth not granted; Reserve with freedom, female grace Well matched with manly vigour, In songs where faney twined her wreaths Round judgment’s stalwart rigour. A mute but strong appeal was made To him by feeblest creatures; In his large heart had each a part That part had found in Nature’s, The wildered sheep, sagacious dog, Old horse reduced and crazy, The field-mouse by the plough upturned, And violated daisy. In him there burned that passionate glow, All Nature’s soul and savour, Which gives its hue to every flower, To every fruit its flavour. Nor less the kindred power he felt, That love of all things human, Whereof the fiery centre is The love man bears to woman. He sang the dignity of man, Sang woman’s grace and goodness; Passed by the world’s half-truths, her lies Pierced through with lance-like shrewdness, Upon life’s broad highways he stood, And aped nor Greek nor Roman; But snatched from heaven Promethean fire To glorify things common. He sang of youth, he sang of age, Their joys, their griefs, their labours; Felt with, not for, the people; hailed All Scotland’s sons his neighbours; And therefore all repeat his verse— Hot youth, or graybeard steady, The boat-man on Loch Etive’s wave, The shepherd on Ben Ledi. He sang from love of song; his name Dunedin’s cliff re sounded :— He left her, faithful to a fame On truth and nature founded. He sought true fame, not loud ac claim; Himself and Time he trusted : For laurels crackling in the flame His fine ear never lusted. He loved, and reason had to love, The illustrious land that bore him : Where’er he went, like heaven’s broad tent A star-bright Past hung o’er him, Each isle had fenced saint recluse, Each tower a hero dying; Down every mountain-gorge had rolled. The flood of foemen flying. From age to age that land had paid No alien throne sub mission, For feudal faith had been her Law, And freedom her Tra dition, : Where frowned the rocks had Freedom smiled, Sung, mid the shrill wind’s whistle — So England prized her garden Rose, But Scotland loved her Thistle. The land thus pure from foreign foot, Her growing powers thus centred Around her heart, with other lands The race historic entered. Her struggling dawn, convulsed or bright, Worker on through storms and troubles, Whilst a heroie line of kings Strove with heroic nobles. Fair field alone the brave demand, And Scotland ne’er had Jost it : And honest prove the hate and love To objects meet a djusted. Intelligible course was hers; By safety tried or danger : The native was for native known— The stranger known for stranger. Honour in her a sphere had found, Nobility a station, The patriot’s thought the task it sought, And virtue—tole ration. Her will and way had ne’er been crossed In fatal contra diction; Nor loyalty to treason soured, Nor faith abused with fiction. Can song be mute where hearts are sound? Weak doubts—away we fling them! The land that breeds great men, great deeds Should ne’er lack bards to sing them, That vigour, sense, and mutual truth Which bafiled each in vader, Shall fill her marts, and feed her arts, While peaceful olives shade her. Honour to Scotland and to Burns! In him she stands col lected. A thousand streams one river make — Thus Genius, heaven-di rected, Conjoins all separate veins of power The one great-soul creation; And blends a million men to make The Poet of the nation. Honour to Burns! and her who first Let loose the abounding river Of music from the Poet’s heart, Borne through all lands for ever! How much to her mankind has owed Of song’s selectest treasures! Unsweetened by her kiss, his lips Had sung far other measures. Be green for aye, green bank and brae Around Mongomery’s Castle! Blow there, ye earliest flowers! and there, Ye sweetest song-birds, nestle! For there was ta’en that last farewell In hope, indulged how blindly; And there was given that long last gaze “ That dwelt” on him “ sae kindly.” No word of thine recorded stands; Few words that hour were spoken : Two Bibles there were interchanged, And some slight love-gift broken. And there thy cold faint hands he pressed, Thy head by dewdrops misted; And kisses, ill-resisted first, At last were unre sisted. Ah cease!— she died. He too is dead, Of all her girlish graces Perhaps one nameless lock remains : The rest stern Time ef faces — Dust lost in dust. Not so : a bloom Is hers that ne’er can wither; And in that lay which lives for aye The twain live on to gether.
As gleams the sunrise on the deep, And on yon cliffs where eagles sweep, And on the circling forests deep, This morn, which owns the New Year’s birth,— Is there no gratulating strain : To hail the advent of thy reign, Thou latest link of Time’s long chain Let down from heaven to this our earth? Of Britain be that strain;— for she, Stretching her empire o’er the sea, Exalts the lowly, and sets free From thraldom’s bonds the fettered slave; For ever may her children share The smiles of her maternal care; For ever may her vessels bear St. George’s standard o’er the wave! Droop not! Although dark tempests may Obscure awhile the potent ray That to these o’er-sea realms brought day, And Treason walk secure the scene; A second morning o’er the deep Shall call us jubilee to keep, And to old strains each heart shall leap — “God save Britannia’s noble Queen!” “ God save Britannia’s noble Queen!” — Shout it aloud! that strain hath been From east to west, in every scene, Heard by the nations, like a hymn Wafted along from clime to clime, To succour truth, to startle crime,” And, with an influence all su blime, To brighten what before was dim. Hark! ’tis Britannia’s morning gun Heralding thee, thou glorious sun; And, if it peal when daylight’s done Doth she not well that honour claim? For wheresoe’er thy beams light earth, Thou seest her wisdom and her worth; Glories that own to her their birth, And trophies of her deathless fame! From Zembla’s snows to India’s sun To her the faint, the feeble run, They who Oppression’s grasp would shun, Or Superstition’s horrors blind : There exiles find a country— there Monarchs and serfs alike re pair, And, underneath her guardian care, A sure and safe asylum find! Then think not, demagogues! on whom Strike these first rays which now il lume Our land, that, with this year, in gloom Shall Britain’s power eclipsed be seen. No! if she wills it, hearts are here That glory in her high ca reer, That from her side will sunder ne’er, But proudly own one common Queen! Methinks there glows in Britain yet A feeling that would grieve to let Thee, sun! upon her empire set, While shouts of rival nations rose : Our fathers were her sons, and we Are but her offspring o’er the sea; Aye undivided let us be — We scorn to link us with her foes! Methinks her subjects, side by side, Will long her burdens just di vide,— Will long maintain, in matchless pride, Her flag, which aye hath honoured been :— And many a great deed yet be done, And many a glorious field be won, Ere of her empire set the sun. “ God save Britannia’s noble Queen,”
News for you, gentlemen! Here is pro sperity, Fat and fullhanded, arrived at our door : Crashes, disasters, and famine’s se verity, Never can harass or trouble us more. No miching malecho! Spin away calico! Never saw man such a prospect be fore! All things are cheapened. Good sirs, in the galleries, Pray bear this cheerful announcement in mind — All things are down—except Ministers’ salaries, Taxes, and some little jobs of the kind. Small trades are finishing, Wages di minishing — That is the way to be happy, you’ll find. Wheat’s at a price that won’t pay for the growing it, That is to say, if we cultivate here; Why should we therefore persist, sirs, in sowing it? Beautiful markets are plenty and near. Hang the home labourer! Buy from your neighbour, or Any one else, so you don’t buy it dear. True pioneers of a better and brighter age, We have diminished the charges for freight; Some little dues there may still be for “ lighterage,”* But, on the whole, ’tis a moderate rate. Wheat for a guinea Load from Vol hynia Comes to your shores, and is lodged at your gate. Huxtable’s pigs, though replete with ammonia, Never worked any such wonders as these; Barley from Mecklenburg, grain from Polonia, Butter from Holland, American cheese; Bacon gra tuitous, Cargoes for tuitous, Float to our coasts with each prosperous breeze. What need we care though a desperate peasantry Prowl round the stackyards with tinder and match? Blandly we’ll smile at such practical pleasantry : Downing Street is not surmounted by thatch. We’re not pro hibiting Some gentle gibbeting When the poor starving delinquents you catch. Cobden, our oracle, swears it is vanity Ever to dream of protection a gain : Wilson declares it is downright in sanity, Also he proves it by figures and pen. Sheets arith metical, Clearly pro phetical, Flow from the quills of these eminent men. Likewise M’Gregor, that brilliant Gla swegian, Whom we desiderate always to speak, Hath, by the aid of some second-sight Stygian, Promised us shortly two millions per week, “ Whaur shall we pit it, sirs?” — Wait till you get it, sirs! Zooks! what a prospect of bubble and squeak! As for you paltry persisting Protectionists, Why should you prate of the labourer’s cause? Don’t you observe you are mere Re surrectionists Trying to get at the grave of the laws? Honest Peel strangled them, Then the Whigs mangled them, Coffined, and sank them with Cobden’s ap plause. Any such notions I think you had best bury Deep in the grave where your idol is laid; Then, from the lips of the member for Westbury, Take a sound lesson in matters of trade. List to his pro phecies — We’ll keep our offices Snug, till your final conversion is made. Deuce take those breechesless rascals the Highlanders! Let them go starve on their beggarly hills : Irish impostors, and kelp-making Islanders, Can’t they find room in our poor-law Ba stilles? Or, for variety, Though there’s satiety, Let them be packed to the calico mills! Wages must tumble, like leaves in a hurricane, Under this grand competition for work : Britons shall toil for the Jew and A merican, Chinaman, Spaniard, Mulatto, and Turk — Each village Hannibal, Fierce as a cannibal, Eyeing his neighbour like Bishop or Burke! These are the triumphs of science po litical — These are the views by the Whigs pa tronised. Tories may scout them; but, ne’ertheless, it I call Such a grand scheme as was seldom devised. How is it robbery? Cheapness and jobbery Are the twin saints whom we’ve just ca nonised. Under the free-trading auspices, true it is Some time or other taxation may pinch. Then for a shy at the Funds and An nuities! We’ll take a yard since you gave us an inch. Hush, Mr. Newdegate! Why not re pudiate, Just as was done by the pupils of Lynch? Worthy Sir Robert, that statesman im maculate, Doubled his fortune by doubling the pound : Even the wisest may sometimes mis calculate — Surely he will not object to re fund? “ That were a merry go! See you at Jericho!” O—very well—I abandon that ground. Shortly—I say, with habitual bonhomie, Everything’s quiet as we Ministers wish, Plenty and peace are combined with e conomy, Food is abundant—provide you the dish. Pay to the foreigner, Peasant and mariner, All you can raise for your loaf and your fish. Banish all notions of British a scendency, Let them be wiped from our memory quite; Modern views have an opposite tendency, As hath been clearly expounded by Bright. Let us be sensible — Britain’s defensible, Not by brute force, but by maxims of right. We, for the voice of the populace amorous, Willing to do anything they require, Shall, if hereafter — chance to grow clamorous, Yield just precisely the thing they desire : We are quite ready to March with a steady toe Out of the frying-pan into the fire. Sunk, like the inmates of Huxtable’s piggery, Up to the knees in an exquisite draft Stand the determined apostles of Whiggery, Chewing the grain, and rejecting the chaff. Ay, Mr. Huxtable! Not from your muck stable, Issues so hearty a grunting or laugh! This, I maintain, of our state is the very type — Joseph’s fat cattle and atrophied kine. We, for the first, may be ta’en by Daguerreotype : Who are the second, you well may di vine. Yea, of a verity! Britain’s pros perity, Means nothing else than the measure of mine!
The earlier frosts had long be gun Their work on ev’ry tenderer tree, And nearly banished, one by one, Blythe summer’s tints of greener y; For every bough’s extremi ty Turned slowly to an alien hue; The ashes faded to a yel low, The limes became all sickly sal low, And tawney-red the hawthorns grew. The beeches’ gloss fled fast a way, And left them brown as iron ore; And e’en the old oak’s outer spray, Marks of this nightly searing bore; And yester eve, the frequent shower Shrouded the moon in wat’ry gloom, And drench’d the branches drooping low; And now, a more relentless foe! Hoarse wind of Autumn thou art come! By the loud uproar of the din, Pour’d thro’ yon swaying aven ue; Whose arching elms, to one with in, Appear some huge cathedral view; And by those flickering leaves that strew The late uncumber’d tracks of deer — And by that tossing pine, which fast Stoops like some drifting shallop’s mast, Hoarse wind of Autumn thou art here! See how the deer are crowding round Yon group of patriarchal oaks, Whose wide extended limbs re bound Against the blast’s assiduous strokes : The dappled herd, with anxious looks, And heads all earthward bending move, To pry where auburn acorns rest New shaken from their cups a bove,— And glean a rich autumnal feast. Aye, wind of autumn, wild and rude Thou com’st to rend, with ruthless hand, The sickening foliage of the wood; For all that spring, with nurture bland, Of mild and tepid breezes fann’d — And fed with balmy dew and shower; And all that summer’s sunny sky Disclosed in rich maturi ty, Must sink before thy wasting power. Thy hands are busy, noisy blast, In stripping each discolor’d tree, Of shoals of leaves which flutter past — Their ruin this, but sport to thee. And though thy violence we see, Now tearing down a load, and now, But what would fill an infant’s hand; Yet ere thou goest, each tree shall stand With trunk unveil’d, and leafless bough. Yet no—the oak and beech shall still Hold to the south some garland sere, Nor lose these hard-kept honours till The winter-wind, thy wild com peer, Roar still more loudly in the ear. And see, the holly stands se cure, It scorns you both, defies your bluster, Nor loses leaf, nor coral cluster, Unless for christmas garni ture. Like leaves from some deciduous tree, Since youthful fancies fall a way, Oh, may I-like yon holly be, And gain those stabler tastes, which stay! Nor, as life’s seasons change, de cay! May I accomplishments pos sess, To make me—like the holly bower — Retain a cheering, leafi ness, Yea, even in age’s wintry hour.
High o’er the drama’s visio nary scene The goddess Fancy rules—its fairy queen : She o’er its new created worlds pre sides, And all the movements of its magic guides. Our hearts, bewitch’d, submissive own her sway — Beat as she prompts, and, as she wills, o bey. Call’d by her power, and by her influence led, The stage, new peopled, swarms with mighty dead; The great of old a charnel revel keep, And Kings and Cæsars issue from their sleep; Her boundless flights no limits can re strain, And time resists, and space obstructs, in vain; She, mighty mistress, each defect supp lies, And grants us all that sterner Truth de nies. Since then, the votaries of her scenic power, We stoop to linger in her favourite bower; Since early moved, and, hearkening to her call, We worship Fancy in her fairy hall; Respect the power whose ministers we stand, And pay the tribute of th’ applauding hand; Be Reason’s cool control awhile re sign’d, And give to Fancy’s day-dreams all the mind. And thou, bright power, in whose exhaustless mine The many-colour’d gems of genius shine; At whose command new light-form’d Ariels rise, And new Titanias greet the wondering eyes; Be present while we thus thy rites dis play, And light us with thy rain-bow beaming ray : So shall our work reveal the hand di vine, And prove us worthy offerers at thy shrine.
Within the greenwood as I walked, Upon a summer’s day, I saw a vision wonderful, That filled me with di smay. Beneath the spreading shadow Of a tall and stately tree, Was a band of porkers gathered, Grunting fierce as fierce could be. They were rough and bristly monsters, With an aspect most ob scene; And they trampled to a dunghill All the fair and comely green. Hideous tusks, and sharply whetted, Did the savage creatures bear; And their flanks were thick incrusted With the droppings of their lair. Above the mighty branches spread From out the parent stem; And lo! I saw a Mannikin High perched on one of them. His face was pale, his cheeks were white; He sate in utter woe; It seemed he durst not venture down, For fear of those be low. But anon he shook the branches, And down the acorns fell, And then the beasts rushed forward, Each with a horrid yell. Right sharp and savage was the grunt, Though plentiful the food : So sate the lonely Mannikin Within the lonely wood. But as I tarried, wondering much To see the little man, A gleam of light came o’er his face, It seemed some cunning plan Rose up within him, for he grinned And nodded to him self, Then grinned again and chuckled, Like a sly and naughty elf. And then I marked him, steal thily From out his belt with draw A weapon in the morning light, That glittered like a saw; And straight astride a heavy branch Right nimbly clambered he And sawed away most bu sily, Between him and the tree! Then longer from accosting him I could not well for bear — “ What, ho, thou foolish Mannikin! What art thou doing there? A little deeper, and ’tis plain The branch must downward go, And down with it the carpenter Unto the beasts be low!” Then answered back the Mannikin — “ Aha! I’m light and strong : You’ll see me scramble higher up, And higher yet ere long. But first this branch I sever, just To please the hungry swine; And then I’ll lop another off— For that’s a scheme of mine!” “ Forbear, thou naughty Mannikin!” Twas thus again I spoke — “ Who was’t gave thee the liberty To lop that stately oak? : In strength and glory it hath stood A thousand years and more, Still spreading forth its mighty arms, As proudly as of yore. What tree hath ever matched it yet For majesty of form? Or yielded such a sure defence From heat, or rain, or storm? Though tempests often round it swept, It still hath bravely stood, Nor ever stooped its shapely crest— That monarch of the wood! “ And thou, an ape-like atomy, Perched up within the tree! Shall its fair limbs be lopped away By such a dwarf as thee?” Yet chattered still the Mannikin— “ Down, down, the branch must go! The pigs demand the sacrifice— They’re watching me be low. See—see! they’re grunting upwards! ah, They bare their tusks at me! For rather than offend my swine I would uproot the tree. Hush—hush, my darlings! Hush, my dears? Here’s plenty food for you — A moment’s patience, and ’tis done; The branch is nearly through!” “ Have done, thou wicked Mannikin, And hold that hand of thine; I marvel what Ulysses ’twas Set thee to keep the swine! If from that noble forest-tree Thou loppest every shoot, Where, when another autumn comes, Will be the needful fruit? ’Tis well to feed thy bristly herd, Ay, feed them to the fill; But leave the oak-tree unprofaned With all its branches still : Lest, when the swine have eaten all The food that thou canst send, ‘ They take a horrid fancy next, To dine on thee, my friend!” ’Twas thus I spoke in warning. Still The Mannikin said, “ Nay!” But ever chattered busily, And ever sawed a way. I marked the branch declining fast, Its fibres creaking sore : I heard the grunting of the beasts Still fiercer than be fore. High up into the air was thrown Each grim uncleanly snout, With wriggling tails and cloven hoofs They galloped all a bout. They flung the mire and pebbles up, In their unholy glee, And held a Satan’s carnival Beneath the fated tree! But as I gazed in wonderment, The sky grew dark a bove; A whirlwind sharp and fitful ly Among the branches drove; There was swaying, shrieking, groaning, Throughout the forest wide, And the hurricane came downward With an angry angel’s stride. Then, right across the welkin, shot The red and dazzling levin, And the thunder brattled growling ly Within the dome of heaven. ’Twere better in an hour like that Far off at home to be, Than watching silly Mannikins Upon the greenwood tree! The first flash scared the porkers; Their nasal snort grew still — The second sent them cowering; As low-bred monsters will — The third with triple ferven cy, And answering peal broke out; Then helter-skelter from the tree Rushed forth the filthy rout. looked up for my Mannikin— I saw him clinging there To branch and twig, to bark and bough, The image of de spair. And ever as the gust blew strong, He clutched with desperate paw, And wildly-chattered in affright— “ The foul fiend take the saw!” By Tamworth town a hermit dwells, Who riddles strange can read; A wizard once of dreaded power, And versed in many a creed. Of Michael Scott no wilder tales Have ever yet been told : Men say he knew the wondrous art Of multiplying gold. But now his magic wand is broke, His tricksy spirits gone, And on a backward bench he sits, Forsaken and a lone. To him I went, and told him straight The things that I had seen! “ O holy man, I pray thee say, What may this vision mean?” The hermit smiled—he stroked his chin— Then quaintly answered he, “ There’s something very singular Connected with that tree! Once on a time, when bark was dear, The boughs I thought to peel, But that same hurricane arose And tossed me head o’er heel. I think the oak will last my time— But hark! I hear the bell!” With his left hand he crossed himself, Then slid into his cell. But what the herd of porkers were, He never told to me; Nor who might be the mannikin Was sawing at the tree.
Whilst vice parades her front in open day, Nor finds contempt companion of her way; Whilst darkness veils the nightly-prowling thief, And skulking malice baffles all be lief; Whilst children lisp in oaths of dreadful name, And steal, and stare, beyond the reach of shame; Whilst radical confusion rules the hour, Which speaks Queen Caroline’s degrading power, And men are maddened to the last ex treme, Nor reckon blasphemy nor treason shame; If nature fails in such provoking times, Even indignation must have vent in rhymes! Helmorran, great in every deed of ill, In inclination only greater still, Be thou my theme! in all thy motley show Of ragged crime and variegated woe; Stand forth supreme of every sister band, The scorn, contempt, and bye-word of the land. Long have thy sins for vengeance sued a loud, And long has slept the lightning in the cloud; Now let the guilty tremble—in his ire Heaven speeds a tempest of vindictive fire. On watchful day has crept the coward night, And screened her deeds of darkness from the sight; Forth issuing now, with noiseless step and breath, The song of Belial track their fearful path. This to the barn-yard, feels his miscreant way, And this the hen-roost destines as his prey; This wanders far in quest of plunder store, Whilst this steals boldly from his neighbour’s door. Hast thou with care adorned thy pleasure- ground, And made an Eden of thy fields a round? Cut into clumps and waving swells thy lawn, And graced thy paddock with the fearful fawn? Canst thou set watch for those who shun the light, Or bind in bonds the Demons of the night? Avert the weapon, whose accursed use Is mangling devastation and a buse? Thy poultry own thy unremitted care, And geese and turkeys fatten on their fare; Thy ducks and chickens crowd thy kitchen door, And noisy gabblings speak thy feathered store. With lock and bar thy peopled roost pro tect, Thou canst not stem that bleeding turkey’s neck, Restore the wing by well-aimed malice broke, Nor speak protection to thy limping flock! One favourite dog, by age and worth en deared, Recalls the memory of a name re vered — A father’s kindly unremitted love — A tender mother’s now in heaven a bove; Around his every motion time has cast Deep-rooted recollections of the past; The well known cough, and head of silver hair — The chapter folded down, and conned with care — The time, the place, the incidents that were. Upon thy hearth he takes his daily bed Of matted fleece, by thy own fingers spread; In circling movement folds his shaggy paws, And yawns his languor with distended jaws. Around his couch thy menials move with care, All thy affection share, or seem to share; The very housemaid plies a cautious broom, And treads more softly through the dusted room. Though, all unapt for motion, forth he creep, To stretch a tedious interval, and sleep; Though visionless he eat his wonted meal, Without or recognisance or ap peal, Refuse the “ bit” bestowed in action bland, And scarcely deign to lick the giver’s hand; The time has been, when with thy changing eye, His own had gleamed or sorrowed in re ply; From forth thy opened door he’d shot a way, In antic gambo! and unceasing play, Made all thy lawn re-echo to his tale, And chased in very sport his circling tail! His sports are numbered, all his meals are past, Doomed to receive a poisoned meal at last! Around thee blooms the purple heather- bell, And daisies spread their cups along the dell; The fox-glove reddens on thy scented banks, And blue-bells hang their heads in graceful ranks; The starry-headed clover sprinkles o’er Thy green-sward pasture-ground with snow shower : Amidst these sweets, and o’er that honeyed lea, Through gayest noontide summer hums the bee; From flower to flower, with note of tiny swell, He culls provision for his winter cell, With loaded thigh ascends the sunny day, And homeward speeds his heaven-conducted way; Ill-fated wanderer of thy cherished hive, What means can care pursue, can art con trive! What engine set, the spoiler’s steps to stay, Which bears at noon of night thy store a way! Whence have these cows their food, that seem so sleek; And by the highway-side a pittance seek? These horses, can they labour thus on nought, For whose support no provender is bought? The neighbouring farmer—for he knows full well — Could solve the problem, if he dared to tell. Such are thy deeds, Helmorran! such thy shame Befitting well thy far-detested name! The actors next we sing in order due, And from perplexing numbers cull a few.
They’ll speak of him for many a year, In Britain’s sad de cline, In other lands, perchance, than this, Across the weltering brine. They’ll speak of him who drove them forth In alien fields to toil, Who forced them from their fathers’ hearths, The children of the soil! Amidst the deserts of the west When evening shadows fall, Around their aged grandsire’s knees The babes will gather all — And “ Tell us, grandsire,” thus they’ll speak, “ O tell us yet a gain, Of that dear native land of yours That lies beyond the main. “ Why did you leave that happy land, And seek a shelter here, Where keenly sweeps the northern wind Through frozen forests drear? And why forsake the purple hills Where Scotland’s heather grows, To shudder in this dreary waste Of cold Canadian snows?” “ Ah, children—Ye recall the time. When I was young and strong, When never roebuck on the brae More swiftly, raced a long. I dwelt within a bieldy hut Far up a Highland glen, With forty more our name that bore, All true and loyal men. “ We sowed the seed, and reaped the grain, With thankful hearts and kind; Our cattle grazed upon the hill That rose our homes be hind. Each Sabbath-day we worshipped God Within the homely fane, All circled by the blessed graves I ne’er shall see a gain. “ Our chief—ah, me! how proud were we That honoured name to hail, Was, like his fathers, true and just— In heart and soul, a Gael. His lands were narrowed in their range Since dark Culloden’s day, But o’er our hearts the ancient name Still bore its ancient sway. “ He loved us : Ay! he did not leave His old ancestral home, As many did, with stranger friends In foreign lands to roam. God’s blessing rest upon his head, Alive or dead, say I; For ’midst his clan, though dwindled sore, He looked to live and die! And so we dwelt, in peace and rest, For many a changing year : Not rich; but riches never made A home so doubly dear. From kindly earth, from verdant hill, From river, lock, and wood, We drew the stores that kept us still In raiment and in food. One year—I know not which it was, For it was long a go,— The summer had been cold and wet, And early fell the snow; A heavy blight came down from heaven On plant, and root, and grain, And what the pestilence had touched, Ne’er rose to life a gain. It was an awful winter. Want And famine raged a round; Yet little felt we of their power, Within our master’s ground. Our debts were few, our rents were small, And these were all for given — No heavier burden did we bear Than that which fell from heaven! The spring came round—the primrose bloomed Upon the bank and brae, And blythsome looked the bonny glen Within the light of May. The lowing of a hundred herds, The voices of the rills, The bleat of flocks, the glad bird’s song Rang o’er our Highland hills. The blade was springing in the field Right healthily and green, With promise of the fairest yield That eye had ever seen. And joy rose up within our hearts, We feared no more de cay, But thanked our Maker—who had ta’en The grievous curse a way. “ O little knew we of the men Who ruled within the land; The days were gone when Scottish hearts O’er Scotland held com mand. The days were gone when valiant souls Who knew their country’s right, Stood foremost at the council board As they were first in fight. “ The spirit of the olden time, That blazed so bright of yore, Had died away, and no one spoke Of faith or honour more. They deemed this glorious earth was made, And vaulted with the sky, For nothing but to gather gold, To traffic, fawn, and lie! “ And so they reared the chimney-stalk, And so they laid the keel, And trampled on the labouring poor With hard and heavy heel. A cold and crafty Southron carle, Was lord and master there : No gentle blood had he who stood Beside the monarch’s chair. “ He made his laws—I wot not how— But this I know full well, “ That ruin like a biting frost Upon the country fell. It mattered not how bright the sun, How bountiful the rain, The wickedness of man had made The gifts of God in vain. “ These were sore days. Within the towns Was nought but foreign bread; By foreign serfs beyond the seas “ The people now were fed. No work was there for us to do, No labour far or near; We dared not render thanks to Him Who sent a fruitful year. “ The plough lay rusting in-the field : We drove our cattle down, We sold them—’twas our last resource, Within a distant town. The poor dumb creatures! when they went I knew the hour must come, For the like woeful journey next, To those that were not dumb. “ And so it fell. One weary day The bitter news was told, That the fair land we loved so well Was to a stranger sold, The race that for a thousand years Had dwelt within the glen, Were rudely summoned from their homes, To beg as broken men. “ Some would not leave—the ruffians tore The crumbling thatch a way; They plucked the rafters from the wall, And bade them starve and stay! The old, the bedrid, and the sick, The wife and new born child — I thank my God, I did not strike, Although my heart was wild! “ We parted—kinsfolk, clansmen, friends, With heavy hearts and sore; We parted by the water side, To meet on earth no more. The sun was sinking to his rest Amidst a lurid sky, And from the darkening hill above We heard the falcon’s cry.” “ O wicked deed, O cruel men! O sad and woeful day! But, grandsire, tell us of your friends And kinsfolk, where are they?” “ They lie within the festering heaps, Among the city dead — Scant burial had they for their bones, No gravestones mark their head; “ Some died of want, of sorrow some, And some of broken age : They who lived on were sad as birds Cooped in a narrow cage. O children, with the savage beasts I’d rather lay me down, Than dwell among the stifling lanes Within a factory town! “ Sharp hunger forced us to the mills; We slaved for scanty food ’Midst flashing looms, and buzzing wheels, And strangers rough and rude. From morn to night we toiled and spun Like beasts to labour driven, And only through the dingy panes We saw the light of heaven. “ Ay, there was room for all! The child That scarce could walk a lone, The little ones we loved so well, The stripling and the grown; The modest maiden forced to bear The coarse and scurril jest; The old man with his silver hairs— The wife with babe at breast. “ All, all might work—for England ne’er Had borne so high a name, Though not for Christian chivalry She strove to keep her fame. No longer streamed Saint George’s cross The foremost in the air, Her glory lay in cotton bales And yards of flimsy ware. “ For this we toiled, for this we span, For this all round and round, Ten thousand chimney-stalks were reared Above the blackening ground. For this they made the reaper’s song, The ploughman’s whistle cease; And ’midst the clanking of the chains Proclaimed the reign of peace! “ But we—the Highland-born, the free, How could we struggle there? Still in our hearts we felt the breath Of our fresh mountain air — We saw the shadows of the hills Hang in the waters clear, The purling of the distant rills Was sounding in our ear. “ We sang the old familiar songs— We sang them at the loom; We sang of light, and love, and joy, When all around was gloom. O then, O then—the bitter tears Rose to each aching eye — O were we but once more at home, Though only there to die! “ Death came, but came not quickly. Pale And weak my sister grew; With sharpened pain and wasting sobs Her heavy breath she drew. At last I laid her in her bed When she could work no more. I kissed her poor, thin, wasted cheek— I prayed—and all was o’er! “ I laid her in a stranger’s grave, And then I turned and fled, I cared not whither—anywhere— To earn my honest bread; In any land where flesh and blood Were reckoned more than gain — Where tyrant masters did not wring Their wealth from woe and pain.” O England —England! many a heart Is sad and sore for thee, Though basely, meanly, falsely driven To dwell beyond the sea. O England! if the bonny Rose Was drooping on your crown, Why did you stretch a cruel hand To pluck the Thistle down? There’s many a name of noble fame Writ in your ancient roll; There’s many an honest statesman yet Of free and generous soul : Why stoop to those who cannot walk With high and upright head, Whose living souls no kindred own With thy time-honoured dead? The worst of all—the thrice-forsworn— The gamester of thy fame — How dares he deem that aftertimes Will give him aught but shame? Let monuments be reared above— Of marble heap a hill — The peasant’s curse upon his head Shall weigh the heavier still!
Behind that door, by every filth de filed, Where live in common, parent, sow, and child, The Cobbler sits, in cap of greasy hue, And plies, with frequent rap, the bungled shoe; His snuffy nose a sniv’ling cadence lends, And still at every rap the drop des cends, O’er hand and seam a blackening plaster throws Which owns the origin of Parent Nose. And here his sulky mate, on tripod stool, O’er noisy wight exerts Pythonic rule — Of infant Brat the glowing bottom plies, With skelp responsive to its ceaseless cries, Bans, scolds, and capers, till her husband’s strap Around her shoulders walks, with sobering slap! The veriest Imp, which scarce can mark its feet, Will curse its fellow, or its mother cheat, Deny the truth with shame-untroubled eye, And, though convicted, give the truth the lie, Scream o’er the Screamer, at its topmost pitch, And scatter filth about, and spread the itch!
Urged by that word, which hell might not gain say, Seven devils. passed from. Magdalene a way; But yonder village hut contains a dame, Of whose default eight human devils came. On weekly market nights, as Farmers pass, Beneath the movings of the stirrup glass, Their path she crosses, on their woodland way, And deeds are done, for which the simple pay. All now are fathers, impotent or strong, Or those who did, or those who meant her wrong. A childless husband pays the silence smart, Deep cursing barrenness within his heart. A father bribes, with pious care, the dame, And from an injured spouse conceals the shame, Such proofs of early manhood proud to see, The son admits the wily wanton’s plea, Whilst Bell is paid for all her labours past, And chouses son and father at the last.
You have heard the ancient story, How the gallant sons of Greece, Long ago, with Jason ventured For the fated Golden Fleece; How they traversed distant regions, How they trod on hostile shores; How they vexed the hoary Ocean With the smiting of their oars;— Listen, then, and you shall hear another wondrous tale, Of a second Argo steering before a prosperous gale! From the southward came a rumour, Over sea and over land; From the blue Ionian islands, And the old Hellenic strand; That the sons of Agamemnon, To their faith no longer true, Had confiscated the carpets Of a black and bearded Jew! Helen’s rape, compared to this, was but an idle toy, Deeper guilt was that of Athens than the crime of haughty Troy. And the rumour, winged by Ate, To the lofty chamber ran, Where great Palmerston was sitting In the midst of his Di van : Like Saturnius triumphant, In his high Olympian hall, Unregarded by the mighty, But detested by the small; Overturning constitutions—setting nations by the ears, With divers sapient plenipos, like Minto and his peers. With his fist the proud dictator Smote the table that it rang — From the crystal vase before him The blood-red wine up sprang! “ Is my sword a wreath of rushes, Or an idle plume my pen, That they dare to lay a finger On the meanest of my men? No amount of circumcision can annul the Briton’s right — Are they mad, these lords of Athens, for I know they cannot fight? “ Had the wrong been done by others, By the cold and haughty Czar, Thad trembled ere I opened All the thunders of my war. But I care not for the yelping Of these fangless curs of Greece — Soon and sorely will I tax them For the merchant’s plundered Fleece. From the earth his furniture for wrath and vengeance cries — Ho, Eddisbury! take thy pen, and straightway write to Wyse!” Joyfully the bells are ringing In the old Athenian town, Gaily to Piræus harbour Stream the merry people down; For they see the fleet of Britain Proudly steering to their shore, Underneath the Christian banner That they knew so well of yore, When the guns at Navarino thundered o’er the sea, And the Angel of the North proclaimed that Greece again was free. Hark!— a signal gun—another! On the deck a man ap pears Stately as the Ocean-shaker— “ Ye Athenians, lend your ears! Thomas Wyse am I, a Herald Come to parley with the Greek; Palmerston hath sent me hither, In his awful name I speak — Ye have done a deed of folly—one that ye shall sorely rue! Wherefore did ye lay a finger on the carpets of the Jew? “ Don Pacifico of Malta! Dull, indeed, were Britain’s ear, If the wrongs of such a hero Tamely she could choose to hear! Don Pacifico of Malta! Knight-commander of the Fleece — For his sake I hurl defiance At the haughty towns of Greece. Look to it—For by my head! since Xerxes crossed the strait, Ye never saw an enemy so vengeful at your gate. ‘ Therefore now, restore the carpets, With a forfeit twenty- fold; And a goodly tribute offer Of your treasure and your gold : Sapienza, and the islet Cervi, ye shall likewise cede; So the mighty gods have spoken, Thus hath Palmerston de creed! Ere the sunset, let an answer issue from your monarch’s lips; In the meantime, I have orders to arrest your merchant ships.” Thus he spake, and snatched a trumpet Swiftly from a soldier’s hand, And therein he blew so shrilly, That along the rocky strand Rang the war-note, till the echoes From the distant hills re plied; Hundred trumpets wildly wailing, Poured their blast on every side; And the loud and hearty shout of Britain rent the skies, “ Three cheers for noble Palmerston!— another cheer for Wyse!” Gentles! I am very sorry That I cannot yet re late, Of this gallant expedition, What has been the final fate. Whether Athens was bombarded For her Jew-coercing crimes, Hath not been as yet reported In the columns of the Times. But the last accounts assure us of some valuable spoil : Various coasting vessels, laden with tobacco, fruit, and oil. Ancient chiefs! that sailed with Jason Over the wild and stormy waves — Let not sounds of later triumphs Stir you in your quiet graves! Other Argonauts have ventured To your old Hellenic shore, But they will not live in story, Like the valiant men of yore. O! ’tis more than shame and sorrow thus to jest upon a theme That, for Britain’s fame and glory, all would wish to be a dream!
Come, holy Jamie, come, with all thy store Of canting phrase and hypocritic lore! Thy voice in favour of thyself be raised, The saint, the father, and the man be praised. Thou canst not covet, till the psalm be sung; Thou canst not jest, the Scripture on thy tongue; Thou canst not meditate, in fervent prayer, To cheat the needy of his scanty fare! Yes! thou mayst slyly covet, scheme, and cheat, Each impious jest and slanderous tale re peat. Thy fate is fixed, thy destiny se cure, “ For to the pure in heart, all things are pure!” And lives there ’neath a garb of heavenly show, One reptile hypocrite of earth be low, Who dare betray his master’s sacred name, And bring e’en holiness itself to shame! The Infidel, the veriest Debau chee, Stands higher in the scale of “ Man” than he!
Old Father Sycophant, stand out to light, And self-condemned in injured virtue’s sight; Hast thou not whispered in a certain ear, What cost the houseless widow many a tear?- Laughed at thy patron’s jests, though trite and stale, And “ excellent” exclaimed at every tale? His trees, his lawns, his breed of cattle lauded? And up to heaven his “ politics” ap plauded? Oh! I have marked thee bend, and scrape, and stand, Thy hat low dangling from thy better hand, Yes -ing and No -ing to the great man’s will, And with his changed opinion veering still. Have I not seen thee in a “ Priest’s” at tire, Mixing with holy flame unholy fire? “ His Lordship was at church, you marked, to- day; “ And how, my dearest, did I preach and pray? “ Her Grace was most attentive, I could see — “ She scarcely turned her lovely eyes from me; “ And Lady Ann an angel tear-drop shed, “ I’ll get a Gown when Lady Ann is wed; “ But I must dress for dinner at the hall — “ ‘ I’m not at home,’ should any neighbour call; “ The poor are always sickening—can’t they die? “ Reserve for supper-time the pigeon- pie.” As crows the cock, so chirps the chicken brood :— “ Were ever gentle folks so very good? “ And, dear Papa, my Lady called to- day, “ And ask’d my sister Suky to a play; “ Such real attentive folks I never saw — “ They are so very kind, my dear Pa pa. “ And, dear Papa, how very much we need “ Society, Papa—we do in deed, “ Except the ‘ Russels,’ nobody have we “ Worth pinning down a ribbon end to see, “ A set of low-bred country farmer folks — “ Big-bosom’d Jennies, bullet-headed Jocks — “ With now and then the Laird o’ Spittal Miln, “ Whose face is ever reeking like a kiln. “ It was but t’other day that ‘ Clodpole’ dined “ With us, Papa,—he bullock’d, bull’d, and swin’d, “ And so belaboured us with ‘ fork and knife,’* “ I thought I should have died, upon my life. “ And then they’re so familiar—just con ceive “ How any mortal can at all be have, “ When ‘ Calfhead,’ from his whisky, nods at me, “ And passes with a grinning ‘ Miss, how d’ ye?’ “ And Jock Guidfallow’s daughter curtseys low, “ And how we all are ‘ living,’ begs to know!” Thus aped Sir Frog, the bullock in the stank, And from his brother Frog indignant shrank, Till, ready to explode, by sheer in flation, He learn’d, too late, to know his proper station!
Tufnell! For the love of mercy, Let me go for half an hour — I’ll be back before that proser Hath discussed the price of flour. Don’t you hear, he’s just beginning To investigate the rate Of the Mecklenburgh quotations, Metage, lighterage, and freight? Next, I know, he’ll pass to Dantzic, With a glimpse at Rostock wheat — I have seen the whole already In his Economic sheet. See! upon the backward benches There reposes stealthy Peel — Dreaming, doubtless, that he’s smothered In an atmosphere of meal. Palmerston’s recumbent yonder— Hawes is sleeping by the door; Even Russell’s tiny nostril Quivers with a nascent snore. Let me go—nay, do not hold me So intensely by the coat; I assure you, on my honour, I’ll be back in time to vote. Oh, the night-winds wander sweetly O’er my hot and throbbing brow! What a contrast is the moonlight To the scene I left just now! Let me walk a little onward Underneath the budding trees, Where the faint perfume is wafted On the pinions of the breeze : Overhead a thousand starlets Glisten in the robe of night, And the earth is wrapped in slumber With a pure and calm de light. By your leave, good Master Tufnell, I shall stay a little here; You have plenty noodles yonder Who are safe enough to cheer Wilson’s dunderhead discourses, Or the cant of Labou chere! What a dolt was I to credit All these wild, free-trading schemes! Cobden’s calico predictions, Porter’s importation dreams! For I loathed the mean alliance, Even when I chose to wheel In the wake of him who led us, Pinning foolish faith to Peel. Was I mad, to place my honour In this most disgusting fix? Half the world was rather crazy In the days of Forty- six. O the happy times of premiums! O the balmy touch of scrip! Would that I had sold my bargains Ere they had me on the hip! Every day a new allotment Promised shining heaps of gold; Every day the mounting market Swelled my hopes a hundred fold, I remember old Sir Robert, With his shirt-sleeves rolled on high, Lust of speculation gleaming In his gray and greedy eye; Turning sods with silver shovel, Celebrating that e vent With a speech on competition At the opening of the Trent. I have dined with royal Hudson, And may dine again, per haps, Should another exaltation Follow on this drear col lapse. All had drunk the wine of gambling, All had quaffed the share cham pagne, Wisdom’s warnings were rejected, Prudence preached to us in vain. Madness, frenzy, lust of riches, Reigned within the minds of all, That, we thought, must answer Peter Which had served the turn of Paul. If, by scorning honest labour, Men made fortunes in a trice, What might be the luck of Britain, Casting with Free-traders’ dice? I am strongly of opinion— Looking to my country’s good — That I’ve stuck by him of Tamworth Rather longer than I should. As concerning next election, I’ve received some pregnant hints, Both from country correspon dents, And the leading public prints. Cultivation’s at a discount, Rents are very slowly paid : Some aver that sly Sir Robert Has contrived to coin his spade; Neither is there much progression In the wool and cotton trade. What the deuce would men be after? If those fellows had their will, England would be straight converted To a monstrous cotton- mill. Everywhere would ghastly chimneys Vomit forth their odious mist, Settling, like the breath of Satan, O’er this island of the blest : When the only occupation Would be spinning yarn and twist! Spin away, my brave compatriots! Spin as largely as you can; Who shall dare to set a limit To the sale of shirts for man? Whilst the raw material’s granted, Spin away with might and main; Use the time that’s still vouchsafed you, For it may not come a gain. There’s a smartish kind of notion Running in the Yankees’ head, That they need not be indebted To your kindness for their thread. In the meanwhile go for cheapness, Smite the farmers hip and thigh — Making honest people bankrupt Is the way to make them buy. Starve the masses of the nation, Drive them all into the mills; Clear the plains and sweep the valleys, Desolate the Highland hills. Let the rough hard-fisted yeoman, All too clumsy for the loom Migrate to the western prairies, Where for labour still there’s room. Let the peasant and the cottar Quit the useless plough and spade — Built for them are costly mansions, Raised for them are rates in aid. To the workhouse let them gather, Or by theft attain the jail; Honesty has bread and water, Crime is fed on beef and ale. O the glorious consummation Of this truly Christian scheme, Such as never saint or prophet Witnessed in ecstatic dream! Wasted fields and crowded cities, Swarming streets and desert downs, All the light of life concentred In the focus of the towns! Yea, exult, ye foes of England! In the downfall of the race That of yore, in fiery combat, Met your fathers face to face : For the pride of lusty manhood, And the giant Saxon frame, Never more shall be embattled In the coming fields of fame; Shrunken sinews, sallow faces, Twisted limbs and factory sears — These shall mark your next opponents In the European wars. Not such yeomen as with Alfred Won their freedom long a go — Such as on the plain of Cree Triumphed o’er a worthy foe — Such as drove invasion backward, Have their homes in Britain now! This at least our sons may utter, Blushing for their fathers’ shame — Brain me with a billy-roller, If I longer play this game, Hither for the crimp of Tamworth, Or his first lieutenant, Gra ham! No, by Jove! I will not suffer Degradation of the kind — What care I for Johnny Russell, With his hungry host be hind? Let them blunder on insanely, Digging holes within the sand, Thinking, like the stupid ostrich, To escape the hunter’s hand. Let them shirk the facts before them, Comforting themselves the while, That their Economic asses Can the public ear be guile. Lord! to hear the blockheads braying. Spite of proof before their eyes — “ I assure the house,” quoth Wilson, : “ Wheat must very shortly rise. It was so-and-so at Dantzic More than twenty years a go; Therefore wait a little longer— ’Twill be up again, I know.” Jolly Villiers, on the other and, with exultation vows, More than one-and-ninety millions Have been plundered from the ploughs; And he hopes before another Year shall run its destined course, To congratulate the public That affairs are worse and worse. I, for one, am sick and weary Of these everlasting prigs; Quite disgusted with the shuffling Of the miserable Whigs; With their impudent averments, And their flagrant thimble rigs! Hark, the midnight chimes! I fancy The palaver’s nearly over : For to-night let Johnny Russell to And his colleagues rest in clover. But upon the next occasion, When there’s talk about a tax, Whether it shall weigh on foreign Or on native British backs, Master Tufnell must excuse me, If I seek another lobby Than the one that’s now frequented By my former chief, Sir Bobby!
Rob Shankland was a light and limber blade — Smart in his dress—a tailor to his trade; To him Dame Nature, in a merry hour, Gave all the smart endowments in her power — Nor grudg’d the number of her various gifts, But graced him, like a cat, with many shifts : Rob was a Wit, as every neighbour knew — Yet Rob could argue long, and reason too. On Fiddle he performed with wondrous skill, And on the Flute he fingered better still; At Quoits, or Putting, he could brag the place, And, if he ran, he always won the race. Rob loved a wedding—dearly loved a fair, Where’er the fun was hatching, Rob was there. His voice was queer—his very look was droll; Of every social club Rob was the soul — Could ape a neighbour’s manner, voice or gait; Grind razors on the outside of a plate † With solemn, wrinkled, sacerdotal face, Pour forth the fervour of a “ Highland grace;” Or rave you Daggerwood in “ cloud-capt towers;” — So vast the compass of his social powers. Not deeply read in books or Roman lore, Rob learned the Rudiments, but learned no more — Had figured far through Hutton’s various rules, Read all Collections that are read in schools. Letters of every kind he could in dite, And if the Lover could not, he could write, Of slighted faith the anger due ex press — For sweet-heart glow with sweet-heart tender ness; Old Aunty Kate he could assist to tell How she her late-come groceries should sell, To profit by the bargain. Could there be A youth more useful, more alert than he? But customers were pressing—could not stay — They had been long put off from day to day; They liked his wit—his talents they ad mired : But these were not the qualities re quired. Rob promised—broke his word—again trans gressed — Essayed to rest at home, but could not rest — Became impatient of restraint, and swore He’d fairly kick the custom to the door — Absconded—listed—crossed the Stygian shore.
Peruvian miner, slave, and beast at once, In everlasting midnight takes his stance; The galley-convict, fastened to the oar, Of ease and happiness can taste no more — The hapless victim of the fickle fair Nor quiet hope, nor liberty must share; Even Tyranny will sleep upon a throne, And Prisoners of state forget to groan; “ Dissenting Minister,” in village placed, By prejudice opposed, by whim ca ressed, Enslaved alike by every friend or foe — This is the highest pitch of human woe. A day was named—the choice behoved to fall On, “ Jedediah,” now a second Paul; Of meek humility he plays the part In all the mimicry of studied art; Consults his hearers, smiles, and looks a broad, Has revelations, wrestles with his God — The lingering spirit may not quit the clay, It may not part, till Jedediah pray. From house to house he travels full of grace, Eats and converses, prays in every place. But when on Sabbath hour he lifts his hands, Comes softly down his chin and flowing bands — His eyes up-fixed on Heaven’s topmost tower, In all the steady stretch of mystic glour — His voice attuned to fervour’s solemn whine, The pitch inhuman, but the sugh di vine, A crowd so vast his ministrations draw, They seek accommodation on the “ Law.” Around his tent they squat—they groan—they sleep — Awaked at intervals, they sigh, they weep; And as he coughs,* with soul alarming groan, Again they start, again they sigh, they moan! Such fervent transports may not, cannot last, This weeping—sighing—groaning—over past — As snow in summer melts—they melt as fast. Now Jedediah—waked to misery, finds The galling littleness of little minds — The Elder’s sage advice, “ ’tis duty calls, “ And he must speak on whom the duty falls, “ He is full sorry—sore alarmed of late, “ To count the scanty offering from the plate, “ Should this continue—those who preach may feel, “ The empty seats—in many a scanty meal!” Amidst the vulgar, doomed his life to lead, From starving villagers to reave his bread; Their eyes to brave, through every morning walk, And live from eve to eve—the village talk — His doctrines moulded to the varying taste; In vain attempts to please, his health to waste; To float—the barge—by every wind be set — Such is unhappy Jedediah ’s fate!—
No, no! ’tis false! it cannot be! When saw a mortal eye Two suns within the firmament, Two glories in the sky? Nay, Walmsley, nay! thy generous heart Hath all too wide a room : We’ll not believe it, e’en on oath— There’s but one Joseph Hume! Unsay the word so rashly said; From hasty praise for bear! Who bring a foreign Pompey here Our Cæsar’s fame to share? The buzzard he is lord above, And Hume is lord be low, So leave him peerless on his perch, Our solitary Joe! He may be known, that bearded wight, In lands beyond the foam; He may have fought the fiery fight ’Gainst taxes raised at home. And hate of kings, and scorn of peers, May rankle in his soul; But surely never hath he reached “ The tottle of the whole.” Yes, he may tell of doughty deeds, Of battles lost and won, Of Austrian imposts bravely spurned! By each reforming Hun. But dare he say that he hath borne The jeers of friend and foe, Yet still prosed on for thirty years Like our transcendent Joe? Or hath he stood alone in arms Against the guileful Greek, Demanding back his purchase-coin With oath, and howl, and shriek? Deemed they to hold with vulgar bonds That lion in the net? One sweep of his tremendous paw Could cancel all their debt. How could we tell our Spartan wives That, in this sacred room, We dared, with impious throats, proclaim A rival to the Hume? Our children, in their hour of need, Might style us England’s foes, If other chief we owned than one, The member for Mont rose. O soft and sweet are Cobden’s tones As blackbird’s in the brake; And Oldham Fox and Quaker Bright A merry music make; And Thompson’s voice is clear and strong, And Kershaw’s mild and low. And nightingales would hush their trill To list M’Gregor’s flow; But Orpheus’ self, in mute de spair Might drop his magic reed When Hume vouchsafes, in dulcet strains, The people’s cause to plead. All other sounds of earth and air Are mute and lost the while; The rasping of a thousand saws, The screeching of the file. With him we’ll live, with him we’ll die, Our lord, our light, our own; We’ll keep all foemen from his face, All rivals from his throne. Though Tory prigs, and selfish Whigs, His onward course as sail. Here stand a hundred delegates, All joints of Joseph’s tail. Ho, there! remove that hairy Hun With beard as white as snow; We need no rank reformers here To cope with honest Joe. Not Muntz, with all his bristly pride, From him our hearts can wean : We know his ancient battle-cry— “ Shave close, my friends, and clean!”
The Tailor’s wife! avaunt, ye peaceful few; Her voice will pierce your very temples through; The Tailor’s wife! these words, of direful sound, Spread consternation through the village round — Awake the drum, arouse the trumpet’s blare, And shake with dissonance the startled air. Let asses bray—attack the swelling gong, And pour a tempest through my maddened song! The Tailor’s wife, in wild tornado, comes! Mute are the trumpets, silent are the drums; On zephyr wings the eastern music floats, And asses bray through more melodious throats. She comes! she treads! in all her furious sway; The dogs run backwards to accede her way; The solid earth, beneath her sounding feet, With inward palpitation seems to beat. Now, woe to thee, O less than mortal wight! Scarce ninth-part “ Man,” in such a woeful plight, What can avail thee now, thy wonted jeers, That cut with all the keenness of thy shears — Thy mirth-provoking, rage-allaying wit?— These qualities, alas! avail thee not. In vain thy throne of more than Turkish pride, The sceptre Lap-board resting at thy side; Thy primate Goose, by public zeal in spired, Against thine enemies to fury fired; Thy needle Ministers, of sharpest steel, That stitch the garments of the common weal; Thy life-guard Prentices, that speak thy power — Avail thee nothing in this trying hour. The storm drives onward with increasing force, Nor may’st thou brook its brunt, nor stem its course; Down on thy knees, ask pardon, Snip, and tell The sovereign sway of all-subduing “ Bell;” And to each mated lord a lesson give, How he in harmony and peace may live, Avert the tear of injured pride, and prove The unresisting tool of wedded love. Oh, dared the poet half his mind ex plain, What arts are used a husband to re tain In bondage. With what woe and wail, What fume, fret, sulk, our fortress they as sail, How they will scold—and should we silence keep, For very rage, how they will sob and weep — Misfortunes father on our heads, and see With after-thought, unto futuri ty; Instruct us of our danger when ’tis o’er, Affirm they prophesied it all be fore; For God knows what, how they will threap and thraw, Forget the subject, false conclusions draw; Then lord it o’er us, with a mighty air, And scarcely grant us, in our home, a chair. Oh, dared he thus the wedded dames to brave, What power could cover, what repentance save; And He who penned the treasonable lay, Might ne’er forget it till his dying day!
By copious draughts, and jarring disputes fired, From whisky-shop the reeling Smith re tired; His wife, pre-doomed to feal a Tyrant’s hand, And dread the thunder of his harsh com mand, With beating heart his tottering footsteps hears, Whilst broken curses murmur in her ears, Each quaking imp discerns th’ approaching woe, And feels, in every step, a coming blow. Oh shame to manhood—blot on nature’s plan, And only in thine outward form a Man! Shamed by the fiercest brute that roams the plain; The Tiger loves, and is beloved a gain; The fierce Hyena— fellest of the fell ”— In soft connubial amity will dwell. She shrinks at thy approach, whose broken heart In all thy varied fortunes bore a part; And even now, beneath this load of ill, That broken-hearted woman loves thee still — Clings to the arm that strikes her—bathes thy bed With tears for thee and for thy Infants shed. Could I with magic art thy crime pur sue, And visit on thy head the vengeance due, No vulture should be sent to tear thy heart, Nor shouldst thou need to pey Ixion’s part,— No Christian torture rack thy writhing frame, Nor hellish Imp pursue thee through the flame,— But, doomed to dree a long protracted life, I’d match thee fairly with the “ Tailor’s Wife!” Oh woman! injured, basely scoffed, and scorned, With all but immortality a dorned, Where’er thy destiny has fixed thy fate, Or in the cottage, or the hall of state, Thy proudest boast, than all thy charms more dear — Is “ Patience,” in the state we picture here.
The Sabbath sun has mounted in the east, But still the Villagers are sunk in rest. This is the day of rest the slumberer knows — A day of listless lounging and re pose; So, to begin the duties of the day, It best befits to sleep the morn a way. The second * bell has rung. His breakfast o’er, “ Sam” takes his Sunday station at the door — With idle comrade idler talk sus tains — Of king, or lord, or minister, com plains. Whilst many a puff-narcotic bears a long Some public grievance, or some private wrong, Ungartered stockings—buttonless ar ray — In tattered uniform—proclaim the day. Too late to dress, and far too late to shave, Soap, time, and trouble, Sam resolves to save. “ He care for Parson’s preaching!— he can look With more advantage on a Sunday book, With Willison or Boston, he may see The marrow-marked of true divini ty, E’en, standing where he stands, amidst his door- way, Obtain from Wellwood’s pen ‘ a glimpse of glo ry;’ Of holy Ambrose, read the Gospel page, Or, with his ‘ Devils,’ doubtful combat wage; With Bunyan’s ‘ Christian’ journey on his road, And reach at last the ‘ City of his God.’” Thus reasons he, whose Sabbath hours of prime Are lost in negligence, or spent in crime. Forth comes the Landlord of the village inn — His breath still loaded with his breakfast gin — On stoney settle thrown, the known re treat Of all the Sunday stragglers of the street, He sits, the centre of the gathering crowd, And swears his tale, and tells his jest a loud : “ God’s curse! I cares not, or for Laird or Leddy, I pays my rent, and always ‘ has the ready ’ When Gauger calls. It was but t’other day I paid a good two hundred pounds a way — These taxes are the devil—so come here, And we shall taste my Wife’s own bottle cheer.” Straight, in obedience to his kind desire, To Landlord’s glass these auditors retire; And, hence resolved such kindness to re pay, In sottish dissipation waste the day. Thus then are nursed, and nurtured into crimes, The lawless “ Ragamuffins of the Times †”— The Sergeant’s prey, who scours the crowded street, With which, to fill the Ranks, to man the Fleet; The houseless Vagrant, eager to ob tain, By stealth or force, by any method, gain; He who in banishment is doomed to pine, Or to the injured laws his life re sign; A Christian Sabbath, early spent in sin, Here all the sufferers’ miseries be gin. How sad the tale of sweet Eliza’s wrong — The woeful burden of my closing song, Her image on my heart I still re tain, And picture all her loveliness with pain.— A noted Laird of thirty acres good, Above the village rank, her Father stood; One only daughter shared a Parent’s love, The beauteous semblance of a Saint a bove; Full eighteen summers o’er her head had passed, And each had found her lovelier than the last, When William proferred, profligate and bold — With seeming truth his artful passion told, Demanded leisure all his tale to say, And fixed his visit for the “ Sabbath- day.” There needs no lengthened phrase to paint the woe Which from one little slip may often flow, An absent Father, and a ruined Child — A perjured Lover, and a Maniac wild — Distraction’s Gorgon dream, and poisonous cup — A Parent’s dying groan to sum it up!
All the mills were closed in Rochdale, Shut the heavy factory door; Old and young had leave to wander, There was work for them no more. In the long deserted chambers Idly stood tke luckless loom, Silent rose the ghastly chimney Guiltless of its former fume. Near a brook that leaped rejoicing, Freed once more from filthy dye, Dancing in the smokeless sunlight, Babbling as it wandered by — Walked a middle-aged Free-trader, Forwards, backwards, like a crab : And his brow was clothed with sorrow, And his nether-man with drab. Chewing cud of bitter fancies, Dreaming of the by-gone time, Sauntered there the downcast Quaker Till he heard the curfew chime. Then a hollow laugh escaped him : “ Let the fellows have their will — With a dwindling crop of cotton, They may ask a Five-hours Bill! “ Side by side I’ve stood with Cobden, Roared with him for many a year, And our only theme was cheapness, And we swore that bread was dear; And we made a proclamation Touching larger pots of beer, Till the people hoarsely answered With a wild approving cheer. “ Did we not denounce the landlords As a ravening locust crew? Did we not revile the yeomen, And the rough-shod peasants too? Clodpoles, louts, and beasts of burden, Asses, dolts, and senseless swine — These were our familiar phrases In the days of auld-lang syne. “ And at length we gained the battle : Oh, how proudly did I feel, When the praise was all accorded To my brother chief by Peel! But I did not feel so proudly At the settling of the fee — Cobden got some sixty thousand— Not a stiver came to me! “ Well, they might have halved the money— Yet I know not—and who cares? After all, the free disposal Of the gather’d fund was theirs : And it is some consolation In this posture of af fairs, To reflect that twas invested In the shape of railway shares! “ O, away, ye pangs of en vy! Wherefore dwell on such a theme, Since a second grand subscription Is, I know, a baseless dream? Haunt me not with flimsy fancies— Soul, that should be great and free! Yet—they gave him sixty thousand, Not a pennypiece to me! “ But I threw my spirit forwards, As an eagle cleaves the sky, Glaring at the far horizon With a clear unflinching eye. Visions of transcendent brightness Rose before my fancy still, And the comely earth seemed girdled With a zone from Rochdale Mill. “ And I saw the ports all opened, Every harbour free from toll : Countless myriads craving shirtings From the Indies to the pole. Lapland’s hordes inspecting cotton, With a spermaceti smile, And Timbuctoo’s tribes demanding Bright’s ‘domestics’ by the mile! “ O the bliss, the joy Elysian! O the glory! O the gain! Never, sure, did such a vision Burst upon the poet’s brain! Angel voices were proclaiming That the course of trade was free, And the merchants of the Indies Bowed their stately heads to me! “ Out, alas! my calculation Was, I know, too quickly made; Even sunlight casts a shadow, There is gloom in briskest trade. I forgot one little item— Though the fact of course I knew, For I never had considered Where it was that cotton grew. “ Wherefore in this northern valley, Where the ploughshare tears the sod, Spring not up spontaneous bushes Laden with the precious pod? What an Eden were this island, If beside the chimney- stalk Raw material might be gathered, Freely of an evening walk! “ But alas, we cannot do it. And the Yankee—fiends con found him!— Grins upon us, o’er the ocean, With his bursting groves a round him. And these good-for-nothing Negroes Are so very slow at hoeing, That their last supply of cotton Will not keep our mills a- going “ Also, spite of Cobden’s speeches Made in every foreign land, Which, ’tis true, the beastly natives Did not wholly under stand, Hostile tariffs still are rising, Duties laid on twist and twine; And the wild pragmatic Germans Hail with shouts their Zollve rein. “ They, like madmen, seem to fancy That a nation, to be great, Should as surely shield the workman As the highest in the state : And they’d rather raise their taxes From the fruits of foreign labour, Than permit, as nature dictates, Each man to devour his neighbour. “ So my golden dreams have vanished, All my hopes of gain are lost; Fresh accounts of glutted markets Come with each successive post. And I hear the clodpoles mutter As they pass me in the street, That they can’t afford to purchase, At the present rate of wheat. “ Well, I care not—tis no matter! My machines won’t eat me up; And the people on the poor-rates Have my perfect leave to sup. Let the land provide subsistence For the children of the soil, I am forced to feed my engines With a daily cruise of oil. “ Ha! a bright idea strikes me! ’Tis the very thing, huzza! I have somewhere heard that cotton May be cultured in Bombay. Zooks! it is a splendid notion! Dicky Cobden is an ass. Wherefore should we pay the Yankees Whilst Great Britain holds Ma dras? “ Cotton would again be cultured If, with a benignant hand, Fair protection were afforded To the tillers of the land. ’Tis a sin and shame, we know not Where our real riches lie; Yes! they shall have just protection, Else I’ll know the reason why. “ Surely some obscene oppression, Weighs the natives’ labour down, Or their energies are palsied By a tyrant master’s frown. To my heart the blood is gushing— Righteous tears bedew my cheek — Parliament shall know their burdens, Ere I’m older by a week! “ Ha! those fine devoted fellows! ’Twere a black and burning shame, If we let the Yankees swamp them In their mean exclusive game. I have always held the doctrine, Since my public life be gun, That it was our bounden duty To take care of Number One. “ What!— allow the faithful Indian To be crushed : in cotton- growing? O forbid it, truthful Wilson! O refuse it, saintly Owen! Have their claims been disregarded? There is life within a mussel; And I’ve got a kind of bridle On the neck of Johnny Russell. “ I shall move a special motion, Touching this o’erlooked af fair : El-Dorado would be nothing : To the wealth that waits us there. Let us get a fair protection For our native Indian niggers, And, I think, the Rochdale mill-book Would display some startling figures! “ Ha! Ive got another notion! Things are rather dull at home, And I feel no fixed objection, In my country’s cause to roam. It is needful that some cautious Hand should undertake the task, Hum—there must be a commission— Well—I’ve only got to ask. “ They’ll be rather glad to spare me, In thet prveant precious fix : Charley Wood is somewhat shakey With his recent dodge on bricks. Palmerston’s in hottest water, What with France, and what with Greece; As for little Juggling Johnny He’ll pay anything for peace. “ Faith, I’ll do it! were it only As a most conclusive thick, And a hint unto our fellows That I’m quite as good as Dick. Hang him! since he’s made orations, In a sort of mongrel French, One would think he’s almost equal To Lord Campbell on the bench. “ Time it is our course were severed; Tm for broad distinctions now. Since my mills are fairly stoppaged, At another shrine I bow, Send me only out to India On this patriotic scheme, And I’ll show them how protection Is a fact, and not a dream.”
Once more, through God’s high will and grace, Of Hours that each its task ful fils, Heart-healing Spring resumes its place;— The valley throngs and scales the hills. In vain. From earth’s deep heart o’er charged, The exulting life runs o’er in flowers;— The slave unfed is unen larged : In darkness sleep a nation’s powers. Who knows not Spring? Who doubts when blows Her breath, that Spring is come in deed? The swallow doubts not; nor the rose That stirs, but wakes not; nor the weed. I feel her near, but see her not, For those with pain-uplifted eyes Fall back repulsed; and vapors blot The vision of the earth and skies. I see her not; I feel her near, As, charioted in mildest airs, She sails through yon empyreal sphere, And in her arms and bosom bears The urn of flowers and lustral dews, Whose sacred balm, o’er all things shed, Revives the weak, the old re news, And crowns with votive wreaths the dead. Once more the cuckoo’s call I hear, I know, in many a glen pro found, The earliest violets of the year Rise up like water from the ground. The thorn I know once more is white; And, far down many a forest dale, The anemones in dubious light Are trembling like a bridal veil. By streams released that singing flow From craggy shelf through sylvan glades, The pale narcissus, well I know, Smiles hour by hour on greener shades. The honeyed cowslip tufts once more The golden slopes;— with gradual ray The primrose stars’ the rock, and o’er The wood-path strews its milky way. From ruined huts and holes come forth Old men, and look upon the sky! The Power Divine is on the earth;— Give thanks to God before ye die! And ye, O children worn and weak, Who care no more with flowers to play, Lean on the grass your cold, thin cheek, And those slight hands, and whispering say, “ Stern Mother of a race un blest — In promise kindly, cold in deed; Take back, O Harth, into thy breast, The children whom thou wilt not feed.”
Then die, thou Year—thy work is done : The work ill done is done at last. Far off, beyond that sinking sun, Which sets in blood, I hear the blast That sings thy dirge, and says— “ A scend, And answer make amid thy peers, (Since all things here must have an end,) Thou latest of the famine years!” I join that voice. No joy have I In all thy purple and thy gold, Nor in the nine-fold harmo ny From forest on to forest rolled : Nor in that stormy western fire, Which burns on ocean’s gloomy bed, And hurls, as from a funeral pyre, A glare that strikes the mountain’s head; And writes on low-hung clouds its lines Of cyphered flame, with hurrying hand; And flings amid the topmost pines That crown the steep, a burning brand. Make answer, Year, for all thy dead, Who found not rest in hallowed earth, The widowed wife, the father fled, The babe age-stricken from his birth. Make answer, Year, for virtue lost; For Faith, that vanquished fraud and force, Now waning like a noontide ghost; Affections poisoned at their source : The labourer spurned his lying spade; The yeoman spurned his useless plough; The pauper spurned the unwholesome aid, Obtruded once, exhausted now. The weaver wove till all was dark, And, long ere morning, bent and bowed Above his work with fingers stark; And made, nor knew he made, a shroud. The roof-trees fall of hut and hall, I hear them fall, and falling cry — “ One fate for each, One fate for all; So wills the Law that willed a lie.” Dread power of Man! what spread the waste In circles, hour by hour more wide, And would not let the past be past!— The Law that promised much, and lied. Dread power of God! whom mortal years Nor touch, nor tempt; who sitt’st su blime In night of night,—O bid thy spheres Resound at last a funeral chime. Call up, at last, the afflicted Race Whom Man not God abolished. Sore, For centuries, their strife : the place That knew them once shall know no more.
Fall, Snow, and cease not! Flake by flake The decent winding-sheet com pose : Thy task is just and pious; make An end of blasphemies and woes. Fall flake by flake : by thee a lone, Last friend, the sleeping draught is given : Kind nurse, by thee the couch is strewn, The couch whose covering is from heaven. Descend and clasp the mountain’s crest; Possess wide plain and valley deep :— This night, in thy maternal breast Forsaken myriads die in sleep. Lo! from the starry Temple gates Death, rides, and bears the flag of peace : The combatants he sepa rates; He bids the wrath of ages cease. Descend, benignant Power! But O, Ye torrents, shake no’ more the vale; Dark streams, in silence seaward flow; Thou rising storm, remit thy wail. Shake not, to-night, the cliffs of Moher, Or Brandon’s base, rough sea! Thou Isle, The Rite proceeds :— from shore to shore Hold in thy gathered breath the while. Fall, snow! in stillness fall, like dew On temple roof, and cedar’s fan; And mould thyself on pine and yew, And on the awful face of man. Without a sound, without a stir, In streets and wolds, on rock and mound, O omnipresent comfor ter, By thee, this night, the lost are found. On quaking moor, and mountain moss, With eyes upstaring at the sky, And arms extended like a cross, The long-expectant sufferers lie. Bend o’er them, white-robed Aco lyte! Put forth thine hand from cloud and mist, And minister the last sad rite, Where altar there is none, nor priest. Touch thou the gates of soul and sense : Touch darkening eyes and dying ears; Touch stiffening hand and feet, and thence Remove the trace of sin and tears. And ere thou seal those filmed eyes, Into God’s urn thy fingers dip, And lay, ’mid eucharistic sighs, The sacred wafer on the lip. This night the Absolver issues forth : This night the Eternal Victim bleeds — O winds and woods—O heaven and earth! Be still this night. The Rite pro ceeds.
Ay! hew them down on every side, The brave old English trees; Why should we seek a shelter now From native plants like these? Why to the broad and aged elm A longer respite give Than to the myriad men at home Who know not how to live? Yes! hew the wood and rear the pile, Build up your foreign hive! Let British industry be crushed And alien labour thrive. Complete the work so well begun, The task so wondrous wise; Nor fear to lack, ere all be done, A plenteous sacri fice! The sacrifice of tears and woe, And pain, and want, and toil, From those who labour at the loom, Or turn the British soil. The sacrifice of wasted hearts At Mammon’s filthy shrine — The sacrifice of homeless men Who die, and make no sign! Why was it that our fathers fought So valiantly and long, Why went our levied armies forth To battle with the strong? Why rode our navies east and west, The terror of the sea, If not to keep this land of ours As great as it was free. To keep it free from foreign foot, And free from foreign spoil; To shield the hardy peasant’s hut, To guard the workman’s toil. To give and take as brethren should With kind and open hand, And rear the brave old English race Secure on English land. Send out your ships—you need them all, Though not for cotton bales. Go—drive the clansmen from the hills, The peasant from the dales, And send your bravest and your best In other lands to dwell; Since naught but foreign work is prized In that they loved too well. And build your stately temple up, Spare neither stone nor tree, And heap it full of costly things For starving men to see. Throw wide your gates to all the world, Yea, throw them wide to all — Be sure the greedy foreigners Will answer to your call! We know them well—the bearded Russ, The German, and the Gaul. They seek your gold—be bountiful, And give them all they need : What though for every glittering coin Some British heart must bleed? Another rule than that of old The modern statesman knows — He taxes none but Englishmen, And favours but their foes. O wise and good! O good as wise! For this great deed, be sure Hereafter on your head shall light The blessings of the poor. And that same monument you rear Shall stand in after days, The fittest trophy of your worth : Your honour, and your praise. Down with the trees! for long enough They’ve stood in grandeur there; The axe is laid unto the root— Smite on, and do not spare. For foreign shows our English wood Will furnish rafters rare. Ay—roof them in! ’tis stranger’s work— Let English homes go bare!
The Daisy blossoms on the rocks, Amid the purple heath; It blossoms on the river’s banks, That thrids the glens be neath; The eagle, at his pride of place, Beholds it by his nest; And, in the mead it cushions soft The lark’s descending breast. Before the cuckoo, earliest spring Its silver circlet knows, When greening buds begin to swell, And zephyr melts the snows; And, when December’s breezes howl Along the moorlands bare, And only blooms the Christmas rose, The Daisy still is there! Samaritan of flowers! to it All races are a like, The Sqitzer on his glacier height,— The Dutchman by his dyke,— The seal-skin vested Esquimaux, Begirt with icy seas,— And, underneath his burning noon, The parasol’d Chi nese. The emigrant on distant shore, Mid scenes and faces strange, Beholds it flowering in the sward, Where’er his footsteps range; And when his yearning, home-sick heart Would bow to its de spair, It reads his eye a lesson sage— That God is every where! Stars are the Daisies that begem The blue fields of the sky, Beheld by all, and everywhere, Bright prototypes on high :— Bloom on, then, unpretending flowers! And to the waverer be An emblem of St. Paul’s content, St. Steven’s constan cy.
Rose of the desert! thou art to me An emblem of stainless puri ty,— Of those who, keeping their garments white, Walk on through life with steps a right. Thy fragrance breathes of the fields a bove, Whose soil and air are faith and love; And where, by the murmur of silver springs, The Cherubim fold their snow-white wings;— Where those who were severed re-meet in joy, Which death can never more de stroy; Where scenes without, and where souls wi thin, Are blanched from taint and touch of sin;— Where speech is music, and breath is balm; And broods an everlasting calm; And flowers wither not, as in worlds like this; And hope is swallowed in perfect bliss;— Where all is peaceful, for all is pure; And all is lovely; and all en dure; And day is endless, and ever bright; And no more sea is, and no more night;— Where round the throne, in hues like thine, The raiments of the ransom’d shine; And o’er each brow a halo glows Of glory, like the pure White Rose!
Aday of strife hath fled; The azure mantle of Twilight falls; The field is strewed with dead; But the cross is planted on Salem’s walls! In vain the Sultan cried, ’Mid the boiling fight, for the prophet’s aid; And on, with swords al lied, Rushed the hosts of the Christian undis mayed! He laid him down to die, At the foot of an aloes, a wounded knight, Beneath the chilly sky, And the fading traces of western light :— With desolating force, The night-wind moaned ’mid the forest gloom; And, in its sweeping course, Uplifted the depth of his raven plume. In garb of green, a page, Alone, o’er his dying master hung, His anguish to assu age, And cool the thirst of his burning tongue; The frequent falling tear He dashed in vain from his eyes of blue; As the knight, he loved so dear, His painful breathing aye shorter drew! Said the knight, “ When war is done, And to Europe the vessels retrace the sea, Then bear this pledge to one — The only one that may weep for me! Oh! tell, that, as I sighed, This broken pledge to my heart was pressed; Oh! tell, that ere I died, I hung o’er her magic name, and blessed!” “ Pardon,” exclaimed the page — “ If love will pardon to love al low; Ella of Hermi tage Forsook her kin, to be with thee now!— He turns his dying eyes, Sir Harold, and gazes on that sweet face;— To speak in vain he tries, Then sank like lead in a last em brace! She pressed her cheek to his, To his as cold as the marble stone; And with one long, long kiss, Her heart had broke, and her spirit was flown! In the shade of the aloes tree, In death united, the lovers lay; And many a tear fell free, O’er their graves, at the dawn of day; And lovely o’er the tomb, Where, side by side, these lovers re pose, Commingling their per fume, A rose of England and Sharon grows; And, on the boughs a bove, When fades in the west the parting light, The dirge of faithful love A bulbul hymns to the ear of Night.
The Sweet Briar flowering, With boughs em bowering, Beside the willow-tufted stream, In its soft, red bloom, And its wild per fume, Brings back the past like a sunny dream! Methinks, in childhood, Beside the wildwood I lie, and listen the blackbird’s song, Mid the evening calm, As the Sweet Briar’s balm On the gentle west wind breathes a long — To speak of meadows, And palm-tree shadows, And bee-hive cones, and a thymy hill, And greenwood mazes, And greensward daisies, And a foamy stream, and a clacking mill. Still the heart re joices, At the happy voices Of children, singing amid their play : While swallows twittering, And waters glittering, Make earth an Eden at close of day. In sequestered places, Departed faces, Return and smile as of yore they smiled; When, with trifles blest, Each buoyant breast Held the trusting heart of a little child. The future never Again can ever The perished gifts of the past re store, Nor, to thee or me, Can the wild flowers be What the Briar was then—oh never more!
The Wall-flower—the Wall- flower, How beautiful it blooms! It gleams above the ruined tower, Like sunlight over tombs; It sheds a halo of re pose Around the wrecks of time. To beauty give the flaunting rose, The Wall-flower is su blime. Flower of the solitary place! Gray ruin’s golden crown, That lendest melancholy grace To haunts of old re nown; Thou mantlest o’er the battle ment, By strife or storm de cayed; And fillest up each envious rent Time’s canker-tooth hath made. Thy roots outspread the ramparts o’er, Where, in war’s stormy day, Perey or Douglass ranged of yore Their ranks in grim ar ray; The clangour of the field is fled, The beacon on the hill No more through midnight blazes red, But thou art blooming still! Whither hath fled the choral band That filled the Abbey’s nave? Yon dark sepulchral yew-trees stand O’er many a level grave. Tn the belfry’s crevices, the dove Her young brood nurseth well, While thou, lone flower! dost shed a bove A sweet decaying smell. In the season of the tulip- cup When blossoms clothe the trees, How sweet to throw the lattice up, And scent thee on the breeze; The butterfly is then a broad, The bee is on the wing, And on the hawthorn by the road The linnets sit and sing. Sweet Wall-flower—sweet Wall- flower! Thou conjurest up to me, Full many a soft and sunny hour Of boyhood’s thoughtless glee; When joy from out the daisies grew, In woodland pastures green, And summer skies were far more blue, Than since they e’er have been. Now autumn’s pensive voice is heard Amid the yellow bowers, The robin is the regal bird, And thou the queen of flowers! He sings on the laburnum trees, Amid the twilight dim, And Araby ne’er gave the breeze Such scents, as thou to him. Rich is the pink, the lily gay, The rose is summer’s guest; Bland are thy charms when these de cay, Of flowers—first, last, and best! There may be gaudier on the bower, And statelier on the tree, But Wall-flower—loved Wall- flower, Thou art the flower for me!
The night was dark, the thunder rolled, In torrents the rain was pouring; The lightning flash’d—’twas to un fold The breast of the ocean roaring :— Then, from the tower, gazed Ade line On the tempest’s wild com motion, And dim blue lights were seen to shine Afar on the foaming ocean! Alas! she sighed, that one so dear, Should toss on the faithless billow, While thousands, void of doubt and fear, Repose on the downy pillow; Hark!— ’tis the distant signal gun And lo! as the lightning flashes, The crowds on yonder deck that run, As the sinking vessel crashes! No more she saw—no more she heard, For darkness begirt the ocean, Save the dismal wail of frighted bird, Or the yeasty waves’ com motion, Till morning woke; and, on the beach, Did Adeline’s eyes dis cover, Beneath her tower, within her reach, The pale, pale face of her lover! Hark! from her lattice to the breeze, How mournfully sweet she is singing! Now gazing wistful o’er the seas, And ever her white hands wringing : From festal bower, since that dread hour, Hath Adeline’s smile de parted, And thus she sighs, at evening hour, The song of the broken- hearted! She was a star of beauty rare, O’er the brow of a twilight mountain; A flower that spreads its bosom fair, By the side of a vernal fountain : There came a cloud, and veiled the star, From earth its light is banished; There rose a flood, and, in the jar Of waters the young flower vanished!
When Freedom first appeared be neath, Right simple was the garb she wore, Her brows were circled with a wreath : Such as the Grecian victors bore : Her vesture all of spotless white, Her aspect stately and se rene; And so she moved in all men’s sight As lovely as a Maiden Queen. And queenlike, long she ruled the throng, As ancient records truly tell; Their strength she took not from the strong, But taught them how to use it well. Her presence graced the peasant’s floor As freely as the noble’s hall; And the humbler was the door, he still more welcome was her call. But simple manners rarely range Beyond the simpler ages’ ken, And e’en the Virtues sometimes change Their vesture and their looks, like men. Pride, noble once, grows close and vain, And Honour stoops to vulgar things, And old Obedience slacks the rein, And murmurs at the rule of kings. So Freedom, like her sisters too, Has felt the impulse of the time, Has changed her garments’ blameless hue, And donn’d the colours dear to crime. First in a Phrygian cap she stalked, And bore within her grasp the sphere; And ever, when abroad she walk’d, Men knew Revenge was following near. She moves again—The death-drums roll, The frantic mobs their chorus raise, The thunder of the Carma gnole — The war-chant of the Marseil laise! Red run the streets with blameless blood — The guillotine comes clanking down — And Freedom, in her drunken mood, Can witness all without a frown. Times change again; and Freedom now, Though scarcely yet less wild and frantic, Appears, before men’s eyes be low, In guises more intensely antic. No single kind of garb she wears, As o’er the earth she goes cru sading; But shifts her habit and her airs Like Joe Grimaldi masque rading. Through Paris you may see her tread, The cynosure of all be holders; A bonnet rouge upon her head, A ragged blouse upon her shoulders, More decent now than once she was, Though equally opposed to riches, She still upholds the good old cause, Yet condescends to wear the breeches. The Huns behold her as of yore, With grisly beard and monstrous swagger, The swart Italian bows be fore The Goddess with the mask and dagger. The German, as his patriot thirst With beer Bavarian he assu ages, Surveys her image, as at first ’Twas pictured in the Middle Ages. Her glorious form appears to him In all its pristine pomp and glitter, Equipped complete from head to heel, In semblance of a stalwart Ritter. With doublet slash, and fierce mou stache, And wrinkled boots of russet leather, And hose and belt, with hat of felt, Surmounted by a capon’s feather. Mysterious as Egyptian Sphinx, A perfect riddle—who can solve her? One while she comes with blazing links, The next, she’s armed with a revol ver. Across the main, whene’er the shoe Upon her radiant instep pinches, To-day, she’ll tar and feather you; To-morrow, and she merely Lynches. While thus abroad, in varied guise, We see the fair enchantress flitting, She deigns to greet in other wise Her latest satellites in Britain. Sometimes in black dissenting cloth, She figures like an under taker, And sometimes plunges, nothing loath, Into the garments of a Quaker. You’ll find her recommending pikes At many a crowded chartist meeting, Where gentlemen, like William Sykes, To exiled patriots vote their greeting. You’ll find her also with her friends, Engaged upon a bloody errand, When, stead of arguments, she sends Her bludgeoneers to silence Ferrand. You’ll find her too, at different dates, With men of peace on platforms many, Denouncing loans to foreign states. Whereof they could not raise a penny. In short, to end the cata logue, There’s hardly any son of Edom Who, in his character of rogue, Wont tell you that he worships Freedom. Yet hold—one sample more—the last, Ere of this theme we make a clearance; One little month is barely past Since London saw her grand ap pearance, In one of those enormous hats, Short leggings and peculiar jerkins, Which men assume who tend the vats Of Barelay and his partner Perkins. To that great factory of beer, Uneonseious wholly of his danger, Nor dreaming that a foe was near, There came, one day, an aged stranger. He was a soldier, and had fought In other lands ’gainst revo lution; And done his utmost—so he thought — To save his country’s consti tution. But saving states, like other things Is not in highest vogue at present; And those who stand by laws and kings Must look for recompense un pleasant. Fair Freedom brooding o’er the drink That makes the Briton strong and hearty, Began to sneeze upon the brink : As though she scented Bona parte. “ Ah, ha!” she cried, and cried a gain — At every word her voice grew louder — “ I smell an Austrian or a Dane, I smell a minion of gun powder! Some servant of a kingly race My independent nostril vexes! Say—shall he dare to show his face, Within this hall of triple X’s? “ ’Tis true—he is unarmed, a lone, A stranger, weak, and old, and hoary — Yet—on, my children! heave the stone! The legs the risk, the more the glory!” She ceased : and round the startled man, As round the Indian crowds the cayman, From vat, and vault, and desk, and van, Thronged brewer, maltster, clerk, and drayman. “ A precious lark!” the foremost cried; “ Come—twig him, Tom! come—pin him, Roger!” “ Who is it?” Then a sage re plied — “ He’s some infernal foreign sodger! He looks as how he’d scored ere now Some shoulders black and blue with lashes : So pitch him here into the beer — And, lads—we’ll pull off his mou staches!” They did—what brutal natures scorn, What savages would shrink to do — What none but basest cowards born, And the most abject and most few, Would offer to an old man’s head! O shame—O shame to English men! If the old spirit be not dead, ’Tis time it showed itself a gain! What! in this land which shelter gave To all, whatever their de gree, Or were they faint, or were they brave, Or were they slaves, or were they free — In this Asylum of the Earth — The ngblest name it ever won — Shall deeds like these pollute our hearth, Shall open shame like this be done? O most ignoble end of all Our boasted order and re nown! The robber in the tribune’s hall — The maltster in the Judge’s gown! The hospitable roof pro faned; Old age by ruffian force op prest, And English hands most vilely stained With blood of an unconscious guest! O Freedom! if thou wouldst main tain Thy empire on the British shore, Wash from thy robes that coward stain, Resume thy ancient garb once more, In virgin whiteness walk a broad, Maintain thy might from sea to sea, And, as the dearest gift of God, So men shall live and die for thee!
Wherever it may hap, however spring, Under whatever covert or dis guise, Even unto the judgment of the wise, Death is an awful, a terrific thing!— The tempests beat on time’s ungentle shore, Who would not rather risk his shuddering form Within a fragile bark, and brave the storm, Than sink beneath the waves, and be no more? Cold, cold and clammy, is the hand of death, And dark the mansion that it leads us to! Where, as the night-wind sighs, its baleful breath Disturbs the sombrous, melancholy yew But, is not death the omega of care? Aye, but we die, and go we know not where!
They’ve done their task, and every cask Is piled within the cell : They’ve heaped the wood in order good, And hid the powder well. And Guido Fawkes, who seldom talks, Remarked with cheerful glee — “ The moon is bright —they’ll fly by night! Now, sirs, let’s turn the key.” The wind with out blew cold and stout, As though it smelt of snow — But was’t the breeze that made the knees Of Tresham tremble so? With ready hand, at Guy’s com mand, He rolled the powder in; But what’s the cause that Tresham’s jaws Are chattering to the chin? Nor wine nor beer his heart can cheer, As in his chamber lone He walks the plank with heavy clank, And vents the frequent groan. “ Alack!” quoth he, “ that this should be — Alack, and well-a- day! I had the hope to bring the Pope, But in a different way. “ I’d risk a rope to bring the Pope By gradual means and slow; But Guido Fawkes, who seldom talks, Won’t let me manage so. That furious man has hatched a plan That must undo us all; He’d blow the Peers unto the spheres, And throne the Cardi nal! “ It’s time I took from other book Than his a saving leaf; I’ll do it— yes! I’ll e’en con fess, Like many a conscious thief. And on the whole, upon my soul, As Garnet used to teach, When human schemes are vain as dreams, ’Tis always best to preach! “ My mind’s made up!” He drained the cup, Then straightway sate him down, Divulged the whole, whitewashed his soul, And saved the British crown;— Disclosed the walks of Guido Fawkes, And swore, with pious aim, That from the first he thought him cursed, And still opined the same. Poor Guido died, and Tresham eyed His dangling corpse on high; Yet no one durst reflect at first On him who played the spy. Did any want a Prote stant, As stiff as a rat tan, To rail at home ’gainst priests at Rome — Why, Tresham was their man! ’Twas nothing though he’d kissed the Toe Abroad in various ways, Or managed rather that his wife’s father Should bear the blame and praise. Yet somehow men, who knew him when He wooed the Man of Sin, Wouldslightly sneer, and whisper near, Who rolled the powder in? If you, dear youth, are bent on truth n these degenerate days, And if you dare one hour to spare For aught but “ Roman Lays;” If, shunning rhymes, you read the Times, And search its columns through, You’ll find per haps that Tresham’s lapse Is matched by something new. Our champion John, with armour on, Is ready now to stand (For so we hope ) against the Pope, At least on English land. ’Gainst foreign rule and Roman bill He’ll fight and surely win. But—tarry yet —and don’t for get Who rolled the powder in.
“ Lady Morison rode by hill and dale, Till she came where sweet Nith flows From her mountains free, and there she clamb A hill through herds of roes. She heard the alarm horns sounding loud, The clang of full drawn bows, With the rush of mailed men, and saw The conflict in the close. She marked the battle’s gory press, Where, all disorder lie, The plumed helms waved to and fro, Like the heavings of the sea; And the startled fawns their soft hoofs weet In life’s blood flowing free. Kirkpatrick’s helm, Lord Maxwell’s plume, Her hurrying glance could know; And the gleaming of Lord Johnstone’s blade, That gives no second blow. She saw Lord Herries hurrying where The arrows drove like snow, And every time his broad blade fell, An armed head sink low. Again she gazed, and her golden lace She slacked for room to breathe; Lord Allan she saw, and helmed heads His courser’s feet be neath, And his brandished war-axe smiting low The objects of his wrath. ‘ I’d walk the world’s remotest nook, Where the ocean sweeps the land, And give the green yale of Glenae For a foot of rock and sand, To have thee in a wilderness, With bill, or bow, or brand; And seek from heaven to airt no blow, But leav’t to mortal hand.’ ‘ Have then thy wish, Lord Johnstone said, And count this river clear Earth’s farthest bourne—these ranks of men— A desart dark and drear, And that buglet’s note, thy raven’s croak, Our deadly strife to cheer;’ He said, and shook his battle blade, And spurred to full ca reer I have seen two whirlwinds meet, and sweep To heaven the golden grain; The levin flash i’ the clouds, ere fell The thunder drops of rain; Yet nought so fiery, dread, and fierce, As the meeting of those twain. I saw their agitated plumes— Their brands aloft in air — The gleam of their mail-coats carved with gold— Their mantles flaunting fair — Their rushing steeds, whose fiery eyes, In the conflict seemed to share; But ere I got another glance, Lord Jonstone’s saddle was bare. Small was his harm, though his bosom mail Did a braind’s deep dinting show; The burning steel, and the gleaming gold, Had caught a crimson hue; And the yellow broom, whereon they stood, Had a red blood drop or two. Ralph Jardine, from sweet Annan’s bank, Red o’er with anger grew; A burnished bow of the tempered steel, To the silver tips he drew, And the broad shaft kindled i’ the point, So fast and fierce it flew. Lord Johnstone stood like the stricken pine, Neath the tempest’s fiery sweep; And doomed like a ripened ear of corn, The sickles whet to reap, When through Lord Morison’s bosom mail With fierce and speed, The arrow sank, and the red blood sprang, And stained his bright steel weed; And down he sank on the gory sward, Like a tree of the green wood, That’s poisoned by the wind of Heaven, I’ the breaking o’ the bud. Sore toiled with the shock of war, and bathed In sweat, and smeared with blood, Lord Johnstone came from the battle-press, To taste Nith’s silver flood. His bow and his brand he has laid on the grass, And has bared his brow so brave; And his plumed helmit he held to his lips, Full of the clear cold wave. Lady Morison leapt from her palfrey light, All crimson was her hue; She bent her bow, and a cloth yard shaft, To her neck of snow she drew. Lord Johnstone thought of his lady’s arm, As he home rejoicing drew, When the chord clanged shrill, as the swallow’s song, And swift the arrow flew; And where the gold gorget clasped his neck, The bright point started through. Through a press of lances, crashing round And the clank of bill and brand, Lord Allan they bore, and they laid him down On the grass by sweet Nith sand; And there were gallant heads hung low, And many a mournful eye Came and dropt a tear, then flew to the press Of battle thickening nigh. They turned his face to the tread of men, That shook the river shore; His face was bright with a gloomy smile, For a moment and no more; On high he saw his raven grim, Through ranks resistless bore, And his galland squires of Glenae ride To the saddle laps in gore. Lady Morison came like a fair-haired page, With bow and broad sword bright; Scarce stained was her foot with the gory grass, For she came like the falcon’s flight; She put an arm round Lord Allan’s neck, Like a wreath of Criffel snow; “ O! I have a soft and a cunning hand, Can cure thee of thy woe.” With many a soft and a gentle touch, And prayer and word of cheer, She wooed the bitter shaft from the wound Then turned to Heaven her clear : And snowy brow—and to her there came A grave and a holy seer. As he came, the gory grass to his feet Has given a crimson dye; He knelt o’er good Lord Allan there, And his withered hands held high; And, silent and sad, he looked to heaven With a meek and steady eye. Beside him knelt that fair-haired Page, Whose heavenward hands did show All spotted with blood, as the lilies be Where has passed the wounded roe. The strife had sunk on Lord Morison’s sight When the gun forsook our clime; But ere it was given again to his glance, Death had held revel time I’ the ranks o’ war, and among the crests Of Annan’s pith and prime. The warlike Jardines all had fallen, And they lay on sweet Nith sands — As mowers asleep in the noon-day sun, With their broad blades in their hands. No warlike Bells knit their dark brows On Nithsdale’s charging bands; Nor Johnstones tried, on a crested helm, The temper of their brands. All these had sunk; but O what chiefs Had Nithsdale to be moan! Strong Glencairn dying waved his helm, And cheered his merrymen on. Lord Herries lay in a gory swathe Of men his blade had mown; And Lord Maxwell’s steed rode through the ranks, But his gallant rider was gone. And Roger Kirkpatrick, hot with fight, Leaned ’gainst an oak-tree hoar; Lord Johnstone’s pennon, he won with his brand, Was drenched in his bosom gore, His eye waxed dim, yet still his blade With a soldier’s grasp he bore. George Gordon’s steed runs fetlock deep Through gore; and, as he goes, His rider’s helmet-plume to the moon All pure and spotless shows. What stain can touch the noble plume That graces a Gordon’s brows? o the bravest hand that ever bore brand That warlike crest ne’er bows. And now the evening dew fell clear— The small birds sought their bowers — The hare licked the honey-dew from her foot, As she sported on banks of flowers. The mower had left his scythe i’ the swaird, And ta’en the lily lea; The shepherd had folded his lambs frae the fox And hameward whistled he. But the hands that had buckled their ar - mour on, When the morning sky was grey, Thought death had gotten a scrimpit darke Of the lee-long summer day, And foot to foot, and hand to hand, With brands and axes keen, Fought fierce, as if in the bloody fray New-yoked they had been. O sad and drear it was to hear, When the evening shades fell on, The bloody strife at the river side, And list the wounded moan. No mercy but what sharp glaives gave, On either side was sought; And deeds that would made heroes once, By simple hands were wrought. The flashing blood ’mong shivered spears, And cloven steel-weeds ran; And, plaunching through the lappering gore, Came rushing horse and man. For Lord Morison came again to the fight, And he whirled his faulchion then Like some martial spirit, returned to earth, To wither the might of men. The moon rode radiant now, and high The stars gleamed brightly round : Twas silence all, from Drumlanrig-dell To Durisdeer’s misty, bound. Save where the gentle river sent A sweet and a slender sound, I could hear the breathing of the dun deer Asleep on the dewy ground. ’Twas sweet to stand on Lillycross hill, And mark where the moon-beam brave Spilt its liquid silver on cliff and scaur, And touched Ae’s fairy wave, Or a golden top to Glenae groves, And Lord Morison’s turrets gave. There Fancy might delighted sit, And shape the fragrant air To forms of heaven, and people the groves With dames and damsels fair, Proud warlike shapes with eyes of fire, And hands to do and dare, And bid the spirits of earth and heaven To the revelry re pair. Lord Morison through the greenwood comes With his merry men all in a row; Their helms and brands in blood and dust Have dimmed their morning glow. Their hands they wave, that a banquet’s spread To the raven and the crow; All under the gleam of the round bright moon They sing as they merrily go. “ Allan Morison loves to rule the bands All ranked, armed, and steady; And loves to hear the shouts o’ weir, When spears are levelled ready; And measure a sword with a gallant knight By stream or woodland shady : But dearer than them a’ to his heart Is his sweet lovely lady.”
When the Emperor lay a-dying And an unresisted spell, Like a cloud across his eyelids From the land of darkness fell; “ Ave, Cæsar! ” Sounded o’er him like a knell — “ Ave, Cæsar! ” From the borderland of hell. For a vision rose upon him, In the dimness of the night, Dark at first, but clear and clearer Ere he died at morning light — Musing, musing, All too late, on Wrong and Right; ( “ Ave, Cæsar! ”) ’Twas a vision of af fright. Lo! the storied Coliseum, All a-blaze with green and red; Lo! the elephant and panther On the canopy over head; Sand is strewing Where the fighting-men have bled; ( “ Ave, Cæsar! ”) Men are dragging off the dead. Now a myriad ranks are silent, Watching what may next be fall; And another troop advances, Buckler’d Thracian, sinewy Gaul; * Them the trainer— Loud, uncaring, daring all — Unto Cæsar Brings, to greet him ere they fall. “ Ave, Cæsar Imperator!” Thus they used to shout of old; “ Dying men salute thee, Cæsar!” Thus the horrid greeting rolled In the vision, Round and round his bed of gold, ( “ Ave, Cæsar!” ) While his limbs were growing cold. And they waved their arms before him; Touched the purple one by one; Said, “ The dying greet thee, Cæsar, From another world be gun, (Ave, Cæsar!), Where our servitude is done; (Ave, Cæsar!) Emperor and slave are one.”
Ogallant Sir James is come out of the North, Through all that wild region his fame had gone forth; Yet, save the Vice-Chancellor, friend he had none; He came all unask’d, and he came all a lone. So daring in heart, and so dauntless in pith, There ne’er was Professor like President Smith. He staid not for frown, and he stopp’d not for groan; He put in his clamour where claim had none; But e’er he arriv’d at a Lecturer’s state, The tutors conspir’d—and the lectures came late. For a churchman, God wot! and a botanist too, Was to sit in the chair that Sir James had in view. In a rage, then, he stalk’d into College and Hall, Among Bedmakers, Bachelors, Doctors, and all; Then spoke Mr Marsh in a civilish way, (For some of the Tutors had little to say ), “ O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, Or to dine with the Fellows, or—what come ye for?” “ I long wish’d to lecture, my suit you de nied, I know you’d have lik’d them, if once you had tried; And now am I come with this Pamphlet of mine, To try a last measure—then leave you to pine; There are students in London more civil by far, That would gladly have welcom’d so brilliant a * star.” Sir James shew’d his Pamphlet, and Monk read it through; He gulp’d the hard bits, but he saw ’twould not do; He look’d down to laugh, and pretended to sigh, With a smile on his lip, and a sneer in his eye. Then down comes the rogue with an “ Answer” forth with — “ This is dealing hard measure!” says President Smith. So stately the tone, and so lovely the print, Even Freshmen conceiv’d there must something be in’t. While Socinians did fret, and Professors did clap, And Webb tore the tassel that deck’d his new cap; And Reviewers did whisper, “ ’T’were better by far To have match’d your brave Knight in some gooseberry war.” A hint such as this had just rung in his ear, When he reached the stage-coach,† and the coachman stood near; So light to the box that tight coachman he sprung, So snugly the reins o’er the dickey were flung — We are off! we are off! over bank and o’er hill, “ Your Pamphlet may follow,” cried James, “ if it will.” There is quizzing ’mong wags of the Trinity clan : King’s, Queen’s men, and Johnians, they all laugh that can; There is joking and smoking in Norwich ci tiè, But the lost Knight of Botany ne’er do we see, —So daring in heart, and so dauntless in pith : Was there e’er such a callant as President Smith?
He is gone from the counter; He is gone from the store-chest, Like his ‡ brother’s prime fount, ere Our need was the sorest. The fount, re-ap pearing, From the rain-drops shall borrow, But to us comes no cheering, To Litchfield no morrow! The hand of the suitor Takes the girl that is fairest, But the voice of the tutor Damns sweetmeats the rarest; Each gownsman will pop in The shop that is nearest, But they sent Jack a trotting, When ices were dearest. Firm foot on the causeway, Sage council wi thin-door, Tight hand at a nosegay,* How dark is thy windor! Like Gog† from the mountain, Like the scraps‡ on the river, Like the bubble on Ned’s§ fountain, Thou art gone, and for ever!
That was a day of bitter smart, The day that witnessed our fare well, When thou didst turn thee from a heart Thine own, and passing rich as well. I know too well my fault was great, Yet less than that thy memory kept, And I have borne its woeful weight, And tears of blood my sin hath wept. And years have passed, and now my star Conducts me near thy paths once more, I feel anew my bosom’s war, The joy and pain well known of yore. Methinks from thee I would not sever, And I would speak the word “ For give!” For, though the world would part us ever, Thou’rt loved and lovely, and I live. If to new aims I turned a way, Through joy and sorrow struggling free, Yet through life’s various hazard- play My thought would still come home to thee. I strove for pleasure, honour, truth, Prizes I won, and wear them now; Yet boon is none so rich as youth — The boon of youth to me wert thou.
It was the day that tuneful Pindar sent To banquet with Apollo;* I, who knew Him far from Thebes, sat pondering the in tent Of that strange vision, which, revealed to few, He trusted to my long-tried faithful breast Ere unto Argos he his steps ad dressed. For ten days gone (‘twas thus he told the tale ) There stood revealed his midnight couch be side A form majestic, lifting her black veil : At once he knew her for King Hades’ bride, Awful, yea terrible, yet fair to see, With eyes that lit the gloom, Persepho ne. Upon the moonlight splendour of those eyes His own, he said, fixed unaverted gaze, The while he heard these words : “ Thy melo dies Resound, O Pindarus! each high god’s praise; Each goddess’ might and beauty make they known Save one;— they leave unhymned my praise a lone. Why, Phœbus’ nursling! why, thus wrong my fame? Why weave no garland of fair song for me? Is this well done to slight my holy name? But yet thou, too, shalt praise Persepho ne, Not here, near waters bright by Dircé fed,— By darker waves, in kingdom of the dead.” I mused on this : night came, and with it stood Pindar by me, changed since I saw him last; All signs of age were gone, his altered mood Showed solemn joy, as one who had o’er passed The boundaries of our life, and all things seen As gods behold them in their light se rene. He held the lyre no more; but full, rich song Flowed from his lips like stream that swells in might; He praised Persephone, the fair, the strong, The gentle,—then he vanished from my sight. With me some fragments of that song remain,— Take them, poor echoes of a lofty strain!
Hail! thou whose crown, Not made of gold, gleams bright when gold is dimmed, Not twined of roses, blooms when roses die, Persephone! by me till now un hymned; Till now,—but now mine eye Hath seen thee, and I praise thee. Thou far down Wast carried, under Enna’s plain, In wider realms to rise a gain, And share his throne whose awful frown Shakes all that live with dread, Whose smile sheds sunlight on the righteous dead. Spouse of a king Who rules his subjects with such gentle sway That none from out of all that myriad band Has ever sought his laws to diso bey, Or to escape his hand,* Thou canst not mourn for thy long-vanished spring, Or pant to share the hollow mirth, Or see the fitful lights of earth, Now that a steadier radiance fling Round thee, with splendour pure, The rays no night can quench nor mist ob scure. Hail! awful queen! Thou, who the earthen vessel shatterest, Giving to sight The gem within, till now un seen! Thou, who dost wave thy wand and scatterest The phantom host, That eager troop a round The seekers after light! Thou bringer-forth to view of treasures lost; By whose pure hands the coils that Life has bound In tangled maze, are straight un wound! Hail! gracious one! Who liftest up from earth, safe carrying, Mighty and kind, The traveller whose long march is done; Who longed for thy white feet, far tarrying On distant hill, As heavier grew his load As fiercer blew the wind : Once on thy bosom, he forgets all ill; Borne in thine arms, o’er ocean’s trackless road, To island, of the blessed a bode. Hail! Lady of fair flowers, More lasting than on earth that grow; For these with morning blow, Ope wide at noon, and droop at even- tide : But those that deck thy bowers Bloom on, a fadeless glory and a pride. No worm is at their root, And, when they turn to fruit, It keeps the promise of its birth. Nay more, within thy garners safe a bide The sheaves we toiled to raise, but might not bind on earth. Hail! thou who dost u nite The severed once by change, or death! Where turf, thy trees be neath, Spreads green and smooth in many an open glade, Friend after friend to sight Steps forth, and greets us from the holy shade. No whisper breathe they sad,— Their brows are clear and glad. There Orpheus meets Eurydi ce, Antigone her brethren; nor a fraid Is now the Theban king to bless his children three. Hail! Cleanser, hail! Whose holy touch removes the stain, The blot from sire to children cleaving, Which men have washed, and washed, in vain. “ To-morrow ’twill be gone,” Hope cries, de ceiving; Yet prayer and effort fail. But thou hast lustral waters, far More cleansing than in temples are; Their dew makes pure at once; and, clean a gain, Within thy halls we stand, for gladness scarce be lieving. Hail! Giver great To man of his desire, long sought, But unaccomplished! Thou, his wish ful filling, Dost give him what he grasped by thought Awhile, but vainly : disappointment chilling Still followed soon or late. Earth’s gifts to shadows turns thy hand : Earth’s dreams it bids substantial stand Around us, into life from shadows brought;— Our heart’s deep thirst with love, our mind’s with wisdom stilling. Hail! dealer of true praise! With thee the tinsel fades, the diamond glows. Hail! Mighty Teacher, hail! Thou dost di sclose The secret hid from man for many days; Thy Hand unseals his eyelids, and he knows The God he sought in vain on earth by winding ways.
Quick from fog and frost a way, Fly my song with greeting gay To fair Belmont’s lady fair. Up, my song, to purer air — Up like soaring lark in spring! Quick as swallow dips his wing Slanting to the summer sea, Quick, away, with frolic glee, Humble greeting, greeting gay, To the Lady Portia! She is good and she is wise — She has shapen desti nies;— Swift of tongue, of noble speech, Learning ever, wise to teach; Wise in counsel, firm in deed, Helper in man’s utmost need; Brave as wise, and true as brave, Quick to feel, and strong to save : Fly my little song, and pay Honour to great Portia. Wise she is,—and sweet withal, Queen at life’s great fe stival, Queen of laughter; keen of wit, Quick to aim, and sure to hit,— Laughing light, and laughing ever, At the foolish jest and clever — Laughing first and jesting after, For she scarce can speak for laughter,— Who our thousand follies sees, Antics, inconsisten cies : Wiser than all men, more gay Than a child is Portia. Bright on Adriatic sea Plays the sunlight laughing ly; Soft on Belmont lawns by night Flows and spreads the fair moon light; Countless years has Venice stood Steadfast on the shifting flood : Steadfast heart, unbroken will, Noble purpose, matchless skill, Tenderness of moon’s soft ray, Splendour of the southern day, Charm of Venus at her birth, Naught of malice, all of mirth, Laughter, learning, love, and play — All good things are Portia. Fly, then, song across the sea, Fly to mirth and minstrel sy; And when thou dost see the trees On fair Belmont’s terra ces, Bow thee to thy lady’s knife, Kiss the hand that takes thy life; Take one kiss and breathe one sigh When she cuts thy chord, then lie In her hand, beneath her smile; She will laugh a little while — For she laughs at little things — Then perchance she’ll fold thy wings, Lay thee on her heart to rest; Then my song art thou most blest On the home of trust and play, On the heart of Portia.
He came, saw, and was conquered. Lady mine, You cannot choose but conquer; in mere sport You triumph, and your prize a human heart; Where others strive, you take your ease and win,— Win for you must; and so our friend was won,— Tamed to the rose-chain which I’ve worn so long. Was never victory more swift and sure! Never. A week, day, hour—nay, not so much; He came, he saw, was conquered. Victory! Glory to you and me! Take all the glory. No—though ’twas I that dragged him from his books, ’Twas you that tamed him. Bent o’er dusty books There was my friend, my Ralph, my dear sworn brother, After some hundred years or so turned—poet, Spoiling his eyes—the boy has pleasant eyes— Gnawing a weighty tome, grub, scholar, mole, Philosopher of dusk and dust—and poet. I found him, and I dragged him forth to light. To gaslight. Yes, to gaslight—best of lights, There he sat blinking—’twas the rarest sport— The innocent had never seen a play, Never! He knew his Shakspeare, loved the book; But not the boards; they said the modern stage Was all unworthy; so he only came Because I prayed him, and we had been friends. You had been friends? Friends? Yes, the closest friends. Oh but to see the change! There he sat dazed, Puzzled, disdainful; and the play began. What’s this? The dazed eyes open round and bright. What’s this? Black-letter? parchment? manuscript? A Student’s prize? Newest old-fashioned verse, Or old verse new the fashion? Yes, by Love, By the great little master! Such a scroll As not all libraries on earth can match, Parchment of living words, live manuscript, Most old, most new, the very fount of song, The world writ small in poetry—a woman. He did not know the kind. And does he know it? He learns his lesson daily at your feet. What shall you do? Where do you go to-day? I am to go? I weary you? Not much. I cannot comprehend you. I hope not. I can but leave you. You are very kind. Sphinx though you be, you make your meaning clear. Adieu, most potent lady : Queen, farewell, Give my respects to Master Ralph; farewell, Most arbitrary lady, queen of hearts, Queen of the stage—— Don’t speak about the stage : I would forget—this is my holiday— Let me forget the actress—so good-bye! Good-bye. The gate grates on the gravel-walk; He comes, I go—all pass; he goes, I come; We are two buckets at one well. Good-bye. You’ll educate my friend. Your friend! And mine? Oh what a day! Are you at last content? My lady, did you ever see such a day? I have seen many days. But none like this. Why, all the land to-day is fairyland. I came by the upland common all ablaze With gorse from end to end, and met the breeze Full in the face, and the grey morning clouds Rolled northward rent, and the great sun shone through : But that was nothing. Where the road dips down Steep from rough common to the wide grass-lands, I found a world of blossom; by my side The May-trees stood so thick with bloom, methought No space was there for song o’ the thrush, that shook The heart o’ the bush with rhapsodies of love : But that was nothing; for each blade of grass Had its rain-jewel; short-lived buttercups— Wealth of the meadow, fairy merchants’ gold— Thronged to my feet; then field and hedgerow, elms All newly green, and golden youth of oaks, And great horse-chestnut with imperial plumes; Far trees, and farther in the farther fields, Till I saw dimly the fair silver coils, Where the full Thames lay dreaming. All the land Was one broad flood of blossom, all the air Was scent of blossom. Down the road I came, Like a winged creature who but walks for whim, Half stifled by the songs I could not sing : But that was less than nothing; for I came Under your garden-wall, the old red wall, Rough stained and beautiful; and there I stood, Delaying my delight, and looking up I looked close in and through laburnum bloom, And through the bloom light slanted to my eyes, Sunshine and blossom dazzling, golden shower, Quivering, with beauty breathless : but that’s nothing, For when I pushed your gate, my dusty feet Were ankle-deep in daisies; nothing still, For round the o’erflowing lilac-bush I stole Breathless, and here are you. Yes, here am I;— And is that something? Crown o’ the day to me, Music that makes all music’s meaning clear, The master-touch interpreting all lights, Colour of colours, heart o’ the living rose—— Enough! Enough! Would you too flatter? No. I pray you pardon me, I am mad to-day : Drunken with spring : this morning on the road I could not sing, for all the world was poem, The world was poet, I was dumb; but now Beholding you I speak I know not what, The pent stream flows, and I am rhapsodist. I pray you pardon me. You need no pardon : I think your liking for these things is real. You really like the country. Really like it! To-day I love it. Arthur loves the town. Arthur? Where is he? Will he come to-day? Yes, he is here; he’s somewhere in the house— Helping my maid perhaps to plan a gown For the next part I play.— Don’t talk of plays. Is not this better than the playhouse? Yes : Oh so much better! This is holiday, My holiday amid the birds and bloom, My holiday with flowers. You love flowers. I hate them. What? I hate them. So would you If they were hurled at you, each on its wire, Falling with a thud on the boards, stirring the dust, Formal and scentless, dull, inevitable As gloves or fans—a bouquet! Bloom is bloom. May I not choose some flowers for my lady? No, let them live; I am so modest, I, One daisy shall suffice me; thanks, my poet. Your poet! If I dared—that was my dream The night when I first saw you; on that night I was so full of poetry, or verse Which would be poetry, so full of song, That, as I walked home through the London crowd— Crowd that was but a murmur in my ears, A shadow world,—I heard no single word Of Arthur’s talk, who will be critical. The moon shone fair above base yellow lights, And my lips babbled song; the moon shone fair And touched my lips with madness, till I thought That I was poet, fit to be your poet : I broke from Arthur, and ran home; my brain Was burning; “ It is the god,” I cried, “ The god inspires me :” so I seized my pen And wrote :— and by the morning light I read Page after page of broken scribbled verse, Poor verse—Yes, you may laugh. I do not laugh. Show me this verse. Then you love poetry? I hate it. Verses have been flung at me To fall with a thud like flowers : poetry Is but cheap flowers, jewellery that’s cheap, Cheap as my life. Why will you talk like that? I talk as I feel. I am not good, you know; Not good,—and somewhat weary of my life; At least I can be honest—bad but true,— Show me your verse. My lady, speak no more These cruel words against yourself. You know I can’t believe them—even if I would. You would believe them then? I wished to once; Once; long ago. We have been friends one week. I was a fool, a prejudiced poor fool, And I knew nothing. A week ago! Poor boy! I am a boy no longer. As a boy I lived with boys, and loved my friends, my dreams, And did not hate my books; I worked and played, Glad both of work and play. Then I saw you : Now I see nought but you. Nought but each cloud, Each summer cloud, each tree, each blade of grass. I saw all these because I came to you, Because I came to you, all beautiful; They had but mocked me else. As they mock me. Would I could see their beauty; for this land, Your dainty land of spring, is laid in flats; The carpenters are barely out of sight; Smell o’ the lamp, glare o’ the gas; and soon Not without jolt and creak the play’s next scene Will be presented. I foresee the scene. What is that scene? A dainty scene enough; A room, a bijou, boudoir, lady’s bower; A wall of satin, save where Cupids leer From panels; two long windows draped in lace Through which the rose-coloured pale sunlight faints To die on flowered carpet; all things there Which women love, for which—Let’s hear your verse. There are tears in your eyes. No, no. My eyes are dazed By too much lime-light. Let me hear your verse. There are tears in your eyes : why do you cry? Poor child! Child! I am laughing now; are you content? Child! I suppose that I was once a child, Knowing no harm i’ the world, a little child, I must have been—but it was long ago. Tell me about yourself. With pleasure, sir; The subject interests me : I was born Some five-and-twenty years ago, or more— I think that I was born before the flood : I lived in a farm :— Now mark the pretty scene! To Right a cottage porch o’ergrown with roses, Right Centre—pump or pigeon-house on pole, Then practicable gate o’ the old pasture, And Left a bit of barn-door. On this scene Enter a young girl singing; that was I. “ Dost like the picture? ” as they ask i’ the play. But come, recite! You did not tear them all, Not all your pretty verses? All, I think : There’s something I remember—but I will not, You are so strange to-day. You like me not : You like me not to-day; and that is well; You must not like me. Stop; don’t tell me that; It is too late. Poor boy! Not poor but rich, Rich with a kingdom that I would not yield To be an Emperor. And that’s not much. Don’t talk like a young lover on the stage! This my garden, this my holiday; Keep the stage lover from me :— Be my Siebel, Cull me some flowers. Let the flowers live; Is not the whole world nosegay for my lady? Pestilent vapours. No. Disperse them then; Come, let me have my hour; come, if you love me; Sit by my feet and speak your verse to me; Here at my feet! That’s right; and now the verses! They are so weak. The better! Who am I That I should make men poets? Quires of verse Have been discharged at me; they were all weak. Begin! I cannot. If you love me, Ralph. I must. I can remember but few lines, Night’s flower, child of night and perfumed air Star o’ the night, lone star as pure as pale — Night’s bird whose mere discourse is music rare — Bird, star and flower, lovelorn nightin gale — Lightning of wrath, O passion fierce and frail — Heart o’ the rose, O heart of love’s own heart — Air, fire, life, death—and woman too thow art. I have obeyed you, lady. Thanks, my poet. And when I played, you saw all this in, me? You were so much to me. And it was real? Was this play real to you? Did you believe? The woman that you played was real to me, Now shadow of a shade, since you are real, Since I am by your feet, and this is you. Shadow of a shade, ay, shadow of shade is play And woman too. Then nought be real to me But this dear shade. No; have no faith in me. I have no choice. Poor boy! Nay, not so poor! Now, when I felt your hand light on my hair, A blessing fell on me : Oh to sit here For ever, that this moment might be time, Dream with no waking after! dreamful sleep, Or death of all thought save that you are near. Yes, dream; you are safe in dreams—but never wake. Dream, and I dream this day will ne’er be done. The butterfly outlives it, but not love. One night falls dark, dark night on love and life. Oh this is poetry, folly, player’s rant; You dream and wake to-morrow. A week ago We two were strangers; let some few days pass And we are strangers. But a week ago I had not lived. Stage fever is not life; Stage fever’s quick. Yes, quick to cure or kill. You must not talk like that. What need to talk? Let the air talk in the lilac; you and I Sit silent breathing spring-time—you and I. And are you happy? I am rich with joy, And yet not wholly happy. Lover’s mood! O lover’s luxury of sighs long-drawn! Immortal—dead at sundown! Is’t not sweet To taste the day’s delight, and sorrow too, Sorrow in the thought that you and I must part? Why must we part? Why! Wake and see the world, The world on which I make my player’s round, A star—how runs it!— star that’s pale and pure, Star o’ the troupe, a comet with faint tail, With somewhat musty followers—not with you. Child, would you journey round this dusty world Tied to my apron-string? Yes, that would I. No, be a man and burst these idle bonds, These apron-strings. Who tied me here but you? You bound me, and I will not loose the bonds. You bid me be a man; be woman you To pity me : “ I would I were thy bird.” Don’t quote from plays. ’Tis real enough to me. I’ve seen so many love-sick Montagues; I’ve stepped from windows with no house behind, Leaned from sham balconies to lisp sham love;— The powder’s thick on the child Juliet’s cheek; She’s dead i’ the first scene, dead, stark, analysed, Dissected—Now I shock you! You see now How dull to feel I am, how cold, how bad, How tired of life! A live warm-blooded man Had better crash his heart against a stone Than look for love in me. Be warned in time. All is cold here at my heart, all is cold here. See me, not Juliet in me : push her back, This Juliet of your fancy, to the tomb; To the tomb with her, if you love me, Ralph. If I love! Child, poor child, you must not love, You shall not love me. I am not a child,— I love you, Mabel. Hush! you shall not love me. You will not : do you mark me? Arthur! here! Where is my loving playmate? Ho, boy, ho! Come to me, Arthur. I salute you both. Good morning, Ralph, a happy day to you! Is it not happy, man? Oh, much too happy! I triumph, Arthur! May I kiss your hand? My lips if you will; I am right royal to-day. What are you saying? You will spoil it all. Look how the boy stares, boy who dares not think Of woman’s lip, who dares no¢ lift his eye When trembling sore he takes her finger-tips,— Boy! child! a woman’s wine is made of grapes, Virtue! a fig’s end!— oh, how runs the stuff?— Iago knew us. Good! Brava! brava! Was ever such an actress! Ralph, applaud! I’ll swear he half believes her. What an actress! And is this acting? No. I tell you, no. (Be silent, Arthur, do not cross my whim.) I have been acting, acting for a week, A long dull week, seven days of sentiment— Heaven bless us all!— of sentiment and song, “ Sighing like furnace,” of young grass and lambs, Young grass, young lambs, young love, love of a boy. But now good-bye, ingenuous charm of youth, Good-bye to love, good-bye to love and lamb, And back to town! I am free, I am true, myself, I am myself again. Good-bye, dear boy; We meet in town? No. Then good-bye again. Good-bye. What means this, Mabel? Won’t you speak? Go. What have I done? I’ve done nothing wrong. Nothing but torture me! Go! Very well! I never yet have crossed a lady’s whim. I am alone : this is my holiday.
Dear Tom, this brown beaker, so clasped and so cracked, Was once Jemmy Blinker’s, a scholar e xact; He gave it to me, when he died in his bed, This bowl, with his Homer bound trimly in red. And now once a-year, since the flight of his soul, I read in his Homer, and drink from his bowl — Rare Jemmy Blinker! O rare Jemmy Blinker, where now shall we find A scholar like him, of omnivorous kind? Not this volume he tasted, or that, for his whim, But a book was a book and a banquet to him : Its date and its title and binding he knew, And its place in the Bodleian Library too — Rare Jemmy Blinker! O rare Jemmy Blinker, oh where shall we find A scholar like him, of the Polyglot kind? For his Latin, could Cicero rise from the dead, He would wonder to find his own echo so spread; And for Greek, every twig he could hunt to its root, In Sanscrit, and Gothic, and Gaelic to boot — Rare Jemmy Blinker! When you caught him in one of his musty old nooks, Half buried behind a big rampart of books, With his soft-shaded hair, and his delicate skin, You ne’er had suspected the giant wi thin; But Jem was a tough one, and never knew pains In his vulcanite bowels and bend-leather brains — Rare Jemmy Blinker! Our readers are now a light-skirmishing race, Who skim frothy fancies with grasshopper grace, But Jem, with a folio like Hercules, would wrestle, And he pounded the stuff in his brain with a pestle; His memory beat all the rhapsodist crew, For Homer both forwards and backwards he knew — Rare Jemmy Blinker! ’Twas a feast to behold him, with pipe and with coffee, Grinding his teeth o’er some rugged old strophe; His wit never failed when a verse was to mend, With a gash in the front and a gap in the end; And keen as a terrier nosing the vermin, He smelt a hiatus like Porson or Hermann — Rare Jemmy Blinker! At famous book-sales with the clock he was seen, In a snuffy old shirt, and a coat of pea- green; Few volumes he bought, but when Blinker was there, Be sure that the lumber contained something rare; He once stood an Aldus, so costly a winner, That he lived a whole week without port to his dinner — Rare Jemmy Blinker! One winter at Rome, when he journeyed with me, No pictures he went, no processions, to see; No vespers he heard, and no matins could say, But he sat in the Vatican day after day; And when he came back from his tour anti quarian, He published the text of an old Greek gram marian — Rare Jemmy Blinker! So mighty was he variantes to fish up, I never knew why he was not made a bishop; Perhaps such a fellow, who shaped his own notions, Might shake an old creed with unseemly com motions : I once heard it whispered, though not Uni tarian, He brewed in his brain a slight tincture of Arian — Poor Jemmy Blinker! He had faults, I confess, but what mortal has not? We moderns, he said, on the shelves would soon rot; Bombastic was Shakespeare, and once he de tected him, Cribbing from Pindar, when no man su spected him; John Ruskin was flighty, Tom Carlyle was crude, And all were admired most when least under stood — Said learned Jemmy Blinker! His books he loved well, but loved not less his bottle, Like Socrates, Solon, and sage Ari stotle — For the Greeks were great drinkers, he said, and if you, sir, Denied it, you’d find that he knew what he knew, sir; He’d rise in his chair, like a god, and be lay us With book, page, and letter of old Athe næus — Rare Jemmy Blinker! One day in his study—what fate could be sadder?— He clomb to the shelf, No. 10, on a ladder; And while fumbling up there for a Cas siodorus, He came tumbling down with a rumble sonorous : And he broke his hip-bone, and the doctors him bled, And we wept briny tears when he died in his bed — Poor Jemmy Blinker! Then fill up the glass, Tom, of port do not scrimp us, ’Tis nine years to-day since he rose to O lympus; Not lightly again shall we see such a tinker Of wormy old vellums as glorious Blinker. I read in his Homer, I drink from his bowl, And I pray that the gods may give peace to the soul Of rare Jemmy Blinker!
You blame me that I cannot love As you can love, my friend; You call me heartless,—light of faith,— Because my fancies end! I do not say it is not true; Oh no! your words are right : But you who love, and I who laugh, Which gains most in the fight? And why, if you were seeking love, Should you have turned to me?— I, who of all who meet your gaze Have sworn inconstan cy! Go further yet, poor heart, and seek For one who still can give; Or, if your heartbreak prove too sharp, Curse me, my friend,—and live. Yes! Once I cursed,—and lived. Alas! ’Tis better far to die, Hands meekly clasped and prayerful Eyes upturned to the sky. I loved too well,—as you, my friend, Are loving me this hour; Such loves die hard, are cursed, we know, With overwhelming power. My love went out,—as yours will do,— But after many years; And in those years I was not glad, And bitter were my tears. My love was like your love, my friend,— It met with no re turn, In spite of passionate appeal, In spite of words that burn. But you who love, and I who laugh, May part at least in peace; One day you’ll thank me for my words, One day your pain will cease.
Flower of the Bean, Oh the joys we have known, oh the days we have seen! When Love sang, the world was so glad and so green, O flower of the Bean! Flower of the Brake, Life had but one blossom; and oh, for your sake I plucked it, and gave it! now let my heart break, O flower of the brake! Flower of the Rose, The rain ever rains, and the wind ever blows, And life since you left me has nothing but woes, O flower of the Rose! Flower of the Gorse, All the love that I gave you comes back like a curse; No peace will be mine till I’m laid in my hearse, O flower of the Gorse!
The ship Britannia sailed a way One stormy winter, to cross the Bay, With a skipper bold and a gallant crew, And the flag at her mast of the old True Blue. Her sails were stout, and her spars were st rong, And she seemed to feel, as she bowled a long, That she feared not the worst that winter could do, For her decks were manned by a British crew. The winds blew free and the waves rose high, And the lightning shivered across the sky, And the good ship plunged in the foaming deep, Then reared like a horse ere he takes his leap. Oh, well for her that the man at the wheel Had an iron hand and a heart of steel! Oh, well for her that her skipper true Would have none on board but a British crew! She rode the waves and she weathered the blast, Till she sailed into summer seas at last, And her flag aloft was yet proudly borne, Though her spars were strained and her sails were torn. Then those who knew what the storm had been, And all that the skipper had suffered and seen, Said, “Ah, there’s nothing that ship can’t do, As long as she’s manned by a British crew!” ‘Tis winter again, and the ship must sail Across the Bay in a furious gale : Her sails are stout, and her spars are strong, And why should she fear as she bowls a long? With her gallant crew, and her skipper bold, And her flag that waves where it waved of old, Oh why should she fear what the gale can do, While she carries on board her British crew? Alas for the ship, and alas for the flag! The old True Blue is a pitiful rag — All ravelled and sodden with mud and dirt By the hands that should guard it from stain or hurt. Alas for the ship, and the gallant men Who could save her now as they saved her then — Oh, well may she fear what the gale can do, For her decks are manned by a Lascar crew! Alas for the ship, that her pilot’s hand Is shifting and weak as a rope of sand! And alas for her, that her captain’s eye Is wicked and wild as the stormy sky! He sees not the breakers which foam a head, He hears not the thunder-clouds’ gathering tread, And little he recks what the gale can do — But oh for one hour of her British crew! The waves will rise, and the winds will blow, And the Lascars will cower like rats be low; With nerveless fingers and craven heart, Under battened hatches they shiver and start : The skipper is mad, and the rudder gone, And the ship rushes on to her doom a lone — And we know too well what the gale will do To a ship that is manned by a Lascar crew!
Mark yonder cot, among the trees, Where flow’rs in native freedom twine, Whose fragrance courts the healthy breeze That sheds around their scent di vine. Within that humble cot thou’lt find More pow’r than dwells ’neath gilded dome; The wealth of wit, the pow’r of mind, For there behold a poet’s home. While counted gold, ’neath bolt and bar, To hide from all the miser tries, The poet’s wealth—more precious far — In open page, uncounted lies. The pearls of thought, the mental ore, By fancy’s fire to gold re fined, The poet makes no hidden store, But shares his wealth with all man kind. Then wealth, and pomp, and pow’r give way, And warriors bold with flag un furl’d; A king can but one nation sway — The poet’s rule is o’er the world! The honour be, without a blot, Around his path where’er he roam, But where he loves and wanders not Be blessings!— on the poet’s home.
“ Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end; Each changing place with that which goes be fore, In sequent toil all forwards do con tend. Nativity once in the main of light, Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned, Crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight, And Time that gave, doth now his con found. Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow; Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth, And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow. And yet, to times in hope, my verse shall stand, Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.”
“ That time of year thou may’st in me behold. When or leaves, or none, or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare, ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou seest the twilight of such day, As after sunset fadeth in the west, Which by-and-by black night doth take a way, Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest. In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, As the deathbed whereon it must ex pire Consumed with that which it was nour - ished by. This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong, To love that well which thou must leave ere long.”
“ Captain, or colonel, or knight in arms, Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize, If deed of honour did thee ever please, Guard them, and him within protect from harms. He can requite thee; for he knows the charms That call fame on such gentle acts as these, And he can spread thy name o’er lands and seas, Whatever clime the sun’s bright circle warms. Lift not thy spear against the Muse’s bower : The great Emathian conqueror bid spare The house of Pindarus, when temple and tower Went to the ground; and the repeated air Of sad Electra’s poet had the power To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.”
“ When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never, Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God, Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load Of death, called life, which us from life doth sever. Thy works, and alms, and all thy good en deavour, Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod; But, as Faith pointed with her golden rod, Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever. Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best Thy handmaids, clad them o’er with purple beams And azure wings, that up they flew so drest, And spake the truth of thee on glorious themes Before the Judge; who thenceforth bid thee rest, And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.”
“ It is a beauteous evening, calm and free; The holy time is quiet as a nun Breathless with adoration; the broad sun Is sinking down in its tranquilli ty; The gentleness of heaven is on the sea : Listen! the mighty being is a wake, And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder—everlasting ly. Dear child! dear girl! that walkest with me here, If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, Thy nature is not therefore less di vine : Thou liest ‘in Abraham’s bosom’ all the year; And worshipp’st at the Temple’s inner shrine, God being with thee when we know it not.”
“ Glory to God! and to that Power who came In filial duty, clothed with love di vine, Which made His earthly tabernacle shine Like ocean, burning with purpureal flame : Or like that Alpine mount which takes its name From roseate hues; far kenned at morn and even, In quiet times, and when the storm is driven Across its nether region’s stalwart frame. Earth prompts, heaven urges—let us seek the light, Mindful of that pure intercourse be gun When first our infant brows their lus - tre won. So, like the mountain, may we glow more bright, Through unimpeded commerce with the sun, At the approach of all-involving night.”
“ Mysterious Night! when our first pa - rent knew Thee from report alone, and heard thy name, Did he not tremble for this lovely frame, This glorious canopy of light and blue? Yet ’neath a curtain of translucent dew, Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame, Hesperus, with the host of heaven, came, And lo! Creation widened in man’s view. Who could have thought such darkness lay con cealed, Within thy beams, O sun! or who could find, Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood re vealed, That to such countless orbs thou mads’t us blind? Why do we, then, shun death with anxious strife? If light can thus deceive, wherefore not life?”
Upon the cherry-bough the blackbird sings His careless, happy song, As ’mid the rubied fruit he tilting swings, Heedless of Right or Wrong. No Future taunts him with its fears or hopes, No cares his Present fret; The Past for him no dismal vista opes Of useless, dark re gret. Ah! how I envy him, as there he sings His glad unthinking strain, Untroubled by the sad imagi nings That haunt man’s plotting brain! All orchards are his home; no work or care Compels him here to stay; His is the world—the breathing, open air — The glorious summer day. Below, Earth blossoms for him; and a bove Heaven smiles in boundless blue; Joy is in all things, and the song of Love Thrills his whole being through. From bough to bough its gay and transient guest Is free to come and go Where’er the whim invites, where’er the best Of juicy blackhearts grow. His are these sunny sides, that through and through He stabs with his black bill; And his the happiness man never knew, That comes without our will. Ah! we who boast we are the crown of things, Like him are never glad; By doubts and dreams and dark self-questio nings We stand besieged and sad. What know we of that rare felici ty The unconscious blackbird knows, That no misgiving spoils; that frank and free From merely living grows? Haggard Repentance ever dogs our path; The foul fiend Discon tent Harries the spirit, and the joys it hath Are but a moment lent. The riddle of our Life we cannot guess; From toil to toil we haste, And in our sweetest joy some bitter ness Of secret pain we taste. Ah! for an hour at least, when bold and free In being’s pure de light, Loosed from the cares that clog humani ty, The soul might wing its flight. Then, blackbird, we might sing the perfect song Of Life and Love with thee, Where no regret nor toil, nor fear of Wrong, Nor doubt of Right should be.
“ Get up, get up, my merrie young men, And saddle my guid bay steed; For I maun ride to St. Mirren’s Kirk, And the time draws on wi’ speed.” Then up and spak his bonnie young wife : “ What for suld ye gang there? ’Tis past the hour for vesper sang, ’Tis past the time for prayer.” Then up and spak his only son : “ I hear the sad sea’s maen; O think on the mirk and eerie night, O think on the wind and rain. The shore is wild, the glen is deep, The moor is rough and hie; And he who rides on sic a night Suld hae guid compa nie.” “ Ye speak but true, my bonnie young wife, The time o’ prayer is bye; Ye speak but true, my only son, The wind and waves are high. The shore is wild, the glen is deep, The moor is cauld and wide; But I hae a tryst at St. Mirren’s Kirk, And I trow I downa bide.” He mounted on his strang bay steed, Nor dreamed o’ rain or wind; The lanesome whaup cried on before, The houlet screamed be hind. “ Speed on, speed on, my guid bay mare, Nor heed that melo die; ’Tis but the sang o’ the lone mermaid, As she sings to the wintry sea. Haud up, haud up, my bonnie bay steed, Till ye wun to bank or brae; For the wan water o’ Fairlie burn I trow has tint its way.” The thunder brattled wi’ eerie thud, As he rade ower the moor o’ Kame; But when he cam to the Baidland hill, The lichtnin’ spell’d his name. When he gaed by the mountain tarn, And through the Biglee moss, He saw a lowe on St. Mirren’s Kirk, Abune the guid stane cross. And when he cam,to the auld kirkyaird, Wow! but he shook wi’ dread; For there was a ring o’ seven witches A’ dancin’ abune the dead. There were twa grim hags frae Saltcoats toon, And twa frae the Kirk o’ Shotts, And twa cam ower frae the Brig o’ Turk, And ane frae John o’ Groats. O wha was he in that hellish ring Wi’ buckles abune his knee? He was clad in a garb o’ guid braidclaith,— I’se warrant the Deil was he! And aye he keckled, and aye he flang, As the hags gaed merrilie round, Till the frightened banes i’ the kirkyaird mool Lap up through the quaking ground, Then by cam a muckle cormorant, And it jowed the auld kirk bell; The lowe gaed out, the witches fled, And the Deil stood by him sel ’. The wind blew up, and the wind blew doon, Till it fell’d an auld ash- tree; And the Deil cam ower to the kirkyaird yett, And he bow’d richt courteou slie. “ O cam ye here to be purged or shriven, Or cam ye here to pray?” “ O I cam here for the bonnie bridle Ye promised me yester day. I wad ride on the back o’ the nor’-east wind; I wad prance through driving storm; And I wad own the guid bridle That wad keep me aye frae harm.” “ Gin I gie you the gift ye seek O what will you gie me? Gin I gie you the bonnie bridle, O what sal be my fee?” “ I am chief o’ the knights o’ Cunninghame; I am laird o’ the green Cum bray; And I’ll gie you a bonnie white doo When ye pass by that way.” He is aff on the wings o’ the nor’-east wind, Wi’ a speed that nane may learn; He has struck red fire frae the black Kame hill, And flash’d ower the Baidland cairn. And aye he shook his strange bridle, And aye he laughed wi’ glee, As his wild steed danced doon the mountain-side Uncheck’d by rock or tree. “ O up and see this eerie sicht!” Cried a shepherd in Crosby glen; But as he spak the swift bay steed Had pass’d ayont his ken. “ O up and see this wild horseman, And his horse wi’ the clankin’ shoon!” But ere the eye could be turned to look He had clanged through Ardrossan toon. And aye he rade, and aye he laughed, And shook his bridle grim; For there wasna a rider in a’ the land, Could ever keep sicht o’ him. “ Get up, get up, my merrie young men, Get up my sailors gay; For I wad sail in my bonnie white boat, To the shores o’ fair Cum bray.” He set his face to the saut, saut sea, He turned his back to land; And he sang a lilt o’ a guid luve-lay, As he gaed doon the strand. He hadna been a league frae shore, A league but barely three; When oot and spak his only son : “ Send my guid page to me. Now saddle me fast my father’s steed, Put his new bridle on : For I maun ride to Portincross Before the licht is gone.” Then up and spak his young mother : “ My son, that maunna be; The rocks are high, the steed is wild, And I fear the gurly sea. I dream’d a dolefu’ dream yestreen, And grat till my een were blin ’; O if ye ride that wild bay steed, I fear ye’ll ne’er come in.” “ Come cheer ye up, my mother dear, Fause dreams ye maunna dree; What gies sic joy to my father’s heart, Will no bring grief to me.” Now he has mounted the bonnie bay steed, And he has seized the rein; “ Cheer up, cheer up, my sweet mother, Till I come back a gain.” The first mile that he rade alang, His een were lit wi’ glee; The second mile that he rade alang, His heart beat merri lie. The third mile that he rade alang, His feet danced in his shoon; And ere the fourth mile he had rade His brain gaed whirling roon’. He flang the reins frae oot his han ’— The steed gaed briskly on, Ower rock and fen, ower moor and glen, By loch and mountain lone. The sun blink’d merrily in the lift; Pearls gleam’d on ilka tree; The bonniest hues o’ rainbow licht Were flickerin’ on the sea. O sweet is the smile o’ the opening rose, And sweet is the full-blawn pea; And sweet, sweet to the youthfw’ sense, Were the ferlies he did see Fair forms skipped merrily by his side,— The gauze o’ goud they wore; But the blythest queen o’ a’ the train Danced wantonly on be fore. “ Come here, come here, my bonnie young May, Sae sweet as I hear ye sing; Come here, come here, my ain true luve, And I’ll gie ye a pearlie ring.” He urged the steed wi’ his prickly heel, Till the red blude stained her side; But he ne’er could reach that fause young May Sae fast as he might ride. He rade and rade ower the wide coun trie, Till mirth gave place to pain; The sun dropp’d into the cauld, cauld sea, And the sky grew black wi’ rain. “ Haud in, haud in, my guid bay steed, Sae fast as ye seem to flee; I hear the voice o’ my dear mother, As she greets at hame for me. O halt ye, halt! my bonnie bay steed, There’s dule by the sounding shore; Nae pity dwells in the bleak, bleak waves, Sae loud as I hear them roar. O help me, help! my sweet mother; Come father and succour me!” But the only voice in the lone mirk nicht Was the roar o’ the grewsome sea. He has lookit east, he has lookit wast, He has peer’d through the blinding hail; But the only licht on the wide waters, Was the gleam o’ his father’s sail. He has lookit north, he has lookit south, To see where help might be; But the wild steed leapt ower the black headland And sank in the ruthless sea! O when his father reached the shore, Sair did he greet and maen, When he thought on the fair young face He ne’er might see a gain. “ Come back, come back, my bonnie young son, Come back and speak to me!” But he only heard thro’ the grey, grey licht The sough o’ the pitiless sea. “ O gie mea kiss o’ his red, red lips, Or a lock o’ his gouden hair!” But the heartless wind, wi’ an eldritch soun’, Aye mocked at his de spair. O cauld was the bite o’ the plashing rain, And loud was the tempest’s roar; And deep was the grief o’ the father’s heart As he stood by the hopeless shore. “ Wae, wae on my tryst at St. Mirren’s Kirk, That bargain I sairly rue, When I took ower the Deil’s bridle And sold my bonnie white doo!”
O Life! O Death! Ye dread mysterious twain, Baffling us from the cradle to the bier; Phantoms that fill our souls with strange, vague fear, Elusive as the forms that haunt the brain Of the sick raver. Question we in vain The lore of all the ages, sage and seer, To answer why and who ye are, and clear The clouds that round you evermore re main. Whence come ye? Whither go ye? None may say — One leads man walking in an idle show Along the myriad paths of joy and woe To where the other waits to bear a way The enfranchised Soul, that chartless Ocean o’er, To the dim land whence man returns no more.
O Life! O Death! How good ye are and fair, As, luminous in the glory of God’s love, Ye stand revealed His Angels from a bove! Angels we’ve entertained, though una ware,— The janitors that wait our souls to bear Through either gate of Being; not to rove Unguided, but in course prescribed to move, Fixed as the planets’ paths that roll through air. In Christ’s “ dear might,” your Lord and ours, now bold With reverent courage, lo! the veil we raise Erst wrapped around you, and with wondering gaze Your solemn beauty undismayed be hold, No more dread mysteries, our souls to scare, Making Life Vanity and Death De spair.
Life is no sleepless dream, as poets sing : Death is no dreamless sleep, as sophists say. A deeper wisdom tells us, brothers they, Loving, though parted until Time shall bring The twain together in their journe ying, To part no more, on that supremest day, When Heaven and Earth and Time shall pass a way, And Christ shall reign o’er all as God and King. Yet, till they meet, there stands a third be tween, A brother, like yet differing from each, And he is Sleep, whose mission is to teach What Life’s and Death’s less mysteries may mean,* Till, Life’s watch o’er, we “fall on sleep,” to spring To deathless Life through Death’s awake ning.
Rabbi Ben Esdra to his dearest friend, Rabbi Ben Israel, greeting—May the Lord Keep thee in safety! I am still in Rome, And, after months of silence, now redeem My pledge to tell you how this Christian world (Which here I came to study), nearly viewed, Strikes me, a Jew born, and with steady faith In all the Law and Prophets of our land. Still, though a Jew, it is the Truth I seek,— Only the Truth,—and, come from whence it will, I greet it with bent head and reverent heart. I am a seeker;—though my faith is firm, I will not tie my mind in knots of creeds. No more preamble. I am now in Rome, Where our Jehovah rules not,—but the man Jesus, whose Life and Fate too well we know, Is made a God—the cross on which he died A reverend symbol, and his words the law. His words, what were they? Love, goodwill to man. His kingdom? Peace. His precepts? Poverty. Well, are they followed? That’s the question now. What fruit have they produced? One moment, first. I think no ill of him. He was sincere, Lofty of thought, a pure idealist, Possessed, indeed, by visionary dreams, But wishing ill to no one, least of all To us, and to our Faith, which was his own. I will not say he was entirely wrong In the strong censures that he laid on us; For we had many faults—were, as he said, Only too much like whited sepulchres,— And then, no good man is entirely wrong, And none entirely right. The truth is vast, And never was there Creed embraced it all. Like all enthusiasts he beheld his half, Deemed it the whole, and with excess of zeal Pushed his ideal truth beyond the stretch Of human practice. Most of what he taught The wise and good of old had said before. His healing skill, this sect calls miracles, A hundred others had as well as he; And for that claim his followers set up, And he, perhaps (though here there is much doubt), Asserted of himself, that he was sent Messias, King of kings, to save the world,— This, surely, was no crime deserving death : No mere opinions, void of acts, are crimes. Besides, what sect or creed was ever crushed By cruelty? Our error was perverse, Wilful, unwise. Had we but spared his life, He would have passed away as others pass,— Simon and John and Apollonius, Judas of Galilee, and many more. But, no! we lifted him above the rest; Made him conspicuous by his martyrdom; Watered with blood his doctrines; fired the hearts Of those who loved him with intemperate zeal And wild imaginations, till at last They thought they saw him risen from the dead. Our folly (call it by its lightest name) Nourished the seed into this mighty sect, That takes his name and worships him as God. Setting aside the superstitious part, I ask, What were the doctrines that he preached, And that his followers with their lips profess? Love! Peace! Goodwill to man! This was the gist Of all he taught. Forgive your enemies! Seek for the lost sheep from the fold that stray! Harm no one! For the prodigal returned Kill the fat calf! Be merciful to all! Who are the enemies, prodigals, lost sheep, To whom their mercy, love, care, gifts are given? Not we, the Jews, in truth. Is it for us They kill the calf? Are we the enemies That they forgive? Have they goodwill for us? Not they! They hold us rather like foul swine,— Abuse us,—lay great burdens on our backs,— Spit on us,—drive us forth beyond their walls,— Force us all slavish offices to do,— And if we join their sect, scorn us the more. If those are blessèd, as he says, whom men Revile and persecute, most blest are we! Yet was not Jesus, first of all, a Jew,— Even to his death a Jew? Did he renounce His strict faith in the Prophets and the Law? Never! “ I come not to destroy,” he said, “ The Law or Prophets, only to fulfil.” So, too, his preaching, whatsoe’er it was, Was to the Jews. The miracles he wrought Were for the Jews alone. “ I am not sent,”— These are his words,— “ but unto the lost sheep Of Israel’s house : my bread is not for dogs.” Who were the dogs to whom he thus refused To lend his healing hand? What had she done Who asked his service that he scorned her thus? She was from Canaan, or a Greek—no, Jew; This was her crime. ’Tis true that, touched at last By those sad humble words of hers, “ The dogs May eat the crumbs dropped from the master’s board,” He made her an exception to his rule,— But still his rule was this. This his first rule. No? But it was! Remember the rich youth Who prayed to be his follower : “ Two things,” He said, “ are needful.” First, that you obey The Law and Prophets—that is, are a Jew;— And then the second, that your wealth and goods You sell, and give the proceeds to the poor. First be a Jew, then poor. Renounce all wealth; Keep nothing back. These are conditions prime, Refusing which, your following I reject. I see you gravely shake your head at this; But read the records,—you will see I’m right. Jesus, let me repeat it yet again, Was first and last a Jew; never renounced That faith of ours; taught in the Synagogue; Quoted the Prophets; reaffirmed the Law; Worked with the Jews, and only healed the Jews, And held all other nations but as dogs.* I’ve read the records carefully again : It goes against my will—still, I admit, Ben Esdra may be right. Here let me note One case that he perchance has overlooked— That of the Publican named Zaccheus. This man was rich, and, curious, sought to look On Jesus,—for this purpose climbed a tree. Jesus, perceiving him, proposed himself To be his guest; at which a murmuring went Among his followers,—for this wealthy man Was, as they said, a sinner, or no Jew. But I note this, that Zaccheus on the spot Surrendered half his goods unto the poor Ere Jesus went into his house; and then, And not till then, said Jesus— “ On this house This day salvation cometh, forasmuch As he, too, is a son of Abraham ”— That is,a Jew. Again, where did he send His twelve disciples (Judas ’mid the rest) To preach the Gospel? To the Gentiles? No! This he forbade,—but “ unto the lost sheep Of Israel’s house.” And one case more I note,— That of the woman of Samaria, To whom he said (his followers murmuring That he should speak to her): “ Salvation comes And second (mark this well, and ponder it), He was a Communist—denied the right Of private wealth; ordained a common purse To be administered for all alike, And all rejected who refused him this. “ ’Tis easier for a camel to pass through A needle’s eye”—these are his very words,— “ Than that a rich man should inherit heaven.” A rich man, mind you, whether good or bad. What was the moral of his parable Of Lazarus, and Dives? What offence Did Dives, that in everlasting fire He was condemned to suffer? What good deed Did Lazarus that he at last should lie On Abraham’s bosom in eternal bliss? Nothing! The beggar, Lazarus, was poor; Dives was rich. This was the crime of one, The virtue of the other. Not one hint Of any other reason for the hell Or heaven that he adjudged them,—not one word That Dives was not charitable, kind, Generous, a helper of his brother man;— No accusation, save that he was rich. No word that Lazarus, with all his sores, Possessed one virtue, save that he was poor. Nay, more : when Dives in his torment sued For mercy, what did Abraham say to him? You for your evil deeds must suffer now? No! but, “ You had the good things on the earth, Lazarus the evil. Therefore, now, to thee Is torment given—comfort unto him.” Working to pile up wealth Jesus abhorred. “ Each man for all,” he said, “ and all for each. Take no thought of to-morrow—for the day Sufficient will be given. No sparrow falls Save through God’s law. The ravens of the air Sow not and reap not, yet God feedeth them. The lilies of the field nor toil nor spin, Yet Solomon was not arrayed like them. Why, then, take thought of raiment and of food? But to the Jews.” Doubtless, as well we know, It was unlawful for a Jew to eat And bide with those who were uncircumcised. Upon this point, long after he was dead, Extreme contention ’mid his followers rose, If Gentiles, ere they had been circumcised, Into the Christian faith could be baptised— Some holding full adherence to the law A prime condition,—some, that it sufficed If its main principles were recognised : But this I merely note. It seems quite clear That only Jews at first could join the sect. Leave all to God. Blessèd are ye, the poor! God’s kingdom shall be yours : but ye, the rich, Woe unto you.” This was his life and text. Once only—so the record goes—a rage Seized upon Jesus, when, with whip and thong, The money-changers—all who bought and sold— He from the precincts of the temple drove, Saying, “ ’Tis writ, This is the house of prayer, But ye have made it to a den of thieves.” Let this show what he thought of such as these. Those who were with him knew and did his will,— Lived in community of goods, renounced All private wealth. This doctrine, too, they preached After his death; and all who joined their sect Sold their possessions, houses, treasures, lands, And paid the price into the common store, To be administered to each one’s need. They did not seek by subterfuge and trick To cling to Mammon while they worshipped God.* What should a Christian do, then, who accepts The doctrines that this master, nay, this God (For so they call him), clearly thus appoints;— Live by them, should he not? Not by blank words Affirm them, but by all his acts and life. First, love to God—and love to man as well. Then peace, forgiveness, kindness, poverty. What is the Christian practice? War—the sword As arbiter of all disputes of men— Reprisals,—persecutions unto death For all who differ from them—Peter’s sword That Jesus bade him sheathe,—no simple lives Of frugal fare and pure beneficence, But luxury and imperious tyranny In all high places,—all in earnest strife To pile up wealth for selfish purposes,— Each greedy for himself, the wretched poor Down-trodden, trampled on,—the Church itself, Splendid with pageant, cruel in its power,— Pride rampant, hissing through a thousand maws,— Power, like a ravening wolf among the lambs, Worrying the weakest,—prayers, lip-deep, no more— The devil’s work done in the name of God. Such is the spectacle I see in Rome. * Here I, Ben Israel, note the curious case Of Ananias and Sapphira, struck By sudden death, because of all their wealth They kept a part back for their private use— Tempting by this the Lord, as Peter said. But where are the Almighty’s lightnings now? Among the pomps in which this Christian Church Invests its pageants, oft I think of him Whom they pretend to worship, and his words Come back to me with which he once reproved Our priests of his own days. The world, indeed, Has but one pattern for its worldliness,— Or now, or then, ’tis evermore the same. If we of old were stiff-necked in our pride, Desiring power instead of godliness, Avid of pomp,—these Christians are the same : They will not follow either God or Christ. “ Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and see; Ask, where is the good way, and walk therein, And so ye shall find rest unto your souls. But they replied, We will not walk therein.” Thus Jeremiah,—Jesus much the same. Long prayers, low bowings in the market-place, Chief seats in synagogues, upper rooms at feasts, Fine linen, costly dresses, pompous rites, Grand ceremonials, purple trailing robes, Embroidered hems, and wide phylacteries,— All this he scorned. Well, still we see the same, For all his scorn, among his followers. His very words describe these cardinals As they were made for them alone,—not us. Not we alone were whited sepulchres; Robbed widows, orphans, every one for greed : This Church still robs them, wears its purple robes, Prays at the public corners of the streets, Nor even the outside of the platter cleans. And what thinks Jesus of it?— if, indeed, He from beyond can look into their hearts, Who call upon his name and preach of Peace. Foul hypocrites, who feed their hungry flocks With husks of dogmas and dead chaff of talk, And trample virtue down into the mire. I ask myself, Do these men ever think Or weigh their master’s teaching, practice, words, That thus by rote, like empty formulas, They gabble them, as senseless parrots talk. Doctrine and life to him were one. To these Doctrine from life is utterly divorced. Whatever Jesus was, this Church, these men, Are none of his,—or ours; his words alone They worship like a fetish, without sense,— His real inner teaching they reject; Nay, are afraid to look it in the face And seek its meaning, lest it come to this, That they must choose between the things he would, And what they covet dearer than their life. Jew as I am, in view of them, at times I long to see some real Christian sect Ready to take the system that he taught, And try it in this world,—not talking Peace, Good-will to men, Love, Justice, Charity, But living it in very deed,—a sect That should abjure all individual greed, All competition for a selfish end, And joining, make one common purse for all, As Jesus did among his followers. Would it succeed? Ah, you and I are Jews; Jesus has no authority with us. But were we Christians, and not hypocrites,— Did we believe that he was really God, Or even that his mission was divine,— How should we dare to gloss his teachings o’er, And twist his doctrines so that they should fit Our worldly needs, and in the very face Of his plain orders seek some verbal trick To warp them to the life we like to lead! The Eternal One must needs look down and smile At these base wrigglings of His creatures here, Filled with sad pity, too, at their offence,— Seeing them do, with His name on their lips, All He forbids, and dreaming none the less They only shall be saved,—all others damned. Would Jesus’ plan succeed? The world thus far Has taken another path,—we most of all,— Believing not in him, nor in his scheme;— But dreaming—shaking, as it were, from me All usages and habits of the world, At times I stretch my mind out in the vague, And seek upon this plan to build a world. No property, but that which all should own With equal rights,—the product of all work Held for the common good in trust for all; All, to the lowest, to be clothed, fed, housed, Freed from necessity and from the wolf Of hunger, and the pains and pangs of life; Each having claims on all to do the task Best fitted for his powers, tastes, happiness; Each as a duty bound to do his share, And not to be a drone within the hive. What glory might the world then see!— what joy! What harmony of work! what large content! What splendid products of joint industry! All toiling with one purpose and one heart; No war, no waste of noble energies,— But smiling peace, the enlarging grace of art; Humanity a column with its base Of solid work, and at its summit crowned With the ideal capital of Love! This is a dream that turns this world of ours Quite upside down;— I’ll say no more of it. And yet one word more, lest you deem me fool! Think not I dream : none but a fool could dream Equality of rights,—that is, the claim To justice, life, food, freedom in the bound Of common benefit, involves the claim To equal virtues, powers, intelligence,— Since God in these unequal shaped us all, And fitted each one for his special end. So should the wise, just, virtuous take the lead, Or all at once is lawless anarchy; For what more fatal, hopeless, than a scheme Where wise and good, and fool and knave alike, Own equal powers and rights in government? But how secure the leadership to those Whom God hath made for leaders? Ah, my friend, That is the question none hath e’er resolved; For liberty, at best a negative— Mere freedom from restraint—engenders soon Licence and tyranny,—dire positives; Just as Aurelius, best of emperors, Begot for son the cruel Commodu Danger on all sides threatens government. Choose you a king,—the very best is weak,— And fierce temptation dogs the path of power. Choose you the Demos,—it perchance is worse; For then, as in an agitated sea, The frothiest ever to the surface swims. Caprice, rage, panic, interest, sway the mob; Justice is overstormed, wisdom lies low, And noisy ignorance, swollen by the breath Of blatant demagogues, wrecks the lost state. Why?— But because the eager lust of men, The godless strife of utter selfishness, Makes of the world a blind and brutal herd, All crowding on, devoid of common aim,— Each goring his own way to make his path. Well, seeing this, and how these blundering schemes Beget a brood of sin and misery, Said Jesus to his followers : All is wrong; Let it be all reversed,—such life is hate; But God is love: try love, then, for your scheme,— Try God’s law;— as the Book of Wisdom saith, “ All hatred stirreth strife; but love hath power To cover up all sins;” and yet again : “He who his neighbour scorneth, sins but he; Is happy who hath mercy for the poor.” “ The profit of the earth is made for all, And riches breed disease and vanity.” So saith the preacher, just as Jesus said. Nothing was new in Jesus’ scheme but this,— To make community a fact—no dream.* But new or old, his followers obeyed, Accepting what he taught. Their life was pure,— They craved no gains, abjured all private wealth; Preached poverty, and practised what they preached; And then, with stealthy step and half-veiled face, Pride entered, and ambition; and they shaped That fair community into the thing Now called a Church, and on its altar raised The same false idol he had driven forth; And now what is this Church so called of Christ? The last and even the most hideous shape Of tyranny—that spawns upon the world As love’s true offspring the foul serpent brood Of superstition, bigotry, and hate. Thus looking on, and striving as I can To keep my mind wide open to new thought, I weave my dream of what the world might be,— A vague wild dream, but not without its charm. * And scarcely this, say I, Ben Israel— Commenting on this letter. We of old Among the patriarchs ever practised it. And well it worked, till, into cities packed, Men grew ambitious, greedy, void of God, And then confusion came to one and all. The greed of riches is the curse of man : Virtue and wisdom only, hand in hand, Have any rightful claims to power; the wise, The good, in every age affirm the same,— Solon, Confucius, Plato, Thales, all. “ Flee greed, choose equal rights,” Menander says. When Greece made question of her wisest men What is the best form of all government, Thales replied, “ Where none are over-rich, None over-poor;” and Anacharsis said, “ Where vice is hated—virtue reverenced.” So Pittacus— “ Where honours are conferred But on the virtuous;” and Solon, too, In thought, if not in words, like Jesus spoke,— “ Where any wrong unto the meanest done Is held to be an injury to all.” So also Solomon,— “ Remove me far. From vanity and lies; and give to me Nor poverty nor wealth. Blessed is he Who for the poor and needy giveth thought : The Lord shall help him in his time of need.” Since nothing in our Law forbids to us The trial of this scheme, suppose we Jews— (Nay, do not smile)—suppose we very Jews Go on and do even this, the Christians’ work : They will not do it,—oh, be sure of that! No more of this : oh, my Jerusalem!— Thou whom again we shall rebuild in power— Let Justice be thy strong foundation-stones, And Love the cement that shall knit them close. Firm in our Faith—at last—at last, O Lord! When we have suffered to the bitter end, Thy chosen people Thou wilt lift again, And sweep Thy enemies before Thy path. Come not to Rome,—it is the sink of vice : Its grandeur is decayed; its splendid days Are faded. Famine, War, and Pestilence— Tempest and inundation and fierce hordes— Have o’er it swept, with ruin in their track. The herdsman tends his flocks upon the Hill Where Manlius drove the Gauls. The Capitol Scarcely exists in name : its temples proud Are wrecked and ruined. In the Forum herd Horned cattle; and beyond the Flaminian gate, Where once triumphant swarmed the crowds of Rome, Spreads a flat marsh, o’ergrown with rustling canes, Where flocks of whirring wild-fowl make their home. Death haunts the temples, once so full of life. Life crowds the tombs where the dead Cæsars lie, And fortifies their wrecks for deadly feud. The arts have perished. Prone upon the earth Lie shattered the proud statues of their gods, While the rude builder breaks them with his pick, Or burns them into lime. The games are o’er; The streets are filled with ruffian soldiery, Quick at a quarrel; and the deadly knife Of treachery stabs the unsuspecting foe. Upon the Castle every week are seen Black corpses, nailed along the outer walls. The city throngs at night with bravos hired, Who after murder find a safe retreat In many a priestly palace. In a word, Rapine and murder, rape and parricide, Ay, ev’ry crime, with or without a name, Ravage the city. Justice, with sad face, Weeping, hath fled, and Mercy’s voice is dumb. Is this the reign of Christ—or Belial? Yet still I linger here : I scarce know why. There is a charm that, all beyond my will, Allures me, holds me, will not let me go. ’Tis not indeed like our Jerusalem; Yet in its age, its sorrows and its wrongs, It is allied to her,—a city sad, That, like a mourner weeping at a tomb, Sits clad in sackcloth, grieving o’er the past, Hoping for nothing, stricken by despair. Sad, lonely stretches compass her about With silence. Wandering here, at every step We stumble o’er some ruin, once the home Of happy life; or pensive, stay our feet To ponder o’er some stern decaying tomb, The haunt of blinking owls. Nor all in vain Doth kindly nature strive to heal the wounds Of Time and human rage : with ivy green, With whispering grasses, reeds, and bright-eyed flowers, Veiling its ruin; and with tremulous songs Of far larks hidden in the deep blue sky, Lifting the thoughts to heaven. Here many a day Alone I stray, and hold communion sad With dreams that wander far on boundless ways Of meditation vague, recalling oft The passages of Prophets in our Land. At times Isaiah seems to speak, and say To Rome, as once unto Jerusalem : “ Judah is fallen, ruin hath involved Jerusalem. What mean ye that ye beat My people into pieces? that ye grind The faces of the poor? The Lord shall take The bravery of thy ornaments away; Thy men shall perish by the sword in war; Thy mighty ones shall perish, and thy gates Lament and mourn; and thou, being desolate, Shalt sit upon the ground. Woe unto them That draw iniquity with the weak cords Of vanity, and call the evil good,— Their roots shall be as rottenness, like dust Their blossoms perish,—for they cast away : The Lord’s law, and despise his Holy Word.” And then in sorrow for this grievous fate In which we are plunged, I comfort me with this— That He, the Eternal One, hath promised us That we at last shall from our sorrows rest, And from our fear, and from our bondage dire, And build again our new Jerusalem. And yet once more. Hear Jeremiah speak : “How doth the city solitary sit That once was filled with people! How is she Become a widow, that among the powers Was great, and princess in the provinces? She weepeth sorely in the night; her tears Are on her cheeks; and of her lovers none Will comfort her.” Ah, my Jerusalem! Thy sister here is Rome, and sins like thee, And she shall suffer also like to thee. As she hath suffered for her heathen pride And worship of false gods, and now is cast Headlong to earth with all her temples proud, So shall she suffer in the time to come For all her violence and worldly lust, And all her utter falseness to her faith. Is there no place upon this wretched earth Where God shall have His own, and peace shall reign? Is there no spot the devil doth not own? Shall we, poor human wretches, ever seek To thwart God’s law, and rear up in His stead Base idols, and make covenant with Death? Such thoughts come over me, oppressed and sad, As ’mid Rome’s ruined tombs I meditate, Feeling how transient a thing is man, Whose life is but a shadow on the grass That comes and goes, and like a passing wind, Or like a voice that speaks and vanishes. And sitting silent under the blue sky That broods unchanging on the change below, Idly I watch the drooping ivy swing Through sunlit loops of arching aqueducts, Printing its wavering shadow on the sward. Or, as my eye runs down their lessening lines, Broken by gaps of time and war, and swing Along the far Campagna’s rolling stretch Like vertebrae of some huge skeleton, I ponder o’er the past of Rome,—the pomp, The pride, the power, the ruin,—masters, slaves, Conquerors and victims, even the gods themselves, Shattered and fallen and equal in the dust— And silent nature calmly moving on, Heedless of them, and what they were or did, As it will be of us, when we are gone. Often, again, with scarce a conscious thought,— My spirit wandering vaguely, who knows where?— I gaze upon the cloud-shades trailing slow Or the deep chasms of the opaline hills, And drift with them through some abyss of space, And feel the silence sink into my soul. At times a rustling starts me, and I see Some long-haired goat, that, mounting up to crop A wandering spray, peers down through glass-grey ovens And pausing, stares at me. At times, again, I hear the thud of hoofs upon the grass, And jangling swords, and voices of command, As some armed troop goes galloping along. And then I hide me, knowing that my tribe Are only recognised to be the butt Of mocking words—or scarce more wounding blows. The shepherd, leaning idly on his staff, Alone has kindly words for such as we,— For nature hath subdued him into calm, Uutil he almost seems a part of her. I have seen the Pope, whom in their blasphemy They term God’s Holiness. A fisherman, Like Peter, was his father; and his son, By mock humility and specious ways Veiling his inward self, inly devoured By lust of place, and luxury, and power, Hath mounted in the end to Peter’s chair. Peter was poor and simple at the least,— Honest though ignorant. This Sixtus here, Fourth of his name, his utter opposite,— Luxurious, worldly, fierce, and stained with crime. There are no limits to his low desires;— None to his passions; and he treads us down As if we were the offal of the earth. Last week he gave a banquet that, I think, Poor Peter would have been aghast to see : Tis said it cost some twenty thousand crowns, Shaming Vitellius with its cost and waste. But this is nothing to his other deeds. Little he thinks of carrying out the dream Of which I just have spoken. No! the poor Starve on black bread, and fester in disease, While thus he lords it in’his luxury. Nor are the rich much better off with him : A short month since he pillaged an old man— The Prince Colonna—on some poor pretence;— Robbed him of all his plate, robes, tapestries, Tore him with torture, then lopped off his head; And clothed in wretched rags to mock his rank, Sent back in answer to his mother’s prayers For his mere life—the mutilated corpse! And this is God’s yicegerent on the earth— The head of what they call the Christian Church! Bad as the Christian’s lot is, ours is worse : We are the football and the scorn of all,— Laden with taxes, tributes,—forced to wear An ignominious badge,—banned from the town, And huddled in the Ghetto’s filthy den. No public office may we hold : our oath Avails not in their courts against the word Of any Christian; and now, worse than this, In these last years one degradation more Is cast upon us by this Christian court, Whose creed is, “Love your neighbour as yourself.” We are but beasts that in the Carnival Must race half-naked, clothed but round thie loins, A halter on our necks, as we were dogs,— Insulted, hooted, jeered at by the mob. No one of us is free of this,—or old Or young, whatever be our state,— Elder or priest or child,—it matters not. High ladies, cardinals in purple robes, Ay, even the Pope himself, with all his court, Seated on high, in all their pomp and pride, “ Laugh at us, as we stumble on our course, Pelted with filth, and shake their holy sides, Encouraging the mob that mock at us. But what offends me more than all the rest Is that this usage has debased our tribe,— Bent its proud neck, and forced it to the earth,— Taught us to cringe and whimper, taught us wiles, And driven us at their beck to creep and crawl. We, who were God’s own people,—we must bow Before these Christians : with a smile accept Even their kicks, and humbly give them thanks For our mere life. This stings me to the quick. As for what Christ said, “ Love your enemies; Bless them that curse you, and do good to them,”— This is beyond the power of any man— Beyond my power at least,—I curse them all! I stay my pen here,—for the hot blood boils Within my brain in thinking on these things : I dare not trust myself to write you more. My work is almost done for which I came, And soon I hope to greet your face again, Shaking the dust off from this godless place, With all its rottenness and infamy : Then for my dear Jerusalem again! Greet all my friends,—Rebecca, Ismael, And all your dear ones. Peace be with you all! I count the days till we once more shall meet.
We pressed to greet him at Southampton Pier, Not vouching all his deeds and words com pact Of wisdom; nor that all his censors lacked Judgment and conscience; but to honour in Frere One who feared God and knew no other fear; Who, deaf to Party, dared in every act To face the truth, and wrestle with stern Fact For England’s weal,—ignoring wrath and jeer From Faction’s bondsmen, dull to compre hend The Free, and chapmen in philanthro py Spiced high with slander. Be it enough for me If dear ones, where my dust with dust shall blend, Write o’er it : eleeison ky rie. Whate’er his faults, sir bartle called him friend.
Like spray blown lightly from the crested wave To glitter in the sun, So from my heart love gave These airy fancies to the eyes of a belovëd one. But who shall guess From the blown foam that in the sunbeam shines What secret stores there be Of unsunn’d sea? Ah! how much less The depths of what I feel from these poor broken lines I dedicate to thee!
Lassie wi’ the face sae bonnie, An’ the bricht bewitchin’ ee, Is there, tell me, is there ony Danger I can dare for thee? That I lo’e thee thou mayst know it, But it’s hard for me to bear A’ my love till I can show it By some danger I maun dare!
The mountain-tops above the mist Like summer islands lie — Now we together both were blest If thither we could fly. And you, while at Your feet I sat, Would gaze into the skies; But I would be Content to see Their glory in your eyes.
Winter is it? Summer splendour Never was so fair to see!— All because a maiden tender Gave to-day her heart to me. Heaven a happy lifetime lend her, Long, and from all evil free; For the graces that com mend her Make her life the life of me.
Shout and sing, ye merry voices Of the mountain-forest free! What, but late, were jarring noises Now as music are to me! Earth in bridal bloom re joices, Heaven benignly bends to see! He, beloved of her his choice is, Blest of all the boys is he! Blest of all the world of boys is He that’s telling this to thee! Shout and sing, ye merry voices!— Fill the forest with your glee!
It is the hour when all things rest : The sun sits in the bannered West And looks along the golden street That leads o’er ocean to his feet. Sea-birds with summer on their wing Down the wide West are journe ying, And one white star serenely high Peeps through the purple of the sky. O sky, and sea, and shore, and air, How tranquil are ye now, and fair! But twice the joy ye are were ye If one that’s dead companioned me.
The woodland! And a golden wedge Of sunshine slipping through! And there, beside a bit of hedge, A violet so blue! So tender was its beauty, and So douce and sweet its air, I stooped, and yet withheld my hand,— Would pluck, and yet would spare. Now which were best?— for spring will pass And vernal beauty fly — On maiden’s breast or in the grass Where would you choose to die?
Awake, beloved! it is the hour When earth is fai ryland; The moon looks from her cloudy bow’r, The sea sobs on the sand. Our steps shall be by the dreaming sea And our thoughts shall wander far To the happy clime of a future time In a new-created star! Arise, my fair! a strange new wind Comes kindly down from heaven; Its fingers round my forehead bind A chaplet angel- given. I’ll sing to thee of the dawns to be And the buds that yet shall blow In the happy clime of a future time Which only the angels know!
Dear love, we have left them be hind us! Behind us, and far be low! They will search a month ere they find us In the hill-wood where we go. Listen!... that is the voice of the forest, It is whispering us words of cheer : Ah, my heart, when my heart was sorest, Has often been healed up here! Why do you cling to me, darling, And bury your face in my breast? You may well be at case where the starling Has grown a familiar guest. The forest and the mountain And I are old, old friends, And the wild birds and the fountain And the sky that over them bends; And the friends of my youth and my childhood, Thou maiden of the sea That hidest thy face in the wild wood,— How could they be foes to thee? Look up, my own heart maiden! No foot of man comes here; ’Tis tenantless as Eden Throughout the tranquil year!— But I am nearly for getting Old Philip and his wife : From sunrise to sun setting They lead a simple life. ’Tis sixty years since he brought her To share his board and bed; And they had a son and a daughter — But she is long since dead. And the boy became a soldier And marched to the wars a way : And the old couple grow still older In the wood here where they stay. How brightly your eyes are shining, And but the trace of a tear! With your cheek on my arm re clining, Dear heart, you should have no fear. They sit far up on the mountain Beside their clean-swept hearth, Where the river is only a fountain And heaven is nearer than earth. The goodwife knits her stocking, And Philip should trap the game; But he’s old, so the birds are flocking And the blue hares are quite tame. The mother thinks of her daughter And her hair that outshone the sun; But Philip dreams of slaughter, And of his wayward son. There is none, you know, to ad vise her, Excepting her prejudiced mate. Ah, heaven! the mother is wiser As love is better than hate. So the mother knits and fondles In fancy the flaxen hair, While Philip a sabre handles, And starts in his sleep in his chair. How far to their cottage is it?— A good hour’s climb, I should say : Of course, we must pay them a visit, And they’re sure to ask us to stay. So now, sweetheart, if you’re rested, We’ll farther up the wood : Many a night have I nested Here in the soli tude. It’s grand in the wood in the sun light As the sunlight’s falling now, But I like it too when the wan light Of the moon is on each bough. Look back! she is floating yonder — I saw her between the trees When their fringes were drawn a sunder By the fingers of the breeze. How naked and for saken She shrinks through the blue day- sky! At night, never fear, she’ll a waken And lift her horn on high. Look up through the boles be fore us, And the long clear slanting lines Where the light that shimmers o’er us Is sifted through the pines! It’s a good hour yet till gloaming, And then we’ve Selené’s light; And it’s pleasant this woodland roaming In search of a home for the night. Give me your hand, my darling! We’re safe in the soli tude; In the world beneath us there’s snarling — There’s peace in the mountain wood.
The sweetest flower of latter spring, That only breathes the breath of May; The prettiest finch on painted wing, By dropping acorn scared a way,— My Love is fair and shy as they. A bashful violet of a maid, She trembles at a gust of care; But then she’s fairest when a fraid, Her blue eyes look up in a prayer,— My little Love is good as fair. Once I came back : she sat a lone, Past midnight, in a dusky room; On face and hair the firelight shone — Ah, happy me! when through the gloom I heard her sigh, and knew for whom. Smiling that night, and crown’d with flowers, All eyes but mine my Love had seen; I knew the music of those hours Was witching, but my little Queen Had sigh’d for me, her smiles be tween. I care not if her face be cut To shape of artists’ fanta sies; The light of it is nameless, but Fills all my dreams, and when I rise I follow it to my Love’s blue eyes.
Maidens arise! for the silver stream Is glancing beneath the day’s first beam; The reapers task is not be gun, And the river’s bank is wholly ours; Scarce can we bear the city’s hum, And our frolics ’mid these leafy bowers Will be witness’d only by the sun. Ah! brighter far than the gilded dome, Or the gems and gold of my palace home Are the flowers our footsteps press : Sweet to my ear are the varied chants Of the tufted grove’s inhabi tants; Than rarest perfumes drawn from plants Sweeter the Zephyr’s balmi ness. Still is the stream, the sky is clear, We will leave our gauzy vestments here, The sport of the gentle wind. Detach my crown, and let us brave The murmuring river’s placid wave With tresses uncon fined. Haste! but athwart the morning haze What object meets my doubtful gaze? Look, maidens, look! nor fear — An aged palm, by tempests rent, Down from its desert home is sent, To pay a visit here. No,— if such transient glance may tell, ’Tis Heimus’ bark, or Iris’ shell, Impell’d by breezes mild : No,— ’tis a skiff, where lies at rest, Calmly as on a mother’s breast, A tender, lovely child. He sleeps,—and one might deem the nest, Borne on the changeful wavelet’s breast Contain’d a spotless dove Floating the sport of every wave, Rock’d as if cradled in his grave, So calm the waters move. He wakes! oh hasten, maidens dear! He weeps! what mother without fear Could risk such in nocence? He spreads his arms—the waters— hark! Are rougher—Is a fragile bark Of reeds his sole defence? It is perchance a Hebrew child, Doom’d by my father’s mandate wild To perish from the earth. Sweet babe! I will thy mother be, And thou shalt owe thy life to me, Though not thy birth Thus spoke the Pharoah’s daughter, while Her joyous band beside the Nile, Follow’d her motions wild : Fairest of all she doff’d her dress, And in her native loveli ness Appear’d Old Ocean’s child. The water ripples o’er her feet, As acting on the impulse sweet, She touch’d the limpid tide. The ark seh seizes,—O’er her brow, Pleased with her burden, came a glow Of purity and pride. Parting the wave the tangled reeds di splacing, She gently steps, the rescued infant placing On the damp strand; While one by one, touch’d by his helpless ness, A kiss upon his snowy brow to im press Advanced the maiden band. Woman! who for thy child hast fondly craved Thy God’s protection, see him saved Nor strive thy joy to smother : Approach, embrace thy Moses—neither tears Nor transport will betray thy fears, Iphis is not a mother. Then, when the maid elate and trium phing Carried the boy before the dreaded king With all but mother’s feeling, Thus sang the choir of angels, high a bove Veiling with wings of snow their looks of love Their Maker’s praise re vealing : Weep no more, Jacob, in this land of woe, Increase not with thy tears the sluggish flow Of Nile, hasten to Jordan’s strand. The day arrives, when Goshen’s land shall see (Spite of the hostile ranks) both blest and free The captive band. “ A feeble infant floating on the surge, Chosen of God, and by His power a scourge, Was rescued from the wave. Ye that deny your God, from this be taught — That as a babe for ancient Israel fought, A Babe the world shall save.”
Far in the purple time, e’er pain Had yet commenced her ancient reign — That time which never comes a gain — I met a Palmer on the way, “ Oh, wretched youth, in evil day I find thee, ” cried that pilgrim grey. “ Thy love is dead : upon her lie The snowy cerements, round her cry The weeping crowd; I saw her die. “ A thousand knights without com pare, A thousand maidens call her fair, A thousand lilies deck her hair. “ Her golden hair with halo crown’d —” I heard, and fell upon the ground, And saw no sight and heard no sound. Then, where she lay, I came and cried, “ Oh! dearest dear, here let me bide, Here sleep for ever by thy side.” A voice came from the little hill Of earth, “ O love, be constant still, Such is the pleasure of my will. “ Go, gather glory in the right : A soul that dwells in love and light Shall watch thee in the darkest night; “ And like a bird upon her nest Shall brood above thee in thy rest, And at the last shall make thee blest.”
She is right weary of her days, Her long lone days of dusty kneeling; And yet “ The thoughts o’ you,” she says, “ Has took away my tired feeling. “ For when I’ve done the room,” she says, “ And clean’d it all from floor to ceiling, A-leaning on my broom,” she says, “ I do have such a tired feeling!” But he, the other labou rer, Has left behind his moorland shieling, And comes at last to comfort her, Because he knows her “ tired feeling.” “ I know’d you was to come,” she says, “ For why? I see’d the swallows wheeling; And that’s a sign to me, I says, “ I soon shall lose my ‘ tired feeling.’ “ I’ll ax my Missis leave, I says; I canna work; my heart wants healing : She give it me, and smiles and says, ‘ Well, that’ll cure your tired feeling.’ “ And so it will! For days and days I’m strong again, and fit for kneeling; The thoughts o’ seeing you,” she says, “ Has took away my tired feeling.”
He slandered Mabel, then I smote The knave upon his loathsome face. I was her husband; how they sneered To see me champion her dis grace! I bore her clinging to my breast, The cowards all around her pressed. He came a golden type of Mars, A mummer’s king barred up in mail Studded with silver rivet- stars, His banner flapping like a sail. His housings were all striped and spangled, With broidered pearls and rubies tangled. His burgonet was beaten off, This axe soon swept away his crest; My mace struck twice, a ghastly stab Two inches wide gaped in his breast; And, from his vizor beaten in, Blood smeared his cold and sallow skin. And that was how I left the beast Who spat upon my Mabel’s fame; I tore his flag in two, and trod Upon the shield that bore his name. Then spurning praise, and gift, and feast, I mounted for the blessed East.
It is my mother with her raven hair. Her thoughts are with the dead, Are with the lately dead! Gentle ever;- sitting weeps she there, Weeping, weeping;— silent ly ever. There is a band of children romping mad : Amide their gambols wild She marks her only child; Kindly ever;— watching, smiles, tho’ sad, Smiling, smiling,—mournful ly ever. Hark to the jocund bells’ triumphant sweep! She greets the bride in white, Foretells a future bright; Cheerful ever;— kneeling, prays she deep, Praying, praying,—hopeful ly ever. What horrid grief was that I had to show? A tale too often told! My mother, though so old, Truest ever;— clinging, soothes my woe, Soothing, soothing,—tender ly ever. It is my mother with her silvern hair. She was my All on earth; I never knew her worth! Loving ever;— waiting, rests she there, Resting, resting,—peaceful ly ever.
Sitting underneath a tree I build airy castles, While in every cloud I blow Float my fairy vassals, Dancing round me, dancing round me, Circling in the vapour, Like the midges o’er a pool, Like the boys released from school, Or moths around a taper. Let me preach in playful tone With the due in flation; Pointing morals, sure as fate, To my congre gation. "See this slender rod of clay, White and frail and little, Type of poor mortality, (That Death snaps in cruel play,) Life is no less brittle.” Thin and sharp and winding blue Rise the clouds a bove one, Lingering o’er the preacher’s head (How can such things love one?) Half contemptuously I roll Up my sermon paper, “ Riches, beauty, glory— all ” (Let the words like good seed fall ) “ Vanish like a vapour.”
Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to re move : Oh no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests, and is never shaken; It is the star of every wandering bark, Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken. Love’s not Time’s fool; though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle’s compass come, Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out e’en to the edge of doom. If this be error, and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
And then it seem’d I was a bird That dipt along the silent street. In that strange midnight nothing stir’d, And all was moonlight, still and sweet. By lofty vane and roof and loft, Aloof, aloft, where shadows hung Down ghostly ways that wafted soft, Warm echoes where I sank and sung; And lower yet by flower-set sill, And close against her window- bars, And still the moonlight flowed, and still, The still dew lit the jessamine stars; And oh! I beat against the pane, And oh! I sang so sweet, so clear,— And oh! I sang so sweet, so clear,— Then nearer, nearer—killing near; And back she flung the win dow-rod, The moonlight swept in, like a stream; She drew me to her neck— Oh! God, ’Twas then I knew it was a dream!
Here doth Dyonisia lie. She, whose little wanton foot Tripping (ah! too careles sly!) Toucht this tomb, and fell in to ’t. Trip no more shall she, nor fall. And her trippings were so few! Summers only eight in all Had the sweet child wander’d through. But, already, life’s few suns Love’s strong seed had ripen’d warm. All her ways were winning ones : All her cunning was to charm. And the fancy, in the flower, While the flesh was in the bud Childhood’s dawning sex did dower With warm gusts of woman hood. O what joys by hope be gun, O what kisses kist by thought, What love-deeds by fancy done, Death to deedless dust hath wrought Had the Fates been kind as thou, Who, till now, was never cold, Once Love’s aptest scholar, now Thou hadst been his teacher bold : But, if buried seeds up throw Fruits and flowers; if flower and fruit By their nature fitly show What the seeds are, whence they shoot, Dyonisia, o’er this tomb, Where thy buried beauties be, From their dust shall spring and bloom Loves and graces like to thee.
No echo of man’s life pursues my ears; Nothing disputes this Desolation’s reign; Change comes not, this dread temple to pro fane, Where time by æons reckons, not by years. Its patient form one crag, sole-stranded, rears, Type of whate’er is destined to re main While yon still host encamped on Night’s waste plain Keeps armèd watch, a million quivering spears. Hushed are the wild and wing’d lives of the moor; The sleeping sheep nestle ’neath ruined wall, Or unhewn stones in random concourse hurled : Solitude, sleepless, listens at Fate’s door; And there is built and ’stablisht over all Tremendous Silence, older than the world.
Far, far away, I know not where, I know not how, The skies are grey, the boughs are bare, bare boughs in flower : Long lilac silk is softly drawn from bough to bough, With flowers of milk and buds of fawn, a broidered shower. Beneath that tent an Empress sits, with slanted eyes, And wafts of scent from censers flit, a lilac flood; Around her throne bloom peach and plum in lacquered dyes, And many a blown chrysanthemum, and many a bud. She sits and dreams, while bonzes twain strike some rich bell, Whose music seems a metal rain of radiant dye; In this strange birth of various blooms, I cannot tell Which spring from earth, which slipped from looms, which sank from sky. Beneath her wings of lilac dim, in robes of blue, The Empress sings a wordless hymn that thrills her bower; My trance unweaves, and winds, and shreds, and forms a new Dark bronze, bright leaves, pure silken threads, in triple flower.
Foxes peeped from out their dens, Day grew pale and olden; Blackbirds, willow-warblers, wrens, Staunched their voices golden. High, oh high, from the opal sky, Shouting against the dark, “ Why, why, why must the day go by? ” Fell a passionate lark. But the cuckoos beat their brazen gongs, Sounding, sounding so; And the nightingales poured in starry songs A galaxy be low. Slowly tolling the vesper bell Ushered the stately night. Down-a-down in a hawthorn dell A boy and a girl and love’s de light.
