No one else gets a chance. If she werent so eloquent, she wouldnt be worthy of the gold kylin, said Dai-yu huffily, rising from her seat and walking off as she spoke. Fortunately no one heard her but Ban-chai, who made a laughing grimace, and Bao-yu, who immediately regretted having once more spoken out of turn, but who, suddenly catching sight of Bao-chais expression, could not help laughing himself. Seeing him laugh, Bao-chai at once rose from her seat and hurried off to joke with Dai-yu. When youve finished your tea and rested a bit, said Grandmother Jia to Xiang-yun, you can go and see your married cousins. After that, you can amuse yourself in the Garden with the girls. Its nice and cool there. Xiang-yun thanked her grandmother. She wrapped up three of the rings again, and after sitting a little longer, went off, attended by her nannies and maids, to call on Wang Xi-feng. After chatting a while with her, she went into the Garden and called on Li Wan. Then, after sitting a short while with Li Wan, she went off in the direction of Green Delights in quest of Aroma. Before doing so, however, she turned to dismiss her escort. You neednt stay with me any longer, she said. You can go off now and visit your relations. Ill just keep Fishy to wait on me. The others thanked her and went off to look for various kith and kin, leaving Xiang-yun alone with Kingfisher. Why arent these water-lilies out yet? said Kingfisher. It isnt time for them yet, said Xiang-yun. Look, theyre going to be double-decker ones, like the ones in our lily-pond at home, said Kingfisher. Our ones are better, said Xiang-yun. Theyve got a pomegranate-tree here which has four or five lots of flowers growing one above the other on each branch, said Kingfisher. Thats a double-double-double-decker. I wonder what makes them grow like that. Plants are the same as people, said Xiang-yun. The healthier their constitution is, the better they grow. I dont believe that, said Kingfisher with a toss of her head. If that were so, why dont we see people walking around with one head growing on top of the other? Xiang-yun was unable to avoid laughing at the girls simplicity. Ive told you before, you talk too much, she said. Lets see how can one answer a question like that? Everything in the world is moulded by the forces of Yin and Yang. That means that, besides the normal, the abnormal, the peculiar, the freakishin fact all the thousands and thousands of different variations we find in thingsare caused by different combinations of Yin and Yang. Even if something appears that is so rare that no one has ever seen it before, the principle is still the same. So according to what you say, said Kingfisher, all the things that have ever existed, from the time the world began right up to the present moment, have just been a lot of Yins and Yangs. No, stupid! said Xiang-yun. The more you say, the sillier you get. Just a lot of Yins and Yangs indeed! In any case, strictly speaking Yin and Yang are not two things but one and the same thing. By the time the Yang has become exhausted, it is Yin and by the time the Yin has become exhausted, it is Yang. It isnt a case of one of them coming to an end and then the other one growing out of nothing. Thats too deep for me, said Kingfisher. What sort of thing is a Yin-yang, Id like to know? No ones ever seen one. You just answer that, Miss. What does a Yin-yang look like? Yin-yang is a sort of force, said Xiang-yun. Its the force in things that gives them their distinctive forms. For example, the sky is Yang and the earth is Yin water is Yin and fire is Yang the sun is Yang and the moon is Yin. Ah yes! Now I understand, said Kingfisher happily. Thats why astrologers call the sun the Yang star and the moon the Yin star. Holy name! said Xiang-yun. She understands. Thats not so difficult, said Kingfisher. But what about things like mosquitoes and fleas and midges and plants and flowers and bricks and tiles? Surely you are not going to say that they are all Yin-yang too? Certainly they are!
Sorry! I forgot. Wont do it again. The girl feels blest -5947 said Nuageuse, Her young mans rich and beautifully dressed. The girls content Shes been performing in a big event. Next Nuageuse sang her song -1152 A flower began to open in the month of May. -1008 Along came a honey-bee to sport and play. He pushed and he squeezed to get inside, But he couldnt get in however hard he tried. -1152 So on the flowers lip he just hung around, -1460 A- playing the see-saw up and down. -980 Oh my honey-sweet, Oh my sweets of sin, If I dont open up, How will you get in? After drinking her pass cup she picked up a peach So bonny blooms the peach-tree-o? It was now Xue Pans turn. Ah yes, now, lets see! I have to say something now, dont I? The girls upset But nothing followed. All night, whats 8he upset about then? said Feng Zi-ying with a laugh. Buck up! Xue Pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his eyes seemed about to pop out of his head. After glaring fixedly for an unconscionable time, he said The girls upset He coughed a couple of times. Then at last it came The girls upset Shes married to a marmoset. The others greeted this with a roar of laughter. What are you laughing at? said Xue Pan. Thats perfectly reasonable, isnt it? If a girl was expecting a proper husband and he turned out to be one of them, shed have cause to be upset, wouldnt she ? His audience were by now doubled up. Thats perfectly true, they conceded. Very good. Now what about the next bit? Xue Pan glared a while very concentratedly, then The girl looks glum But after that was silence. Come on! said the others. Why was she glum? His dads a baboon with a big red bum. Ho! Ho! Ho! Pay the forfeit, they cried. The first one was bad enough. We really cant let this one go. The more officious of them even began filling the sconce-cups for him. But Bao-yu allowed the line. As long as it rhymes, he said, well let it pass. There you are! said Xue Pan. The M. C. says its all right. What are the rest of you making such a fuss about? At this the others desisted. The next two are even harder, said Nuageuse. Shall I do them for you, dear? Piss off! said Xue Pan. Dyou think I havent got any good lines of my own? Listen to this The girl feels blest In bridal bower she takes her rest. The others stared at him in amazement I say, old chap, thats a bit poetical for you, isnt it? Xue Pan continued unconcernedly The girls content Shes got a big prick up her vent. The others looked away with expressions of disgust. Oh dear, oh dear! Hurry up and get on with the song, then. One little gnat went hum hum hum, Xue Pan began tunelessly. The others looked at him open-mouthed What sort of song is that? Xue Pan droned on, ignoring the question Two little flies went bum bum bum, Three little Stop! shouted the others. Sod you lot! said Xue Pan. This is the very latest new hit. Its called the Hum-bum Song. If you cant be bothered to listen to it, youll have to let me off the other thing. Ill agree not to sing the rest of the song on that condition. Yes, yes, well let you off, they said. Just dont interfere with the rest of us, thats all we ask. This meant that it was now Jiang Yu-hans turn to perform. This is what he said -2647 The girls upset Her mans away, she fears he will forget. -2647 The girl looks glum So short of cash she cant afford a crumb. -2647 The girl feels blest Her lampwicks got a lucky crest. -2647 The girls content Shes married to a perfect gent Then he sang this song A mischievous bundle of charm and love, Or an angel come down from the skies above? Sweet sixteen And so very green, Yet eager to see all there is to be seen. Aie aie aie The galaxys high In the roof of the sky, And the drum from the tower Sounds the midnight hour, So trim the lamp, love, and come with me Inside the bed-curtains, and you shall see!
He will be all right presently. Grandma wants someone to play dominoes with, said Bao-yu to Bao-chai. Why dont you go and play dominoes? Oh, is that what I came for? said Bao-chai but she went, notwithstanding. Why dont you go? said Dai-yu. Theres a tiger in this room. You might get eaten. She said this still bending over her cutting, which she continued to work away at without looking up at him. Finding himself once more ignored, Bao-yu nevertheless attempted to remain jovial. Why dont you come out for a bit too? You can do this cutting later. Dai-yu continued to take no notice. Falling to get a response from her, he tried the maids Who told her to do this dress-making? Whoever told her to do it, said Dai-yu, it has nothing whatever to do with Master Bao. Bao-yu was about to retort, but just at that moment someone came in to say that he was wanted outside, and he was obliged to hurry off. Dai-yu leaned forward and shouted after him Holy name! By the time you get back, I shall be dead. Outside the gateway to the inner quartets Bao-yu found Tea-leaf waiting. Mr Feng invites you round to his house, said Tealeaf. Bao-yu realized that this must be in connection with the matter Feng Zi-ying had spoken of on the previous day. He told Tealeaf to send for his going-out clothes, and went into his outer study to wait for them. Tealeaf went back to the west inner gate to wait for some-one who would carry a message inside to the maids. Presently an old woman came out Excuse me, missus, said Tealeaf. Master Bao is waiting in the outer study for his going-out clothes. Could you take a message inside to say that lie wants them? your mothers twat! said the old woman. Master Bao lives in the Garden now. All his maids are in the Garden. What do you want to come running round here for? Tealeaf laughed at his own mistake. Youre quite right. Im going cuckoo. He ran round to the gate of the Garden. As luck would have it, the boys on that gate were playing football in the open space below the terraced walk, and when Tealeaf had explained his errand, one of them ran off inside for him. He returned after a very long wait, carrying a large bundle, which he handed to Tealeaf, and which Tealeaf carried back to the outer study. While he was changing, Bao-yu asked for his horse to be saddled, and presently set off, taking only Tealeaf, Ploughboy, Two-times and Oldie as his attendants. When they reached Feng Zi-yings gate, someone ran in to announce his arrival, and Feng Zi-ying came out in person to greet him and led him inside to meet the company. This comprised Xue Pan, who had evidently been waiting there for some time, a number of boy singers, a female impersonator called Jiang Yu-han and a girl called Nuageuse from the Budding Grove, a high-class establishment specializing in female entertainers. When everyone had been introduced, tea was served. Now come on! said Bao-yu, as he picked up the proffered cup of tea. What about this lucky accident you mentioned yesterday? Ive been waiting anxiously to hear about it ever since I saw you. Thats why I came so promptly when I got your invitation. Feng Zi-ying laughed. You and your cousin are such simple soulsI find it rahver touchin! Afraid it was pure invention, what I said yesterday. I said it to make you come, because I fought that if I asked you outright to come and drink wiv me, youd make excuses. Anyway, it worked. The company joined in his merriment. Wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them. Feng Zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them then he called on Nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn. Xue Pan, by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him, was already beginning to be obstreperous. He seized Nuageuse by the hand and drew her towards him If youd sing me a nice new song - one of your specials, Id drink a whole jarful for you. How about it, eh? Nuageuse had to oblige him by taking up her lute and singing the following song for him to her own accompaniment Two lovely boys Are both in love with me And I cant get either from my mind.
You should be begging for mercy right now, not swearing at me. Youre not worth killing, though. Ill just give you a little lesson. He picked up his horsewhip and turning Xue Pan on his face once more, proceeded to deal him thirty or forty cuts along the length of-his body, from his shoulders down to his calves. Xue Pan was by now half sober, and finding the pain unbearable, began to roar. Look at you! said Xiang-lian contemptuously. I should have thought you could take your medicine a bit better than that. He took him by the left leg and dragged him a few steps to where the reeds began, in the stagnant ooze of the dyke, so that he was coated from head to foot with the liquid mud. Now, he said, do you know who I am? As Xue Pan merely lay in the mud whimpering and made no reply, he threw away his whip and gave him a few thumps with his fist. Xue Pan rolled about and bellowed Youve broken my ribs. I know youre straight. It was the others who told me you werent. I shouldnt have listened to them. Leave the others out of this, said Xiang-lian. Im talking about now. Now? said Xue Pan. Now I know youre straight. I kn6w I was wrong. What more can I say? Youll have to talk a bit prettier than that before Ive finished with you, said Xianglian. Old pal Xue Pan began, whimpering. Xiang-lian dealt him another thump with his fist. Ow! Ow! Chap Two thumps this time. Ow! Ow! Sir, then. Please sir, forgive me for being so blind. From now on I shall honour you and fear you. -294 Now drink some of this water, said Xiang-lian. Xue Pan knitted his brows with disgust But this water is really filthy. I couldnt get it down. Xiang-lian raised his list threateningly. Ill drink, said Xue Pan hurriedly. Ill drink. He bent down and drank a mouthful of the water at the base of the reeds but before he could swallow it, there was a great retching noise and he vomited up all that he had recently eaten and drunk. Filthy pig! said Xiang-lian. Now eat that up and I let you off Xue Pan began kotowing to him. Please, for your souls sake, earn a bit of merit dont try to make me do that! I couldnt do that if you -killed me. This stench is poisoning me said Xiang-lian and leaving Xue Pan, he unfastened his horse, led it off a few paces, vaulted into the saddle, and galloped away. Observing with relief that Xiang-lian had really gone, Xue Pan, cursing his folly for having been so egregiously mistaken in his man, attempted to struggle to his feet but every part of him was hurting so much that it was impossible for him to rise. -347 Meanwhile, back at the party, Cousin Zhen and the others, suddenly noticing that the two of them were missing, sought them for a while without success. Someone did say that they thought they might have gone out of the North Gate but Xue Pan had told his pages not to follow him, and they were all in such dread of their master that none of them dared go out there to look. In the end Cousin Zhen became so uneasy that he sent Jia Rong with some of the boys to track them down. Their trail led them through the North Gate and about two thirds of a mile along the road which crosses the bridge outside it. There, suddenly, they caught sight of Xue Pans horse, tied up to one of the trees at the side of a reed-filled dyke. Good! they said. Where the horse is, the rider must be. And all of them went over to where the horse was standing. As they did so, they heard someone groaning among the rushes and there, when they went to look, was Xue Pan, his clothes torn, his face cut and swollen almost beyond recognition, and so besmirched with mud from head to foot that he had more the appearance of an old wallowing sow than of a human being. Jia Rong had little difficulty in guessing what had happened. Slipping from his horse, he ordered the servants to help Xue Pan to his feet. Tireless in the pursuit of love, Uncle I he said cheerfully, while they struggled to do his bidding. This time its led you into the reeds of the marshes. I suppose the Dragon King must have taken a fancy to you and carried you off to be his son-in-law.
I can tell you a way out of this if you want to refuse, said Patience. What? said Faithful. Have a word with Her Old Ladyship and get her to tell him that shes already given you to Mr Lian. Thatll cool his ardour. You too now? said Faithful angrily. Youre a nice lot, I must say! It was your mistress who suggested that the other day. I thought we hadnt heard the last of that. If you dont want either of them, said Aroma, then if you ask me I think your best plan would be to get her to tell him that shes promised you to Master Bao. That would put him off rig ht away! Both embarrassed and-exasperated by these taunts, Faithful rounded on her tormentors with some heat. Youre rotten, both of you, and I hope you both come to bad ends! I thought you were decent sorts who might try to comfort me in my trouble. But even if you dont care, you might at least refrain from treating it as a joke. I suppose you think you dont have to worry about me because your own futures are assured and each of you will end up as chamber wife to the person of your choice. Well, as I see it, things in this world dont always -turn out the way you want them to. I wouldnt be quite so cock-a-hoop if I were you. You might be in for some nasty shocks yourselves. The others saw that they had really rattled her and laughingly did their best to calm her down. Now, now, Faithful, dont take it so much to heart. We three have been like sisters ever since we were little girls. We were only teasing you a bit because theres no one else around. Tell us what plan youve decided on, so that we shant be so worried about you Plan? said Faithful. Ive got no plan. I just shant go to him and thatll be the end of it. Patience shook her head. I very much doubt if it will. You know what Sir Shes temper is like. Its true that he cant touch you as long as youre with Her Old Ladyship but youre not going to be with her all your life, are you? Youll have to leave in the end, and if you fall into his clutches then, youll be in real trouble. Faithful smiled grimly. As long as Her Old Ladyship lives, I shall stay with Her Old Ladyship. And when alls said and done, even when the old dear goes to her rest, there are still the years of mourning. There would be no question of his taking a concubine with his mother just dead. And by the time the period of mourning is overwell, anything might have happened. Ill just have to wait and see. If I get really desperate, I can -always shave my hair off and become a nun or failing that, theres always suicide. I dont mind going through life without a man. Glad to keep myself clean? The other two tittered protestingly. The things you say, Faithful! Have you no shame? Theres not much room left for shame when things have come to this pass, said Faithful. Anyway, if you dont believe me, just wait and see. Lady Xing said just now that she was going to see my parents about this. I wonder if she will. Shell have to go all the way to Nanking if she does! Your parents are looking after the house in Nanking and cant be fetched, said Patience, but they can be got in touch with eventually. And in any case, your elder brother and his wife are here. Its a pity youre a house-born servant and not on your own here like me and Aroma. It makes no odds, said Faithful. You can take an ox to the water, but you cant make him drink. Just because I refuse him, hes not going to kill my parents! While she was talking, her sister-in-law appeared some distance from where they were sitting, walking in their direction. There you are! said Aroma. Theyve evidently found that they cant get in touch with your parents, so theyve already had a word with your sister-in-law. That cow! said Faithful. Shes a regular camel-dealer, that one. Shed just jump at a thing like this! The cow was already upon them, smiling all over her face. Ah, here you are, miss! Ive looked for you everywhere. Come with me. Ive got something to tell you. Patience and Aroma fussed round her, inviting her to sit with them on the rock. No, you young ladies sit down said the woman.
I cant stand the heat, said Bao-chai. I did watch a couple of acts of something, but it was so hot that I couldnt stay any longer. Unfortunately none of the guests showed any sign of going, so I had to pretend I was ill in order to get away. Touch! thought Bao-yu but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh. No wonder they compare you to Yang Gui-fei, cousin. You are well-covered like her, and they always say that plump people fear the heat. The colour flew into Bao-chais face. An angry retort was on her lips, but she could hardly make it in front of company. Yet reflection only made her angrier. Eventually, after a scornful sniff or two, she said I may be like Yang Gui-fei in some respects, but I dont think there is much danger of my cousin becoming a Prime Minister. It happened that just at that moment a very young maid called Prettikins jokingly accused Bao-chai of having hidden a fan she was looking for. I know Miss Baos hidden it, she said, Come on, Miss! Please let me have it, You be careful, said Bao-chai, pointing at the girl angrily and speaking with unwonted stridency. When did you last see me playing games of this sort with anyone? If there are other young ladies who are in the habit of romping about with you, you had better ask them. Prettikins fled. Bao-yu realized that he had once again given offence by speaking thoughtlessly and as this time it was in front of a lot of people, his embarrassment was correspondingly greater. He turned aside in confusion and began talking nervously to someone else. Bao-yus rudeness to Bao-chai had given Dai-yu secret satisfaction. When Prettikins came in looking for her fan, she had been on the point of adding some facetiousness of her own at Bao-chais expense but Bao-chais brief explosion caused her to drop the prepared witticism and ask instead what play the two acts were from that Bao-chai said she had just been watching. Bao-chai had observed the smirk on Dai-yus face and knew very well that Bao-yus rudeness must have pleased her. The smiling answer she gave to Dai-yus question was therefore not without a touch of malice. The play I saw was Li Kui Abuses Song Jiang and Afterwards Has to Say He Is Sorry. Bao-yu laughed. What a mouthful Surely, with all your learning, cousin, you must know the proper name of that play? Its called The Abject Apology. The Abject Apology? said Bao-chai. Well, no doubt you clever people know all there is to know about abject apology. Im afraid its something I wouldnt know about. Her words touched Bao-yu and Dai-yu on a sensitive spot, and by the time she had finished, they were both blushing hotly with embarrassment. Xi-feng was insufficiently educated to have understood all these nuances, but by studying the speakers expressions she had formed a pretty good idea of what they were talking about. Rather hot weather to be eating raw ginger, isnt it? she asked. No one present could understand what she meant. No ones been eating raw ginger, they said. Xi-feng affected great surprise and rubbed her cheek meaningfully with her hand If no ones been eating raw ginger, then why are they looking so hot and bothered? At this Bao-yu and Dai-yu felt even more uncomfortable. Bao-chai was about to add something, but seeing the abject look on Bao-yus face, she laughed and held her tongue. None of the others present had understood what the four of them were talking about and treated these exchanges as a joke. Shortly after this, when Bao-chai and Xi-feng had gone Out of the room, Dai-yu said to Bao-yu. You see? There are people even more dangerous to trifle with than I. If I werent such a tongue-tied, slow-witted creature, you wouldnt get away with it quite so often, my friend. Bao-yu was still smarting from Bao-chais testiness. To be set upon now by Dai-yu as well seemed positively the last straw. But though he wanted to reply, he knew how easily she would take offence and controlled himself with an effort. Feeling in very low spirits, he left the room himself now and went off on his own. It was the hottest part of the day. Lunch had long been over, and in every apartment mistress and maids alike had succumbed to the lassitude of the hour.
Whatever it is, youll only have another day or two to wait, I promise you. Aroma was amused to see her so agitated. Why, whats the matter? Why should you be in such a state about it? Patience dropped her voice even lower. Mrs Lian has already put the money for this months allowances out at interest. Shes waiting for the interest on some of her other loans to pay your allowances with. Its all right for me to tell you this, but whatever you do, dont let anyone else know about it! Aroma laughed. But shes not short of money, shes got plenty. What does she want to go giving herself all this extra worry for? Shes certainly not short of money, said Patience. Just in the few years since she started doing this, the amount she has got out on loan must have grown to several hundred times the original premium. And she doesnt spend all of her own allowance either. Whenever shes got nine or ten taels saved up out of it, she invests them too. Why, just her profits alone after shes deducted the allowances from the interest must be in the region of a thousand taels a year. You and your mistress are a nice pair, I must say! said Aroma. Keeping the rest of us short while you use our money to feather your own nests with! Thats most unfair! said Patience indignantly. Any way, Im sure you cant really be short of money. Not myself, its true said Aroma. In any case, I havent got anything to spend it on. I was thinking more of my young gentleman. I like to keep some by me in case he ever needs any. Look, if youre in urgent need of money, Ive got a few taels put by myself that I can let you have, said Patience. You can have them as an advance on this months allowance, if you like. I dont really need any at the moment, said Aroma, but may I take you up on your offer if I ever do? Of course, said Patience, and left without further ceremony. Outside the courtyard gate a maid from xi-feng was looking for her. The Mistress wants to see you about something. What has she got so urgent that she has to keep pestering me like this? said Patience. Ive just had Mrs Zhu all over me to make me stay and talk to her. Its not as if Id run away. Better ask her yourself, said the girl. It wasnt my idea to fetch you. Cheeky devil! said Patience, and continued on her way. When she got there, however, it was not Xi-feng she found waiting for her, but the old countrywoman she had admitted on a previous occasion as a suppliant, Grannie Liu, with her little grandson Ban-er. They were sitting in the side room on the kang with Zhang Cais wife and Zhou Ruis wife on either side of them, while maids were emptying sacks of jujubes, melons and other farm produce on the floor below. The company rose hurriedly to their feet as Patience entered. Grannie Liu, who recognized her from her last visit, scrambled down from the kang and greeted her at once as Miss Patience without any of the previous times confusion. The family all send their regards, Miss. Theyd have come themselves long since to see you and pay their respects to their Aunt Lian, only theyve been too busy with the farm-work. Anyways, theyve had a good harvest this year, thanks be, and its been a good year for the fruit and vegetables. This here that Ive brought is the first pickings. We didnt like to sell them, because we wanted our first-fruits to go to Mrs Lian and the young ladies. We thought that mayhap eating the rarities of earth and sea every day of their lives they might sometimes tire of delicate food and fancy a bit of plain country stuff for a change. Anyway, there you are! Its a poor gift, but its given with a warm heart! Its very good of you to have brought it, said Patience, and begged her to be seated, sitting down herself as she did so. She invited Zhou Ruis wife and Zhang Cais wife to be seated as well, and ordered one of the junior maids to pour tea. Mesdames Zhou and Zhang chaffed her on her appearance. Youve got the spring in your face, Miss. Your eyes are all red. Patience laughed. I know. I dont drink normally, but today Mrs Zhou and the young ladies got hold of me and just forced it down me. I was made to drink, against my will. Thats why my face is so red. Well I dont know, said Zhang Cais wife.
And see that he gets. some tea. Murmuring a reply, Cousin Zhen himself withdrew, followed by Jia Lian and Jia Rong, and conducted Dr Wang back to one of the gentlemens rooms in the front part of the mansion. Theres nothing seriously wrong with Lady Jia, said Dr Wang when they were seated. She has a slight chill. There is no need for her to take any medicine. A light, simple diet for a day or two and see that she keeps warm. That should be enough. Ill write Out a prescription that you can have made up if she feels like taking something. If not, I should just forget about it. He drank his tea and wrote out the prescription. Just as he was about to leave, the nurse came hurrying in with Xi-fengs little girl in her arms. Doctor, have a look at us too, will you? The doctor went over, took one of the childs hands and supported it on his own left hand while he felt her pulse. Then he felt her forehead and inspected her tongue. Im afraid the young lady is not going to be very pleased with my advice, he said with a smile. A good, cleansing hunger is what she needs. Let her miss a couple of meals. No need for a prescription. I shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bedtime. That should help do the trick. With that he took his leave once more and departed. Cousin Zhen and the other two went back to Grandmother Jias apartment with the prescription and reported what the doctor had said. Then they laid the prescription on the table and withdrew. Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-chai and the rest came out from behind the curtain as soon as the doctor had gone. Lady. Wang sat with Grandmother Jia for a while before returning to her own apartment. The coast was now at last clear for Grannie Liu to come forward and take her leave. You must come again when you have the time, said Grandmother Jia. She ordered Faithful to see her off. I cant see you off myself, she said. Im not feeling too well today. Grannie Liu, having thanked her and said good-bye, followed Faithful out of the room and into a room at the side of the courtyard. Faithful pointed to a large bundle on the kang These are dresses given to Her Old Ladyship by various people over the years as birthday or festival presents, but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by outsiders, theyve none of them ever been worn. Its a shame to keep them, really. She told me yesterday to pick out a few for you to take back with you, either to give away as presents or to wear yourself about the house. In this box here youll find those pastries you wanted. This parcel has got the medicines in you were talking about the other day the Red Flower Poison Dispellers, the Old Gold Anti-Fever Pastilles, the Blood Renewing Elixir Pills and the Easy Birth Pills. Youll find each kind wrapped up separately inside its own prescription. These two little silk purses are to wear. Faithful undid the draw-strings and extracted from each purse a golden Hearts Desire medallion with a device showing an ingot, a writing-brush and a sceptre. She smiled at Grannie Liu mischievously You give me these and keep the purses. Grannie Liu, surprised and delighted as she showed by her many pious ejaculations to be receiving these further presents in addition to what Patience had shown her the night before, seemed eager to accede to this request. Yes, yes, Miss. You keep them by all means. Faithful, who had not intended to be taken seriously, replaced the medallions in their. purses and did them up again. I was only pulling your leg. Ive got lots of these things already. Keep them to give the children at New Year. While she was speaking, a little maid came in carrying a Cheng Hua enamelled porcelain cup, which she handed to Granule Liu. Master Bao said I was to give you this. Well! said Granule Liu as she took the cup from her. Now what do you make of that? Reckon it must be something I did for him in a past life. Those clothes I gave you to change into the other day when you had your bath were mine, said Faithful. If you dont mind taking them off me, Ive got some more like them that Id like to make you a present of. As Grannie Liu made no objection, Faithful got out several more sets of clothing and wrapped them up for her. Granule Lin wanted to go into the Garden to thank Bao-yu and the girls and say good-bye to them she also wanted to take her leave of Lady Wang but Faithful prevented her.
Why should you start being afraid of her all of a sudden? She stamped with impatience. Look at the state my eyes are in I she said. I dont want them all making fun of me again. At that Bao-yu released her hand and she bounded round to the back of the bed, slipping into the rear courtyard just as Xi-feng was entering the room from the front. A bit better now? said Xi-feng. Is there anything you feel like eating yet? If there is, tell them to come round to my place and get it. As soon as Xi-feng had gone, Bao-yu was visited by Aunt Xue, and shortly after that by someone whom his grand-mother had sent to see how he was getting on. At lighting-up time, after taking a few mouthfuls of soup, he settled down into a fitful sleep. Just then a new group of visitors arrived, consisting of Zhou Ruis wife, Wu Xin-dengs wife, Zheng Hao-shis wife, and those other members of the mansions female staff who had had most to do with Bao-yu in the past and who, having heard of his beating, were anxious to see how he was. Aroma came out smiling on to the verandah to welcome them. Youre just too late to see him, ladies, she told them in a low voice. Hes just this minute dropped off. She ushered them into the Outer room, invited them to be seated, and served them with tea. After sitting there very quietly for several minutes, they got up to take their leave, requesting Aroma as they did so that she would inform Bao-yu when he waked that they had been round to ask about him. Aroma promised to do so and showed them out. Just as she was about to go in again, an old woman arrived from Lady Wangs to say that Her Ladyship would like to see one of Master Baos people. After reflecting for a moment, Aroma turned to the house and called softly to Skybright, Musk and Ripple inside. Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so Im going over. Stay indoors and keep an eye on things while Im away. I shant be long. Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wangs apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely pleased when she saw that it was Aroma. You could have sent one of the others, she said. There was no need for you to come and leave him unattended. Aroma smiled reassuringly. Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own. Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted. I have nothing in particular to tell you, said Lady Wang. I merely wanted to ask about my son. How is the pain now? Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him, said Aroma. It was so bad before that he couldnt lie still, but now hes sleeping quite soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was. Has he had anything to eat yet? said Lady Wang. He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent, said Aroma, but thats all he would take. He kept complaining that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum bitters to drink, but of course thats an astringent, and I thought to myself that as hed just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him but after only half a cup of it he said it tasted sickly and he couldnt get it down. Oh dear, I wish youd told me sooner, said Lady Wang. We were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably only get wasted, so I didnt. If he cant manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a few of them to take back with you.
said Xi-feng. If I refused to join your club and spend my money in it, I should be declaring myself in open rebellion against the Prospect Garden Residents Association, and heaven help me then!my life wouldnt be worth living! I shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty, and the first thing I shall do will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the clubs entertainment. I can t write poetryor anything else, for that matterand Im a very common, ignorant sort of person to be joining a poetry club and as for taking on this disciplinary business well, whether I do or whether I dont, I dont suppose therell be much danger of your expelling me once youve seen the colour of my money. The others laughed. Ill open the store-room presently, she continued, and Ill get them to put out anything that looks as if it might be of use for you to have a look at. If you can use it, keep it. Anything youre still short of after that, Ill tell them to buy for you outside. I can get the pongee cut for you straight away. The architects drawing isnt at Lady Wangs, by the way its at Cousin Zhens place. Im telling you this to save you a wasted journey. I can get it for you, if you like then I can have it taken with the pongee to Sir Zhengs gentlemen and ask them to do the sizing for you. Li Wan nodded approvingly. That would be very kind. If youll really do all that for us, we shall have nothing more to say. Come on then, everybody I Lets go home and see what happens. If she doesnt send the stuff we can come back and deal with her later. She began to leave the room as she said this, the cousins following in her wake. I know of only one person who could have stirred all this up, said Xi-feng as they were going, and thats Bao-yu. The mention of his name stopped Li Wan in her tracks. She came back into the room. Id completely forgotten it was Bao-yu that I came about in the first place. He was the one who failed to turn up at our first meeting. Were all too soft to know what to do with him. How do you think we ought to punish him ? Xi-feng thought for a bit. The only thing I can suggest is that you should make him go round to each of your apartments in turn and sweep the floors for you. Yes, yes, said the others, laughing. The very thing! They were just about to leave for the second time when Lai Das mother, old Mrs Lai, came in, leaning on the shoulder of a little maid. Xi-feng and the rest rose to greet her. They begged her to be seated and offered her their congratulations. The old woman sat down on the edge of the kang and smiled round at them with pleasure. The way I see it, since you are our employers, our good fortune is really yours. If it werent for your family, how would the likes of us ever have come by a piece of good fortune like this in the first place? Yesterday when you sent young Sunshine round with those presents, my grandson kotowed upwards. in the doorway to show his gratitude. When will he be leaving to take up his post? said Li Wan. Old Mrs Lai sighed, as though the thought made her melancholy. Oh, I dont concern myself with their affairs. I just let them get on with it. When he came round to me to kotow the other day, I didnt have a good word for him. I said to him, Young man, dont tell me youre a mandarin now, because its just plain ridiculous. Thirty years it is since you were born, I said, and all that time, in actual fact, youve been a bondservant. Yet through the kindness of our Masters you were set apart from the moment you came out of your mothers womb. Thanks to the Masters and your parents, I said, you were taught to read and write like a gentlemans son and fussed over by a parcel of maids and nannies and wet-nurses as if you was some sort of young phoenix. I doubt you know how the word bondservant is written. Youve known nothing but soft living since you were born, I said. You dont know the bitterness your father and your grandfather had to go through. You dont appreciate the generations of hardship that went into the making of a fine gentleman like you. And the money they spent on you, I said nursing you through all the fevers and calamities of youth for you were a sickly, ailing child it would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver Then, when you were twenty, the Master, out of the kindness of his heart, undertook to buy you a place in the Service, so that your future would be assured.
Its a good job Im only your granddaughter-in-law. If Id been your grandson, I should have asked you for her for myself a long time ago. I shouldnt have waited till now, I can tell you! Oh, said Grandmother Jia, laughing. So its all my fault, is it? Of course its your fault, said Xi-feng. In that case I wont try to keep her, said Grandmother Jia. You can take her back with you. Not just now said Xi-feng. In my next life, perhaps. If a good girl in this life, I might be reborn as a man, and I can ask you for her then! Go on, take her with you! said Grandmother Jia. You can give her to your Lian. See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then! -1014 Lian doesnt deserve her, said Xi-feng. All hes fit for is a couple of sad old dumplings like me and Patience! This set everyone laughing. A maid came in to announce someone. Lady Xing, maam. Lady Wang hurried out to meet her. What followed will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 47 In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a hasty getaway HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her. Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithfuls attitude. She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of Grandmother Jias women as she entered the old ladys courtyard. She would have liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late she had already been seen and announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was covered with shame and confusion. By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence might add to Lady Xings embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together, Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence. I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband, she said. I must congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own now why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age? Yet they tell me that you positively encourage his excesses. Lady Xing blushed crimson with embarrassment. I have tried several times to dissuade him, without success. I am sure you must realize that I have acted against my will in this matter. You did what you were told, all the same, said Grandmother Jia sharply. Would you do what you were told if he asked you to kill someone? Just reflect for a moment. There is only your sister-in-law, poor, simple soulshe is always ailing from something or otherto worry about the responsibilities of this household. Its true that she has Lians wife to help her, hut she has so much to do that she hardly knows which way to turnalways putting the rake down to pick up the broom. And I have to cut down on all my activities nowadays. So if there is ever anything that your sister-in-law and Feng have overlooked, Faithful is the only one left to make sure that my needs are attended to. She is a child who notices things. If she sees that I lack something, she will either ask for it herself or have a word with one of the other two and make sure that I get it. Think of all the hundreds and thousands of things there are to be done in this household. If I hadnt got Faithful, how could the other two avoid overlooking something once in a while? So what would you have me do then? Would you expect me to start worrying about all these things myself? Should I have to start calculating what I needed every day and go running off to the other two to ask them for it? Of all the girls Ive ever had, Faithful is the only one left me now who is a bit older and more responsible than the restwho understands my little ways and knows how I like things done. Theres a genuine bond between usfor example, she would never take advantage of our relationship, as some girls would, to ask other people for clothes or money for herself.
She turned once more as she was leaving, this time including Bao-chai in her admonition. And dont you two eat too much, either. Crab is very good to eat, but it isnt very good for you. If you eat too much of it, it will give you stomach-ache. Yes, Grandma. The two girls saw her out of the Garden. When they were back again, they gave orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid but Bao-yu objected. No, dont lay again, he said. We want to get on with the poetry. Put the big round table in the middle with all the food and drink on it so that we can help ourselves when we feel like it and sit where we like. That will be much nicer than having set places. Bao-chai agreed but Xiang-yun reminded them that there were others besides themselves to be considered, and having first ordered a separate table to be laid and some good hot crabs to be selected, she invited Aroma, Nightingale, Chess, Scribe, Picture, Oriole and Ebony to come and sit at it. After that she had a couple of carpets spread out on the ground beneath the cassia-trees at the foot of the rockery and made the old nannies and junior maids sit down on them and eat and drink to their hearts content, insisting that they need only get up to wait on them if they were specially called for. Then she took the list of poem-titles and pinned it to the inside wall of the pavilion. Very original! the others commented when they had finished reading the titles, but went on to express the fear that they might find them difficult to write on. Xiang-yun explained what they had decided about rhymes viz. that there should be no set rhyme-scheme and everyone should be free to choose their own. Now thats what I call sensible I said Bao-yu. I cant stand set rhymes. Dai-yu had a barrel-shaped porcelain tabouret moved up to the verandahs edge, and having selected a fishing-rod for herself, sat leaning on the railing, fishing. Bao-chai sat for some time silently contemplating a spray of cassia she had picked, then, leaning over the railings and idly plucking off the flowerets, dropped them one by one into the water and watched the fish swim up from below and nibble at them with plopping noises as they floated on the surface. Xiang-yun for the most part sat quietly musing, occasionally getting up to look after Aroma and the other maids at the table outside, or to make sure that the people sitting on the carpets were getting enough to eat and drink. Tan-chun stood with Li Wan and Xi-chun in the shade of a weeping willow, watching the water-fowl. Ying-chun sat apart from the rest beneath a flowering tree, stringing jasmine blossoms into a flower-chain with a needle and thread. Bao-yu watched Dai-yu fishing for a bit, then went over and leaned on the railings and talked with Bao-chai for a bit, and finally, after watching Aroma and the other maids eating and drinking at their table, ended up by drinking with them him-self while Aroma shelled a crab for him. Presently Dai-yu put down her fishing-rod, went over to the central table, took up a silver self-service wine-kettle whose surface was carved with a nielloed plum-flower pattern, and, having selected a little shallow, rose-quartz winecup, was just about to pour herself a drink, when a maid observed her and came hurrying up to do it for her. No, let me pour it myself, said Dai-yu. That is half the fun. You get on with your party. So saying, she proceeded to half-fill the tiny receptacle with liquor from the silver kettle. But it proved to be yellow rice-wine, whereas what she wanted was spirits. I only ate a small amount of crab, she said, but it has given me a slight heart-burn. What I really need is some very hot samshoo. We have some, said Bao-yu, and quickly ordered a kettle of special mimosa-flavoured samshoo to be heated for her. Dai-yu took only a sip of it before putting the winecup down again. Presently Bao-chai strolled up and helped herself to the samshoo. She, too, put her cup down after taking only a tiny mouthful of it. Then she moistened a brush with ink, and going over to the list of titles, put a tick over the first one, Remembering the Chrysanthemums, and wrote the word Allspice underneath it.
Good talkers can be very tiresome at times and then I prefer the silent ones. Thats all right then, said Bao-yu. I was going to say my sister-in-law certainly isnt much of talker, yet Im sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good talker were the only thing -that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about. Well now, if were going to start comparing, said Grandmother Jia, I hope your Aunt Xue wont think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best. Aunt Xue laughingly demurred. You mustnt say that. Im sure you cant really mean it. No, no, Im sure she does, Lady Wang hurriedly inter-posed. Ive often heard Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you werent around. Bao-yus contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao-chai and grinned but she turned quickly away and began talking to Aroma. Just-then a servant came to say that lunch over at the mansion was ready, and Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to hurry up and get better and then admonished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her leaning on Xi-fengs arm. Is that soup ready yet? she inquired when they were out of the room. Then, turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for her lunch. Mind you let me know if there is, she said. I have the power to make Fengie treat us to it. Aunt Xue laughed. You shouldnt tease the poor girl! Shes always getting nice things for you. But youre not much of an eater at the best of times. Dont you believe it, Aunt! said Xi-feng. Grannie knows how to tuck in. Shed have eaten me by now if she werent afraid that shed find me a bit too vinegary. This set them all off laughing. Even Bao-yu, in the inner room, had to join in, though it hurt him to do so. Aroma, standing beside him, was helpless with mirth. Mrs Lian really is a caution! Bao-yu took her hand and drew her down beside him. Come! he said. You must be tired. Youve been on your feet for hours. Hey, youve forgotten! said Aroma. While Miss Baos still in the courtyard, you ought to ask her if shell let Oriole come over to do that knotting for you. Yes, said Bao-yu. Im glad you reminded me. He raised his head and shouted towards the window. Cousin Bao! If you can spare her, after youve had your lunch, would you mind sending Oriole here to do some knotting for me Yes, certainly, said Bao-chai, turning back to reply. Ill send her over presently. Grandmother Jia and the others had Stopped to listen. Not having heard properly, the old lady asked what it was, Bao-chai explained. Oh do, my dear! said Grandmother Jia. Do let him have her to do the knotting I If you need someone in her place, I have plenty of free hands in my apartment. Just pick which ever of my maids you like to wait on you. Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were amused. Let her go to him by all means, said Aunt Xue, but there certainly wont be any need of a stand-in. She has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is. They had been walking on as they talked and presently came upon Xiang-yun, Patience and Caltrop picking balsams beside an artificial mountain of rock. Seeing Grandmother Jia and the rest coming, they left off their flower gathering and came forward to join them. Soon the little party emerged from the Garden. Fearing that Grandmother Jia might be fatigued, Lady Wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down for a while in her apartment. The old ladys feet were indeed beginning to trouble her and she nodded in consent. Lady Wang sent a maid on ahead to prepare for her arrival. Aunt Zhao was prudently avoiding Lady Wang for the time being by feigning sick, so of the two concubines it was only Aunt Zhou who came out with the old women-servants and maids of the apartment to welcome Grandmother Jia, holding up the door blind for her to enter and arranging the pillows and back-rest for her on the kang.
The nature of Bao-chais reply will be revealed in the following chapter. CHAPTER 35 Sulky Silver tastes some lotus-leaf soup And Golden Oriole knots a flower-patterned fringe BAO-CHAI heard Dai-yus sarcasm-quite clearly, but her mind was too taken up with her own family affairs to pay much attention, and she continued on her way without looking back. As Dai-yu gazed towards the House of Green Delights, which was at some distance from the flowering tree in whose shade she was standing, she presently observed Li Wan, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun, attended by numerous maids, going into the gate of its courtyard. Then, as she continued to watch, she saw them one by one come out again and go their separate ways. it struck her that Xi-feng had not been with them, and she wondered why. Its not like her not to visit him, she thought. Even if shes otherwise engaged, youd expect her to find some means of getting over and doing her little turn, if only to keep in with Grandma and Auntie Wang. There must be some very pressing reason to keep her away. She lowered her head to reflect. Raising it again and looking once more in the direction of Green Delights, she observed a colourful throng of females just about to enter, and when she looked a little harder, she could make out Wang Xi-feng with Grandmother Jia leaning on her arm. Lady Wang and Lady Xing walked behind them, followed by Aunt Zhou and a large bevy of maids and women servants. As the last of these disappeared inside the gate, Dai-yu nodded wistfully, thinking how good it must be to have a family, and soon her face was once more wet with tears. Presently she saw Aunt Xue and Bao-chai arrive. Not long after she had watched them enter the gate, Nightingale suddenly walked up behind her. Come and have your medicine, Miss, she said. its cool enough to drink now. Whats the matter with you? said Dai-yu. Always fussing! What does it matter to you whether I take my medicine or not? Nightingale laughed good-humouredly. Your coughs only just beginning to get better, and already you want to stop taking your medicine! it may be the fifth month and the weather may be hot, but all the same, you still need to be careful, Come on, youve been standing quite long enough in this early morning damp. You ought to come in now and rest a bit. Now that Nightingales words had recalled her attention to herself, Dai-yu became aware that her legs were in fact rather tired. For a moment or two she appeared rather bewildered, then, taking Nightingales arm, she slowly made her way back to the Naiads House. As they entered the courtyard, the chequered shadows of the bamboos and the dew-pearled moss reminded her of two lines she had read in The Western Chamber A place remote, where footsteps seldom pass, And dew still glistens on the untrodden grass. Its all very well, she thought, as she reflected oh the heroine of that play, Ying-ying may have been unfortunate, but at least she had a widowed mother and a little brother. I have no one. She was about to shed tears once more but just then her parrot, which had been perched aloft under the verandah eaves, seeing that his mistress had returned, flew down with a sudden squawk that made her jump. Wicked Polly! she said. Youve shaken dust all over my head! The parrot flew on to its perch. Snowgoose! it called. Raise the blind! Miss Lin is back! Dai-yu stooped in front of it and tapped its perch. Did they remember your food and water, Polly ? The parrot heaved a long sigh, uncannily like the ones that Dai-yu was wont to utter, and recited, in its parroty voice -1547 Let others laugh flower-burial to see Another year who will be burying me? Dai-yu and Nightingale both burst out laughing. Its what youre always reciting yourself, Miss, said Nightingale. Fancy Polly being able to remember it!, Dai-yu made her take the perch down and hang it up outside the round moon-window of her study. Going indoors she sat down by the moon-window to take her medicine. Light reflected from the bamboos outside passed through the gauze of the window to make a green gloom within, lending a cold, aquarian look to the floor and the -surfaces of the furniture. To keep her spirits up in these somewhat cheerless surroundings she spoke teasingly to the parrot hanging on the other side of the gauze until he jumped and squawked on his perch, after which she taught him a few snatches of her favourite poems.
Wang Jun-xiao. Famous for his diagnoses. The doctor bowed. He was my great-uncle, he said, smiling demurely, but still not daring to raise his head. Grandmother Jia laughed. That makes you a friend of the family. She stretched out an arm and slowly arranged it for him on the pillow. The old women brought up a large stool which they set down in front of her table and slightly to one side. Dr Wang knelt on it, squatting on his heel with one haunch so that he was half-sitting on the edge of the stool, and in that polite but uncomfortable posture proceeded at great length to take the old ladys pulses, first in one arm and then in the other. After that he made another bow and retired, eyes still on the floor, as they had been throughout the consultation. Thank you, said Grandmother Jia as he was leaving. See him out, will you, Zhen? And see that he gets. some tea. Murmuring a reply, Cousin Zhen himself withdrew, followed by Jia Lian and Jia Rong, and conducted Dr Wang back to one of the gentlemens rooms in the front part of the mansion. Theres nothing seriously wrong with Lady Jia, said Dr Wang when they were seated. She has a slight chill. There is no need for her to take any medicine. A light, simple diet for a day or two and see that she keeps warm. That should be enough. Ill write Out a prescription that you can have made up if she feels like taking something. If not, I should just forget about it. He drank his tea and wrote out the prescription. Just as he was about to leave, the nurse came hurrying in with Xi-fengs little girl in her arms. Doctor, have a look at us too, will you? The doctor went over, took one of the childs hands and supported it on his own left hand while he felt her pulse. Then he felt her forehead and inspected her tongue. Im afraid the young lady is not going to be very pleased with my advice, he said with a smile. A good, cleansing hunger is what she needs. Let her miss a couple of meals. No need for a prescription. I shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bedtime. That should help do the trick. With that he took his leave once more and departed. Cousin Zhen and the other two went back to Grandmother Jias apartment with the prescription and reported what the doctor had said. Then they laid the prescription on the table and withdrew. Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-chai and the rest came out from behind the curtain as soon as the doctor had gone. Lady. Wang sat with Grandmother Jia for a while before returning to her own apartment. The coast was now at last clear for Grannie Liu to come forward and take her leave. You must come again when you have the time, said Grandmother Jia. She ordered Faithful to see her off. I cant see you off myself, she said. Im not feeling too well today. Grannie Liu, having thanked her and said good-bye, followed Faithful out of the room and into a room at the side of the courtyard. Faithful pointed to a large bundle on the kang These are dresses given to Her Old Ladyship by various people over the years as birthday or festival presents, but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by outsiders, theyve none of them ever been worn. Its a shame to keep them, really. She told me yesterday to pick out a few for you to take back with you, either to give away as presents or to wear yourself about the house. In this box here youll find those pastries you wanted. This parcel has got the medicines in you were talking about the other day the Red Flower Poison Dispellers, the Old Gold Anti-Fever Pastilles, the Blood Renewing Elixir Pills and the Easy Birth Pills. Youll find each kind wrapped up separately inside its own prescription. These two little silk purses are to wear. Faithful undid the draw-strings and extracted from each purse a golden Hearts Desire medallion with a device showing an ingot, a writing-brush and a sceptre. She smiled at Grannie Liu mischievously You give me these and keep the purses. Grannie Liu, surprised and delighted as she showed by her many pious ejaculations to be receiving these further presents in addition to what Patience had shown her the night before, seemed eager to accede to this request. Yes, yes, Miss. You keep them by all means. Faithful, who had not intended to be taken seriously, replaced the medallions in their.
Suppose I were at fault and you told Her Ladyship and asked her to let you go dont you think youd feel just a tiny bit uncomfortable afterwards when it got about that you had left me because I wasnt good enough for you? Why ever should I? said Aroma. Of course, I wouldnt go if it meant marrying a thief or a murderer. Theres always another way out. I could always take my own life. We all have to die some time or other its just a question of when. All youve got to do is stop breathing, thats all. After that you hear nothing, see nothing - its all over! Stop it, now! Stop it! said Bao-yu, covering her mouth with his hand. You dont have to say things like that. All too familiar with the peculiarities of this master who condemned flattering auspicious talk as false and hollow, but was upset and morose if you told him the truth, Aroma regretted her blunder in having too openly spoken her mind. Smilingly she turned the conversation on to topics which experience taught her were agreeable to him the beauties of Nature, the beauties of girls, girls. But somehow from there the conversation imperceptibly found its way round to the subject of girls dying. Suddenly realizing this, Aromait was she who was talking at the time broke off in alarm. Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence. We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The problem is how to die well. Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that a scholar dies protesting and a soldier dies fighting and get themselves killed off on the assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the only real occasion for protesting is when ones ruler is misguided, and the only real occasion for fighting is when ones country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the soldier so hankers for a heros death that he gets himself killed off in the first encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles? But surely, Aroma interrupted, those famous men in the olden days laid their lives down because they had to? Nonsense! said Bao-yu. The soldiers among them lacked generalship as a consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty then, if the Court didnt immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and promptly get themselves killed. You wont, surely, say that they died because they had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven, and its unthinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal fame and glory. They werent really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at all. Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently decompose there until thewind had picked my bones clean, and after that never, never to be reborn again as a human beingthat would be a really good death. Im sleepy, said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes -and fell fast asleep. By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten. A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Gardens possibilities, and its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved, for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to sing him some of the arias from it.
She stared at them indignantly. Dont do that! she said. Its wicked to waste things like that. But Bao-yu leaped up to her, snatched the fan from her hand, and passed it to Skybright, who at once tore it into several pieces. The two of them, Bao-yu and Skybright, then burst into uproarious laughter. What do you think youre doing? said Musk. Thats my fan youve just ruined. Whats an old fan? said Bao-yu. Open up the fan box and get yourself another. If thats your attitude, said Musk, we might as well carry Out the whole boxful and let her tear away to her hearts content. All right. Go and get it, said Bao-yu. And be born a beggar in my next life? said Musk. No thank you I She hasnt broken her arm. Let her go and get it herself. Skybright stretched back on the bed, smiling complacently. Im rather tired just now. I think I shall tear some more tomorrow. Bao-yu laughed. The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels are well spent. For a few old fans its cheap at the price! He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan, and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool. But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening. -1344 About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in Grandmother Jias room, someone came in to announce that Miss Shi had arrived. Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps to welcome her. For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere months separation is an occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports, when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot, Xiang-yun should remove her Outer garments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused. Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I dont think Ive ever seen anyone wearing so much. Its my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all, said Xiang yun. You wouldnt catch me wearing this stuff if I didnt have to. You dont know our Xiang-yun, Aunt, Bao-chai interposed. Shes really happiest in boys clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yus gowns and put a pair of his boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, Bao-yu, come over here! Youll get the dust from that hanging lamp in your eyes if youre not careful. But Xiang-yun just smiled and didnt move. It was only when everyone couldnt hold it in any longer and started laughing that Grand-mother realized who it was and joined in the laugh. She told her that she made a very good4ooking boy. Thats nothing, said Dai-yu. What about that time last year when she came to stay for a couple of days with us in the first month and it snowed? Grandma and Auntie Wang had just got back from somewhereI think it was from visiting the ancestors portraitsand she saw Grandmas new scarlet felt rain-cape lying there and put it on when no one was looking. Of course, it was much too big and much too long for her, so she hitched it up and tied it round her waist with a sash and went out like that into the back courtyard to help the maids build a snowman. And then she slipped over in it and got covered all over with mud The others all laughed at the recollection. Bao-chai asked Xiang-yuns nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing. I dont mind her being tomboyish, said Ying-chun, but I do wish she wasnt such a chatterbox. You wouldnt believe Iteven when shes in bed at night it still goes on. Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber.
If she cant eat it herself, she can give it to the cat, said Faithful. The old woman put the contents of two of the dishes into a box and carried it off to give Patience. Wheres Candida ? said Faithful. Shes in there eating with the rest, said Li Wan. What do you want her for? Its all right, said Faithful. Nothing. Aroma isnt here, said Xi-feng. Why dont you send her a couple of dishes ? Faithful gave orders for this to be done. She inquired of the remaining old women whether the boxes for the drinking party were ready yet. I think theyll be a while yet, said one of them. Hurry them up a bit, will you? said Faithful, and the old woman went off to do her bidding. The young women, accompanied by Grannie Liu, now went into Tan-chuns room, where Grandmother Jia and the others were chatting and laughing together. This room, a three-frame apartment which Tan-chun, who loved spaciousness, had left undivided, had in the midst of it a large rosewood table with a Yunnanese marble top piled high with specimen-books of calligraphy and littered with several dozen miscellaneous ink-stones and a small forest of writing-brushes standing in brush-holders and brush-stands of every conceivable shape and size. On one side of the table was a bucket-sized pincushion flower-vase of Ru ware stuck all over with snow-white pompom chrysanthemums. On the west wall of the room hung a Landscape in Mist and Rain by Mi Fei, flanked by a pair of scrolls bearing a couplet written by the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhen-qing -576 My heart has discovered true ease amidst the clouds and mists of the mountains My life has gained a fierce freedom from the rocks and torrents of the fells. -347 Against the wall beneath was a long, high table. On it, towards the left, stood a large Northern Song porcelain dish heaped with those ornamental citrus fruits they call Buddhas hands, whose brilliant yellow contrasted agreeably with the green ish blue of the glaze. To the right a white jade chime in the form of a two-headed fish hung in a varnished wooden frame to whose side a tiny hammer was attached. Ban-er, whom growing familiarity was making bolder, was with difficulty restrained from unfastening the hammer and striking the fish with it. He then said that he wanted one of the yellow things to eat, and Tan-chun selected a Buddhas hand from the dish and gave it to him. There you are, she said, but its only to play with. It isnt good to eat. On the opposite side of the room was a large four-poster bed whose silk gauze hangings had a pattern of bright green plants and insects in reversible embroidery. Ban-er ran over to it and began identifying the insects Thats a cricket. Thats a grasshopper Grannie Liu dealt him a hefty slap Little varmint! Who said you could go running around putting your dirty hands on everything? Just because youve been allowed in to have a look, it doesnt mean you have to start getting above yourself. The blow had been hard enough to make him cry, and it took the combined efforts of the others present to comfort him. Meanwhile Grandmother Jia had been looking through the gauze-covered windows into the courtyard behind. Those paulownias by the verandah eaves are still very fine, she remarked. Its a pity theyve begun losing their leaves. A little gust of wind blew across the courtyard as she spoke, bearing on. it a faint strain of music from outside. That must be a wedding, she said. I didnt realize we were so near to the street here. You could never hear the street from here, Mother, said Lady Wang, laughing. Those are our twelve little actresses rehearsing. If theyre going to be playing anyway, said Grandmother Jia, we may as well have them to play in here. It will be entertainment for us and it will make an Outing of sorts for them. Xi-feng at once ordered the troupe to be summoned, and made hurried arrangements for a long table to be brought in, that the actresses could sit down to perform at, and covered with a red rug. Much better put them in Xi-chuns water pavilion, said Grandmother Jia. The music will sound even better coming across the water. Later on when we take our wine we can sit in the downstairs of the Painted Chamber. Its nice and open there and close enough to the pavilion for listening to the music from. Everyone agreed that this would be a good idea.
They arrived in the courtyard of Green Delights to find everything plunged in silence. Xiang-yun went round to the side to see if Aroma was in any of the maids rooms. Dai-yu went up to the main building and peeped through the gauze window into Bao-yus bedroom. She saw Bao-yu, clothed in little else but a thin, rose-coloured shirt, sprawled out asleep on the bed and Bao-chai sitting beside him sewing, with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side. For some moments she goggled incredulously at this touching domestic scene, then, fearful of disturbing it, she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles. When she had somewhat subdued them, she beckoned to Xiang-yun to come over and look. Wondering what extraordinary spectacle could have put her in such a state, Xiang-yun hurried over for a peep. She, too, found the scene inside a comical one and would have burst out laughing but in her case it was the consideration that Bao-chai had always been so kind to her that caused her to control her mirth. And knowing how merciless Dai-yu could be with her witticisms, she took her by the hand and dragged her away, explaining as she did so that she had just remembered that Aroma had said something about going at noon to wash some clothes in the lake. Im sure thats where she will be, she said to Dai-yu. Lets go and look for her there. Dai-yu was not in the least deceived, and showed as much by her sardonic laugh. But she followed her nonetheless. Bao-chai meanwhile continued her sewing undisturbed. She had just completed her second, or maybe it was her third petal, when Bao-yu, who appeared to be dreaming, cried out angrily in his sleep. Why should I believe what those old monks and Taoists say? I dont believe in the marriage of gold and jade. I believe in the marriage of stone and flower. The words astounded her. She had still not recovered from the shock of hearing them when Aroma returned. What, isnt he awake yet? Bao-chai shook her head. I just now ran into Miss Lin and Miss Shi, said Aroma. I suppose they didnt come in here, did they? Not that I know of, said Bao-chai. She glanced up at Aroma with a sly smile Did they tell you anything? Aroma coloured. Oh, a lot of nonsense - as usual I They were only joking, though. They werent joking, said Bao-chai, - not this time. I was going to tell you myself, but you went rushing off before I had a chance to. Just at that moment a maid arrived from Xi-feng summoning Aroma to go and see her. There you are I said Bao-chai. Thatll be what she wants to see you about. Aroma had to arouse two of the sleeping maids to take her place in the inner room then she and Bao-chai left Green Delights together. They parted company outside, and Aroma went off to Xi-fengs place on her own. When she got there she was, as Bao-chai had predicted, formally acquainted with the new arrangements concerning her pay and status that had just been made for her by Lady Wang. She was told that she should go over to Lady Wangs to kotow her thanks, but that there was no need for her to see Grandmother Jia. She found this interview with Xi-feng acutely embarrassing. By the time she got back from Lady Wangs, Bao-yu was already awake. She answered him evasively when he asked her where she had been and waited for the silence and darkness of the night to tell him of her unofficial promotion to his bed. Bao-yu was delighted. I hope therell be no more talk of leaving me now! he said, smiling broadly at her. Do you remember the time when you got back from visiting your family and tried to frighten me with all that talk about your brother wanting to buy you out of service and how there was no future for you here and no point in your staying permanently, and all those other heartless, unkind things you said? Id like to see anyone trying to take you away from me now! Huh! Aroma sniffed scornfully. Thats not at all the way it is. I belong to Her Ladyship now. Now if I want to leave you, I dont have to talk to you about it at all. All I have to do is have a word with Her Ladyship, and off I go! Bao-yu laughed.
How dare you lie to me! She raised her hand and dealt the girl a slap on the cheek that made her reel, quickly followed by a second slap on the other cheek. An angry red patch swelled up instantly on either side of the girls face. Dont, madam. Youll hurt your hand, Patience pleaded. Hit her for me, then, said Xi-feng, and ask her why she ran away. If she still wont talk, tear her lips! At first the maid tried sticking to her story, but when she heard that Xi-feng was going to heat an iron red-hot and burn her mouth with it, she broke down and tearfully confessed that Jia Lian was at home and had stationed her in the passage-way to look out for her mistress and give him warning of her coming hut as Xi-feng had left the party so much earlier than expected, she had been taken unawares. This seemed to Xi-feng to have the ring of truth about it. Why did he ask you to look out for me? she asked. Surely Im allowed to go back to my own room? There must have been a reason. Tell me. If you do, from now on I shall love you and be your friend. But if you dont, I shall take a knife and cut your flesh with it! To reinforce her threat, she plucked a formidable hairpin from her hair and jabbed it violently in the neighbourhood of the girls mouth, causing her to dodge this way and that from it in terror. Ill tell, madam, Ill tell. Only please dont let him know that it was me that told you, she wept and implored. Patience begged Xi-feng not to hurt the girl, at the same time urging the girl to make a clean breast of what she had to say. The story then came out. Mr Lian came in a while ago and had a bit of a nap. When he woke up, he sent someone to see what you were doing. They brought word back that your birthday party had only just started and you wouldnt be back for ages, so he opened the chest and took out two pieces of silver and two hairpins and two lengths of satin and told me to go and give them in secret to Bao Ers missus and tell her to come over. So then she came over to our room and Mr Lian made me go and wait in the passage here and look out for you. And thats really all I know. Xi-feng was by now shaking all over with anger. She pulled herself to her feet notwithstanding and strode off swiftly towards the house. As she approached the gateway of the courtyard, another little maid popped her head out but quickly drew it in again and ran when she saw that it was Xi-feng. When Xi-feng called to her by name, however, this maid, being more quick-witted than the other one, neither went on retreating nor stood still, but simply turned about and came running up to Xi-feng outside, an obsequious little smile upon her face. Oh madam, I was just going over to tell you when I saw you coming here yourself. Tell me what? said Xi-feng. The girl then proceeded to relate voluntarily what the other girl had just told under duress. Xi-feng spat contemptuously. Youve left it a bit late, havent youwaiting until you see me and then trying to act the innocent ? She raised her hand and struck the girl a blow that sent her staggering, then, tiptoeing across the courtyard, applied her ear to the window to hear what was going on inside. The first thing she heard was a laugh and a womans voice. The best thing that could happen to you, it was saying, would be if that hell-cat wife of yours was to die. Suppose she did, Jia Lians voice said in answer, and I married another one who turned out to be just as bad ? If she was to die, said the first voice, you ought to make Patience your Number One. Im sure shed be better than this one. Patience wont let me come near her nowadays, said Jia Lian. She has a lot to put up with, the same as me, that she doesnt dare talk about. I dont know, I reckon I must have been born under a hen-pecked husbands star! Xi-feng heard this shaking with fury. The couples praise of Patience made her at once suspect that Patience had been complaining about her behind her back. The fumes of wine mounted up inside her, clouding her judgement. Without pausing to reflect, she turned and struck Patience twice before kicking open the door and striding into the room. There, without more ado, she proceeded to seize hold of Bao Ers wife and belabour her, breaking off only to block the doorway with her body in case Jia Lian might think of escaping.
Well go back and thank him for me. Tell him its very kind of him and I very much appreciate it. And have the pots taken to my room. When he had given these instructions, he continued with Ebony on his way to Autumn Studio. He arrived to find that Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun and Xi-chun had all got there before him. They laughed excitedly when they saw him enter. Here comes another one! I hadnt realized that I was so popular! said Tan-chun. I wrote to you all more or less on the spur of the moment. It was no more than a tentative suggestion. I had no idea it would meet with this instant response from everybody. Its a pity you didnt think of it earlier, said Bao-yu. We ought to have started a club long ago. Well I dont think its a pity, said Dai-yu. Do, by all means, have a poetry club if youre all so keen to, only count me out of it, please. I dont feel up to it. Ying-chun laughed. If youre not, then what about the rest of us? This is no time for false modesty, said Bao-yu. Here is a serious proposition and one which we are obviously all enthusiastic about. What we need are some ideas that we can all discuss. Come on, Chai! Lets hear what you have got to say first, then perhaps we can hear from Cousin Lin. Whats the hurry ? said Bao-chai. Were not even all here yet. Just as she was saying that, Li Wan arrived. She smiled at them all as she entered. My! What a poetic lot we are! If you are going to have a poetry club, may I propose myself for president? The idea of having one did in fact occur to me earlier in the year, but I thought that as I cant write poetry myself, a proposal coming from me might seem a bit presumptuous, and I did nothing about it. Now that my poetical sister-in-law has had the same idea, I should like to do what I can to help her get it Started. If we are definitely going to have a poetry club, said Dai-yu, then as members of the club we are all equals and fellow-poets. We cant go on calling ourselves cousin and sister-in-law all the time I quite agree, said Li Wan. We ought to choose pennames to sign our poems with, then we can use them for addressing each other by as well. I shall call myself Farmer Sweet-rice. I dont suppose anyone else will want that title. I shall call myself Autumn Studio, said Tan-chun. Thats pretty unoriginal! said Bao-yu. Cant you do any better than that? Youve got all those paulownias and plantain-trees around your place cant you make a name out of them? All right, said Tan-chun. Im very fond of my plantains. I shall call myself Under the Plantains. Thats very original, said the others admiringly. But Dai-yu laughed. Come on, everybody! she said. Pop her in the stew-pot! Well have a nice piece of venison with our wine. As no one could understand this recondite joke, Dai-yu undertook to explain it for them. Under the plantains is where the woodcutter in the old Taoist parable hid the deer he had killed so the allusion means a deer. In calling herself by that pen-name, Cousin Tan is therefore offering herself to her fellow-members as venison for them to feast on in their carousals. Oh, all right, Miss Clever said Tan-chun. Plantain Lover, then. You wait! Ill be even with you yet. Ive got just the name for her, she told the others. When the Emperor Shun died, his two queens are supposed to have gone along the banks of the river Xiang looking for him. According to the legend, the two queens turned into river goddesses and their tears became the spots you find on the bamboos that grow along the banks of the river. Thats why theres a kind of bamboo called Naiads Tears. Well now, Cousin Dai lives in the Naiads House, and she cries so much that I shouldnt be at all surprised if one of these days the bamboos in her courtyard all turned out to have spots on them so I think the best pen-name for her would be River Queen. The others, applauding, agreed that this was exactly the tight name for Dai-yu. Dai-yu herself hung her head and said nothing. Ive thought of one for Bao-chai, said Li Wan.
Is there anything you fancy to eat? said Lady Wang. We can order it for you when we go back presently. I cant think of anything, said Bao-yu, unless I did quite like that soup we had once with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it. Xi-feng, who was standing by listening, gave a crow of laughter. Listen to that, now! What low tastes the boy has! What-ever makes you want to eat that leathery old stuff ? Have it made, have it made! said Grandmother Jia vehemently. Let the boy have it by all means. Dont be in such a hurry, Grannie! said Xi-feng laughing. Im trying to think whos got the moulds that they need for making the little shapes with. She turned and ordered one of the old women in attendance to go and ask the chief cook but though the old woman was a long time gone, she came back empty-handed. Cook says the four moulds for the soup-shapes were handed in some time ago on your instructions. Xi-feng thought for a bit. Yes, I remember now I did get them back from her. But I cant remember who I gave them to. I should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room. She sent someone to the tea-room stewardess but she hadnt got them either. In the end they turned out to be with the plate stewardess, who looked after the gold and silver. Aunt Xue was the first to examine them when they arrived. There were four moulds fitted into a single box. They were made of silver, a foot or so long and about an inch wide. Along the face of each mould were rows of very finely cut dies, each about the size of a bean, thirty or forty on each mould. On one of the moulds the dies were in the shape of chrysanthemums, on another of plum-flowers, on the third of lotus pods and leaves, and on the remaining one of caltrops. Aunt Xue turned to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang with amusement. You people really do think of everything! All these patterns for a bowl of soup! If you hadnt told me, I should never have guessed what these things were for. Xi-feng answered her before either of the older ladies could reply. You wouldnt know about these anyway, Aunt. Its something they thought up last year for Her Graces visit. They cut shapes with these things out of some special doughIm not sure exactly what its made ofand put them in a clear soup. Theres supposed to be a suggestion of autumn lotuses in the flavour, but it doesnt taste very much really. Its certainly not the sort of thing youd want to eat very often. In fact, I think the only time we ever had it was when they made some for the visit. Im surprised he can still remember. She handed the moulds to an attendant woman-servant. Tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other ingredients as theyll need to make ten bowlfuls with. Say its wanted immediately. Why so much? said Lady Wang. I have my reason, said Xi-feng. This isnt the sort of thing one eats every day, and now that Cousin Bao has mentioned it, it seems silly to make it just for him and not let you and Grandma and Auntie Xue taste it as well. So while we are about it, we might just as well do enough of it for everyone. She smiled mischievously. I might even have a taste of it myself. Grandmother Jia laughed. Little monkey! We spoil you! Spending public money on private entertainment, thats what this is! The others all laughed. Xi-feng, quite unconcerned, joined in. Thats no problem, she said. Im sure I can-afford a little treat like this. She turned to the waiting woman Tell the kitchen to use plenty of everything and charge it all up to my account. The woman murmured a reply and went off to see about the order. Bao-chai had been following these exchanges with amusement. Cousin Feng may be very artful, she said, but I dont believe that in all the years Ive been here I have ever seen her get the better of Lady Jia. Im an old woman, my dear, said Grandmother Jia. What use would I have for artfulness at my time of life? Mind you, when I was the age that Feng is now, I could have taught her a thing or two. Still, though she may not be as sharp as I was then, she doesnt do so badly! A deal better than your Aunt Wang here, thats certain. She cant talk to save her life, poor soul, no more than a woman of wood!
Understanding that something must be wrong with her appearance, she slipped into Li Wans bedroom and took the cover off the mirror to have a look. It was the hair above her brows that was coming loose. She pulled out the drawer in Li Wans dressing-box, took out two little vanity-brushes, primmed her hair at the mirror, then, hurriedly replacing everything, went back into the outer room, where the others were still laughing. She pointed a finger accusingly at Li Wan. So this is your idea of supervision in needlework and moral instructioninviting us over here for jokes and horseplay! Did you hear that, all of you? said Li Wan. This is the ringleader who sets everyone else laughing and misbehaving, yet she has the effrontery to blame me for starting it all! Oh, I could - ! Well, all I can say is that I hope when you marry you have a real Tartar for a mother-in-law and lots of nasty sisters-in-law with tongues as sharp as yours. It will serve you right! Dai-yu, blushing, clung to Bao-chais hand. Lets give her a years leave, shall we? Let me suggest what I think is a fair compromise and see what the rest of you think of it, said Bao-chai. Its true that Lotus Dweller can paint, but painting in her case means no more than an occasional sketch in the Impressionistic style. Now of course, you couldnt paint this Garden in the first place if you didnt have impressions of it but the trouble is that the Garden itself was designed rather like a painting, with every rock, every tree, every building in it carefully and precisely placed in order to produce a particular scenic effect and if you tried to get your impressions of all of these different scenes onto paper exactly as they are, they simply wouldnt make a picture. The shape of the paper imposes its own perspectives. You have to make them into a composition. You have to decide which to bring into the foreground and which to push into the background, which to leave out altogether and which to show only in glimpses. When youve done that, you can make your rough draft. And even then, its only when youve studied the draft for a long time and corrected it until youre satisfied that you can go ahead with your transfer. One of your difficulties is going to be the ruler-work. With all those buildings youre going to have to do the straight lines with a ruler, and in ruler-work if youre not very careful its easy to make the most terrible mistakes - railings that slant to one side, leaning pillars, windows on the skew or steps drawn Out of line. Sometimes careless ruling can produce even more grotesque results, like a table squashed into a wall or a flowerpot apparently testing on the side of a curtain. Any one of these things is enough to make a painting look ridiculous. Putting in the human figures is going to be another problem. First of all you have to be very careful that you have got them in the right perspective. Then again, in painting figures the clothes and the position of the hands and feet are of great importance. A careless slip of the brush can mean a monstrously swollen hand or a crippled leg. Compared with these, little mishaps like the colour of the face running into the hair are of minor importance. In my opinion this painting is going to be very, very difficult. And since a year is thought to be too long and a month too short, the compromise I suggest is that she should be allowed half a year to do it in, but that Cousin Bao should be appointed to help her. My reason is not that I think he knows mote about painting than she does and can tell her how to do itI am sure that if he tried, it would only make matters worsebut because whenever there is anything she doesnt know about or has difficulty in putting in, he will be able to take the painting to one or another of his men friends outside who know about these matters and ask for their advice. Bao-yu was enthusiastic. Thats a splendid idea. Zhan Guang can do Elaborate style buildings and Cheng Ri-xing is very good at women. Ill go and have a word with them now. Didnt I tell you you ought to be called Busybody? said Bao-chai. Just because Ive mentioned the possibility, you dont have to go rushing off straight away. Wait until weve finished discussing what needs to be done, then you can go and see them. The question now is, what is she going to do this painting on? Weve got some. Snow Wave paper still, said Bao-yu. It comes in large enough pieces and it holds the ink well. Oh, youre just hopeless I said Bao-chai.
Today is one of my fast-days I shall only be eating vegetables. You go and have a proper meal with your Grandma. I shall share your vegetables, said Bao-yu. Go on, you can go, he said, dismissing the maid and rushing up to the table, he sat himself down at it in readiness. You others had better get on with your own lunch, Lady Wang said to Bao-chai and the girls. Let him do as he likes. You really ought to go, Bao-chai said to Bao-yu. Whether you have lunch there or not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why dont you? Oh, leave her alone! said Bao-yu. Shell be all right presently. Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused. Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao? they asked him. Even your eating and drinking all seems to be done in a rush. You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu, said Bao-chai blandly. Dont make him waste time here with us. Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard where his Grandmother Jias apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of Xi-fengs courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was standing in her doorway with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her direction. Ah, just the person I wanted to see! she said, as soon as she caught sight of Bao-yu. Come inside. I want you to write something down for me. Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone and a brush, and at once began dictating Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths, miscellaneous Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, Here, what is this? said Bao-yu. It isnt an invoice and it isnt a presentation list. How am I supposed to write it? Never you mind about that, said Xi-feng. As long as I know what it is, thats all that matters. just put it down anyhow. Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the paper and folded it away. Now, she said, smiling pleasantly, theres something I want to talk to you about. I dont know whether youll agree to this or not, but theres a girl in your room called Crimson whom Id like to work for me. If I find you someone to replace her with, will you let me have her? There are so many girls in my room, said Bao-yu. Please take any you have a fancy to. You really dont need to ask me about it. In that case, said Xi-feng, Ill send for her straight away. Please do, said Bao-yu, and started to go. Hey, come back! said Xi-feng. I havent finished with you yet. Ive got to see Grandma now, said Bao-yu. If youve got anything else to say, you can tell me on my way back. When he got to Grandmother Jias apartment, they had all just finished lunch. Grandmother Jia asked him if he bad had anything nice to eat with his mother. There wasnt anything nice, he said. But I had an extra bowl of rice. Then, after the briefest pause Wheres Cousin Lin ? In the inner room said Grandmother Jia. In the inner room a maid stood below the kang blowing on a flat-iron. Up on the kang two maids were marking some material with a chalked string, while Dai-yu, her head bent low over her work, was engaged in cutting something from it with her shears. What are you making? he asked her. Youll give yourself a headache, stooping down like that immediately after your lunch. Dai-yu took no notice and went on cutting. That corner looks a bit creased still, said one of the maids. it will have to be ironed again. Leave it alone! said Dai-yu, laying down her shears. It will be all right presently. Bao-yu found her reply puzzling. Bao-chai, Tan-chun and the rest had now arrived in the outer room and were talking to Grandmother Jia.
The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her out of the shadows. Who is it? Skybright. What do you want? Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss? Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She -found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it could mean. I suppose they must be very good ones, she said. Probably someone gave them to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for them just now myself. Skybright laughed. Theyre not new ones, Miss. Theyre two of his did, everyday ones. This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then suddenly, in a flash, she understood. Put them down. You may go now. Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her. Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of conflicting emotions. I feel so happy, she thought, that in the midst of his own affliction he has been able to grasp the cause of all my trouble. And yet at the same time I am sad, she thought because how do I know that my trouble will end in the way I want it to? Actually, I feel rather amused, she thought. Fancy his sending a pair of old handkerchiefs like that! Suppose I hadnt understood what he was getting at? But I feel alarmed that he should be sending presents to me in secret. Oh, and I feel so ashamed when I think how I am forever crying and quarrelling, she thought, and all the time he has understood! And her thoughts carried her this way and that, until the ferment of excitement within her cried out to be expressed. Careless of what the maids might think, she called for a lamp, sat herself down at her desk, ground some ink, softened her brush, and proceeded to compose the following quatrains, using the handkerchiefs them-selves to write on 1 -907 Seeing my idle teats, you ask me why These foolish drops fall from my teeming eye Then know, your gift, being by the merfolk made, In mermans currency must be repaid. 2 -907 Jewelled drops by day in secret sorrow shed Or, in the night-time, in my wakeful bed, Lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain, Shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain. 3 -907 Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiads tears Each salty trace of them fast disappears. Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow Outside the window still her tear marks show. She had only half-filled the second handkerchief and was preparing to write another quatrain, when she became aware that her whole body was burning hot all over and her cheeks were afire. Going over to the dressing table, she removed the brocade cover from the mirror and peered into it. Hmn! Brighter than the peach-flowers hue, she murmured complacently to the flushed face that stared out at her from the glass, and, little imagining that what she had been witnessing was the first symptom of a serious illness, went back to bed, her mind full of handkerchiefs. From Dai-yu and her handkerchiefs let us return to Aroma, who, it will be remembered, bad been sent off to Bao-chais for a book. When she got there, she found that Bao-chai was not in the Garden, having gone round to her mothers place outside. Not liking to return empty-handed, she waited for Bao-chai to return. It was already the beginning of the first watch when she did so. Knowing her brother as she did, Bao-chai had already, even before hearing anything to that effect, suspected that he was in some way responsible for Bao-yus misfortune. What Aroma had earlier on told her had therefore been no more than confirmation of an already existing suspicion. Yet Aroma had only been echoing what Tealeaf had told her and what Tealeaf had told her was pure guesswork without a shred of evidence to support it. Thus what started in everyones mind as a suspicion, repetition very soon compounded into a certainty. Yet the ironical fact was that he who by his past behaviour had so richly merited the reputation which had caused them to suspect him was totally innocent on the one Occasion when everyone was most unshakeably convinced of his guilt. The object of this misunderstanding had on this particular evening returned home having had a good deal to drink outside. He greeted his mother and then, observing that his sister, too, was sitting there, addressed a few desultory remarks to her.
The thing one always has to be on ones guard against is bad taste -which generally means no more than arranging good things in a bad way. I dont think any of my girls has bad taste. Now why dont you let me decorate this room for you? I promise you it shall look both dignified and austere. There are still a few things tucked away in my dowry that Bao-yu doesnt know about. wouldnt let him see them, or theyd have disappeared long ago!. She called Faithful to her and instructed her what to bring. I want you to fetch that bonseki and the little screen and the little tripod of smoky agate. Those three things arranged on the table here will be enough. Theres also a set of white satin hangings hand-painted in black ink. Id like you to get them too and put them up in place of these bed-curtains. Yes, madam, said Faithful. But these things are all stored in the attic over the east wing and Im not sure which chests theyre in, so it will take me quite a while to find them. Cant I leave it until tomorrow ? Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is immaterial, said Grandmother Jia, as long as it gets done. After sitting for a while longer in Bao-chais room, they got up and again moved on to the covered area underneath the Painted Chamber. lgante and the other little actresses came forward to make their curtseys and to inquire what pieces they should play. Choose a few of the ones you are most familiar with, said Grandmother Jia, and the little actresses went off to the Lotus Pavilion. No further mention of them is made in this part of our narrative. Supervised by Xi-feng, the servants had by now completed the seating arrangements for the drinking-party. Two wooden couches covered with woven grass mats and embroidered cushions had been placed side by side at the head. Each had a pair of carved lacquer tables in front of it. On one of each pair there was an incense seta miniature metal vase, a miniature cassolette and a miniature tripod, all for burning different kinds of incense in - on the other was a large lacquer box. These two couches with a pair of tables each were for Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue. Of the places ranged below them only one, Lady Wangs, had a couch and two tables all the rest had one table and a chair. On the east side, nearest to Grandmother Jia, sat Grannie Liu with Lady Wang below her on the west side Xiang-yun had been laid first, nearest to Aunt Xue, then Bao-chai, then Dai-yu, then Ying-chun, then Tan-chun, then Xi-chun, with Bao-yu in the very last place of all. A table and chairs had been laid for Li Wan and Xi-feng between the inner and outer mosquito screens which protected those inside the room from the insects of the lake. The little lacquer tables were of many different shapessome four-lobed like a begonia leaf, some five4obed like plum-flowers, some shaped like multi-petalled sunflowers, some like lotus leaves, some square, some round - and the lacquer boxes were designed to match the shapes of the tables. Everyone had his own nielloed silver self-service wine kettle and a little polychrome cloisonn winecup. Well now, said Grandmother Jia when they were all seated, lets have a cup or two to warm up on, and after that I think it would be more fun if we played a drinking game. I am sure you know lots of good ones, said Aunt Xue, but what about the rest of us? I am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk. We might just as well drink the extra cups now, since were bound to lose anyway, and forget about the game! Come, Mrs Xue, youre being excessively modest all of a sudden! said Grandmother Jia. But perhaps you think Im too old for this sort of thing? No, no, no. And Im not being modest, either, said Aunt Xue, laughing. I am afraid of not being able to give the answers and making a fool of myself. Even if we cant give the answers, said Lady Wang, it only means drinking a few more cups of wine. And if we get drunk, we can go to bed. No one is going to laugh at us, I hope! Aunt Xue smiled and nodded. Very well, I shall do as I am told then. But I think Lady Jia ought to drink a cup first, as proposer of the game. Of course, said Grandmother Jia, and drained off a cup forthwith.
I can guess what it is thats bothering you. I shall go and tell Her Ladyship that youre old enough to leave us now and ask her to send you away. Thats what you really want, isnt it? I dont want to go away. Why should I want to go away? said Skybright with tears in her eyes now more upset than ever, Youre inventing this as a means of getting rid of me, arent you, because Im in your way? But you wont get away with it. Look, Ive never had to put up with scenes like this before, said Bao-yu. What other reason can there be but that you want to leave? I really think I had better go and see Her Ladyship about this. He got up and began to go but Aroma came in again and barred his way. Where are you off to? she asked him smilingly. To see Her Ladyship. Oh, thats silly, said Aroma. I wonder youre not ashamed to. Even if Skybright really does want to leave, there will be plenty of time to tell Her Ladyship about it when everyone has cooled down a bit and you are feeling calm and collected. If you go rushing off in your present state, Her Ladyship will suspect something. Her Ladyship wont suspect anything, said Bao-yu. I shall tell her quite openly that Skybright has been agitating to leave. When have I ever agitated to leave? said Skybright, weeping now in earnest. Even if youre angry with me, you ought not to twist things round in order to get the better of me. But you go and tell her! I dont care if I have to beat my own brains out, Im not going out of that door. Now thats really strange, said Bao-yu. You dont want to go, yet at the same time you wont keep quiet. Its no good I really cant stand this quarrelling. I shall really hare to see Her Ladyship about this and get it over with. This time he seemed quite determined to go. Seeing that she was unable to hold him back, Aroma went down on her knees. Emerald, Ripple, Musk and the other maids, aware that a quarrel of more than usual magnitude was going on inside, were waiting together outside in breathless silence. when word reached them that Aroma was now on her knees interceding for Skybright, they came silently trooping in to kneel down behind her. Bao-yu raised Aroma to her feet, sighed, sat down on the edge of the bed, and told the other maids to get up. What do you want me to do? be asked Aroma. My heart is destroyed inside me, but none of you knows Or cares. Tears started from his eyes and rolled down his cheeks unheeded. Seeing his tears, Aroma too began to cry. Skybright, who stood crying beside them, was about to say something but just at that moment Dai-yu walked in and she slipped outside. Dai-yu beamed at the weeping pair Crying on a holiday? whats all this about? Have you been quarrelling over the rice-cakes? Bao-yu and Aroma both burst Out laughing. Well, if Cousin Bao wont tell me, she went on, 1m sure that you will. Come! she said, slapping Aroma familiarly on the shoulder. Tell sis all about it. Its obvious that the two of you have been having an argument. Tell me what its all about and Ill make it up between you. Oh, Miss! Aroma gave her a push. Dont carry on so! Im only a maid you shouldnt say such things to me. Only a maid? said Dai-yu. I always think of you as my sister-in-law. Dont you see that youre simply encouraging people to be nasty to her ? Bao-yu protested. Even as it is, people already gossip about her. How can she stand up to them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying? You dont know what I feel, Miss, said Aroma. If I only knew how to stop breathing, Id gladly die. Dai-yu smiled. If you were to die, I dont know about anyone else, but I know that I should die of grief. I should become a monk, said Bao-yu. Try to be a bit more serious, said Aroma. You and Miss Lin are both laughing at me. Dai-yu held up two fingers and looked at Bao-yu with a quizzical expression. Thats twice youre going to become a monk. From now on Im keeping the score. Bao-yu recognized the allusion to what he had said to her the day before.
And then for that stupid master of mine to go and beat me! Once more the sense of injustice overcame her and she could not restrain her tears. Dont be upset, Patience! said Bao-yu consolingly. I offer you an apology on their behalf Patience laughed. It has nothing to do with you. Were all cousins, said Bao-yu. What one of us does concerns all the others. If they have done you an injury, its up to me to apologize. He turned his attention to her appearance. What a pity! Youve made your new dress all damp. Aromas dresses are in here. Why dont you change into one of hers, then you can spray some samshoo on this one and iron it? Youll need to do your hair again as well. He called to the junior maids to fetch water for washing and heat a flat-iron. Up to this moment Patience had known only by hearsay of the remarkable understanding shown by Bao-yu in his dealings with girls. He had deliberately kept away from her in the past, knowing her to be Xi-fengs confidante and he supposed Jia Lians cherished concubine. It had indeed been a source of frequent regret to him that he had been unable to show her how much he admired her. Seeing him like this for the first time, Patience reflected on the truth of what she bad heard. He really has thought of everything, she told herself, as she watched Aroma open up a large chestspecially for her and select two scarcely worn garments from it for her to change into. Then, since the water had already arrived, she took off her own dress and skirt and quickly washed her face. Bao-yu, who stood by smiling while she washed, now urged her to put on some make-up. If you dont, it will look as if you are sulking, he said After all, it is Fengs birthday, and Grandma did specially send someone to cheer you up. Inwardly acknowledging the reasonableness of this advice, Patience looked round her for some powder, but could not see any, whereupon Bao-yu darted over to the dressing-table and removed the lid from a box of Early Ming blue -and-white porcelain in which reposed the head of a white day my with five compact, stick like buds on either side of the stem. Pinching off one of these novel powder-containers, he handed it to Patience. There you are. This isnt ceruse, its a powder made by crushing the seeds of garden-jalap and mixing them with perfume. Patience emptied the contents of the tiny phial on to her palm. All the qualities required by the most expert perfumers were there lightness, whiteness with just the faintest tinge of rosiness, and fragrance. It spread smoothly and cleanly on the skin, imparting to it a soft bloom -that was quite unlike the harsh and somewhat livid whiteness associated with lead-based powders. Then the rouge, too, was differentnot in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses. This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge, Bao-yu explained to her, only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. Its so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands for using on your cheeks. Following his directions, .Patience found that her complexion had acquired a radiant freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume. Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patiences hair. At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wans place and she had to leave him in a hurry. Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret. Today wasor would have been if -she had livedGoldens birthday, and for this reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning.
Infected by her enthusiasm, the maids and older women-servants went scurrying off in all directions to summon or invite. In less time than it would take to eat a meal, all those invited, young and old, mistress and servant, had been assembled, and the room was packed. Aunt Xue and Grandmother Jia sat on their own facing the multitude, Lady Xing and Lady Wang on chairs at the opposite side of the room beside the door. Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun and the Three Springs sat in a row at the back of the kang behind Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue. Bao-yu half reclined in his grandmothers lap. All the rest stood, shoulder to shoulder, on the floor below. As soon as she saw that they were all assembled, Grandmother Jia gave orders for stools to be brought so that Lai Das mother and various other of the more aged and respected servants present might sit down. It was customary in the Jia household to treat the older generation of servants those who had served the parents of the present masterswith even greater respect than the younger generation of masters, so that in this instance it was not thought at all surprising that You-shi, Xi-feng and Li Wan should remain standing while old Mrs Lai and three or four other old nannies though not without first apologizing for the liberty seated themselves on the stools. Grandmother Jia now smilingly announced the proposal that she had already outlined to Lady Wang. All present, it need hardly be said, were willing to fall in with itsome because they were on good terms with Xi-feng and were genuinely happy to give her pleasure, some because they were afraid of her and welcomed this as an opportunity of getting themselves into her good books, and all because in any case they could afford to do so. Accordingly, as soon as Grandmother Jia had finished speaking, they all enthusiastically and with one voice agreed. Grandmother Jia opened the list with her own subscription Ill give twenty taels. Ill follow Lady Jia, said Aunt Xue. Twenty taels. Lady Xing and Lady Wang called next We obviously cant put ourselves on a level with Lady Jia. Sixteen taels. You-shi and Li Wan, decreasing their call by a like amount, came next Twelve taels. We cant have you paying out that sort of money, Grandmother Jia said to Li Wan, a young widow with no mean of her own. Ill pay yours for you. Now dont get carried away, Grandma! said xi-feng. You ought to do your sums first before you start interfering. Dont forget youve already got two of the young folk, Bao-yu and Cousin Lin, to pay for besides your own contribution. Its all very well promising to pay these additional twelve taels for Li Wan in the heat of the moment, but later on youll be wishing you hadnt. Youll probably end up by saying that it was all because of that wretched Feng that you had to pay out so much money and think of some trick for getting it back from me three or four times over. I know. Dont tell me Im imagining this. This made everyone laugh. All right, said Grandmother Jia, laughing herself. Then what do you propose? Well now, it isnt even my birthday yet, but already Im feeling uncomfortable because so much is being done for me, said Xi-feng. It seems unluckyso many people being put to so much expense on my account while I dont pay a penny myself. Pd feel a lot easier if youd let me pay this contribution for Li Wan then, when the day comes, I shall be able to eat and drink as much as I like without any fear of spoiling my luck. Grandmother Jia hesitated, but consented when Lady Xing and Lady Wang both insisted that this was the best solution. Ive got another suggestion to make, said xi-feng. Your own contribution Is twenty taels, Grandma, and on top of that youre going to be paying contributions for Bao-chai and Cousin Lin. Its true that Aunt Xue will be paying Cousin Chais contribution on top of her twenty taels, but that doesnt seem quite so unfair. What does seem unfair to me is that Mother and Aunt Wang should be paying only sixteen taels each for themselves, yet paying no extras at all for any of the young people. I think youre getting the worst of this arrangement, Grannie. See what a good girl my Feng is to me! said Grandmother Jia delightedly. Youre quite right, my dear. If you hadnt mentioned it, I should have let them get away with itas usual! All you need do, Grannie, is to make the two young people their responsibility.
In a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside. He could see several girls there sweeping, all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and ornaments in their hair, but no sign of the quiet, neat girl of the day before. He went outside in his slippers to look around, pretending that he had gone out to inspect the flowers. He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of the cloister-like covered walk, but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he could not make out who it was. He approached and looked more closely. It was she, yesterdays girl, standing there on her own, apparently lost in thought. He was a little shy of ad-dressing her at that particular moment and was still hesitating when Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash. He had to go in again without having spoken to her. While Crimson stood there musing, she suddenly became aware that Aroma was beckoning to her, and hurried up to see what she wanted. Our spittoon is broken, Aroma said. Can you go to Miss Lins and ask them if they will lend us one until we can get a replacement? Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiads House. When she got to Green Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees. She could just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on some rocks supervising them. She would have liked to go over, but did not quite dare, and having collected the spittoon, returned, in very low spirits, and lay down in her own room to brood. The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took no notice. Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-tengs lady. A message had already been received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the invitation was from her brothers wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to. Wang Zi-tengs other. sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until the evening. Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wangs kang, called for a candle to be lit, and, with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and shortly after that informing G6lden ?hat she was standing in his light. The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no noticeall, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly counselled some restraint Try not to throw your weight about so! she said. Its silly to put peoples backs up. Jia Huan scowled angrily I know what Im doing, he said. Iont talk to me like a child! Youre friends with Bao-yu nowadays, arent you? You dont like me any more. I know. Ive watched you both. Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger You ungrateful thing! Youre like the dog that bit L Dong-bin you dont know a friend when you see one. They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink. In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few respectful words to his mother, asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mothers bosom to be fondled and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the days events.
Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence. We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The problem is how to die well. Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that a scholar dies protesting and a soldier dies fighting and get themselves killed off on the assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the only real occasion for protesting is when ones ruler is misguided, and the only real occasion for fighting is when ones country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the soldier so hankers for a heros death that he gets himself killed off in the first encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles? But surely, Aroma interrupted, those famous men in the olden days laid their lives down because they had to? Nonsense! said Bao-yu. The soldiers among them lacked generalship as a consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty then, if the Court didnt immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and promptly get themselves killed. You wont, surely, say that they died because they had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven, and its unthinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal fame and glory. They werent really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at all. Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently decompose there until thewind had picked my bones clean, and after that never, never to be reborn again as a human beingthat would be a really good death. Im sleepy, said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes -and fell fast asleep. By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten. A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Gardens possibilities, and its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved, for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to sing him some of the arias from it. The only girls he recognized when he arrived there were Tresor and Topaze, who greeted him with smiles and invited him to be seated. When he asked where Charmante was, the girls all answered him in chorus In her room. Bao-yu at once went to the room indicated. Charmante was in there on her own. She was lying stretched out on her bed, but made no attempt to get up when she saw him enter. Nothing daunted, he sat himself down beside her and, in the familiar way he habitually adopted with girls, smilingly requested her to sing the section from the Return that begins with the words In these quiet courts the floating gossamer... But Charmante did not respond in the expected manner. She rose up quickly and drew away from him when he sat down beside her and in answer to his request to sing, she informed him, with a cold, unsmiling expression, that she was not invoice. I strained my voice the other day at a command performance for Her Grace, she said. I am still resting it. She was sitting opposite him as she said this, so that he had a full view of her face. He remembered now, as he studied it, where he had seen that face before. She was the girl he had seen scratching QIANS on the ground that day under the rose pergola.
spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact, was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu whom he had never seen before and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty. Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff yet in spite of prayers, incantations, divination, and all the expedients that faith and physic could provide, there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients. At sundown Wang Zi-tengs lady took her leave and went home. Next day she made another visit to inquire after them. This was followed by Visits from the wife of Grandmother Jias nephew the Marquis, from Lady Xings brothers wives, and from the wives of other marriage connections of the family. Bottled charm-water, wonder-working monks and Taoists and highly recommended physicians were also sent round to the mansion by various friends and relations. But the cousins continued delirious and lay on their beds burning with fever and babbling incomprehensibly. At nightfall they became even worse, so that the maids and even the older women no longer dared go near them. The two of them had to be carried into Lady Wangs room on their beds and set down there side by side so that Jia Yun and a group of pages could watch over them in shifts throughout the night. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Aunt Xue stayed near at hand, refusing to budge, though unable to do anything but sit by and weep. Jia She and Jia Zheng, afraid that their mothers health would suffer, displayed their concern by keeping themselves and everyone else up throughout most of the night. There were lights burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all. Jia She continued to hunt everywhere for monks and exorcists reputed able to cure diseases of the mind. Finally, Jia Zheng, who saw that their methods were all useless, lost patience with him and tried to make him stop Young people will die if they must. Nothing can alter fate. And that they are fated to die would appear from the fact that all efforts to cure them have been unavailing. I think we should allow them to die in peace. But Jia She took no notice, and the commotion continued as before. By the third day the patients were so weakened that they lay on their beds motionless and their breathing was scarcely perceptible. The whole family had by now abandoned hope and were already making preparations for their laying-out. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Jia Lian, Patience and Aroma had cried themselves into a state bordering on prostration. Only Aunt Zhao was cheerfulthough she did her best to look miserable. Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to Grandmother Jia From now on I can no longer stay in this family. You must get my things ready and let me go. To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body but Aunt Zhao, who also heard them, had the temerity to urge their acceptance Your Ladyship shouldnt take it so hard. Its already all up with the boy. We should be getting his grave clothes ready so that he can go in peace. It will be better that way. If we wont let him go now, when hes ready, it will only make more suffering for him in the world to come She would have gone on, but Grandmother Jia spat in her face. No empty gesture it was a full gob of spittle. Evil woman! May your tongue rot! How do you know its all up with him? You want him to die, dont you? But if you think you will gain by his death, you must be dreaming because if he does die, I shall hold you responsible. Its your spiteful meddling that has forced him to do all this studying. You have reduced the poor child to such a state that the mere sight of his father makes him more scared than a mouse with the cat after it. You have done this, you and the others of your kind. And now I suppose, if you succeed in murdering him, you will be satisfied. But dont imagine you will escape me any of you! She railed and wept. Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and was deeply distressed by it.
Aunt Xue murmured something in reply, afterwards adding as a politeness The younger sons wife is often the more favoured one. Perhaps you are biased, Lady Jia. No, said Grandmother Jia firmly, I am not biased. Bao-yu, she said, turning to her grandson, why didnt you speak up when I falsely accused your mother? How could you stand by like that and watch her being treated unjustly? How could I take Mothers side against Uncle and Aunt? said Bao-yu. Obviously someone was to blame but if it wasnt Mother, who was I to say that it was? I could hardly have said that it was me. Somehow I dont think you would have believed me! -384 Grandmother Jia laughed. Yes, I suppose you are right. Go and kneel down to your mother, then, Bao-yu. Tell her that Im getting old and that she is not to be upset by what I said to her. Ask her to forgive me for your sake. Bao-yu quickly went over and knelt before Lady Wang. But before he could relay his grandmothers message, his mother had laughingly prevented him. Get up at once and dont be ridiculous, Bao-yu I How can you possibly apologize for Grandma to me ? Bao-yu hurriedly got up to his feet. What about you, Feng? said Grandmother Jia. Why didnt you try to stop me? Ive been trying to restrain myself from blaming you for whats happened, said Xi-feng. I dont know why you should pick on me. Grandmother Jias laughter was echoed by the others present. Oh? Now this is interesting. I should like to know why you think Im to blame for what has happened. You shouldnt be so good at training your girls, said Xi-feng. When youve brought up a beautiful young bulrush like Faithful, can you blame other people for wanting her? Its a good job Im only your granddaughter-in-law. If Id been your grandson, I should have asked you for her for myself a long time ago. I shouldnt have waited till now, I can tell you! Oh, said Grandmother Jia, laughing. So its all my fault, is it? Of course its your fault, said Xi-feng. In that case I wont try to keep her, said Grandmother Jia. You can take her back with you. Not just now said Xi-feng. In my next life, perhaps. If a good girl in this life, I might be reborn as a man, and I can ask you for her then! Go on, take her with you! said Grandmother Jia. You can give her to your Lian. See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then! -1014 Lian doesnt deserve her, said Xi-feng. All hes fit for is a couple of sad old dumplings like me and Patience! This set everyone laughing. A maid came in to announce someone. Lady Xing, maam. Lady Wang hurried out to meet her. What followed will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 47 In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a hasty getaway HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her. Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithfuls attitude. She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of Grandmother Jias women as she entered the old ladys courtyard. She would have liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late she had already been seen and announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was covered with shame and confusion. By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence might add to Lady Xings embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together, Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence. I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband, she said. I must congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own now why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age?
You shouldnt make mistakes! I told you I needed a fortune-teller, said Xi-feng. Well, I played the card, so I suppose Ive no one but myself to blame. I should think so too! said Grandmother Jia. Give yourself a good hard slap on the face if you want to know where the fault lies! She turned to Aunt Xue. You mustnt think Im grasping, Mrs Xue. I dont play for -the money but I do so enjoy winning! Of course, said Aunt Xue. No one would be so idiotic as to suppose that you played for the money. Hearing this, Xi-feng, who had meanwhile been counting out the money she had lost, abruptly stopped, and threaded the coins back onto the string. Right! she said, speaking to the others present. That settles it! She doesnt play for the money, she just enjoys winning. Well I am mean and grasping, Im afraid, and when I lose, I like to know how much. But if thats the way she feels, back it all goes again! When Grandmother Jia played cards it was her unvarying custom to let Faithful shuffle for her. She had been talking to Aunt Xue throughout Xi-fengs bit of by play, but broke off when he became aware that Faithful had made no move. Come child, she said. Youre not too upset to shuffle for me, are you? -320 Faithful took up the cards with a laugh. No, only Mrs Lian hasnt paid up yet. Oh, hasnt she? said Grandmother Jia. Shell be lucky if she gets away with that! She called one of the junior maids to her. Take that string of cash from in front of Mrs Lian and bring it here. -320 The little maid did as she was bid -and laid the money on the table beside Grandmother Jia. Please let me have it back, Xi-feng pleaded, so that I can give you the right amount. Feng really is rather mean, said Aunt Xue jokingly. Its only a game, after all. Xi-feng stood up and, laying a hand on Aunt Xues arm, pointed out to her the wooden chest in which Grandmother Jia kept her money. You see that, Aunt? I dont know how much of my money has at one time or another found its way in there. Before Ive been playing half an hour, my money in the chest begins calling to my money on the table to come and join it. All I have to do now is wait until its called it all in, then the game will be over and Grannie will be in a good temper again and I shall be able to go and get on with my work. By the time she had finished -saying this, Grandmother Jia and all the others present were laughing. They were still laughing when Patience, fearing that her mistress might have insufficient money by her, came in bringing another string of cash. Dont put it down in front of me, Xi-feng told her. Put it down beside Her Old Ladyship, so that all my money can go into the chest together. We dont want the money in the chest to have to go through the -business of calling for it all over again. This made Grandmother Jia laugh so much that she scattered the cards she was holding all over the table. Tear her mouth! she said to Faithful, giving her a playful push. Patience laid the money down as she was bidden, and after laughing a while with the others, went out again. On her way out of the courtyard she ran into Jia Lian, who was just about to enter the gate. Wheres Lady Xing? he asked her. Sir She has sent me to look for her. Shes been standing in there with Her Old Ladyship for the last half hour, said Patience. She hasnt dared to move yet, but I dare say shell get away as soon as she can. Her Old Ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning, but thanks to the Mistress, whos been all this time humouring her, shes gradually beginning to calm down a bit. Oh well, when I go in I shall say that Ive come to find out if Her Old Ladyship is going to Lai Das place on the fourteenth, so that I know whether or not to have the carriages ready, said Jia Lian. I can mention that Lady Xing is wanted as an afterthought. And after that perhaps I shall stay on and chaff the old lady a bit for a few minutes. That should he all right, shouldnt it? If youre asking my opinion, I think youd do much better not to go in at all, said Patience.
Aroma and Xiang-yun shook their heads pityingly. So thats stupid rubbish, is it? they said, laughing. Dai-yu tightly surmised that now Xiang-yun had arrived, Bao-yu would lose no time in telling her about his newly acquired kylin. Now Dai-yu had observed that in the romances which Bao-yu smuggled in to her and of which she was nowadays an avid consumer, it was always some trinket or small object of clothing or jewellery a pair of lovebirds, a male and female phoenix, a jade ring, a gold buckle, a silken handkerchief, an embroidered belt or what notthat brought the heroes and heroines together. And since the fate and future happiness of those fortunate beings seemed to depend wholly on the instrumentality of such trifling objects, it was natural for her to suppose that Bao-yus acquisition of the gold kylin would become the occasion of a dramatic rupture with her and the beginning of an association with Xiang-yun in which he and Xiang-yun would do together all those delightful things that she had read about in the romances. It was with such apprehensions that she made her way stealthily towards Green Delights, her intention being to observe how the two of them were behaving and shape her own actions accordingly. Imagine her surprise when, just as she was about to enter, she heard Xiang-yun lecturing Bao-yu on his social obligations and Bao-yu telling Xiang-yun that Cousin Lin never talked that sort of rubbish and that if she did he would have fallen out with her long ago. Mingled emotions of happiness, alarm, sorrow and regret assailed her. Happiness Because after all she thought I wasnt mistaken in my judgement of you. I always thought of you as a true friend, and I was right. Alarm Because if you praise me so unreservedly in front of other people, your warmth and affection are sure, sooner or later, to excite suspicion and be misunderstood. Regret Because if you are my true friend, then I am yours and the two of us are a perfect match. But in that case why did there have to be all this talk of the gold and the jade? Alter-natively, if there had to be all this talk of gold and jade, why werent we the two to have them? Why did there have to be a Bao-chai with her golden locket? Sorrow Because though there are things of burning importance to be said, without a father or a mother I have no one to say them for me. And besides, I feel so muzzy lately and I know that my illness is gradually gaining a hold on me. The doctors say that the weakness and anaemia I suffer from may be the beginnings of a consumption. So even if I am your true love, I fear I may not be able to wait for you. And even though you are mine, you can do nothing to alter my fate. At that point in her reflections she began to weep and feeling in no fit state to be seen, she turned away from the door and began to make her way back again. Bao-yu had finished his hasty dressing and now came out of the house. He saw Dai-yu slowly walking on ahead of him and, judging by her appearance from behind, wiping her eyes. He hurried forward to catch up with her. Where are you off to, coz? Are you crying again? Who has upset you this time? Dai-yu turned and 8aw that it was Bao-yu. Im perfectly all right, she said, forcing a smile. What would I be crying for? Look at you! The tears are still wet on your face. How can you tell such fibs? Impulsively he stretched out his hand to wipe them. Dai-yu recoiled several paces Youll get your head chopped off! she said. You really must keep your hands to yourself Im sorry. My feelings got the better of me. Im afraid I wasnt thinking about my head. No, I forgot, said Dai-yu. Losing your head is nothing, is it? Its losing your kylinthe famous gold kylin-that is really serious! Her words immediately put Bao-yu in a passion. He came up to her and held his face close to hers. Do you say these things to put a curse on me? or is it merely to make me angry that you say them ? Remembering their recent quarrel, Dai-yu regretted her careless reintroduction of its theme and hastened to make amends Now dont get excited. I shouldnt have said that - oh come now, it really isnt that important! Look at you! The veins are standing out on your forehead and your face is all covered with sweat.
Were taking you to see them all. As they left the Naiads House, they could make out, at some distance from where they stood, a number of people punting on the lake. Remarking that since the boats were already out they might just as well use them, Grandmother Jia conducted her little party in the general direction of Amaryllis Eyot and Flowery Harbour. Before they had reached the waters edge, however, a number of elderly women approached, each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they make in Soochow, with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately patterned in needle-engraving of gold, and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in their sides. Seeing them approach, Xi-feng asked Lady Wang where she wanted lunch to be laid. Ask Grandmother, said Lady Wang. Wherever she wants it, of course. Grandmother Jia, who had been moving on, now turned back to tell them. Your Cousin Tans would be a nice place to have it. You go on ahead and lay it there, and the rest of us will follow by boat. Xi-feng, accompanied by Li Wan, Tan-chun, Faithful and Amber, led the women with the lunch-boxes by a short cut to the Autumn Studio. They put Out a couple of tables there in the Paulownia Room. Were often hearing how the gentlemen at their parties outside have a buffoon to provide them with their laughs, said Faithful while they were getting ready. Today weve got a buffoon of our owna female one. Li Wan, being a good, simple soul, did not understand what she meant but Xi-feng knew immediately that she was referring to Grannie Liu and gleefully agreeing that they should have some laughs at the old womans expense, at once began plotting something with Faithful. You two are awful! Li Wan protested laughingly. Anyone would think you were a couple of mischievous children. And what will Lady Jia say? Dont worry, Mrs Zhu! said Faithful. You wont be involved in this one little bit. I promise to keep you out of it. Grandmother Jia now arrived with the others, the company sat down informally, and maids went round and served every one with tea. When they had all finished their tea, Xi-feng came in carrying a bundle of silver-tipped and silver-ornamented ebony chopsticks wrapped in a West Ocean linen napkin, and proceeded to lay the places. Put that little yellow cedar-wood table next to my place so that Mrs Liu can sit by me, said Grandmother Jia. As the maids hastened to comply, Xi-feng tipped a wink at Faithful, who took the opportunity presented by this diversion to draw Grannie Lu aside and quietly brief her on the decorums to be observed by anyone eating with the family. Its part of the rules of this household, she told tile old woman in conclusion. If you dont do it properly, they will laugh at you. The places being now all laid, the company sat down to table, with the exception of Aunt Xue, who had eaten already and continued sitting where she was, drinking tea. Bao-yu, Xiang-yun, Dai-yu and Bao-chai sat at one of the two large tables with Grandmother Jia at their head, and Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat at the other one, presided over by Lady Wang. Grannie Liu had a little table of her own next to Grandmother Jia. Normally when Grandmother Jia took her meals it was the junior maids who stood with spittoons, fly-whisks and napkins in their hands behind the chairs. Faithful had long since graduated from such menial duties. On this occasion, however, she borrowed a fly-whisk from one of the younger girls and did some whisking herself. This was a signal for the other maids, who knew that something was afoot, to melt discreetly away, leaving the stage clear for Faithful. Fly-whisk in hand, Faithful took up a position on her own and darted a questioning glance at her victim. All right, Miss, dont worry! said Grannie Liu, and having settled herself in her place, picked up her chopsticks. She found them extremely heavy and unwieldy. They were a pair of old-fashioned, square-handled ivory ones inlaid with gold, which Xi-feng and Faithful had planted on her in furtherance of their plan. Whats this youve given me? said Grannie Liu. A pair of tongs? These are heavier than one of our iron shovels.
The old woman went off to deliver her message. In due course she reported back againbut these are details omitted from our story. Bao-chai resumed her conversation with Xiang-yun. About the theme for tomorrows poems, she said. We dont want anything too outlandish. If you look at the works of the great poets, you find that they didnt go in for the weird and wonderful titles and daring rhymes that people nowadays are so fond of. Outlandish themes and daring rhymes do not produce good poetry. They merely show up the poverty of the writers ideas. Certainly one wants to avoid clichs but one can easily go too far in the pursuit of novelty. The important thing is to have fresh ideas. If one has fresh ideas, one does not need to worry about clichs the words take care of themselves. But what am I saying all this for? Spinning and sewing is the proper occupation for girls like us. Any time we have left over from that should be spent in reading a few pages of some improving booknot on this sort of thing! Yes said Xiang-yun, without much conviction but presently smiled as a new idea occurred to her. Ive just thought of something. Yesterdays theme was White Crab-blossom. The flower Id like to write about is the chrysanthemum. Couldnt we have Chrysanthemums as our theme for tomorrow? It is certainly a very seasonable one, said Bao-chai. The trouble is that so many people have written about it before. Yes, said Xiang-yun, I suppose it is rather a hackneyed one. Bao-chai thought for a bit. Unless of course you somehow involved the poet in the theme, she said. You could do that by making up verb-object or concrete-abstract tides in which chrysanthemums was the concrete noun or the object of the verb as the case might be. Then your poem would be both a celebration of chrysanthemums and at the same time a description of some action or situation. Such a treatment of the subject has been tried in the past, but it is a much less hackneyed one. The combining of narrative and lyrical elements in a single treatment makes for freshness and greater freedom. It sounds a splendid idea, said Xiang-yun. But what sort of verbs or abstract nouns had you in mind? Can you give me an example? Bao-chai thought for a bit. What about The Dream of the Chrysanthemums ? Yes, thats a good one, said xiang-yun. Ive thought of one too. Couldnt we have The Shadow of the Chrysanthemums? Ye-e-es, said Bao-chai, doubtfully. The trouble is, its been used before. Still, if we had a lot of tides we could probably slip it in. Ive thought of another. Well, come on then! said Xiang-yun. What about Questioning the Chrysanthemums? Xiang-yun slapped the table appreciatively. Thats a lovely one! Presently she added Ive thought of another. What do you think of Seeking the Chrysanthemums? That should be interesting, said Bao-chai. Lets start making a list. Well write down up to ten titles and then see what we think of them. The two of them busied themselves for some minutes grinding ink and softening a brush. xiang-yun then proceeded to write down the titles at Ban-chais dictation. Soon they had ten. Xiang-yun read them over. Ten doesnt make a set, she said. We need two more to make a round dozen, then we shall have just the right number for a little album. Ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty. If were thinking in terms of a sequence of poems, she said, we may as well, while were about it, arrange these titles in some sort of order. Thats it! said xiang-yun. Then they will be all ready for making our Chrysanthemum Album with afterwards. Remembering the Chrysanthemums should come first, said Bao-chai. Now, lets see. When you remember them, you realize you havent got any, so you go and look for some. So Seeking the Chrysanthemums will be the second title. Well, having found some, you will want to plant them so Planting the Chrysanthemums will be the third title. After youve planted them and the flowers have come out, youll want to stand and look at them so the fourth title will be Admiring the Chrysanthemums. You wont be able to have enough of them by just standing and admiring them, so youll naturally want to pick some and arrange them in a vase so that you can enjoy them indoors.
Todays meeting is just a preliminary discussion. Now you will have to wait for me to issue an invitation. Before we do anything else, said Bao-chai, we had better decide how often we are going to meet. Not too often, I hope, said Tan-chun, otherwise it will no longer be a pleasure. I suggest not more than two or three times a month. Twice a month will be quite enough, said Bao-chai. Once weve decided which two days to meet on, we should under-take always to turn up on those two days, wet or fine. At the same time, we should be allowed to arrange additional meetings outside the fixed dates as and when the fancy takes any of us to do so. If we leave it that much flexible, it will be more enjoyable. The others agreed that this was a good proposal and should be adopted. The poetry club was originally my idea, said Tan-chun. I hope you will at least allow me the pleasure of being your hostess at its first meeting. All right, said Li Wan. Well have a meeting tomorrow and you shall entertain us, Why wait until tomorrow? said Tan-chun. Theres no time like the present. You choose a title for us, Amaryllis Islander can set the rhymes, and Lotus Dweller can supervise us while we compose our poems. If you ask me, said Ying-chun, I think that rather than always have the same two people to choose the titles and set the rhymes, it would be better to draw lots. As I was on my way here just now, said Li Wan, I saw them carrying in two pots of white crab-blossom. It was so pretty. Couldnt you have white crab-blossom for your subject? We havent all seen it yet, said Ying-chun. How are they going to write poems about it if they havent seen it? We all know what white crab-blossom looks like, said Bao-chai. I dont see why we necessarily have to look at it in order to be able to write a poem about it. The ancients used a poetic theme as a vehicle for whatever feelings they happened to want to express at that particular moment. If theyd waited until theyd seen the objects they were supposed to be writing about, the poems would never have got written! Very well, then, Ill set your rhymes, said Ying-chun. She took a book of verse off the shelf, opened it at random, and held it up for the others to see. There you are an octet in Regulated Verse. Thats the form. She closed the book again and turned to a little maid who was leaning in the doorway looking on. Give us a word, she said. Any word. Door, said the girl. That means the first line must end with door, said Ying-chun. She turned again to the girl Another one. Pot, said the girl. Right, pot, said Ying-chun, and going over to a little nest of drawers in which rhyme-cards were kept, she pulled out one of them and asked the maid to select two cards from it at random. These turned out to be the cards for not and spot,. Now, she said to the girl, pick any card out of any drawer. Just one. The girl pulled out another drawer and picked out the card for day. All right, said Ying-chun. That means that your first line must end in door, your second in pot, your fourth in not, your sixth in spot ,and the rhyming couplet in the seventh and eighth lines must end in day Tan-chuns maid Scribe laid out four identical sets of brushes and paper for the competitors, who all, except Dai-yu, now began, with quiet concentration, to consider what they were going to write. Dai-yu wandered around outside, playing with the bark of the paulownia trees, admiring the signs of autumn in the garden, occasionally joking with the maids, and in general not giving the slightest indication that she was engaged in the throes of composition. Ying-chun told one of the maids to light a stick of Sweet Dreamsa kind of incense which is only about three inches long and has a very thick wick so that it burns down fairly rapidly - and told the competitors that they had to complete their poems by the time the incense had burned itself out, otherwise they would be penalized. Tan-chun soon had a poem ready. Taking up a brush, she wrote it out and, after going over it and making a few corrections, handed it in to Ying-chun. Then she turned to Bao-chai. How are you doing, Lady All-spice?
That is because the world and its temptations have con-fused it, said the monk. It certainly used to have the power. If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it, I think I can undertake to bring the power back again. Jia Zheng took the Magic Jade from Bao-yus neck and handed it to the monk, who held it on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a sigh Thirteen years, old friend, since we first met under Green -sickness Peak! Time certainly flies. But you have not finished with this world yet, you know. Dear, dear, dear! You arent the Stone you were, are you? -1174 Time was you lived in perfect liberty, Your heart alike from joy and sorrow free, Till, by the smelters alchemy transformed, Into the world you came to purchase misery. -534 By the bye, I am sorry you have been having such a disagreeable experience these last few days. Vain sensual joys the jades sheen have besmirched The poor bird droops, in its close prison perched. From drunken dreaming one day youll recover Then, when all debts are paid, the play will soon be over. When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone, he rubbed it and polished it between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it. There! Its power has now been restored. He handed it back to Jia Zheng. But you must be careful that it does not become contaminated again. Hang it above the threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patients own mother and grandmother go inside. If you will do that, I can guarantee a complete recovery in thirty-three days. Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some remuneration, but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced. The monks directions were scrupulously followed. Lady Wang guarded the doorway in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom. By evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry. This news, so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang, who at once had rice gruel brought in to feed them with, was relayed to the girls in the outer room. Bless His Holy Name! Dai-yu murmured fervently. Bao-chai laughed, but said nothing. The others were mystified. Why do you laugh, Cousin Bao? Xi-chun asked her. I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be, Bao-chai said. Apart from working for the salvation of all sentient beings, He has to protect the sick and hasten their recoverynot to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that they marry and live happily ever after. What a lot He has to keep Him busy! Dont you find the thought rather amusing ? Dai-yu affected scorn, but was blushing hotly. You are all horrid. Instead of following good examples, you all imitate Feng and make nasty, cheap jokes all the time. She raised the portiere and went out. But if you wish to know more, you will have to wait for the next chapter. CHAPTER 26 A conversation on Wasp Waist Bridge is a cover for communication of a different kind And a soliloquy overhead in the Naiads House reveals unsuspected depths of feeling By the time the thirty-three days convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yus health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden It may be recalled that when Bao-yus sickness was at its height, it had been found necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns in watching over him. Crimson was there too at that time, having been brought in with the other maids from his apartment. During those few days she and Jia Yun therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other, and a certain familiarity began to grow up between them. Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much like the one she had lost. She nearly asked him about it, but in the end was too shy. Then, after the monks visit, the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting. Though Crimson could still not dismiss the matter entirely from her mind, she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing their suspicions. A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room, still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window inquired whether she was in.

A day or two after their return to Green Delights, Crimson was sitting in her room, still brooding over this handkerchief business, when a voice outside the window inquired whether she was in. Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself. Yes, Im in, she said. Come inside! Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle. Im in luck I she said. I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lins for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job of taking it. When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said Here you are! and gave me two big handfuls of it. Ive no idea how much it is. Will you look after it for me, please? She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins. Crimson carefully counted them for her and put them away in a safe place. Whats been the matter with you lately? said Melilot. If you ask me, 1 think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some medicine. Silly! said Crimson. Im perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for? I know what, then, said Melilot. Miss Lins very weakly. Shes always taking medicine. Why dont you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just as well. Oh, nonsense! said Crimson. You cant take other peoples medicines just like that! Well, you cant go on in this way, said Melilot, never eating or drinking properly. What will become of you? Who cares? said Crimson. The sooner Im dead the better! You shouldnt say such things, said Melilot, It isnt right. Why not? said Crimson. How do you know what is on my mind? Melilot sho6k her head sympathetically. I cant say I really blame you, she said. Things are very difficult here at times. Take yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades. Well now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why should they leave you out? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that theyd left you out. Aroma, of course, youd expect to get more than anyone else. I dont blame her at all. In fact, I think its owing to her. Lets be honest none of us can compare with Aroma. I mean, even if she didnt always take so much trouble over everything, no one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share. What makes me so angry is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when everyone knows theyre only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu. Doesnt it make you angry? I dont see much point in getting angry, said Crimson. You know what they said about the mile-wide marquee Even the longest party must have an end?
Bao-yu gave vigorous assurances that he would do this for her, then, when they had seen her get into her carriage, they all turned and went in again. As to what followed, that must be looked for in the following chapter. CHAPTER 37 A happy inspiration prompts Tan-chun to found the Crab-flower Club And an ingenious arrangement enables Bao-chai to settle the chrysanthemum poem titles THIS year Jia Zheng was appointed Commissioner for Education in one of the provinces, with instructions to leave for his tour of duty on the twentieth of the eighth month. When the day for his departure arrived, he took leave of his ancestors in the family shrine, kotowed to his mother, and was seen on his way as far as the hostelry of the Tearful Parting the first post-halt on his journey by Bao-yu and other junior male members of the clan. Jia Zhengs doings after his departure are not recorded in this history we merely observe that the departure left Bao-yu free to play and idle in the Garden to his hearts content witout the least fear of restraint or reprisal. -1840 The days in idleness passed by To swell the tale of wasted years On the day of which we write Bao-yu was feeling very bored. He had returned from perfunctory morning calls on his mother and grandmother and had just finished changing back into his everyday clothes, when Tan-chuns maid Ebony arrived carrying a carefully-folded letter from her mistress. Im glad youve come, said Bao-yu, as she handed him the letter. Id been meaning to see your mistress this morning, but I forgot. How is she? Is she any better? Shes quite better, thank you, said Ebony. Shes stopped taking her medicine today. It was only a slight chill that she was suffering from. Bao-yu unfolded the elegant patterned notepaper and glanced at the contents Dear Brother, Some nights ago, when the moon came out in a sky freshly clear after the rain, the garden seemed veritably awash with moonlight, and sleep in the face of so rare a spectacle was unthinkable. Thrice the clepsydra had been turned, and still I lingered beneath the tall paulownias, reluctant to go in. But in the end the treacherous night air betrayed me, and by morning I was lamentably indisposed. How kind of you to have visited me in my sickroom! and how exquisitely thoughtful to have sent your maid-servant shortly afterwards with solicitous inquiries and with those delicious lychees and the calligraphy by Yan Zhen-qing! While I have been lying here quietly on my own, I have been thinking how in the olden days even men whose lives were spent amidst the burly-burly of public affairs would keep some quiet retreat for themselves with its tiny corner of mountain and trickle of running water and how they would seek, by whatever arts and blandishments they knew of, to assemble there a little group of kindred spirits to share in their enjoyment of it and how, on the basis of such leisure-time associations, rhymers guilds and poetry clubs were then founded, so that the fleeting inspirations of an idle hour might often be perpetuated in imperishable masterpieces of verse. Now although I am no poet myself, I am privileged to live midst rocks and streams and in the company of such gifted practitioners of the poetic art. as Xue and Lin and it seems to me a great pity that the romantic courts and pavilions of our Garden should not echo with the jocund carousal of assembled bards, and its flowering groves and blossoming banksides not become places of wine and song. Why should the founding of poetry clubs be the sole prerogative of the whiskered male, and female versificators allowed a voice in the tunable concert of the muses only when some enlightened patriarch sees fit to invite them? Will you come, then, and rhyme with us? The pathway to my door is swept to receive you and your arrival is eagerly awaited by Your affectionate Sister, Tan-chun When Bao-yu had finished reading, he clapped his hands delightedly. Dear Tan-chun! Bless her poetic soul! I must go and discuss this with her straight away. He strode off immediately, with Ebony following at his heels. But he had got no further than Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when he saw one of the old nannies on duty at the back gate of the Garden hurrying from the opposite direction with a note in her hand. She came up to him when she saw who he was and handed him the note. From Mr Yun, sir. Hes waiting at the back gate. He sends his compliments and says would I please give you this.
Certainly they can be very disagreeable at such times. Yes, Im sure thats what it was, said Bao-yu. When I get back, Ill find out who it was and give her a good talking-to. I think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to, said Dai-yu, though its not really for me to say so. Its a good job it was only me they were rude to. If Miss Bao or Miss Cow were to call and they behaved like that to her, that would be really serious. She giggled mischievously. Bao-yu didnt know whether to laugh with her or grind his teeth. But just at that moment a maid came up to ask them both to lunch and the two of them went together out of the Garden and through into the front part of the mansion, calling in at Lady Wangs on the way. How did you get on with that medicine of Dr Baos, Lady Wang asked Dai-yu as soon as she saw her, the Court Physician? Do you think you are any better for it? It didnt seem to make very much difference, said Dai-yu. Grandmother has put me back on Dr Wangs prescription. Cousin Lin has got a naturally weak constitution, Mother, said Bao-yu. She takes cold very easily. These strong decoctions are all very well provided she only takes one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment its probably best if she sticks to pills. The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day, said Lady Wang, but I just cant remember the name. I know the names of most of those pills, said Bao-yu. I expect he wanted her to take Ginseng Tonic Pills. No, that wasnt it, said Lady Wang. Eight Gem Motherwort Pills? said Bao-yu. Zhangs Dextrals?. Zhangs Sinistrals? If it wasnt any of them, it was probably Dr Cuis Adenophora Kidney Pills. No, said Lady Wang, it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a Vajra in it. Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands Ive never heard of Vajra Pills. If there are Vajra Pills, I suppose there must be Buddha Boluses ! The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. I should think it was probably The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills, she said. Yes, yes, thats it! said Lady Wang. Of course! How stupid of me! No, Mother, not stupid, said Bao-yu. Its the strain. All those Vajra-kings and Bodhisattvas have been overworking you! Youre a naughty boy to make fun of your poor mother, said Lady Wang. A good whipping from your Pa is what you need. Oh, Father doesnt whip me for that sort of thing nowadays, said Bao-yu. Now that we know the name of the pills, we must get them to buy some for your Cousin Lin, said Lady Wang. None of those things are any good, said Bao-yu. You give me three hundred and sixty taels of silver and Ill make up some pills for Cousin Lin that I guarantee will have her completely cured before she has finished the first boxful. Stuff! said Lady Wang. Whoever heard of a medicine that cost so much? No, honestly! said Bao-yu. This prescription is a very unusual one with very special ingredients. I cant remember all of them, but I know they include -5947 the caul of a first-born child a ginseng root shaped like a man, with the leaves still on it a turtle-sized polygonum root and lycoperdon from the stump of a thousand-year-old pine-tree. Actually, though, theres nothing so very special about those ingredients. Theyre all in the standard pharmacopoeia. For sovereign remedies they use ingredients that would really make you jump. I once gave the prescription for one to Cousin Xue. He was more than a year begging me for it before I would give it to him, and it took him another two or three years and nearly a thousand taels of silver to get all the ingredients together. Ask Bao-chai if you dont believe me, Mother. I know nothing about it, said Bao-chai. Ive never heard it mentioned. Its no good telling Aunt to ask me. You see! Bao-chai is a good girl. She doesnt tell lies, said Lady Wang. Bao-yu was standing in the middle of the floor below the kang. He clapped his hands at this and turned to the others appealingly.
Just wait a few days until Pan is better and can get about again. Im sure Mr Zhen and Mr Lian and the other menfolk will be unwilling to pass over this in silence. Probably they will get up a little party and ask this person to it and make him apologize to Pan in front of everyone and admit that he was to blame. But if you insist on making an issue of it now and telling Aunt about it, you will make it appear that you are so blind to Pans faults that you allow him to go around provoking other people, but that as soon as someone stands up to him, you fly up in arms and use our relations influence to oppress them. -336 Aunt Xue at once saw the force of this. You are quite right, my child. I was being silly. Dear Mamma! But now you are being sensible. He doesnt fear you, and he wont listen to anyone else. He just goes on getting worse and worse. One or two good, sharp shocks like this might bring him to his senses. Meanwhile Xue Pan lay on the kang in his bedroom, cursing Xiang-lian by every name he could think of and calling on his boys to smash up his house, to beat him to death, to have the law on him. Aunt Xue shouted to them that they were to do no such thing. To Xue Pan she explained that Xiang-lian was in any case beyond the reach of his vengeance. Xiang-lian behaved very bad because he was drunk. When he came to himself afterwards he was very sorry and now, because he is afraid of the consequences, he has fled the country. When Xue Pan heard that, he But you shall learn that if you wish in the following chapter. CHAPTER 48 -214 The Love Deluded One turns his thoughts to trade and travel And the Poetry Enthusiast applies herself to making verses XUE PAN gradually calmed down when his mother told him that Xiang-lian had fled. After four or five days the pain of his injuries had subsided, but not the bumps and bruises and as, while these still disfigured him, he was unwilling to meet any of his acquaintance, he kept to his room on the pretext that he was still too ill to go out. The tenth month soon came. Several of the employees working in Xue Pans shops in the capital wanted to go back home for the annual settling of accounts and Xue Pan found himself giving a farewell party for them in his room. Among those present was one Zhang De-hui, the sixty-year-old manager of his largest pawnshop. He had worked with the family since he was a lad and now had a household of his own and an income of two or three thousand taels. He was planning to leave with the others but not return until half way through the following year, as he explained to Xue Pan on this occasion. Theres a great shortage of stationery and perfumed goods just now, he said. These things are sure to fetch high prices next year. Im proposing to send my eldest boy here after New Year to look after the shop, so that I can travel back later. I shall buy up supplies of stationery and sandalwood fans on my way, aiming to get back here in time for the Double Fifth. I reckon it should be possible to make several hundred percent profit, even after the excise and all the other expenses have been deducted. This gave Xue Pan an idea. I havent felt like seeing anyone since that beating, he thought, and some excuse for getting away from everybody for a year or so is just what Ive been looking for. Obviously I cant go on staying indoors and pretending Im ill indefinitely. And for another thing, I havent done very much with my life to date Im neither a scholar nor a soldier, and though I call myself a merchant, Ive never handled a pair of scales or an abacus in my life, not to mention the fact that I know nothing about the places and peoples of the Empire or its roads and waterways. Why dont I get a bit of capital together and spend a year or so travelling around with Zhang De-hui? It wont matter much whether I make any money or not the main thing is that it will get me away from my disgrace and there is the added advantage that I shall be able to put in a bit of sight-seeing as well. Having so decided, he waited until the other guests had gone and then, making himself as agreeable as he knew how, informed Zhang De-hui of his decision and asked him to delay his departure by a few days so that he would have time to prepare. That evening he told his mother. Aunt Xues initial reaction was one of pleasure, but this quickly gave way to misgivings. It was not that she attached much importance to the loss of a little capital she was concerned about the scrapes he might get into away from home.
I was going to say my sister-in-law certainly isnt much of talker, yet Im sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good talker were the only thing -that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about. Well now, if were going to start comparing, said Grandmother Jia, I hope your Aunt Xue wont think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best. Aunt Xue laughingly demurred. You mustnt say that. Im sure you cant really mean it. No, no, Im sure she does, Lady Wang hurriedly inter-posed. Ive often heard Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you werent around. Bao-yus contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao-chai and grinned but she turned quickly away and began talking to Aroma. Just-then a servant came to say that lunch over at the mansion was ready, and Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to hurry up and get better and then admonished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her leaning on Xi-fengs arm. Is that soup ready yet? she inquired when they were out of the room. Then, turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for her lunch. Mind you let me know if there is, she said. I have the power to make Fengie treat us to it. Aunt Xue laughed. You shouldnt tease the poor girl! Shes always getting nice things for you. But youre not much of an eater at the best of times. Dont you believe it, Aunt! said Xi-feng. Grannie knows how to tuck in. Shed have eaten me by now if she werent afraid that shed find me a bit too vinegary. This set them all off laughing. Even Bao-yu, in the inner room, had to join in, though it hurt him to do so. Aroma, standing beside him, was helpless with mirth. Mrs Lian really is a caution! Bao-yu took her hand and drew her down beside him. Come! he said. You must be tired. Youve been on your feet for hours. Hey, youve forgotten! said Aroma. While Miss Baos still in the courtyard, you ought to ask her if shell let Oriole come over to do that knotting for you. Yes, said Bao-yu. Im glad you reminded me. He raised his head and shouted towards the window. Cousin Bao! If you can spare her, after youve had your lunch, would you mind sending Oriole here to do some knotting for me Yes, certainly, said Bao-chai, turning back to reply. Ill send her over presently. Grandmother Jia and the others had Stopped to listen. Not having heard properly, the old lady asked what it was, Bao-chai explained. Oh do, my dear! said Grandmother Jia. Do let him have her to do the knotting I If you need someone in her place, I have plenty of free hands in my apartment. Just pick which ever of my maids you like to wait on you. Aunt Xue and Bao-chai were amused. Let her go to him by all means, said Aunt Xue, but there certainly wont be any need of a stand-in. She has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is. They had been walking on as they talked and presently came upon Xiang-yun, Patience and Caltrop picking balsams beside an artificial mountain of rock. Seeing Grandmother Jia and the rest coming, they left off their flower gathering and came forward to join them. Soon the little party emerged from the Garden. Fearing that Grandmother Jia might be fatigued, Lady Wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down for a while in her apartment. The old ladys feet were indeed beginning to trouble her and she nodded in consent. Lady Wang sent a maid on ahead to prepare for her arrival. Aunt Zhao was prudently avoiding Lady Wang for the time being by feigning sick, so of the two concubines it was only Aunt Zhou who came out with the old women-servants and maids of the apartment to welcome Grandmother Jia, holding up the door blind for her to enter and arranging the pillows and back-rest for her on the kang.
Her subscription is for forty-eight pounds of oil and a pound of lampwicks a day. Her sea of light is pretty nearly as big as a cistern. Then theres the Marquis of Jin-xiangs lady twenty pounds of oil a day. Oh, and theres some pays for ten pounds a day, some for eight pounds, three pounds, five pounds- all sorts. All of them I keep their seas of light burning for them, back at my house. Grandmother Jia nodded thoughtfully. One thing I should mention, said Mother Ma observing the thoughtfulness if the offering is for an older persona mother or father, sayit doesnt matter how much you subscribe but if its an older person making it for a younger one, like as it may be Your Ladyship for Bao-yu, you dont want to subscribe too much, or it would overload his luck and have the opposite effect. In the case of Your Ladyship subscribing for Bao-yu, I should suggest between five and seven pounds a day. Make it five pounds a day, then, said Grandmother Jia. Well work out the total and send you a months supply every month. Amitabha, Merciful Buddha! Bless His Holy Name! said Mother Ma. As a further precaution Grandmother Jia called in some of Bao-yus maids and told them that in future whenever Bao-yu went out anywhere his pages were to be provided with several strings of cash to give as alms to any itinerant monks or priests or any poor or afflicted persons they might meet upon the way. After seeing Grandmother jia, Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at various other apartments. Presently she came to Aunt Zhaos room. After they had exchanged greetings, Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup of tea. Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with, and Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous remnants of material. Im looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of, dearie, said Mother Ma. I suppose you havent got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do? It doesnt matter about the colour. Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh Take a look at this lot! You wont find anything much worth having here. Nothing worth having in this family ever comes my way. But youre welcome to pick out a couple of pieces if you dont mind the poor quality. Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap, and having picked out several pieces, stuffed them into her sleeve. I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an offering to the Medicine Buddha, said Aunt Zhao. Have you managed to make it yet? Oh yes. That was done days ago. Holy Name! said Aunt Zhao. Id do it oftener if things were a bit easier but you know the saying my heart is willing but my purse is lean. Dont you worry about that! said Mother Ma. You only have to hold out a few more years. When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service, youll be able to afford all the good works you want. Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose Hfn! Lets not talk about it! Itll be no different then from what it is now Huan and I will never be able to compete with the Other One. Its like the Heavenly Dragon appearing when he comes on the scene. Mind you, I dont hold it against the child. Hes a good-looking boy, is Bao-yu, and you can understand the grown-ups being silly about him. No, th is is the one I cant stand. As she uttered the word this, she held up two fingers. Mother Ma guessed her meaning Number Twothe younger of the Rong mansions two daughters-in-law. You mean Mrs Lian? she said. Aunt Zhaos face assumed an expression of terror. Motioning agitatedly to the other to remain silent, she got up, went to the door, raised the door-blind, looked around, and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers, came back and sat down again, her face close to Mother Mas. Shes a dreadful person dreadful! If that woman doesnt end up by carrying off every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with, my names not Zhao! Mother Ma sensed interesting possibilities in this conversation, and was quick to explore them It doesnt need you to tell me that, she said. You surely dont think I havent noticed that? Ive often wondered why you all let her get away with itthough I suppose its probably just as well you do. My dear good woman, said Aunt Zhao, weve no choice but to let her get away with it.
Go on! Cut away! said Bao-yu. I shant be wearing the wretched thing again anyway, so it doesnt matter. Preoccupied with the quarrel, the four of them had failed to notice several old women, who had been drawn by the sound of it to investigate. Apprehensive, when they saw Dai-yu hysterically weeping and vomiting and Bao-yu trying to smash his jade, of the dire consequences to be expected from a scene of such desperate passion, they had hurried off in a body to the front of the mansion to report the matter to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang, hoping in this way to establish in advance that whatever the consequences might be, they were not responsible for them. From their precipitate entry and the grave tone of their announcement Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang assumed that some major catastrophe had befallen and hurried with them into the Garden to find out what it was. Their arrival filled Aroma with alarm. What did Nightingale want to go troubling Their Ladyships for? she thought crossly, supposing that the talebearer had been sent to them by Nightingale while Nightingale for her part was angry with Aroma, thinking that the talebearer must have been one of Aromas minions. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang entered the room to find a silent Bao-yu and a silent Dai-yu, neither of whom, when questioned, would admit that anything at all was the matter. They therefore visited their wrath on the beads of the two unfortunate maids, insisting that it was entirely owing to their negligence that matters had got so much Out of hand. Unable to defend themselves, the girls were obliged to endure a long and abusive dressing-down, after which Grandmother Jia concluded the affair by carrying Bao-yu off to her own apartment. Next day, the third of the fifth month, was Xue Pans birthday and there was a family party with plays, to which the Jias were all invited. Bao-yu, who had still not seen Dai-yu since his outburstwhich he now deeply regrettedwas feeling far too dispirited to care about seeing plays, and declined to go on the ground -that he was feeling unwell. Dai-yu, though somewhat overcome on the day previous to this by the sultry weather, had by no means been seriously ill. Arguing that if she was not ill, it was impossible that he should be, she felt sure, when she heard of Bao-yus excuse, that it must be a false one. He usually enjoys drinking and watching plays, she thought. If hes not going, it must be because he is still angry about yesterday or if it-isnt that, it must be because hes heard that Im not going and doesnt want to go without me. Oh I I should never have cut that cord! Now he wont ever wear his jade again - unless I make him another cord to wear it on. So she, too, regretted the quarrel. Grandmother Jia knew that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were angry with each other, but she had been assuming that they would see each other at the Xues party and make it up there. When neither of them turned up at it, she became seriously upset. Im a miserable old sinner, she grumbled. It must be my punishment for something I did wrong in a past life to have to live with a pair of such obstinate, addle-headed little geese! Im sure there isnt a day goes by without their giving me some fresh cause for anxiety. It must he fate. Thats what it says in the proverb, after all Tis Fate brings foes and loes tegither. Ill be glad when Ive drawn my last breath and closed my old eyes for the last time then the two of them can snap and snarl at each other to their hearts content, for I shant be there to see it, and what the eye doesnt see, the heart doesnt grieve. The Lord knows, its not my wish to drag on this wearisome life any longer! Amidst these muttered grumblings the old lady began to cry. -1094 In due course her words were transmitted to Bao-yu and Dai-yu. It happened that neither of them had ever heard the saying Tis Fate brings foes and loes tegither, and its impact on them, hearing it for the first time, was like that of a Zen perception something to be meditated on with bowed head and savoured with a gush of tears. Though they had still not made it up since their quarrel, the difference between them had now vanished completely In Naiads House one to the wind made moan, In Green Delights one to the moon complained, to parody the well-known lines. Or, in homelier verses Though each was in a different place, Their hearts in friendship beat as one.
Grannie Liu was ignorant of the foreign mode of light-and-shadow painting and was sorely puzzled to discover, on touching the picture, that it did not in fact stick out but was flat all over. Turning from it with a sigh and a shake of her head, she moved on to a little doorway in the wooden partition-wall, over which hung a green, flower-patterned portire. She raised the portiere and went inside. In the room she now entered everything, from the top of the surrounding walls, delicately incised with shapes of swords, vases, musical instruments, incense-burners and the like, to the lavish furnishing below, in which The weavers glowing art combined With gleam of gold and. orient pearl, and thence down to the very floor of brilliantly patterned green glazed tiles beneath her feet, was such as to make even more dazzled the eyes of an already intoxicated old woman. She looked for the way out - but where was it? To the left of her there was a bookcase, to the right a screen. She tried behind the screen. Ah, yes! There was the door. But there too, to her intense surprise, approaching her from the opposite direction and causing her a momentary palpitation of the heart, was another old woman, whom she took to be her old gossip from the village. What? are you here too? she asked her, I suppose you were wondering what had become of me these last few days. Well, it was neighbourly to come and look for me. Which of the young women brought you in? She noticed, with much amusement, that her old neighbours head was covered all over with flowers. Hoo! Youll catch it! Picking the flowers from their garden to put in your own hair. Well I never! The other merely grinned back at her and said nothing. Grannie Liu stretched out a hand to give her the touch of shame. The other old woman stretched her hand out too to stop her. After a. brief soundless skirmish, Grannie Liu managed to get her finger onto the other ones face. But no sooner had she done so than she recoiled in horror, for the cheek she touched was as cold and hard as a block of ice. Suddenly the truth dawned on her Ive heard of rich folks having what they call dressing mirrors in their houses. Mayhap Im standing in front of one of them and its myself Im looking at. She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no doubt of it it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She laughed at her own error. Yes, but how do I get out of here? she thought, as she continued to finger the mirrors carved surround. Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some moments she rolled her eyes in terror. The mirror mirror in fact a kind of door. It had a West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Grannie Liu, in feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror slide back into the panelling, revealing the doorway underneath. Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet. But though she intended no more than a few moments rest, as soon as she had sat down, her weariness overcame her. Her head went down and her feet went up as though she was no longer in possession of them a darkness closed over her eyes, and she sank back on the bed, fast asleep. Outside in the Garden meanwhile, the cousins were beginning to wonder what had become of her, and Ban-er, missing his grandmother, became panicky and began to cry. Perhaps shes fallen into the privy, one of the young people suggested cheerfully. Wed better send someone to have a look. Two old women were sent to the privy to investigate. When they reported back hat she was not there, the others were at a loss to think where she could have got to. It was Aroma who hit on the correct hypothesis. She must have missed the way back because she was drunk. If she followed the path in the wrong direction, it will have taken her to our back Courtyard. Now if she went through the pergola and then on into the house through the back door, shell probably have been seen by one of the maids. If she didnt go in through the pergola but went on walking in a south-westerly direction, Heaven only knows where shell end up! I think Id better go and have a look.
Bao-yu and Tan-chun had come in while she was talking and quietly sat down to listen. Bao-yu was impressed. To judge by what youve just said, you dont need to read any more poetry. The Emperor Jian-wen once remarked that appreciation needs not to seek far afield. From your discussion of that last couplet, I should say that you have already reached the sam dhi! Actually, although you wont know this yet, said Dai-yu, that smoke-thread climbs line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet. If I show it to you, I think you will agree that it is even more austerely effective than Wang Weis line. She took down a copy of Tao Yuan-mings Works, hunted out the couplet she had in mind, and handed it to her to look at -1014 Half-lost in haze the distant haunts of men, Whose dawdling smoke the unseen hamlet marks. Caltrop read it and nodded approvingly Yes, I see. He got the idea for climbs from the dawdling of this earlier line. Bao-yu laughed delightedly. Perfect! You must end your discussion there. If you go on any longer, youll begin unlearning what youve already discovered. You can start writing poetry yourself now, straight away. Its sure to be good. I can see I shall soon be writing an invitation asking you to join our poetry club, said Tan-chun smilingly. Dont make fun of me, Miss Tan, said Caltrop. Writing poetry is something Ive always wanted to do, and now Ive got the chance, Im learning for the fun of it. I dont expect I shall ever be any good. Good heavens! we only write for the fun of it ourselves, said Tan-chun. You surely dont imagine that what we write is good poetry? If we set ourselves up to be real poets, people outside this Garden who got to hear of it would laugh so loud that their teeth would drop out! Thats what Mencius calls throwing yourself away, said Bao-yu. You shouldnt do that. The other day, when I was discussing Xi-chuns painting with some of Fathers gentlemen, they told me they had heard about our poetry club and asked if they could see some of our poems, so I wrote a few out for them from memory. I assure you, they were genuinely impressed. In fact, they have calligraphed them for blocks to have them printed. Is this really true? Tan-chun and Dai-yu asked incredulously. If anyones telling lies, it must be the parrot said Bao-yu. The two girls were aghast. You really are the limit! Quite apart from the fact that the poems arent good enough, you have no business to go showing our stuff to people outside. Whats the harm? said Bao-yu. If those famous poems written by poetesses in days gone by had never been -taken outside -the womens quarters, we shouldnt know about them today. Just then Xi-chuns maid Picture arrived and called Bao-yu away to her mistress. Caltrop pressed Dai-yu to lend her the volume of Du Fu she also begged Dai-yu and Tan-chun to set her a subject for a poem. Let me try my hand at writing one myself, she said, -and you can correct it for me. Last night there was a very fine moon, said Dai-yu. Ive been thinking of writing a poem about it myself, but havent yet got round to it. Why dont you write a poem about the moon? You can use sky and light as your rhymes but I wont set the other rhyme words for you, you can use whichever ones you like. Clutching the volume of poems, Caltrop returned in great glee and at once began thinking about her composition. After working out the first line or two, she could not resist peeping at the Du Fu and reading a couple of poems. And in this way she continued, alternately reading and composing by fits and starts, too excited to think about eating or drinking or to sit still in the same place for two or three minutes together. Why give yourself so much trouble when you dont have to? Bao-chai asked her. Its all that Frowners fault. I shall have to go and have it out with her. You are inclined to be a dreamer at the best of times, but now you are becoming a real case I Please, Miss Bao I said Caltrop. You are putting me off. She was writing while she said this. Soon she had completed the draft of a poem and handed it to Bao-chai to look at. Bao-chai read it and laughed.
The pages were too frightened not to comply. Two held Bao-yu face downwards on a bench while a third lifted up the flattened bamboo sweep and began to strike him with it across the hams. After about a dozen blows Jia Zheng, not satisfied that his executioner was hitting hard enough, kicked him impatiently aside, wrested the bamboo from his grasp, and, gritting his teeth, brought it down with the utmost savagery on the places that had already been beaten. At this point the literary gentlemen, sensing that Bao-yu was in serious danger of life and limb, came in again to remonstrate but Jia Zheng refused to hear them. Ask him what he has done and then tell me if you think I should spare him, he said. It is the encouragement of people like you that has corrupted him and now, when things have come to this pass, you intercede for him. I suppose you would like me to wait until he commits parricide, or worse. Would you still intercede for him then? They could see from this reply that he was beside himself. Wasting no further time on words, they quickly withdrew and looked for someone to take a message through inside. Lady Wang did not stop to tell Grandmother Jia when she received it. She snatched up an outer garment, pulled it about her, and, supported by a single maid, rushed off, not caring what menfolk might see her, to the outer study, bursting into it with such suddenness that the literary gentlemen and other males present were unable to avoid her. Her entry provoked Jia Zheng to fresh transports of fury. Faster and harder fell the bamboo on the prostrate form of Bao-yu, which by now appeared to be unconscious, for when the boys holding it down relaxed their hold and fled from -their Mistresss presence, it had long since ceased even to twitch. Even so Jia Zheng would have continued beating it had not Lady Wang clasped the bamboo to her bosom and prevented him. Enough I said Jia Zheng. Today you are determined, all of you, to drive me insane. No doubt Bao-yu deserved to be beaten, said Lady Wang tearfully, but it is bad for you to get over excited. Besides, you ought to have some consideration for Lady Jia. She is not at all well in this frightful heat. It may not seem to you of much consequence to kill Bao-yu, but think what the effect would be on her. Dont try that sort of talk with me! said Jia Zheng bitterly. Merely by fathering a monster like this I have proved myself an unfilial son yet whenever in the past I have tried to discipline him, the rest of you have all conspired against me to protect him. Now that I have the opportunity at last, I may as well finish off what I have begun and put him down, like the vermin he is, before he can do any more damage. So saying, he took up a rope and would have put his threat into execution, had not Lady Wang held her arms around him to prevent it. Of course you should discipline your son, she said, weeping, but you have a wife too, Sir Zheng, dont forget. I am nearly fifty now and this wretched boy is the only son I have. If you insist on making an example of him, I dare not do much to dissuade you. But to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless. Better strangle me first, if you are going to strangle him. Let the two of us die together. At least I shall have some support then in the world to come, if all support in this world is to be denied me! With these words she threw herself upon Bao-yus body and, lifting up her voice, began weeping with noisy abandon. Jia Zheng, who had heard her with a sigh, sank into a chair and himself broke down in a fit of weeping. Presently Lady Wang began to examine the body she was clasping. Bao-yus face was ashen, his breathing was scarcely perceptible, and the trousers of thin green silk which clothed the lower part of his body were so soaked with blood that their colour was no longer recognizable. Feverishly she unfastened his waistband and drew them back. Everywhere, from the upper part of his buttocks down to his calves, was either raw and bloody or purplish black with bruises. Not an inch of sound flesh was to be seen. The sight made her cry out involuntarily. Oh my son! My unfortunate son! Once more she broke down into uncontrollable weeping. Her own words reminded her of the son she had already lost, and now, with added bitterness, she began to call out his name. Oh, Zhu! Zhu! If only you had lived, I shouldnt have minded losing a hundred other sons!
I have to economize, she would say, to make up for what Sir She wastes. Among the children and servants of the household there was not one whom she trusted or whose advice she would listen to. From the tone of what she had just heard, Xi-feng knew that her mother-in-laws obstinate streak had been aroused and that it would now be quite useless to reason with her. She therefore smiled even more disarmingly and promptly changed her tack. Of course. You are right, Mother. I havent had enough experience to be able to judge these matters. But now I come to think of it, its only natural that a mother should give what she treasures to her own son. Who else would Grandma give her favourite maidor any other precious thingto if not to Father? One shouldnt believe everything that people say about other people behind their backs. No, I can see that now. I have been too credulous. One has only to think how you and Father are with Lian. Many a time when Lian has done something he shouldnt have done, you and Father have spoken as if you could hardly wait to lay your hands on him, but when he eventually turned up, you have forgiven everything and ended up by giving him some treasured possession. Ive no doubt that in this case it will turn out in exactly the same sort of way with Grandma and Father. As a matter of fact, Grandma is in rather a good mood today, so if you are going to ask her, it would probably be best to do so straight away. Let me go over first to keep her sweet for you. Ill find some excuse for leaving and taking the others with me when you arrive. That will give you a good opportunity for raising this matter. If she says yes, that will, of course, be splendid. But even if she doesnt, no great harm will have been done, because no one else will know about it. Hearing what she wanted to hear, Lady Xings good humour returned and she proceeded to tell Xi-feng what she had already decided to do. Actually my idea is not to mention this to Lady Jia at first. I think I shall begin by having a quiet word with Faithful herself. Though she may be bashful, as long as she doesnt say anything against it when Ive explained it all to her, I shall know that as far as she is concerned it is all right. If I talk to Lady Jia then, though she may be unwilling to part with her, she wont be able to get over the fact that Faithful herself is willing to leave. Theres no holding someone who has a mind to go, as they say. I think there should be no difficulty. Trust you for sound planning, Mother! said Xi-feng. That way sounds fool-proof. After all, every one of these girls is ambitiousthey all want to improve their position and get on in the worldand its unthinkable that she should throw away this chance of becoming almost a mistress in order to remain a maid and end up marrying one of the grooms. Exactly! said Lady Xing. Thats exactly what I thought. Any of these senior maids would give her ears for a chance like this. Anyway, you go over nowonly dont breathe a word of this to anyone else!and Ill follow later on, when Ive had my dinner. Xi-feng reflected. Faithfuls no fool, she thought. Whatever Mother says, its far from certain that shell accept. Suppose I do go first and Mother follows later. If Faithful says yes, all well and good but if she doesnt, Mother has such a suspicious nature that shes sure to think its because Ive blabbed and been encouraging the girl to play hard to get. It will be humiliating for her to discover that my prediction was right, and that will make her angry and then shell take it out on me which wont be very amusing. It would be better if we went over together then, whether Faithful accepts or not, no suspicion can possibly fall on me. Just now as I was on the point of coming over, she said, bringing these reflections to a rapid conclusion, two crates of quails arrived from my aunts. I told the servants to fry them, intending to send them over later for your dinner. Then, on my way in through your gate, I met some of the boys from here with your carriage. They said it had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended. Why not make use of my carriage instead? We can go over together in it now, and you can dine at my place afterwards on the quails. Finding this proposal acceptable, Lady Xing called in her maids to help her change then, supported by her ever-solicitous daughter-in-law, she got into the latters carriage and drove with her to the establishment next door.
Its because I wanted to make you laugh, Grannie. Laughter makes the humours circulate. Were going to be eating crabs shortly, and I was afraid that the cold of the crab-meat might settle on your heart. If I can make you laugh and stir your humours up, youll be able to eat as much crab as you like without taking any harm from it. In that case I shall have to keep you with me all the time, so that I am always laughing, said Grandmother Jia. Ill have to stop you going home at night. Its because you indulge her so much that she is so cheeky, Mother, said Lady Wang. By saying things like that to her you will make her even worse. But I like her cheekiness I said Grandmother Jia. After all, theres no harm in it. She knows whats what underneath it all, of course she does. I think its nice that the young people should feel free to joke and laugh a bit when we are all on our own together. We dont want them behaving like a lot of stuffed dummies, surely? While she was saying this, they all passed into the smaller pavilion, where tea was served, after which Xi-feng came bustling in with winecups and chopsticks and began to lay. Grandmother Jia sat with Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu at a centre table, and Xiang-yun, Lady Wang, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun at a table on the east side of the room. A little table was laid for Xi4eng and Li Wan on the west side of the doorway, but this was only for forms sake, since both of them remained on their feet in order to wait on the other two tables. We shant want all the crabs at once, said Xi-feng to the servants bringing them in. Ten will be enough to start with. The others can go back into the steamer. She called for some water, and after washing her hands, stood at the centre table facing Grandmother Jia and began shelling the crabs. She offered the first meat, as a courtesy, to Aunt Xue. No thank you, said Aunt Xue. I dont need anyone to do it for me. I like doing it myself and getting crabby fingers. I think they taste better when you eat them with your fingers. Xi-feng gave the crab-meat she had prepared to Grandmother Jia. The second lot she offered to Bao-yu. Then she called for some really hot wine. She also sent a little maid to fetch mung-bean flour scented with chrysanthemum leaves and cassia for cleaning the lingers with and removing the smell of crab. Xiang-yun sat with the others at her own table for a while, but as soon as she had finished her first crab, got up to look after her guests. She also went outside and gave orders for a plate of crabs to be taken to Aunt Zhao and another to Aunt Zhou. At once Xi-feng came bearing down on her. Youre not used to this. You get on with your eating and leave this to me! Ill have mine when the rest of you have finished. But Xiang-yun, refusing to be put off, ordered a long table to be laid on the verandah at the far side of the Lotus Pavilion and invited the maids Faithful, Amber, Sunset, Suncloud and Patience to come and sit at it. Faithful glanced laughingly in Xi-feng direction. I cant very well sit down and eat while Mrs Lian is waiting on everybody. Thats all right, said Xi-feng. You all go and sit down. Ill take care of everything. At that Xiang-yun, too, went back to her seat. Li Wan and Xi-feng now made a brief pretence of joining in the party, but Xi-feng was soon on her feet again ministering to the rest. After a few minutes she went out on to the verandah, where Faithful and the other maids were regaling themselves with great gusto. They rose to their feet when they saw her come. What have you come Out here for, Mrs Lian? said Faithful. Cant you leave us alone to enjoy ourselves for a bit? Well, arent you disagreeable! said Xi-feng. Here am I doing all the work for you, but instead of thanks I get grumbled at! I was hoping you would offer me a drink. Faithful, laughing, quickly filled a winecup and held it to Xi-feng lips. Tilting her head back, Xi-feng drained it at a gulp. Amber and Sunset followed suit, and two more cupfuls went down in the same way.
Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things hes going to do to his rooms and the clothes hes going to have made and everything, just as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in. Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilots simplicity or at Bao-yus improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girls horns. She was carrying some patterns and sheet of paper. Youre to copy out these two patterns. She threw them in Crimsons direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson shouted after her Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off. What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for you and youre afraid theyll get cold? Theyre for Mackerel. The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam, plim-plam, pimpam, as fast as she had come. Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a brush to trace them with. After rummaging for several minutes she had only succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use. Funny! she said. I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day ... She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last. She turned to Melilot. Would you go and get it for me, then? Im afraid I cant, said Melilot. Miss Aromas waiting for me to fetch some boxes for her. Youll have to get it your-self. If Aromas waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time? said Crimson. If I hadnt asked you to go and get it, she wouldnt have been waiting, would she? Lazy little beast! She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of Bao-chais courtyard. She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she caught sight of Bao-yus old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, coming from the opposite direction and stood respectfully aside to wait for her. Where have you been, Mrs Li? she asked her. I didnt expect to see you here. Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand What do you think, my dear His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-plantingYin or Yun or whatever his name isso Nannie has to go and ask him in. Lets hope Their Ladyships dont find out about it. Therell be trouble if they do. Are you really going to ask him in? Yes. Why? Crimson laughed If your Mr Yun knows whats good for him, he wont agree to come. Hes no fool, said Nannie Li. Why shouldnt he? Any way, if he does come in, said Crimson, ignoring her question, you cant just bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. Youll have to take him back again yourself afterwards. You dont want him wandering off on his own. Theres no knowing who he might bump into. Crimson herself, was the secret hope. Gracious me! I havent got that much spare time, said Nannie Li. All Ive done is just to tell him that hes got to come. Ill send someone else to fetch him in when I get back presently - one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe. She hobbled off on her stick, leaving Crimson standing there in a muse, her mission to fetch the tracing-brush momentarily forgotten. She was still standing there a minute or two later when a little maid came along, who, seeing that it was Crimson, asked her what she was doing there. Crimson looked up. It was Trinket, another of the maids from Green Delights. Where are you going? Crimson asked her. Ive been sent to fetch Mr Yun, said Trinket. I have to bring him inside to meet Master Bao. She ran off on her way. At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again, this time with Jia Yun in tow. His eyes sought Crimsons and hers, as she made pretence of conversing with Trinket, sought his. Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished then Crimson felt herself blushing, and turning away abruptly, she made off for Allspice Court.
I expect youve got parents and dont like to say anything until youve heard from them. Why yes, very right and proper. I shall get in touch with your parents and no doubt you will be hearing from them in due course. Then anything you want to say, you will be able to say to them. With that she left, and went round to Xi-fengs apartment. Xi-feng had long since changed back into her ordinary clothes. As no one else was about, she had taken the opportunity of telling Patience about her interview with Lady Xing. Patience was amused, but shook her head doubtfully at Lady Xings optimism. If you ask me, I think its very uncertain. From the way shes always spoken in the past when weve been alone together, I should think shell-refuse. Anyway, well just have to wait and see. Lady Xing is sure to come here afterwards to talk about what happened, said Xi-feng. If Faithful has accepted, it will be all right but if Faithful hasnt accepted, shes not going to be in a very good mood, and it would embarrass her to have you here while she was telling me about it. Youd better order them to prepare some of those quails and a few other dishes to go with them so that I can offer her dinner when she arrives but after youve done that, youd better take yourself off for a bit and dont come hack until you think shes gone. Patience gave Xi-fengs instructions to the cook and then went off to enjoy herself in the Garden. When Lady Xing left, Faithful felt sure that she would go straight to Xi-fengs for consultation and that soon after that someone else would arrive and put the same question to her again. it seemed to her that the best way of avoiding this would be to decamp. She sought out Amber in order to give some cover to her exit. If Her Old Ladyship should ask for me, tell her that Im not feeling well and couldnt eat any lunch today. Say Ive gone to walk in the Garden for a bit and shall be back again shortly. Amber agreed to do this and Faithful went off to wander about in the Garden. While she -was doing so, she came by coincidence upon Patience doing exactly the same thing. Seeing no one else but the two of them around, Patience felt no compunction in revealing her newly acquired knowledge. Look whos here!, she called out teasingly. Mrs Faithful! Faithful blushed bright red. I suppose youre in the plot against me too. Well, never mind. Ill be having it out with your mistress presently. Patience could see that Faithful was really angry, and regretted her foolish jibe. Taking her by the hand, she led her to some rocks beneath a stand of maple trees where they could sit down together, and proceeded to tell her all that Xi-feng had a few minutes earlier told her. Thank you, said Faithful when she had finished. You and I at least are still friends. When I think of our set how many were we?Aroma, Amber, Candida, Nightingale, Suncloud, Silver, Musk, Ebony, Kingfishershe left to go with Miss ShiCharmer and Goldenthey both diedSnow pink that was dismissedyou and methere must have been a dozen of us altogether when we were young we always told each other everything and shared everything together but now that we are older, the others all seem to go their different ways and just arent interested. Not me, though I havent changed. Im just the same as I always was. I dont have any secrets from any of you. Now listen Im telling you this now for you to rememberonly dont go passing it on to your Mrs Lian. Its not just a question of not wanting to be his concubine. I wouldnt go to Sir She, not if Lady Xing had died and he sent matchmakers and witnesses and asked me to be his proper wife! Patience was about to answer when there was a laugh from behind the rocks on which they were sitting and a voice called out. Whats this shameless boasting I hear? Its enough to set ones teeth on edge! Startled, the two of them rose to their feet and went to look behind the rockery to find out who it was. Aroma emerged, laughing, as they did so. Whats all this about? Tell me about it too., The three of them sat down on the rocks together and Patience retold all that she had just told Faithful. Well! said Aroma when Patience had finished. I suppose its not for someone in my place to say so, but what a nasty old man! Unless theyre downright misshapen, just about no one is safe from him.
Aroma turned her head and shot her lips out in the direction of the figure sleeping on the bed. Him? Hes too big to wear that sort of thing, surely? He wouldnt wear them to start with. Thats why I try to make them so nicelyso that when he sees them he cant resist putting them on. I try to get him to wear them in this hot weather, so that if he uncovers himself in his sleep, theres no risk of his getting chilled. If you think theres a1ot of work in this one, you ought to see the one hes wearing! I wonder you can have the patience, said Bao-chai. Ive done such a lot of work on it today, said Aroma, my neck is quite stiff from bending over. She smiled at Bao-chai entreatingly Do us a favour, Miss sit here a bit in my place, will you, while I go off and stretch my legs? Ill be back directly. Saying this, she slipped quietly out, not waiting for a reply. So intent was Bao-chai on the embroidery that she sank down almost without realizing what she was doing into the place that Aroma had just vacated. It really was a most beautiful piece of work in fact, she found it irresistible, and taking up the needle, began sewing it where Aroma had left off. Meanwhile Dai-yu, on her way back to have a bath, had run into Xiang-yun and agreed to the latters proposal that they should together call on Aroma to congratulate her on her promotion. They arrived in the courtyard of Green Delights to find everything plunged in silence. Xiang-yun went round to the side to see if Aroma was in any of the maids rooms. Dai-yu went up to the main building and peeped through the gauze window into Bao-yus bedroom. She saw Bao-yu, clothed in little else but a thin, rose-coloured shirt, sprawled out asleep on the bed and Bao-chai sitting beside him sewing, with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side. For some moments she goggled incredulously at this touching domestic scene, then, fearful of disturbing it, she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles. When she had somewhat subdued them, she beckoned to Xiang-yun to come over and look. Wondering what extraordinary spectacle could have put her in such a state, Xiang-yun hurried over for a peep. She, too, found the scene inside a comical one and would have burst out laughing but in her case it was the consideration that Bao-chai had always been so kind to her that caused her to control her mirth. And knowing how merciless Dai-yu could be with her witticisms, she took her by the hand and dragged her away, explaining as she did so that she had just remembered that Aroma had said something about going at noon to wash some clothes in the lake. Im sure thats where she will be, she said to Dai-yu. Lets go and look for her there. Dai-yu was not in the least deceived, and showed as much by her sardonic laugh. But she followed her nonetheless. Bao-chai meanwhile continued her sewing undisturbed. She had just completed her second, or maybe it was her third petal, when Bao-yu, who appeared to be dreaming, cried out angrily in his sleep. Why should I believe what those old monks and Taoists say? I dont believe in the marriage of gold and jade. I believe in the marriage of stone and flower. The words astounded her. She had still not recovered from the shock of hearing them when Aroma returned. What, isnt he awake yet? Bao-chai shook her head. I just now ran into Miss Lin and Miss Shi, said Aroma. I suppose they didnt come in here, did they? Not that I know of, said Bao-chai. She glanced up at Aroma with a sly smile Did they tell you anything? Aroma coloured. Oh, a lot of nonsense - as usual I They were only joking, though. They werent joking, said Bao-chai, - not this time. I was going to tell you myself, but you went rushing off before I had a chance to. Just at that moment a maid arrived from Xi-feng summoning Aroma to go and see her. There you are I said Bao-chai. Thatll be what she wants to see you about. Aroma had to arouse two of the sleeping maids to take her place in the inner room then she and Bao-chai left Green Delights together. They parted company outside, and Aroma went off to Xi-fengs place on her own.
These strong decoctions are all very well provided she only takes one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment its probably best if she sticks to pills. The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day, said Lady Wang, but I just cant remember the name. I know the names of most of those pills, said Bao-yu. I expect he wanted her to take Ginseng Tonic Pills. No, that wasnt it, said Lady Wang. Eight Gem Motherwort Pills? said Bao-yu. Zhangs Dextrals?. Zhangs Sinistrals? If it wasnt any of them, it was probably Dr Cuis Adenophora Kidney Pills. No, said Lady Wang, it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a Vajra in it. Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands Ive never heard of Vajra Pills. If there are Vajra Pills, I suppose there must be Buddha Boluses ! The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. I should think it was probably The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills, she said. Yes, yes, thats it! said Lady Wang. Of course! How stupid of me! No, Mother, not stupid, said Bao-yu. Its the strain. All those Vajra-kings and Bodhisattvas have been overworking you! Youre a naughty boy to make fun of your poor mother, said Lady Wang. A good whipping from your Pa is what you need. Oh, Father doesnt whip me for that sort of thing nowadays, said Bao-yu. Now that we know the name of the pills, we must get them to buy some for your Cousin Lin, said Lady Wang. None of those things are any good, said Bao-yu. You give me three hundred and sixty taels of silver and Ill make up some pills for Cousin Lin that I guarantee will have her completely cured before she has finished the first boxful. Stuff! said Lady Wang. Whoever heard of a medicine that cost so much? No, honestly! said Bao-yu. This prescription is a very unusual one with very special ingredients. I cant remember all of them, but I know they include -5947 the caul of a first-born child a ginseng root shaped like a man, with the leaves still on it a turtle-sized polygonum root and lycoperdon from the stump of a thousand-year-old pine-tree. Actually, though, theres nothing so very special about those ingredients. Theyre all in the standard pharmacopoeia. For sovereign remedies they use ingredients that would really make you jump. I once gave the prescription for one to Cousin Xue. He was more than a year begging me for it before I would give it to him, and it took him another two or three years and nearly a thousand taels of silver to get all the ingredients together. Ask Bao-chai if you dont believe me, Mother. I know nothing about it, said Bao-chai. Ive never heard it mentioned. Its no good telling Aunt to ask me. You see! Bao-chai is a good girl. She doesnt tell lies, said Lady Wang. Bao-yu was standing in the middle of the floor below the kang. He clapped his hands at this and turned to the others appealingly. But its the truth Im telling you. This is no lie. As lie turned, he happened to catch sight of Dai-yu, who was sitting behind Bao-chai, stilling mockingly and stroking her cheek with her fingerwhich in sign4anguage means, You are a great big liar and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. But X-feng, who happened to be in the inner room supervising the laying of the table and had overheard the preceding remarks, now emerged into the outer room to corroborate Its quite true, what Bao says. I dont think he is making it up, she said. Not so long ago Cousin Xue came to me asking for some pearls, and when I asked him what he wanted them for, he said, To make medicine with. Then he started grumbling about the trouble he was having in getting the right ingredients and how he had half a mind not to make this medicine up after all. I said, What medicine? and he told me that it was a prescription that Cousin Bao had given him and reeled off a lot of ingredientsI cant remember them now. Of course, he said, I could easily enough buy a few pearls only these have to be ones that have been worn. Thats why Im asking you for them. If you havent got any loose ones, he said, a few pearls broken off a bit of jewellery would do.
But there too, to her intense surprise, approaching her from the opposite direction and causing her a momentary palpitation of the heart, was another old woman, whom she took to be her old gossip from the village. What? are you here too? she asked her, I suppose you were wondering what had become of me these last few days. Well, it was neighbourly to come and look for me. Which of the young women brought you in? She noticed, with much amusement, that her old neighbours head was covered all over with flowers. Hoo! Youll catch it! Picking the flowers from their garden to put in your own hair. Well I never! The other merely grinned back at her and said nothing. Grannie Liu stretched out a hand to give her the touch of shame. The other old woman stretched her hand out too to stop her. After a. brief soundless skirmish, Grannie Liu managed to get her finger onto the other ones face. But no sooner had she done so than she recoiled in horror, for the cheek she touched was as cold and hard as a block of ice. Suddenly the truth dawned on her Ive heard of rich folks having what they call dressing mirrors in their houses. Mayhap Im standing in front of one of them and its myself Im looking at. She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no doubt of it it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She laughed at her own error. Yes, but how do I get out of here? she thought, as she continued to finger the mirrors carved surround. Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some moments she rolled her eyes in terror. The mirror mirror in fact a kind of door. It had a West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Grannie Liu, in feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror slide back into the panelling, revealing the doorway underneath. Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet. But though she intended no more than a few moments rest, as soon as she had sat down, her weariness overcame her. Her head went down and her feet went up as though she was no longer in possession of them a darkness closed over her eyes, and she sank back on the bed, fast asleep. Outside in the Garden meanwhile, the cousins were beginning to wonder what had become of her, and Ban-er, missing his grandmother, became panicky and began to cry. Perhaps shes fallen into the privy, one of the young people suggested cheerfully. Wed better send someone to have a look. Two old women were sent to the privy to investigate. When they reported back hat she was not there, the others were at a loss to think where she could have got to. It was Aroma who hit on the correct hypothesis. She must have missed the way back because she was drunk. If she followed the path in the wrong direction, it will have taken her to our back Courtyard. Now if she went through the pergola and then on into the house through the back door, shell probably have been seen by one of the maids. If she didnt go in through the pergola but went on walking in a south-westerly direction, Heaven only knows where shell end up! I think Id better go and have a look. She hurried back to Green Delights, intending to ask the junior maids if they had seen her but the place was deserted they had all sneaked off elsewhere to play. Entering the main building by way of the front door, she made her way through the complicated carved partition. A thunderous snoring could be heard coming from the bedroom at the back. She hurried through. As she entered the bedroom, a heavy stink, compounded of farts and wine-fumes, assailed her nostrils. Her eyes travelled to the bed, from which the sounds were coming, and saw Grannie Liu, spreadeagled on her back and fast asleep. As soon as she had overcome her shock, she rushed up to the bed and shook her relentlessly until she woke. Grannie Liu opened her eyes wide and saw Aroma standing over her. Oh, miss! She scrambled hurriedly to her feet. C Oh, I am sorry! Anywaypraise be! I havent dirtied the bed. She felt it nervously, to make sure. Aroma, mortally afraid that someone would overhear and Bao-yu get to know of what had happened, gestured to her violently not to speak.
Mischievous little blighter, arent you? said Bao-yu. What do you want to go shooting them for, poor little things? Ive got no reading to do today, said Jia Lan, and I dont like to hang about doing nothing, so I thought Id practise my archery and equitation. Goodness! Youd better not waste time jawing, then, said Bao-yu, and left the young toxophilite to his pursuits. Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the gate of a courtyard. Denser than feathers on the phoenix tail The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragons moan. The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiads House. Of their own accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard. The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to the ground but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green gauze of the casement. He pressed his face to the gauze but before his eyes could distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound of a voice speaking Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love. Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker. He could see her now It was Dai-yu, of course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously. He laughed Why each day in a drowsy waking dream of love? he asked through the window the words were from his beloved Western Chamber then going to the doorway he lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room. Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yus old wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels Miss Lins asleep, sir Would you mind coming back again after shes woken up? Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh Whos asleep? The three old women laughed apologetically. Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep. Nightingale! Come inside now! Your mistress is awake. Having shouted for Nightingale, the three guardians of morality retired. What do you mean by coming into peoples rooms when theyre asleep? said Dai-yu, smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the beds edge patting her hair into shape. At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him. He sank into a chair and smiled back at her What was that you were saying just now before I came in? I didnt say anything, said Dai-yu. Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her Put that on your tongue, girl! I heard you say it. While they were talking to one another, Nightingale came In. Nightingale, said Bao-yu, what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours? Excellent tea? said Nightingale. Theres nothing very special about the tea we drink here. If nothing but the best will do, youd better wait for Aroma to come. Never mind about him! said Dai-yu. First go and get me some water! He is our guest, said Nightingale. I cant fetch you any water until Ive given him his tea. And she went to pour him a cup. Good girl! said Bao-yu. If with your amorous mistress I should wed, Tis you, sweet maid, must make our bridal bed. The words, like Dai-yus languorous line, were from Western Chamber, but in somewhat dubious taste. Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them. In an instant the smile had vanished from her face. -294 What was that you said? He laughed -294 I didnt say anything. Dai-yu began to cry. This is your latest amusement, I suppose. Every time you hear some coarse expression outside or read some crude, disgusting book, you have to come back here and give me the benefit of it. I am to become a source of entertainment for the menfolk now, it seems. She rose, weeping, from the bed and went outside. Bao-yu followed her in alarm. Dearest coz, it was very wrong of me to say that, but it just slipped out without thinking. Please dont go and tell! I promise never to say anything like that again.
Bao-chais strictures about fooling around and his mothers insistence that he had brought about Bao-yus beating by means of a deliberate indiscretion had exasperated him beyond endurance. He jumped about excitedly, protesting with the most solemn and desperate oaths that he was innocent. Id like to find the comedian whos been making up these stories about me, he shouted, turning in anger upon the domestics. Ill smash his rotten face in if I do. Of course, I know what this is all about you all want to show how concerned you are for poor, darling Bao-yu, so youve decided to do it at my expense. What is he, anyway? a Deva King? Every time his dad gives him a few whacks on the bum, the whole household is in a state of uproar about it for days on end. I remember that time Uncle Zheng beat him for doing something he shouldnt have and old Lady Jia decided that Cousin Zhen was at the bottom of it. She had the poor so-and-so hauled up in front of her and there was hell to pay. Now, this time, you want to drag me into it. All right then I dont care. A life for a life. Ill go in there and kill the little blighter then you can all do what you like to me. In the midst of this bawling he had picked up a door bar and was evidently going off to execute his threat but his distraught mother clung to him and prevented him from going. You stupid creature! she said. Who do you think youre going to hit with that? If youre going to hit anyone, youd better begin with me! Xue Pans exasperation had now reached such a pitch that his eyes stood out in his head like a pair of copper bells. This is rich! he shouted. You wont let me go and finish him off, yet you wont stop provoking me by making up all these lies. Every day that fellow stays alive means one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with. Wed much better die, the pair of us, and make an end of it! Have a little self-control! said Bao-chai, joining in her mothers efforts to restrain him. Cant you see how upset poor Mamma is? You ought to be trying to calm her, not making things worse with this uproar. Oh yes ! you can say that now, said Xue Pan, but it was you who started all this by telling her about me, wasnt it? Its all very well to blame me for telling Mamma, said Bao-chai. Why dont you blame yourself for being so careless, you great blabber-mouth ? Me careless ? said Xue Pan. What about the way Bao-yu stirs up trouble for himself then? Let me just give you an example. Let me tell you what happened between him and Bijou the other day. Id met Bijou ten times, near enough, and never had so much as a kind word out of him, yet Bao-yu, that didnt even know him by sight, meets him for the first time the other day, and before you know where you are, hes given him his sash! I hope youre not going to say that that got about because of me ? His mother and sister were indignant. Thats a fine example, isnt it? Its precisely because of that that he was beaten. Now we know it must have been you who told. This is enough to drive a fellow mad! said Xue Pan, Its not so much the lies you keep telling about me. What really gets my goat is the almighty fuss you make about this fellow Bao-yu. Almighty fuss? said Bao-chai. Youve just been waving a door-bar at us, and you say that we have been making a fuss ? Xue Pan could see that Bao-chai had reason on her side and that she was much harder to argue with than his mother. He was therefore eager to find something that would stop her mouth, so that he could say what he wanted to without contradiction. This, coupled with the fact that be was by now far too angry to weigh the seriousness of what he was saying, was responsible for the unpardonable innuendo that followed. All right, sis, he said, you dont need to quarrel with me. I know what your trouble is. Mamma told me long ago that Mr Right would be someone with a jade to match your locket, so naturally, now youve seen -that blasted thing that Bao-yu wears round his neck, you do all you can to stick up for him. Anger at first made Bao-chai speechless then, clinging to Aunt Xue, she burst into tears.
she said. You should hear what shes been saying about you. I dont need to, said Bao-chai. One doesnt expect ivory from a dogs mouth! Bearing down on Dai-yu as she said this, 8he forced her back, laughing and protesting, upon the kang and made as if she would pinch her face. Oh, please coz, forgive me! Dai-yu pleaded. Little Frowner is younger than you and doesnt know any better. You should teach me how to be good. If you wont be nice to me, who else can I turn to? The others, not knowing what lay behind these words, were greatly amused. Do forgive her! they said, laughing. How pitifully she pleads! Even we are melted. But Bao-chai knew she was referring to their recent confrontation on the subject of forbidden books, and feeling rather embarrassed to have this dragged up in the midst of a playful tussle, hurriedly released her. Dai-yu rose to her feet laughing. Thats my good coz. If it had been me, I should never have let you off! Bao-chai pointed her finger at Dai-yu and smiled at her indulgently. Im not surprised that Lady Jia is so fond of you or that the others find you so amusing. I cant help being fond of you too, little coz. Come here and let me do your hair for you. Dai-yu turned her head obediently while Bao-chai refastened her back hair. Bao-yu, watching from where he sat, thought how much better it looked for Bao-chais attention, and wished that he had not told Dai-yu earlier to tidy the hair above her brows, for then Bao-chai could have done that for her too. His agreeable musings on the subject were interrupted by Bao-chais voice Have you finished writing the list? Perhaps youd better be the one to see Lady Jia about it. If theyve got those things here already, so much the better. If not, youll have to get some money to buy them with. In that case I might be able to advise you on where to go for them. Bao-yu folded up the list and stowed it away inside his jacket. They continued to sit a while longer, chatting about this and that. After dinner they went to call on Grandmother Jia to see how she was. She had been suffering from nothing more serious than a slight chill aggravated by fatigue, and by the evening, after a days cosseting and two doses of the mild sudorific prescribed by Dr Wang, she was almost better. If you want to know what the next day held in store, you will have to read the following chapter. CHAPTER 43 -160 An old womans whim is the occasion of a birthday collection And a young mans remorse finds solace in a simple ceremony Our story recommences in Lady Wangs apartment next day. On the previous evenings visit she had found Grandmother Jia almost completely recovered after only two doses of the medicine prescribed for her that same morning by the doctor. Satisfied that it was only a mild chill, contracted during her day in Prospect Garden, and not anything more serious that the old lady had been suffering from, and deeming it unnecessary to make an early call again this morning, Lady Wang summoned Wang Xi-feng to her own apartment to discuss the getting together of some things to send to her husband, Jia Zheng. A summons from Grandmother Jia arrived nevertheless, and Lady Wang hurried over, taking Xi-feng with her, to see what was the matter. Are you still feeling better today, Mother? she asked her when they arrived. Im quite recovered now, thank you, said Grandmother Jia. Ive had a sip or two of the pheasant stew you sent me. It was very tasty I ate some of the meat in it and enjoyed it very much. You have Feng to thank for that, said Lady Wang with a smile. See how dutiful she is to you! It shows that your kindness is not wasted on her. Grandmother Jia returned the smile and nodded affably. It was good of her to think of me. If theres any of the meat still left, Id rather like a few pieces of it fried. It has a pleasant, salty tang that goes well with the rice-gruel I am taking The stew is very nice, but stew and gruel dont go very well together. Xi-feng at once sent orders to the main kitchen to have the pheasant-meat prepared. Well, it wasnt really my diet that I wanted to talk about, said Grandmother Jia. The reason Ive sent for you is because the second of the ninth month is Fengs birthday.
She -found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it could mean. I suppose they must be very good ones, she said. Probably someone gave them to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for them just now myself. Skybright laughed. Theyre not new ones, Miss. Theyre two of his did, everyday ones. This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then suddenly, in a flash, she understood. Put them down. You may go now. Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her. Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of conflicting emotions. I feel so happy, she thought, that in the midst of his own affliction he has been able to grasp the cause of all my trouble. And yet at the same time I am sad, she thought because how do I know that my trouble will end in the way I want it to? Actually, I feel rather amused, she thought. Fancy his sending a pair of old handkerchiefs like that! Suppose I hadnt understood what he was getting at? But I feel alarmed that he should be sending presents to me in secret. Oh, and I feel so ashamed when I think how I am forever crying and quarrelling, she thought, and all the time he has understood! And her thoughts carried her this way and that, until the ferment of excitement within her cried out to be expressed. Careless of what the maids might think, she called for a lamp, sat herself down at her desk, ground some ink, softened her brush, and proceeded to compose the following quatrains, using the handkerchiefs them-selves to write on 1 -907 Seeing my idle teats, you ask me why These foolish drops fall from my teeming eye Then know, your gift, being by the merfolk made, In mermans currency must be repaid. 2 -907 Jewelled drops by day in secret sorrow shed Or, in the night-time, in my wakeful bed, Lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain, Shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain. 3 -907 Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiads tears Each salty trace of them fast disappears. Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow Outside the window still her tear marks show. She had only half-filled the second handkerchief and was preparing to write another quatrain, when she became aware that her whole body was burning hot all over and her cheeks were afire. Going over to the dressing table, she removed the brocade cover from the mirror and peered into it. Hmn! Brighter than the peach-flowers hue, she murmured complacently to the flushed face that stared out at her from the glass, and, little imagining that what she had been witnessing was the first symptom of a serious illness, went back to bed, her mind full of handkerchiefs. From Dai-yu and her handkerchiefs let us return to Aroma, who, it will be remembered, bad been sent off to Bao-chais for a book. When she got there, she found that Bao-chai was not in the Garden, having gone round to her mothers place outside. Not liking to return empty-handed, she waited for Bao-chai to return. It was already the beginning of the first watch when she did so. Knowing her brother as she did, Bao-chai had already, even before hearing anything to that effect, suspected that he was in some way responsible for Bao-yus misfortune. What Aroma had earlier on told her had therefore been no more than confirmation of an already existing suspicion. Yet Aroma had only been echoing what Tealeaf had told her and what Tealeaf had told her was pure guesswork without a shred of evidence to support it. Thus what started in everyones mind as a suspicion, repetition very soon compounded into a certainty. Yet the ironical fact was that he who by his past behaviour had so richly merited the reputation which had caused them to suspect him was totally innocent on the one Occasion when everyone was most unshakeably convinced of his guilt. The object of this misunderstanding had on this particular evening returned home having had a good deal to drink outside. He greeted his mother and then, observing that his sister, too, was sitting there, addressed a few desultory remarks to her. Suddenly he seemed to remember something. I hear young Bao-yus been in trouble, he said. What was it about? This was too much for Aunt Xue, who had been seething inwardly and now broke out in a fury.
Lady Wang was not naturally unkind. On the contrary, she was an exceptionally lenient mistress. This was, in fact, the first time in her life that she had ever struck a maid. But the kind of shamelessness of whichin her view - Golden had just been guilty was the one thing she had always most abhorred. It was the uncontrollable anger of the morally Outraged that had caused her to strike Golden and call her names and though Golden now begged and pleaded, she refused to retract her dismissal. When Goldens mother, old Mrs Bai, had eventually been fetched, the wretched girl, utterly crushed by her shame and humiliation, was led away. But of bet no more. Embarrassed by his mothers awakening, Bao-yu had slipped hurriedly into the Garden. The burning sun was now in the height of heaven, the contracted shadows were concentrated darkly beneath the trees, and the stillness of noon, filled with the harsh trilling of cicadas, was broken by no human voice but as he approached the bamboo trellises of the rose-garden, a sound like a sup-pressed sob seemed to come from inside the pergola. Uncertain what it was that he had heard, he stopped to listen. Undoubtedly there was someone there. This was the fifth month of the year, when the rambler roses are in fullest bloom. Peeping through the fragrant panicles with which the pergola was smothered, he saw a girl crouching down on the other side of the trellis, scratching at the ground with one of those long, blunt pins that girls use for fastening their back hair with. Can this be some silly maid come here to bury flowers like Frowner? he wondered. He was reminded of Zhuang-zis story of the beautiful Xi-shis ugly neighbour, whose endeavours to imitate the little frown that made Xi-shi captivating produced an aspect so hideous that people ran from her in terror. The recollection of it made him smile. This is imitating the Frowner with a vengeance, he thought, - if that is really what she is doing. Not merely unoriginal, but downright disgusting! Dont imitate Miss Lin, he was about to shout but a glimpse of the girls face revealed to him just in time that this was no maid, but one of the twelve little actresses from Pear-tree Court though which of them, since he had seen them only in their make-up on the stage, he was unable to make Out. He stuck Out his tongue in a grimace and clapped a hand to his mouth. Good job I didnt speak too soon, he thought. Ive been in trouble twice already today for doing that, once with Frowner and once with Chai. It only needs me to go and upset these twelve actresses as well and I shall be well and truly in the cart! His efforts to identify the girl made him study her more closely. It was curious that he should have thought her an imitator of Dai-yu, for she had much of Dai-yus ethereal grace in her looks the same delicate face and frail, slender body the same -1536 ... brows like hills in spring, And eyes like autumns limpid pools even the same little frown that had often made him compare Dai-yu with Xi-shi of the legend. It was now quite impossible for him to tear himself away. He watched her fascinated. As he watched, he began to see that what she was doing with the pin was not scratching a hole to bury flowers in, but writing. He followed the movements of her hand, and each vertical and horizontal stroke, each dot and hook that she made he copied with a finger on the palm of his hand. Altogether there were eighteen strokes. He thought for a moment. The character he had just written in his hand was QIANG. The name of the roses which covered the pergola contained the same character Qiang-wei. The sight of the roses has inspired her to write a poem, he thought. Probably shes just thought of a good couplet and wants to write it down before she forgets it or perhaps she has already composed several lines and wants to work on them a bit. Lets see what she writes next. The girl went on writing, and he followed the movements of her hand as before. It was another QIANG. Again she wrote, and again he followed, and again it was a QIANG. It was as though she were under some sort of spell. As soon as she had finished writing one QIANG she began writing another. QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG He must have watched her write several dozen QIANGs in succession. He seemed to be as much affected by the spell on his side of the pergola as the girl herself was on hers, for his eyeballs continued to follow her pin long after he bad learned to anticipate its movements.
Ive got lots of these things already. Keep them to give the children at New Year. While she was speaking, a little maid came in carrying a Cheng Hua enamelled porcelain cup, which she handed to Granule Liu. Master Bao said I was to give you this. Well! said Granule Liu as she took the cup from her. Now what do you make of that? Reckon it must be something I did for him in a past life. Those clothes I gave you to change into the other day when you had your bath were mine, said Faithful. If you dont mind taking them off me, Ive got some more like them that Id like to make you a present of. As Grannie Liu made no objection, Faithful got out several more sets of clothing and wrapped them up for her. Granule Lin wanted to go into the Garden to thank Bao-yu and the girls and say good-bye to them she also wanted to take her leave of Lady Wang but Faithful prevented her. It isnt necessary. In any case, they wont be seeing anyone at this hour. I can thank them for you when I see them later. Well, good-bye then. Come again when you can. She ordered an old servant-woman to fetch two pages from the inner gate to help Grannie Liu out with her things. The old servant undertook to do this and also went with Grannie Liu to collect the things from Xi-fengs apartment. When they had got them all together, she fetched the boys from the outside corner gate who carried them out to the street for her and loaded them into a waiting cab. Granule Liu and Ban-er then got in themselves and Set off without more ado on their journey back home. At this point they pass also out of our narrative, which turns now to other matters. -134 After they had eaten their lunch, Bao-chai and the test of the young people called once more on Grandmother Jia, to see how she was progressing. On their way back, as they reached that point in the Garden where their paths separated, Bao-chai called Dai-yu over to her. Frowner, come with me. Theres something I want to talk to you about. Dai-yu followed her to Allspice Court. When they were inside her room, Bao-chai sat down. Well? she said to Dai-yu. Arent you going to kneel down? I am about to interrogate you. Dai-yu was mystified. Poor Bao-chai! she said, laughing. The girls gone off her head. Interrogate me about what ? My dear, well-bred young lady! said Bao-chai. My dear, sheltered young innocent! What were those things I heard you saying yesterday? Come now, the truth! Dai-yu, still mystified, continued to laugh. She was beginning to feel somewhat uneasy, though she would not admit it. What awful thing am I supposed to have said? I expect youre making it up, but you may as well tell me. Still acting the innocent? said Bao-chai. What were those things you said yesterday when we were laying that drinking game? I couldnt think where you could have got them from. Dai-yu cast her mind back and remembered, blushing, that the day before, when stumped for an answer, she had got through her turn by citing passages from The Return of the Soul and The Western Chamber. She hugged Bao-chai imploringly. Dear coz! I really dont know. I just said them without thinking. If you tell me not to, I promise not to say them again. I really dont know either, said Bao-chai. I just thought they sounded rather interesting. I thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were. Dear coz! Please dont tell anyone about this. I promise not to repeat such things again. Moved by the scarlet, shame-filled face and pitifully entreating voice, Bao-chai relented and did not pursue her questioning. Having first drawn her down into a seat and handed her some tea, she began, very gently, to address her in the following manner What do you take me for? Im just as bad. At seven or eight I used to be a real little terror. Ours was reckoned to be rather a literary family. My grandfather was a bibliophile, so the house we lived in was full of books. We were a big family in those days. All my boy cousins and girl cousins on my fathers side lived with us in the same house. All of us younger people hated serious books but liked reading poetry and plays. The boys had got lots and lots of plays The Western Chamber, The Lute-player, A Hundred Yuan Plays just about everything you could think of.

They used to read them behind our backs, and we girls used to read them behind theirs. Eventually the grown-ups got to know about it and then there were beatings and lectures and burning of booksand that was the end of that.
So soft it came, so silently it went! Last night, outside, a mournful sound was heard The spirits of the flowers and of the bird. But neither bird nor flowers would long delay, Bird lacking speech, and flowers too shy to stay. And then I wished that I had wings to fly After the drifting flowers across the sky Across the sky to the worlds farthest end, The flowers last fragrant resting-place to find. But better their remains in silk to lay And bury underneath the wholesome clay, Pure substances the pure earth to enrich, Than leave to soak and stink in some foul ditch. Can I, that these flowers obsequies attend, Divine how soon or late my life will end? Let others laugh flower-burial to see Another year who will be burying me? As petals drop and spring begins to fail, The bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale. One day, when spring has gone and youth has fled. The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead. -1983 All this was uttered in a voice half-choked with sobs for the words recited seemed only to inflame the grief of the reciterindeed, Bao-yu, listening on the other side of the rock, was so overcome by them that he had already flung him-self weeping upon the ground. But the sequel to this painful scene will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER 28 A crimson cummerbund becomes a pledge of friendship And a chaplet of medicine-beads becomes a source of embarrassment ON the night before the festival, it may be remembered, Lin Dai-yu had mistakenly supposed Bao-yu responsible for Sky-brights refusal to open the gate for her. The ceremonial farewell to the flowers of the following morning had transformed her pent-up and still smouldering resentment into a more generalized and seasonable sorrow. This had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave. Meditation on the fate of flowers had led her to a contemplation of her own sad and orphaned lot she had burst into tears, and soon. after had begun a recitation of the poem whose words we recorded in the preceding chapter. Unknown to her, Bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by rockery. At first he merely nodded and sighed sympathetically but when he heard the words Can J, that these flowers obsequies attend, Divine how soon or late my life will end? and, a little later, -800 One day when spring has gone and youth has fled, The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead. he flung himself on the ground in a fit of weeping, scattering the earth all about him with the flowers he had been carrying in the skirt of his gown. Lin Dai-yu dead! A world from which that delicate, flowerlike countenance had irrevocably departed! It was unutterable anguish to think of it. Yet his sensitized imagination did now consider itwent on, indeed, to consider a world from which the others, tooBao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and the resthad also irrevocably departed. Where would he be then? What would have become of him? And what of the Garden, the rocks, the flowers, the trees? To whom would they belong when he and the girls were no longer there to enjoy them? Passing from loss to loss in his imagination, he plunged deeper and deeper into a grief that seemed inconsolable. As the poet says Flowers in my eyes and bird-song in my ears Augment my loss and mock my bitter tears. Dai-yu, then, as she stood plunged in her own private sorrowing, suddenly heard the sound of another person crying bitterly on the rocks above her. The others are always telling me Im a case, she thought. Surely there cant be another case up there? But on looking up she saw that it was Bao-yu. Pshaw! she said crossly to herself. I thought it was another girl, but all the time it was that cruel, hate Hateful she had been going to say, but clapped her mouth shut before uttering it. She sighed instead and began to walk away. By the time Bao-yus weeping was over, Dai-yu was no longer there. He realized that she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes. Then he descended from the rockery and began to retrace his steps in the direction of Green Delights. Quite by coincidence Dai-yu was walking along the same path a little way ahead. Stop a minute! he cried, hurrying forward to catch up with her. I know you are not taking any notice of me, but I only want to ask you one simple question, and then you need never have anything more to do with me.
Tan-chuns smile had vanished How can she talk such nonsense? Why should I be the one to make shoes for him? Huan gets a clothing allowance, doesnt he? He gets his clothing and footwear provided for the same as all the test of us. And fancy saying a thing like that in front of a roomful of servants! For whose benefit was this remark made, I wonder? I make an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time and if I give a pair to someone I particularly like, thats my own affair. Surely no one else has any business to start telling me who I should give them to? Oh, shes so petty! Bao-yu shook his head Perhaps youre being a bit hard on her. Shes probably got her reasons. This made Tan-chun really angry. Her chin went up defiantly Now youre being as stupid as her. of course shes got her reasons but they are ignorant, stupid reasons. But she can think what she likes as far as I am concerned, Sir Jia is my father and Lady Wang is my mother, and who was born in whose room doesnt interest methe way I choose my friends inside the family has nothing to do with that. Oh, I know I shouldnt talk about her like this but she is so idiotic about these things. As a matter of fact I can give you an even better example than your story of the slippers. That last time I gave you my savings to get something for me, she saw me a few days afterwards and started telling me how short of money she was and how difficult things were for her. I took no notice, of course. But later, when the maids were Out of the room, she began attacking me for giving the money Id saved to other people instead of giving it to Huan. Really! I didnt know whether to laugh or get angry with her. In the end I just walked out of the room and went round to see Mother. There was an amused interruption at this point from Bao-chai, who was still standing where they had left her a few minutes before Do finish your talking and come back soon Its easy to see that you two are brother and sister. As soon as you see each other, you get into a huddle and start talking about family secrets. Would it really be such a disaster if anything you are saying were to be overheard? Tan-chun and Bao-yu rejoined her, laughing. Not seeing Dai-yu, Bao-yu realized that she must have slipped off elsewhere while be was talking. Better leave it a day or two, he told himself on reflection. Wait until her anger has calmed down a bit. While he was looking downwards and meditating, he noticed that the ground where they were standing was carpeted with a bright profusion of wind-blown flowerspomegranate and balsam for the most part. You can see shes upset, he thought ruefully. Shes neglecting her flowers. Ill bury this lot for her and remind her about it next time I see her. He became aware that Bao-chai was arranging for him and Tan-chun to go with her outside. Ill join you two presently, he said, and waited until they were a little way off before stooping down to gather the fallen blossoms into the skirt of his gown. It was quite a way from where he was to the place where Dai-yu had buried the peach-blossom on that previous occasion, but he made his way towards it, over rocks and bridges and through plantations. of trees and flowers. When he had almost reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature mountain between him and the burial-place of the flowers, he heard the sound of a voice, coming from the other side of the rock, whose continuous, gentle chiding was occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs. It must be a maid from one of the apartments, thought Bao-yu. Someone has been ill-treating her, and she has run here to cry on her own. He stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying. She appeared to be reciting something The blossoms fade and falling fill the air, Of fragrance and bright hues bereft and bare. Floss drifts and flutters round the Maidens bower, Or softly strikes against her curtained door. The Maid, grieved by these signs of springs decease, Seeking some means her sorrow to express, Has rake in hand into the garden gone,. Before the fallen flowers are trampled on. Elm-pods and willow-floss are fragrant too Why care, Maid, where the fallen flowers blew? Next year, when peach and plum-tree bloom again, Which of your sweet companions will remain?
Her Old Ladyship says she wants you to go to Court at four oclock tomorrow morning to give thanks. Yes, of course, said Bao-yu inattentively, and gave Ripple instructions to take his presents round to Dai-yu Tell Miss Lin that I got these things yesterday and that if theres anything there she fancies, I should like her to keep it. Ripple went off with the presents. She was back in a very short time, however. Miss Lin says she got some yesterday too, and will you please keep these for yourself. Bao-yu told her to put them away. As soon as he had washed, he left to pay his morning call on Grandmother Jia but just as he was going out he saw Dai-yu coming towards him and hurried forward to meet her. Why didnt you choose anything from the things I sent you? Yesterdays resentments were now quite forgotten today Dai-yu had fresh matter to occupy her mind. Im not equal to the honour, she said. You forget, Im not in the gold and jade class like you and your Cousin Bao. Im only a common little wall-flower! The reference to gold and jade immediately aroused Bao-yus suspicions. I dont know what anyone else may have been saying on the subject, he said, but if any such thought ever so much as crossed my mind, may Heaven strike me dead, and may I never be reborn as a human being! Seeing him genuinely bewildered, Dai-yu smiled in what was meant to be a reassuring manner. I wish you wouldnt make these horrible oaths. Its so disagreeable. Who cares about your silly old gold and jade, anyway? Its hard to make you se what is in my heart, said Bao-yu. One day perhaps you will know. But I can tell you this. My heart has room for four people only. Grannie and my parents are three of them and Cousin Dai is the fourth. I swear to you there isnt a fifth. Theres no need for you to swear, said Dai-yu. I know very well that Cousin Dai has a place in your heart. The trouble is that as soon as Cousin Chai comes along, Cousin Dai gets forgotten. You imagine these things, said Bao-yu. It really isnt as you say. Yesterday when Little Miss Bao wouldnt tell lies for you, why did you turn to me and expect me to? How would you like it if I did that sort of thing to you? Bao-chai happened to come along while they were still talking and the two of them moved aside to avoid her. Bao-chai saw this clearly, but pretended not to notice and hurried by with lowered eyes. She went and sat with Lady Wang for a while and from there went on to Grandmother Jias. Bao-yu was already at his grandmothers when she got there. Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be Someone who had a jade to match the gold. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her mothers chatter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of her, was unaware of her embarrassment. But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest. Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads? She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to pull it off now in obedience to his request. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off While she was struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm, and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him. If that arm were growing on Cousin Lins body, he speculated, I might hope one day to touch it. What a pity its hers I Now I shall never have that good fortune. Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yus remark had reminded him of. He looked again at Bao-chai -2458 that face like the full moons argent bowl those eyes like sloes those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived and brows by none but Natures pencil lined.
She stopped and lowered her eyes pensively again to the ground. Bao-yu and Dai-yu have known each other since they were little, she reflected. They are used to behaving uninhibitedly when they are alone together. They dont seem to care what they say to one another and one is never quite sure what sort of mood one is going to find them in. And Dai-yu, at the best of times, is always so touchy and suspicious. If I go in now after him, he is sure to feel embarrassed and she is sure to start imagining things. It would be better to go back without seeing her. Her mind made up, she turned round and began to retrace her steps, intending to go back to the other girls but just at that moment she noticed two enormous turquoise-coloured butterflies a little way ahead of her, each as large as a childs fan, fluttering and dancing on the breeze. She watched them fascinated and thought she would like to play a game with them. Taking a fan from inside her sleeve and holding it outspread of her, she followed them off the path and into the grass. To and fro fluttered the pair of butterflies, sometimes alighting for a moment, but always flying off again before she could reach them. Once they seemed on the point of flying across the little river that flowed through the midst of the garden and Bao-chai had to stalk them with bated breath for fear of startling them out on to the water. By the time she had reached the Raindrop Pavilion she was perspiring freely and her interest in the butterflies was beginning to evaporate. She was about to turn back when she became aware of a low murmur of voices coming from inside the pavilion. Raindrop Pavilion was built in such a way that it projected into the middle of the pool into which the little watercourse widened out at this point, so that on three of its sides it looked out on to the water. It was surrounded by a verandah, whose railing followed the many angles formed by the bays and projections of the base. In each of its wooden walls there was a large paper-covered casement of elegantly patterned lattice-work. Hearing voices inside the pavilion, Bao-chai halted and inclined her ear to listen. Are you s ure this is your handkerchief? one of the voices was saying. If it is, take it but if it isnt, I must return it to Mr Yun. Of course its mine, said the second voice. Come on, let me have it! Are you going to give me a reward? I hope I havent taken all this trouble for nothing. I promised you I would give you a reward, and so I shall. Surely you dont think I was deceiving you? All right, I get a reward for bringing it to you. But what about the person who picked it up? Doesnt he get anything? Dont talk nonsense, said the second voice. Hes one of the masters. A master picking up something belonging to one of us should give it back as a matter of course How can there be any question of rewarding him? If you dont intend to reward him, what am I supposed to tell him when I see him? He was most insistent that I wasnt to give you the handkerchief unless you gave him a reward. There was a long pause, after which the second voice replied Oh all right. Let him have this other handkerchief of mine then. That will have to do as his reward - But you must swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone else about this. May my mouth rot and may I die a horrible death if I ever tell anyone else about this, amen! said the first voice. Goodness! said the second voice again. Here we are talking away, and all the time someone could be creeping up outside and listening to every word we say. We had better open these casements then even if anyone outside sees us, theyll think we are having an ordinary conversation and we shall be able to see them and know in time when to stop. Bao-chai, listening outside, gave a start. No wonder they say venery and thievery sharpen the wits, she thought. If they open those windows and see me here, they are going to feel terribly embarrassed. And one of those voices sounds like that proud, peculiar girl Crimson who works in Bao-yus room. If a girl like that knows that I have overheard her doing something she shouldnt be doing, it will be a case of the desperate dog will jump a wall, the desperate man will hazard all therell be a great deal of trouble and I shall be involved in it. There isnt time to hide. I shall have to do as the cicada does when he jumps out of his skin give them something to put them off the scent There was a loud creak as the casement yielded.
Still, bring it here anyway, and those who want to can help themselves. The maids went off and returned carrying two small tables. A couple of food-boxes followed. Each, when its cover was removed, was found to contain two different kinds of delicacy. In the first box there were two kinds of steamed things marzipan cakes made of ground lotus-root and sugared cassia-flowers, and pine-nut and goose-fat rolls, The second box contained two sorts of fried things, one of them a heap of tiny jiao-zi only about one inch long What have they got inside them? Grandmother Jia asked. Crab-meat, said one of the old women who had brought the boxes. Grandmother Jia frowned. I shouldnt think anyone would feel like eating that now, she said. Much too rich. The other type of fried confection consisted of a wide variety of little pastry-shapes deep-fried in butter. These, too, met with the old ladys disapproval. She invited Aunt Xue to choose first. Aunt Xue selected one of the little cakes of lotus-root marzipan. Grandmother Jia chose a goose-fat and pine-nut roll, but after merely tasting it, handed the uneaten half to a maid. Grannie Liu was fascinated by the delicately fashioned pastries. They had been looped or perforated or criss-crossed in every conceivable shape and the soft dough instantaneously hardened in boiling butter-fat. The one she had selected was shaped like a peony. The cleverest girl in our village couldnt make a paper cutout as fine as that, she said, holding it up for the others to see. It seems almost a shame to eat it. Id like to wrap up a few of these and take them home with me to use as patterns! The others laughed. Ill give you a jarful to take back with you when you go, said Grandmother Jia. Eat these ones now, while theyre still hot. The others contented themselves with nibbling only one or two of whichever delicacies in the boxes took their fancy, but Grannie Liu and Ban-er, partly because of the novelty neither of them having eaten such things before, and partly because the little pastry-shapes really were very pretty and, being heaped promiscuously together, tempted you to go on eating them to discover what new shapes were lying underneath, went on munching away until they had tried several of every shape, by which time about half the pile had vanished. Xi-feng had what was left on the four dishes heaped together onto two of them and put into a single box, and sent it over to the Lotus Pavilion for lgante and the eleven other little actresses to eat. Just then the nurse appeared carrying Xi-fengs little girl, who at once became the main focus of their attention. She was clutching a large grapefruit, but as soon as she caught sight of the Buddhas hand that Ban-er was holding, she decided that she wanted that, and let up a wail when the maids who were attempting to coax it from Ban-er could not procure it for her quickly enough. A resourceful cousin saved the situation by hurriedly taking the grapefruit and inducing Ban-er to make an exchange. Ban-er had by this time been playing with the Buddhas hand for quite a long while and had more or less exhausted its possibilities moreover at the moment he had his hands full of fried pastry-shapes and the grapefruit not only smelled good but, being round, made an excellent football. For these three reasons he concluded that it was an altogether more satisfactory fruit than the Buddhas hand and abandoned all interest in the latter. When everyone had taken tea, Grandmother Jia, with the rest of the party following, conducted Grannie Lin to Green Bower Hermitage, where they were met at the gate by the nun Adamantina. Inside the courtyard the trees and shrubs had a thriving, well-cared-for look. Monks and nuns always have the best-kept gardens, said Grandmother Jia, in smiling approval of what she saw. They have nothing else to do with their time. They were walking towards the meditation hall on the east side of the courtyard. As they seemed to hesitate in the outer foyer, Adamantina invited them to go on inside, but Grandmother Jia declined. No, we wont go inside just now. Weve all recently taken wine and meat, and as youve got the Bodhisattva in there, it would be sacrilege. We can sit out here, where we are. Bring us some of your nice tea. Well just drink one cup and then go out again. Adamantina hurried off to make tea.
said Kingfisher. A daddy one or a mummy one! Silly girl! All right, then, said Kingfisher. But why is it that every-thing else has Yin and Yang but we havent? Get along with you, naughty girl! What subject wilt you get on to next? Why? Why cant you tell me? said Kingfisher. Anyway, I know so theres no need for you to be so nasty to me. Xiang-yun suppressed a giggle. Youre Yang and Im Yin, said Kingfisher. Xiang-yun held her handkerchief to her mouth and laughed Well, thats right, isnt it? said Kingfisher. What are you laughing at? Yes, yes, said Xiang-yun. Thats quite right. Thats what they always say, said Kingfisher the master is Yang and the servant is Yin. Even I can understand that principle. Im sure you can, said Xiang-yun. Very good. While they were talking, a glittering golden object at the foot of the rose pergola caught Xiang-yuns eye. She pointed it out to Kingfisher. Go and see what it is, Kingfisher bounded over and picked it up. Ah ha! she said, examining the object in her hand. Now we shall be able to see whether its Yin or Yang. She took hold of the kylin fastened to Xiang-yuns girdle and held it up to look at it more closely. Xiang-yun wanted to see what it was that she held in her hand, but Kingfisher wouldnt let her. Its my treasure, she said with a laugh. I wont let you see it, Miss. Funny, though. I wonder where it came from. Ive never seen anyone here wearing it. Come on! Let me look, said Xiang-yun. There you are, Miss! Kingfisher opened her hand. Xiang-yun looked. It was a beautiful, shining gold kylin, both larger and more ornate than the one she was wearing. Reaching out and taking it from Kingfisher, she held it on the palm of her hand and contemplated it for some moments in silence. Whatever reverie the contemplation inspired was broken by the sudden arrival of Bao-yu. What are you doing, standing out here in the blazing sun? he asked her. Why dont you go and see Aroma? We were on our way, said Xiang-yun, hurriedly concealing the gold kylin. The three of them entered the courtyard of Green Delights together. Aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at the foot of the front door steps. As soon as she caught sight of Xiang-yun, she hurried down into the courtyard to welcome her, and taking her by the hand, led her into the house, animatedly exchanging news with her as they went. You should have come sooner, said Bao-yu when they were indoors and Aroma had made Xiang-yun take a seat. Ive got something nice for you here and Ive been waiting for you to come so that I could give it to you. He had been hunting through his pockets as he said this. Not finding what he was searching for, he exclaimed in surprise. Aiyo! He turned to Aroma. Have you put it away somewhere ? Put what away? That little kylin I got the other day. Youve been carrying it around with you everywhere, said Aroma. Why ask me about it? Bao-yu clapped his hands together in vexation. Oh, Ive lost it! Wherever am I going to look for it? He got up to begin searching. Xiang-yun now realized that it must have been Bao-yu who dropped the kylin she had only a few minutes earlier discovered outside. Since when have you had a kylin? she asked him. Oh, several days now, said Bao-yu. What a shame! Ill never get another one like that. And the trouble is, I dont know when I can have lost it. Oh dear! How stupid of me! Its only an ornament youre getting so upset about, said Xiang-yun. What a good job it wasnt something more serious! She opened her hand Look! Is that it? Bao-yu looked and saw, with extravagant delight, that it was. The remainder of this episode will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER 32 Bao-yu demonstrates confusion of mind by making his declaration to the wrong person And Golden shows an unconquerable spirit by ending her humiliation in death OUR last chapter told of Bao-yus delight at seeing the gold kylin again.
She handed the moulds to an attendant woman-servant. Tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other ingredients as theyll need to make ten bowlfuls with. Say its wanted immediately. Why so much? said Lady Wang. I have my reason, said Xi-feng. This isnt the sort of thing one eats every day, and now that Cousin Bao has mentioned it, it seems silly to make it just for him and not let you and Grandma and Auntie Xue taste it as well. So while we are about it, we might just as well do enough of it for everyone. She smiled mischievously. I might even have a taste of it myself. Grandmother Jia laughed. Little monkey! We spoil you! Spending public money on private entertainment, thats what this is! The others all laughed. Xi-feng, quite unconcerned, joined in. Thats no problem, she said. Im sure I can-afford a little treat like this. She turned to the waiting woman Tell the kitchen to use plenty of everything and charge it all up to my account. The woman murmured a reply and went off to see about the order. Bao-chai had been following these exchanges with amusement. Cousin Feng may be very artful, she said, but I dont believe that in all the years Ive been here I have ever seen her get the better of Lady Jia. Im an old woman, my dear, said Grandmother Jia. What use would I have for artfulness at my time of life? Mind you, when I was the age that Feng is now, I could have taught her a thing or two. Still, though she may not be as sharp as I was then, she doesnt do so badly! A deal better than your Aunt Wang here, thats certain. She cant talk to save her life, poor soul, no more than a woman of wood! She could never get round me the way your Cousin Feng does. Fengie has the gift of a good tongue, my dear. Thats why your old grannie is so fond of her. Bao-yu laughed. From what you say, Grandma, it sounds as if the good talkers are the only ones you can be fond of. Oh no, said Grandmother Jia. the silent ones have their merits, just as the good talkers have theirs. Good talkers can be very tiresome at times and then I prefer the silent ones. Thats all right then, said Bao-yu. I was going to say my sister-in-law certainly isnt much of talker, yet Im sure you are as fond of her as you are of Feng. If being a good talker were the only thing -that mattered, I should have thought that Cousin Feng and Cousin Lin would be the only two in the family you would really care about. Well now, if were going to start comparing, said Grandmother Jia, I hope your Aunt Xue wont think I am only saying this because she is here, but really and truly I do think that of all the girls in this family her Bao-chai is the one that I like the best. Aunt Xue laughingly demurred. You mustnt say that. Im sure you cant really mean it. No, no, Im sure she does, Lady Wang hurriedly inter-posed. Ive often heard Mother speak well of Bao-chai when you werent around. Bao-yus contribution to the conversation had been made with the intention of encouraging Grandmother Jia to say something nice about Dai-yu. It came to him as a surprise when she started praising Bao-chai instead. He looked at Bao-chai and grinned but she turned quickly away and began talking to Aroma. Just-then a servant came to say that lunch over at the mansion was ready, and Grandmother Jia rose to go. Having first exhorted Bao-yu to hurry up and get better and then admonished his maids, she began to move out of the room not without a polite attempt to make Aunt Xue go out ahead of her leaning on Xi-fengs arm. Is that soup ready yet? she inquired when they were out of the room. Then, turning to Aunt Xue, she asked her if there was anything she particularly fancied for her lunch. Mind you let me know if there is, she said. I have the power to make Fengie treat us to it. Aunt Xue laughed. You shouldnt tease the poor girl! Shes always getting nice things for you. But youre not much of an eater at the best of times. Dont you believe it, Aunt! said Xi-feng. Grannie knows how to tuck in. Shed have eaten me by now if she werent afraid that shed find me a bit too vinegary.
It quite wrings my heart to see her so exploited. Aroma smote her hands together as understanding dawned. Yes, I see. I see now why she was so slow with those ten butterfly bows I asked her to sew for me last month. It was ages before she sent them, and even then there was a message to say that shed only been able to do them roughly. She told me Id better use them on something else. If you want nice, even ones, she said, youll have to wait until next time I come to stay with you. Now I can see why. She didnt like to refuse when I asked her, but I suppose she had to sit up till midnight doing them, poor thing. Oh, how stupid of me! Id never have asked her if Id realized. Last time she was here, she told me that its quite normal for her to sit up sewing until midnight, said Bao-chai and if her aunt or the other women catch her doing the slightest bit of work for anyone else, they are angry with her. Its all the fault of that pig-headed young master of mine, said Aroma. He refuses to let any of his sewing be done by the seamstresses outside. Every bit of work, large or small, has to be done in his room and I just cant manage it all on my own. Bao-chai laughed. Why do you take any notice of him? Why not simply give it to the seamstresses without telling him? Hes not so easy to fool, said Aroma. He can tell the difference. Im afraid theres nothing for it. I shall just have to work through it all gradually on my own Now just a minute! said Bao-chai. Well think of a way round this. Suppose I were to do some of it for you? Would you really? said Aroma. Id be so grateful if you would. Ill come over with some this evening then. She had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a state of great agitation. Isnt it dreadful? Miss Golden has drowned herself in the well. Which Golden? said Aroma, startled. Which Golden? said the old woman. There arent two Goldens that I know of. Golden from Her Ladyships room, of course, that was dismissed the day before yesterday. Shed been crying and carrying on at home ever since, but nobody paid much attention to her. Then suddenly, when they went to look for her, she wasnt there, and just now someone going to-fetch-water from the well by the south-east corner found body in it and rushed inside for help, and when they fished it out, they found that it was Golden. They did all they could to revive her, but it was too late. She was dead. How strange! said Bao-chai Aroma shook her head wonderingly and a teat or two stole down her cheek. She and Golden had been like sisters to each other. Bao-chai hurried off to Lady Wangs to offer her sympathy. Aroma went back to Green Delights. When Bao-chai arrived at Lady Wangs apartment she found the whole place hushed and still and Lady Wang sitting in the inner room on her own, crying. Deeming it an unsuitable moment to raise the subject of her visit, Bao-chai sat down beside her in silence. Where have you just come from? Lady Wang asked her. The Garden. The Garden, Lady Wang echoed. Did you by any chance see your cousin Bao-yu there? I saw him going out just now wearing his outdoor clothes, but I dont know where he was going to. Lady Wang nodded and gave a sigh. I dont know if youve heard. Something very strange has happened. Golden has drowned herself in a well. That is strange, said Bao-chai. Why ever did she do that? The day before yesterday she broke something of mine, said Lady Wang, and in a moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mothers. I had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me as to drown herself. Now that she has, I feel that it is all my fault. Its only natural that a kind person like you should see it in that way, said Bao-chai, but in my opinion Golden would never have drowned herself in anger. Its much more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally. While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for-her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. Theres no earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself.
The only reason I havent mentioned it before is because I was afraid Your Ladyship might be angry with me. What Aroma had lust been saying about misconstructions and scandals so exactly fitted what had in fact happened in the case of Golden that for a moment Lady Wang was quite taken aback. But on reflection she felt nothing but love and gratitude for this humble servant-girl who had shown so much solicitude on her behalf. It is very perceptive of you, my dear, to have thought it all out so carefully, she said. I have, of course, thought about this matter myself but other things have put it from my mind, and what you have just said has reminded me. It is most thoughtful of you. You are a very, very good girlWell, you may go now. I think I now know what to do. There is just one thing before you go, though. Now that you have spoken to me like this, I am going to place Bao-yu entirely in your hands. Be very careful with him, wont you? Remember that anything you do for him you will be doing also for me. You will find that I am not ungrateful. Aroma stood for a moment with bowed head, weighing the import of these words. Then she said I will do what Your Ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability She left the apartment slowly and made her way back to Green Delights, pondering -as she went. When she arrived, Bao-yu had just woken up, so she told him about the flavourings. He was pleased and made her mix some for him straight away. It was quite delicious. He kept thinking about Dai-yu and wanted to send someone over to see her, but he was afraid that Aroma would disapprove, so, as a means of getting her Out of the way?, he sent her over to Bao-chais place to borrow a book. As soon as she had gone, he summoned Skybright. I want you to go to Miss Lins for me, he said. just see what shes doing, and if she asks about me, tell her Im all right. I cant go rushing in there bald-headed without a reason, said Skybright. Youd better give me some kind of a message, just to give me an excuse for going there. I have none to give, said Bao-yu. Well, give me something to take, then, said Skybright, or think of something I can ask her for. Otherwise it will look so silly. Bao-yu thought for a bit and then, reaching out and picking up two of his old handkerchiefs, he tossed them towards her with a smile. All right. Tell her I said you were to give her these. Thats an odd sort of present! said Skybright. Whats she going to do with a pair of your old handkerchiefs? Most likely shell think youre making-fun of her and get upset again. No she wont, said Bao-yu. Shell understand. Skybright-deemed it pointless to argue, so she picked up the handkerchiefs and went off to the Naiads House. Little Delicate, who was hanging some towels out to dry on the verandah railings, saw her enter the courtyard and attempted to wave her away. Shes gone to bed. Skybright ignored her and went on inside. The lamps had not been lit and the room was in almost total darkness. The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her out of the shadows. Who is it? Skybright. What do you want? Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss? Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She -found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it could mean. I suppose they must be very good ones, she said. Probably someone gave them to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for them just now myself. Skybright laughed. Theyre not new ones, Miss. Theyre two of his did, everyday ones. This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then suddenly, in a flash, she understood. Put them down. You may go now. Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her. Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of conflicting emotions. I feel so happy, she thought, that in the midst of his own affliction he has been able to grasp the cause of all my trouble. And yet at the same time I am sad, she thought because how do I know that my trouble will end in the way I want it to?
Having heard a good deal about her, Bao-yu studied her very attentively, when she arrived back presently with the tray. It was a little cinque-lobed lacquer tea-tray decorated with a gold-infilled engraving of a cloud dragon coiled round the character for longevity. On it stood a little covered teacup of Cheng Hua enamelled porcelain. Holding the tray out respectfully in both her hands, she offered the cup to Grandmother Jia. I dont drink Lu-an tea, said Grandmother Jia. I know you dont, said Adainantina with a smile. This is Old Mans Eyebrows. Grandmother Jia took the tea and inquired what sort of water it had been made with. Last years rain-water, said Adamantina. After drinking half Grandmother Jia handed the cup to Grannie Liu. Try it, she said. See what you think of it. Grannie Liu gulped down the remaining half. Hmn. All right. A bit on the weak side, though. It would be better if it were brewed a little longer. Grandmother Jia and the rest seemed to derive much amusement from these comments. The others were now served tea in covered cups of sweet-white eggshell chinaall, that is, except Bao-chai and Dai-yu, whom Adamantina tugged by the sleeve as an indication that they should follow her inside. Bao-yu stealthily slipped out after them and saw Adamantina usher them into a side-room leading off the foyer. This was Adamantinas own room. Inside it Bao-chai seated herself on the couch and Dai-yu sat on Adamantinas meditation mat. Adamantina busied herself at the stove, fanning the charcoal until the water was boiling vigorously and brewing them a fresh pot of tea. Bao-yu stepped softly into the room and made his presence known to the two cousins. So you get the hostesss special brew? Yes, they said laughing. And its no good your gate-crashing in here after us, because theres none for you. Just as Adamantina was about to fetch cups for the girls, an old lay-sister appeared at the door carrying the empties she had been collecting in the foyer. Dont bring that Cheng Hua cup in here, said Adamantina. Leave it outside. Bao-yu understood immediately. It was because Grannie Liu had drunk from it. In Adamantinas eyes the cup was now contaminated. He watched her as she got cups out for the girls. One of them, a cup with a handle, had -2400 THE PUMPKIN CUP carved in li-shu characters on one side and Wang Kai his Treasure in little autograph characters. on the back, followed by another column of tiny characters -934 Examined by Su Dong-po in the Inner Treasury Fourth month Yuan-feng era anno 5 0 When she had poured tea into this cup she handed it to Bao-chai. The other cup was shaped like a miniature begging-bowl and was inscribed with the words THE HORN LINK GOBLET in pearl-drop seal script. Adamantina filled it and handed it to Dai-yu. She poured tea for Bao-yu in the green jade mug that she normally drank from herself, Bao-yu commented jokingly on the choice I thought you religious were supposed to treat all earthly creatures alike. How comes it that the other two get priceless heirlooms to drink out of but I only get a common old thing like this? I have no wish to boast, said Adamantina, but this common old thing as you call it may well be more valuable than anything you could find in your own household. In the worlds eyes, yes, said Bao-yu. But other countries, other ways, you know. When I enter your domain, I naturally adopt your standards and look on gold, jewels and jade as common, vulgar things. Adamantina glowed with pleasure. In place of the jade mug she hunted out a large drinking-bowl for him to drink out of. It was carved from a gnarled and ancient bamboo root in the likeness of a coiled-up dragon with horns like antlers. There, thats the only thing Ive got left. Do you think you can drink so much? Delightedly he assured her that he could. Yes, I dare say you could too, said Adamantina. But Im not sure that Im prepared to waste so much of my best tea on you. You know what they say One cup for a connoisseur, two for a rustic, and three for a thirsty mule. What sort of creature does that make you if you drink this bowlful? Bao-chai, Dai-yu and Bao-yu all three laughed at this.
But although there were plenty of young ladies of outstanding beauty and breeding among the Jia familys numerous acquaintance, none of them, in his view, could remotely compare with Dai-yu. For some time now his feeling for her had been a very special one but precisely because of this same morbid sensibility, he had shrunk from telling her about it. Instead, whenever he was feeling particularly happy or particularly cross, he would invent all sorts of ways of probing her to find out if this feeling for her was reciprocated. It was unfortunate for him that Dai-yu herself possessed a similar streak of morbid sensibility and disguised her teal feelings, as he did his, while attempting to discover what he felt about her. Here was a situation, then, in which both parties concealed their real emotions and assumed counterfeit ones in an endeavour to find out what the real feelings of the other party were. And because when false meets false the truth will oft-times out, there was the constant possibility that the innumerable little frustrations that were engendered by all this concealment would eventually erupt into a quarrel. Take the present instance. What Bao-yu was actually thinking at this moment was something like this In my eyes and in my thoughts there is no one else but you. I can forgive the others for not knowing this, but surely you ought to realize? If at a time like this you cant share my anxietyif you can think of nothing better to do than provoke me with that sort of silly talk, it shows that the concern I feel for you every waking minute of the day is wasted that you just dont care about me at all. This was what he thought but of course be didnt say it. On her side Dai-yus thoughts were somewhat as follows I know you must care for me a little bit, and Im sure you dont take this ridiculous gold and jade talk seriously. But if you cared only for me and had absolutely no inclination at all in another direction, then every time I mentioned gold and jade you would behave quite naturally and let it pass almost as if you hadnt noticed. How is it, then, that when I do refer to it you get so excited? It shows that it must be on your mind. You pretend to be upset in order to allay my suspicions. Meanwhile a quite different thought was running through Bao-yus mind I would do anythingabsolutely anything, he was thinking, if only you would be nice to me. If you would be nice to me, I would gladly die for you this moment. It doesnt really matter whether you know what I feel for you or not. Just be nice to me, then at least we shall be a little closer to each other, instead of so horribly far apart. At the same time Dai-yu was thinking Never mind me. Just be your own natural self. If yon were all right, I should be all right too. All these manoeuvrings to try and anticipate my feelings dont bring us any closer together they merely draw us farther apart. The percipient reader will no doubt observe that these two young people were already of one mind, but that the complicated procedures by which they sought to draw together were in fact having precisely the opposite effect. Complacent reader! Permit us to remind you that your correct understanding of the situation is due solely to the fact that we have been revealing to you the secret, innermost thoughts of those two young persons, which neither of them had so far ever felt able to express. Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of outward appearances. When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once mote made reference to the gold and jade, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the Magic Jade from his neck and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against the floor with all the strength in his body. Beastly thing! he shouted. Ill smash you to pieces and put an end to this once and for all. But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged. Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do. Why smash a dumb, lifeless object? she said. If you want to smash something, let it be me. The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand.
Just then a woman came to the door to report. Bao Ers wife has hanged herself. Jia Lian and Xi-feng were both profoundly shocked but the look of fear on Xi-fengs face was of only momentary duration. Well, she said harshly, what of it? Why make such a fuss about it? Shortly after this Lin Zhi-xiaos wife came in and spoke to Xi-feng on the side. Bao Ers -wife has hanged herself. Her family are talking about taking it to court. Xi-feng laughed scornfully. Good! I was thinking of doing the same thing myself. Ive just been trying to talk them out of it, said Lin Zhi-xiaos wife. I tried frightening them a bit to start with, then I promised them some money if they would drop it. They seemed to be willing. Ive got no money to give them, said Xi-feng, and I wouldnt give it to them if I had. Let them go ahead and sue. I dont want you to talk them out of it, or to try frightening them out of it either. Just let them go ahead and sue. If they lose their case, I shall bring a suit against them for ex morte blackmail! As she stood there in some perplexity to know what to do, Lin Zhi-xiaos wife noticed that Jia Lian was signaling to her with his eyes. She understood his meaning and went off to wait for him outside. Jia Lian followed soon after. Im just going out to have a looksee whats going on, he said on his way out. Youre not to give them any money I Xi-feng shouted after him. Jia Lian went straight off to discuss the matter with Lin Zhi-xiao himself. As a result of their discussion, someone was sent to haggle -with the family and promise whatever seemed necessary, and the family eventually agreed to keep quiet in return for a payment of two hundred taels towards funeral expenses. Terrified that they might change their minds, Jia Lian sent someone to talk to the local magistrate and invited the police inspector and two or three of the constables in to help with the funeral. Seeing the way things were, the family now dared not pursue the matter any further even if they wanted to, and were obliged to digest in silence whatever they might feel of grief or anger. Jia Lian told Lin Zhi-xiao to account for the two hundred taels by adding a bit here and a bit there on to various items in the Current Expenses account. He also slipped Bao Er some money of his own and consoled him with a promise that he would pick a good wife for him at the earliest opportunity to replace the one he had just lost. Flattered by all the attention he was receiving and grateful for the money, Bao Er was only too willing to do as he was told and continued to serve Jia Lian with no less devotion than before. But that is no part of our story. Whatever internal uneasiness Xi-feng may have felt about these developments, outwardly she affected complete indifference. Finding herself alone with Patience when Jia Lian had gone, she smilingly inquired after her injuries. I was terribly drunk yesterday, she said. I hope you wont hold it against me, what I did then. Where did I hit you? Let me have a look. You didnt hit me very hard, said Patience. Just at that moment they were interrupted by an announcement from outside. Mrs Zhu and the young ladies are here. If you want to know what they had come for, you will have to read the following chapter. CHAPTER.45 Sisterly understanding finds expression in words of sisterly frankness And autumnal pluviousness is celebrated in verses of autumnal melancholy As we were saying at the end of the last chapter, Xi-feng had just begun expressing her concern for Patience when Li Wan and the cousins walked in. She broke off and invited them to be seated, and Patience went round and served them all with tea. What a crowd! said Xi-feng. Anyone would think Id sent out an invitation for something I There are two things we wanted to see you about, said Tan-chun. One is my affair the other concerns Xi-chun but also includes instructions from Grandmother. They must be very important things for a turn-out like this, said Xi-feng. We started a poetry club recently, said Tan-chun, and the very first time we had a regular meeting, somebody didnt turn up. As the rest of us are too soft to apply the rules ourselves, we want to invite you, as someone we could trust to apply them for us with iron impartiality, to be our Disciplinary Officer.
Aunt Xue put in an extenuating word for her niece, while laughing with the rest at her discomfiture. However much of an authority she may be, Im sure she would never presume to compete with you, Lady Jia. If she is wrong about the gauze, you must give her the benefit of your greater experience and put her right. I am sure the rest of us would like to know too. As a matter of fact that gauze is a good deal older than any of you here, said Grandmother Jia, so it is not very surprising that Feng mistook it for cicada wing. There is a certain resemblance, and cicada wing is what anyone would most likely take it to be who hadnt seen it before. The proper name for it, though, is haze diaphene. What a pretty name! said xi-feng. I must have seen several hundred different gauzes in my time but I must confess Ive never heard that name mentioned before. Grandmother Jia laughed. And what great age have you now reached, my dear, to be talking so freely about your vast experience? Haze diaphene used to come in four colours clear-sky blue , russet green , pine green and old rose. Hung up as bed-curtains or pasted in windows it looks from a distance like a coloured haze. Thats why they called it haze diaphene. The old rose kind is sometimes called afterglow. You wont find fabric made as fine or as soft as that nowadays, not even among the gauzes made for the Imperial Household. Never mind about Feng, said Aunt Xue, Ive never heard about this kind of gauze before either. While they continued to talk about it, Xi-feng sent someone to fetch a piece from the storeroom. Thats right, thats it! said Grandmother Jia when it arrived. When we first had it, we used it only for covering windows with, but later on we began experimenting and found that it made very good quilts and bed-curtains as well. Get a few lengths of it out tomorrow. You can use the old rose kind to re-cover these windows with. Xi-feng promised to see to it. Meanwhile the others were examining the gauze and admiring its quality. Grannie Liu was particularly impressed, uttering a whole series of Holy Names as she subjected it to close and careful scrutiny. I could never hope to get anything as good as this to make a dress with, she said. It seems a terrible waste to use it on windows. Actually it isnt much good for clothing, said Grandmother Jia. What about this, then? said Xi-feng, pulling out a flap of the quilted crimson gauze dress she was wearing underneath her jacket and holding it up for them to see. Yes, very fine, said Grandmother Jia, examining it. Ah, yes, now there you are! This is a modern Imperial Household gauze but you see its still not as good as that one there. Well, what do you make of that? said Xi-feng. That one there is only an Official Use fabric, yet this one Im wearing, which isnt as good quality, is Imperial H6usehold ! Anyway, have another look tomorrow, said Grandmother Jia. I think youll find that besides the old rose pieces you saw in that chest, theres a lot of clear-sky blue somewhere as well. If there is, get it all out give a length of it to our kinswoman here I should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings and any left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats for the girls. Theres no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed. Xi-feng, having first promised that she would do all these things, told the servant who had brought the sample to take it back to the storeroom. Were a bit cramped in here, said Grandmother Jia. Lets move on to somewhere else now. They say that great families live in great houses, said Grannie Liu, and truly, when I first went into Your Ladyships apartment yesterday and saw those great chests and cupboards and tables and beds, the size of everything fairly took my breath away. That great wardrobe of yours is higher and wider than one of our rooms back home. Im not surprised you keep a ladder in the back courtyard. When I first saw it, I thought to myself, Now what can they need a ladder for? They dont ripen things on the roofs as we do, so it cant be for that. And then of course I realized it must be for getting things out of the compartment on top of that ward-robe of yours, for you could never reach it else.
What a crowd! said Xi-feng. Anyone would think Id sent out an invitation for something I There are two things we wanted to see you about, said Tan-chun. One is my affair the other concerns Xi-chun but also includes instructions from Grandmother. They must be very important things for a turn-out like this, said Xi-feng. We started a poetry club recently, said Tan-chun, and the very first time we had a regular meeting, somebody didnt turn up. As the rest of us are too soft to apply the rules ourselves, we want to invite you, as someone we could trust to apply them for us with iron impartiality, to be our Disciplinary Officer. Thats the first thing. The second thing concerns this painting of the Garden that Xi-chun has been asked to do. There are all sorts of things shell need for it that she hasnt got. We spoke to Grandmother about it and she said that there might still be some things that would do in the downstairs store-room at the back. She said we ought to have a look, and if there are, we can use them. Otherwise, anything we havent got ourselves we should send outside for and buy. I know nothing about poetry, said Xi-feng. I couldnt compose a poem to save my life. I could come along to eat and drink with you if you like. You wouldnt have to compose poems, said Tan-chum Thats not what we want you for. All you have to do is keep an eye on the rest of us, and if you find anyone slacking or playing truant, decide how they ought to be punished. Dont try to fool me, said Xi-feng. Ive already guessed. Its not iron impartiality youre after, its financial backing. If youve got a club, youre sure to have some arrangement for taking it in turns to pay the bill, and as youre short of money, youve thought of this as a means of roping me in so that you can get some out of me. Thats the real reason for your invitation, isnt it? The others laughed. Too bad! Youve guessed. Youre like the original Crystal Man, Feng, said Li Wan. A heart of crystal in a body of glass. You can see through everything! Fancy! said Xi-feng, mockingly. The respected elder sister-in-law! The one whos put in charge of these young ladies to guide their studies and teach them needlework and good manners! You encourage them to start a poetry dub, but as soon as the question of money arises and incidentally, how much money is involved?it cant surely be very much, youre not interested it has nothing to do with you! Now, you have a monthly allowance of ten taels. Excluding Grandmother and Aunt Wang - and they are, after all, ladies of rank and titlethats twice as much as any of the rest of us gets. Yet Grandma and Auntie go on about how poor you are poor young widow I no means of her own!, Oh yes, and be-cause youve got a son, you get another ten taels a month on top of that, which actually makes you equal with Grandma and Auntie Wang. And youve got your land in the Garden, the best plot there. Its down in the tithe-book for the highest tithing. And you havent got a big establishment. I doubt there are ten of you there altogether, counting you and Lan and all the servants, so your outgoings cant come to very much. And in any case your food and clothing is all found out of common funds. If one were to add it all up together, I think your real income must be somewhere in the region of four or five hundred taels a year. Even if you were to spend one or two hundred a year out of that on amusements for the girls like this poetry thing, it wouldnt be for many years. Another year or two from now and theyll all be getting married. And its not as if you were saving up for their dowries, either. Thats hardly likely to be your responsibility. No, youre frightened of spending that money of yours, thats why youve set these girls on to me. Im supposed to go along like an innocent and eat and drink myself silly so that next day I can be made to foot the bill. Thats your little game, isnt it? Listen to her, all of you! said Li Wan, laughing. I make a single, inoffensive remark to her, and in return I get this cart-load of ill-bred abuse! Really, Feng, what a mercenary creature you are! Youre just like one of those muddy-legged wretches who stand haggling in the market-place with a little abacus up one sleeve to do their calculations on.
My place is outside the North Gate, said Xiang-lian. Do you think you can tear yourself from home and spend a whole night outside the city? What do I need a home for if Ive got you? said Xue Pan. All right, said Xiang-lian. Ill wait for you on the bridge then, outside the North Gate. Wed better get back to the party now. Dont forget wait a bit after Ive gone before going yourself then -no one should suspect anything. Yes, said Xue Pan, yes. The two of them then went in again and resumed their places. Xue Pan found waiting difficult and kept his eyes constantly on Xiang-lian, watching for him to go. At the same time he began, in joyous anticipation of the pleasures in store, to drink with greater and greater abandon, not waiting for the wine to be offered, but stretching out rudely to left and right of him and plying himself from the wine-kettles of his neighbours. Soon he was very drunk indeed. Xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved. First he gave an order to his page Almond, who was waiting there You go home now. I have some business outside the city to attend to. Ill be back later. Then he vaulted into the saddle and rode off until he came to the North Gate of the city. Passing through, he rode on till he came to the bridge, where he halted and took up his-station-to wait for Xue Pans arrival. After the time it would take to eat a meal, he caught sight of Xue Pan hurrying along in the distance. His mouth was open, his eyes were staring, and his head turned from side to side as he looked anxiously about him, for all the world like one of those little clapper drums that children twirl upon a stick. So intent was he on scanning the remoter parts of the landscape that he failed to take note of what was nearer at hand and rode right past Xiang-lian without seeing him. Xiang-lian, who for all his loathing could not but laugh at this, gave his horse rein and followed after. Presently Xue Pan began to notice that he was getting into the open country and brought his horse round about. As he did so, he found himself almost face to face with Xiang-lian. I knew you wouldnt fall me, he cried delightedly. Xiang-lian smiled back. Lets go on a bit furtherjust in case anyone is tracking us. He trotted on ahead and Xue Pan followed, keeping as close to him as he could. Presently, having satisfied himself that the country ahead was quite deserted, Xiang-lian dismounted near the edge of a reed-filled dyke and tied his horse up to a tree. You get down too, he called pleasantly to Xue Pan. Lets first swear an oath that if either of us is unfaithful to the other or betrays our secret to anyone, it shall happen to him as the oath shall say. Yes, said Xue Pan. Good ideal He dismounted eagerly tied his horse to another tree, and straightway knelt down and began his oath If ever, in the days to come, I prove unfaithful or betray this secret to another, may Heaven and Earth destroy He got no further. At that point there was a great thump and the sensation of being hit on the back of the neck by an object like a large iron hammer. Everything became suddenly black, except that the darkness was filled with a confusion of flying stars, and he collapsed forwards helplessly upon the ground. Xiang-lian stepped up and surveyed him from above. Someone not used to taking punishment, he concluded. It would be unwise to use too much force on him. Turning him over, he performed, with a few deft flicks over Xue Pans face, the operation which is described in the profession as opening up the fruits hop. At first Xue Pan struggled to get up, but Xiang-lian lashed out with his foot and sent him sprawling once more upon his back. You were willing, just as much as I was, Xue Pan muttered plaintively. You had only to say so if you werent. Why fool me into coming out here with you and then beat me up? He began cursing him obscenely. You blind iniquity! said Liu Xiang-lian. You dont know who youre dealing with. You should be begging for mercy right now, not swearing at me. Youre not worth killing, though. Ill just give you a little lesson. He picked up his horsewhip and turning Xue Pan on his face once more, proceeded to deal him thirty or forty cuts along the length of-his body, from his shoulders down to his calves.
He sends his compliments and says would I please give you this. Bao-yu opened it and read. Dear Father, I have the Honour to present my Humble Duty and hope this finds you as it leaves me in the Best of health, ever since you did me the great Kindness to recognize me as your Son I have been looking for some means of showing my appreciation of your great kindness but so far no opportunity has presented itself, to date. However, thanks to your esteemed Advice I have got to know several Nurserymen also a number of famous gardens and now through this contacts I have come across a very rare Variety of autumn crab flower Pure White only very little to be had, but using every means possible I have got two pots of it I hope you will think of me as a real Son and not refuse to keep them for your enjoyment. However, owing to the present Hot Weather I did not like to call in Person as the Young Ladies are outside in the Garden a lot owing to the heat, and not wishing to give Inconvenience I remain, -4800 Honoured Father, Your Dutifully and Affected Son, Jia Yun Bao-yu laughed when he had finished reading it. Is he alone ? he asked the old woman, or is there someone with him? Hes got a couple of young chaps with him carrying potted plants. I see. Well go back and thank him for me. Tell him its very kind of him and I very much appreciate it. And have the pots taken to my room. When he had given these instructions, he continued with Ebony on his way to Autumn Studio. He arrived to find that Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Ying-chun and Xi-chun had all got there before him. They laughed excitedly when they saw him enter. Here comes another one! I hadnt realized that I was so popular! said Tan-chun. I wrote to you all more or less on the spur of the moment. It was no more than a tentative suggestion. I had no idea it would meet with this instant response from everybody. Its a pity you didnt think of it earlier, said Bao-yu. We ought to have started a club long ago. Well I dont think its a pity, said Dai-yu. Do, by all means, have a poetry club if youre all so keen to, only count me out of it, please. I dont feel up to it. Ying-chun laughed. If youre not, then what about the rest of us? This is no time for false modesty, said Bao-yu. Here is a serious proposition and one which we are obviously all enthusiastic about. What we need are some ideas that we can all discuss. Come on, Chai! Lets hear what you have got to say first, then perhaps we can hear from Cousin Lin. Whats the hurry ? said Bao-chai. Were not even all here yet. Just as she was saying that, Li Wan arrived. She smiled at them all as she entered. My! What a poetic lot we are! If you are going to have a poetry club, may I propose myself for president? The idea of having one did in fact occur to me earlier in the year, but I thought that as I cant write poetry myself, a proposal coming from me might seem a bit presumptuous, and I did nothing about it. Now that my poetical sister-in-law has had the same idea, I should like to do what I can to help her get it Started. If we are definitely going to have a poetry club, said Dai-yu, then as members of the club we are all equals and fellow-poets. We cant go on calling ourselves cousin and sister-in-law all the time I quite agree, said Li Wan. We ought to choose pennames to sign our poems with, then we can use them for addressing each other by as well. I shall call myself Farmer Sweet-rice. I dont suppose anyone else will want that title. I shall call myself Autumn Studio, said Tan-chun. Thats pretty unoriginal! said Bao-yu. Cant you do any better than that? Youve got all those paulownias and plantain-trees around your place cant you make a name out of them? All right, said Tan-chun. Im very fond of my plantains. I shall call myself Under the Plantains. Thats very original, said the others admiringly. But Dai-yu laughed. Come on, everybody! she said. Pop her in the stew-pot! Well have a nice piece of venison with our wine. As no one could understand this recondite joke, Dai-yu undertook to explain it for them. Under the plantains is where the woodcutter in the old Taoist parable hid the deer he had killed so the allusion means a deer.
Still talking, they passed out of the gate of the Garden, at which point our narrative leaves them. Back at Green Delights, Aroma, seeing that the others had now gone, led Oriole into Bao-yus room to ask what it was that he wanted done. Bao-yu gave Oriole a smile. Im sorry, I was busy talking just now, he said. Im afraid I neglected you. The reason Ive dragged you here is because I want you to do some knotting for me. Whats it for? said Oriole. Never mind that, said Bao-yu airily. Do me some of every kind. Oriole clapped her hands and laughed. Goodness me! That would take me about ten year! My dear young lady, said Bao-yu pleasantly, you have all the time in the world at your disposal. Im sure you could manage in less time than that. Not in one sitting, at all events, said Aroma. Better choose two or three of the main types and let her do one of each. If youre talking about types, said Oriole, there are really only three fan tassels, rosary-nets and net-and-tassel fringes for sashes. All right, said Bao-yu, a sash-fringe. What colours the sash? said Oriole. Crimson. Black or navy- blue would go well with crimson, said Oriole. With anything lighter the crimson would be too overpowering. What goes with viridian? said Bao-yu. Peach pink . Mm. That sounds very colourful, certainly. What about something colourful but a bit more on the quiet side? What about leek- green and green ish- yellow ? said Oriole. Thats a very tasteful combination. All right, you make me those three then one black, one peach- pink and one leek- green . What pattern do you want for the netting? said Oriole. What patterns are there? said Bao-yu. Theres stick-pattern, ladder-pattern, diamond, double diamond, linked rings, flower-pattern, willow-leaf... What was the pattern of that netting you did the other day for Tan-chun? Ah, that was a flower-pattern with filled-in centres. Id like it in that pattern. Aroma had meanwhile left them to fetch the silks. As she came back with them, an old woman called through the window to say that her lunch was ready. Off with you then, said Bao-yu, and come back as soon as you have finished. How can I possibly leave with a guest here in the room said Aroma. Dont be ridiculous! said Oriole. You go and have your lunch. Aroma smiled at that and tripped off, leaving the two of them alone together, except for two very junior maids who were to remain at hand in case they were wanted. Bao-yu lay and watched Oriole knotting, chatting to her in a desultory way as he watched. How old are you? he asked her. Oriole replied without raising her head from her work. Fourteen. Whats your surname? Huang. Huang? That means yellow . It goes well with your name. They say yellow oriole, dont they? yellow oriole, golden oriole, My name was Golden Oriole originally, said Oriole, but Miss Bao found it too much of a mouthful, so she called me just Oriole for short, and now everyone else does. Miss Bao must be very fond of you, said Bao-yu. I expect later on when she gets married shell want to take you with her. Oriole pulled a face and laughed. Ive often said to Aroma, Bao-yu went on, whoever gets you and your mistress will be a lucky man. Shes a good person, is our Miss Bao, said Oriole, much more than you realize. There are things about her you dont find in many people in this worldmore important things than good looksthough shes good-looking too, of course. Orioles mellifluous, lilting voice and the simple, artless way in which she talked and laughed had powerfully affected Bao-yu. it increased his pleasure to hear her speaking in this way now about her mistress. What things? he asked her eagerly. Tell me about them. If I do, said Oriole, you mustnt let her know that I to you. Of course not. They were interrupted at this point by a voice from the outer room. Youre very quiet in there! As the two of them simultaneously turned to look, it was Bao-chai herself who stepped into the room.
I belong to Her Ladyship now. Now if I want to leave you, I dont have to talk to you about it at all. All I have to do is have a word with Her Ladyship, and off I go! Bao-yu laughed. Suppose I were at fault and you told Her Ladyship and asked her to let you go dont you think youd feel just a tiny bit uncomfortable afterwards when it got about that you had left me because I wasnt good enough for you? Why ever should I? said Aroma. Of course, I wouldnt go if it meant marrying a thief or a murderer. Theres always another way out. I could always take my own life. We all have to die some time or other its just a question of when. All youve got to do is stop breathing, thats all. After that you hear nothing, see nothing - its all over! Stop it, now! Stop it! said Bao-yu, covering her mouth with his hand. You dont have to say things like that. All too familiar with the peculiarities of this master who condemned flattering auspicious talk as false and hollow, but was upset and morose if you told him the truth, Aroma regretted her blunder in having too openly spoken her mind. Smilingly she turned the conversation on to topics which experience taught her were agreeable to him the beauties of Nature, the beauties of girls, girls. But somehow from there the conversation imperceptibly found its way round to the subject of girls dying. Suddenly realizing this, Aromait was she who was talking at the time broke off in alarm. Bao-yu, who up to that point had been listening to her enthralled, laughed at her sudden silence. We all have to die, as you said yourself just now. The problem is how to die well. Those whiskered idiots who take quite literally the old saw that a scholar dies protesting and a soldier dies fighting and get themselves killed off on the assumption that those are the only two ways in which a man of spirit can die gloriously, would do better to die in their beds. For when you come to think of it, the only real occasion for protesting is when ones ruler is misguided, and the only real occasion for fighting is when ones country is at war. If the scholar is so greedy for martyrdom that he throws away his life at the earliest opportunity, what is to become of the poor misguided ruler in the absence of good advisers? And if the soldier so hankers for a heros death that he gets himself killed off in the first encounter, what is to become of his country without soldiers to fight its battles? But surely, Aroma interrupted, those famous men in the olden days laid their lives down because they had to? Nonsense! said Bao-yu. The soldiers among them lacked generalship as a consequence, they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on. They threw their lives away out of sheer incompetence. Do you call that dying because they had to? And the scholars were even worse. On the strength of having read a couple of books and got up a text or two by heart, they began to cry stinking fish as soon as they found the smallest thing at Court not as they thought it should be, in the hope of winning themselves an imperishable reputation for honesty then, if the Court didnt immediately change its policy, they would work themselves into a passion and promptly get themselves killed. You wont, surely, say that they died because they had to? What you have to remember is that Emperors hold their power from Heaven, and its unthinkable that Heaven should lay the huge responsibility of empire on any but the worthiest shoulders. So you can see that all those death-with-honour characters you have so high an opinion of were thinking only of their own personal fame and glory. They werent really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at all. Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently decompose there until thewind had picked my bones clean, and after that never, never to be reborn again as a human beingthat would be a really good death. Im sleepy, said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes -and fell fast asleep. By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten. A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Gardens possibilities, and its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his appetite for more.
If anything were to happen to her, I should have no one to turn to. Xue Pan, who had overheard, came running into the room at this point. Clasping his hands together, he pumped them up and down, at the same time making sweeping bows to right and left of him, in token of his contrition. Forgive me, sis, he said. Id had too much to drink last night. I met a friend on my way home. It was already quite late when I bumped into him, and I still hadnt sobered up properly when I got back here. I dont know myself what it was I said, but I know I must have talked a lot of silly nonsense. Im not surprised you were angry with me. The clumsiness of his apology rapidly turned Bao-chais weeping into laughter. Lifting her face up from the handkerchief in which it had been buried, she made a little grimace of derision. Theres no need for you to put on this act, she said I understand what your real motive is perfectly well. You dont like having us womenfolk around you and you are looking for a means of getting rid of us, so that you can have the place here to yourself. Xue Pan laughed deprecatingly. I dont know where you got that idea from, sis, he said. Its very unlike you to make a snide remark like that. Snide remark? said Aunt Xue indignantly. If thats a snide remark, I dont know what sort of remarks you were making to your sister last night. I think you must have taken leave of your senses! Now Mamma, dont be angry, said Xue Pan, and dont you be upset, sis. Suppose I were to tell you that from now on Im going to give up drinking with the others altogether, eh? What would you say to that? Id say that you had come to your senses at last, said Bao-chai. And Id say that the Heavenly Dragon had laid an egg, said Aunt Xue, if you really had the will-power to do it. All right then, said Xue Pan. If you ever hear that Ive been drinking with those others again, sis, you can spit at me and you can call me a beast and aand a worthless louse! Dammit, its too bad that the two of you should be worried all the time because of me! Its bad enough that I should make you angry, Mamma but to have poor little sis, too, worrying her heart outoh, I really am a louse! I ought to be extra good to you, Mamma, now that Fathers dead, and extra kind to sis but instead I make my own dear Mother angry and little sis upset. Im not a beast, Im worse than a beast I, And the great booby began to cry. At this Aunt Xue, who had not been crying when he started, was herself becoming upset, and Bao-chai was obliged to intervene with a brisk cheerfulness that she was very far from feeling. Havent you caused enough trouble already without making Mamma cry again? Who says Ive been making Mamma cry? said Xue Pan, restraining his tears and grinning back at her. All right then, all right. Lets drop the whole subject and say no more about it. Well have Caltrop in and get her to pour you a nice cup of tea. I don t want any tea, thank you, said Bao-chai. As soon as Mamma has washed, I shall be going back into the Garden with her. Let me look at that-locket of yours, said Xue Pan. I-think it needs dipping again. Whatever for? said Bao-chai. The gildings as bright as new. Isnt it time you had a few more clothes? said Xue Pan. Let me know what colours and what sort of patterns you want. I wouldnt know what to do with them, said Bao-chai. I havent yet worn all the things Ive got. Shortly after this exchange Aunt Xue re-emerged from changing her clothes and, taking Bao-chai by the hand, went through into the Garden with her, leaving Xue Pan to go off on his own. Once in the Garden, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai made their way straight to Green Delights. From the large number of maids and older women they found when they got there waiting outside on the verandah or in the ante-room inside, they knew that Grandmother Jia and the other ladies must have arrived there before them. They exchanged greetings with the latter on entering, after which they went over to the couch on which Bao-yu lay, to inquire if he was feeling any better.
Adamantina smiled graciously. That would be very nice. But tell them to bring the water only as far as the gate. They can leave it there at the foot of the outer wall. Tell them not to come inside. Of course, said Bao 1 u, putting the cup into his sleeve as they went into the foyer. He found a junior maid of Grandmother Jias there and entrusted it to her. When Grannie Liu goes, see that she takes this Cup with her, will you? By the time he had done this, Grandmother Jia was already outside in the courtyard expressing a desire to get back. Adamantina made no serious effort to detain her, and after seeing her guests out of the Hermitage, went in again and closed the gate after her. Back at the scene of the party, Grandmother Jia, who was feeling somewhat exhausted, told Lady Wang and the girls to act as hostesses to Aunt Xue while she herself went off to Sweet-rice Village for a rest. Xi-feng ordered the servants to fetch a little bamboo carrying-chair, which Grandmother Jia got into. Two old women lifted it up, and then off they all went, Xi-feng and Li Wan one on either side of it and a little cohort of maids and older servants bringing up the rear. As soon as Grandmother Jia had gone, Aunt Xue excused herself and left, Lady Wang, having dismissed the young actresses and given orders for the left-over food in the lacquer boxes to be distributed among the maids, also availed herself of the opportunity of taking a rest. Putting her feet up on the couch lately occupied by Grandmother Jia, she first caused the blinds to be let down, then, instructing one of the junior maids to massage her legs, and murmuring something about calling her if anyone came from Her Old Ladyship, she settled her-self down for a nap. Bao-yu and the girls watched the maids take the food-boxes out onto the rockery. Some sat there on the rocks for their picnic others spread out over the grass below or sat under the trees or down at the waters edge. Although so dispersed, they managed to create a considerable hubbub. After a little while Faithful arrived with instructions to show Grannie Liu some more of the Garden. The cousins, hoping for more laughs, went along with them. A short walk took them to the monumental stone arch at the entrance to the Reunion Palace. Goodness me! said the old woman. You even have a temple here! She fell down on her knees and kotowed, causing her young companions to double up with laughter. Why do you laugh? she said. Do you think I dont know what the words say? We have quite a few temples where I come from and they all have arches like this. The writing on the arch is the name of the temple. All right. Whats the name of this temple then? they asked her. Grannie Liu pointed upwards at the characters inscribed overhead. Temple of the Jade Emperor. Thats what it says, doesnt it? This produced an ecstasy of merriment in the young people. No doubt they would have gone on teasing her, but just at that moment there was an alarming rumble from her bowels and she clutched the hand of one of the little maidservants standing by and begged her for the favour of a couple of sheets of paper, while with the other hand she began undoing the buttons of her dress. The others, still laughing, shouted at her to stop No, no! Not here! Not here! They told one of the older women to escort her to a place beyond the north-east corner of the precincts where there was a privy. Having led Grannie Liu to within sight of it and pointed it out to her, the old servant deemed this an excellent opportunity of taking some time off, and went away, leaving Grannie Liu to make her way back alone. Now Grannie Liu had drunk quantities of yellow rice-wine, which did not in fact agree with her on top of that she had eaten a lot of rich, fatty food and as the food had made her thirsty, she had concluded by drinking an excessive amount of tea. The upset stomach which was the inevitable consequence of so much indulgence kept her a wearisome long time in the privy before her business there was completed. When she at last emerged, the colder air outside drove the wine fumes up into her head, increasing the dizziness, which might be thought normal in a woman of her years who has suddenly got up after squatting for a long time on her heels, to such an extent that she was quite Unable to make out the route that she had come by. Everywhere she looked there were buildings, rocks and trees. Unable to decide which of them lay in the right direction, she made for the nearest paved path and, with slow and deliberate steps, followed it to see where it would take her.
And since the fate and future happiness of those fortunate beings seemed to depend wholly on the instrumentality of such trifling objects, it was natural for her to suppose that Bao-yus acquisition of the gold kylin would become the occasion of a dramatic rupture with her and the beginning of an association with Xiang-yun in which he and Xiang-yun would do together all those delightful things that she had read about in the romances. It was with such apprehensions that she made her way stealthily towards Green Delights, her intention being to observe how the two of them were behaving and shape her own actions accordingly. Imagine her surprise when, just as she was about to enter, she heard Xiang-yun lecturing Bao-yu on his social obligations and Bao-yu telling Xiang-yun that Cousin Lin never talked that sort of rubbish and that if she did he would have fallen out with her long ago. Mingled emotions of happiness, alarm, sorrow and regret assailed her. Happiness Because after all she thought I wasnt mistaken in my judgement of you. I always thought of you as a true friend, and I was right. Alarm Because if you praise me so unreservedly in front of other people, your warmth and affection are sure, sooner or later, to excite suspicion and be misunderstood. Regret Because if you are my true friend, then I am yours and the two of us are a perfect match. But in that case why did there have to be all this talk of the gold and the jade? Alter-natively, if there had to be all this talk of gold and jade, why werent we the two to have them? Why did there have to be a Bao-chai with her golden locket? Sorrow Because though there are things of burning importance to be said, without a father or a mother I have no one to say them for me. And besides, I feel so muzzy lately and I know that my illness is gradually gaining a hold on me. The doctors say that the weakness and anaemia I suffer from may be the beginnings of a consumption. So even if I am your true love, I fear I may not be able to wait for you. And even though you are mine, you can do nothing to alter my fate. At that point in her reflections she began to weep and feeling in no fit state to be seen, she turned away from the door and began to make her way back again. Bao-yu had finished his hasty dressing and now came out of the house. He saw Dai-yu slowly walking on ahead of him and, judging by her appearance from behind, wiping her eyes. He hurried forward to catch up with her. Where are you off to, coz? Are you crying again? Who has upset you this time? Dai-yu turned and 8aw that it was Bao-yu. Im perfectly all right, she said, forcing a smile. What would I be crying for? Look at you! The tears are still wet on your face. How can you tell such fibs? Impulsively he stretched out his hand to wipe them. Dai-yu recoiled several paces Youll get your head chopped off! she said. You really must keep your hands to yourself Im sorry. My feelings got the better of me. Im afraid I wasnt thinking about my head. No, I forgot, said Dai-yu. Losing your head is nothing, is it? Its losing your kylinthe famous gold kylin-that is really serious! Her words immediately put Bao-yu in a passion. He came up to her and held his face close to hers. Do you say these things to put a curse on me? or is it merely to make me angry that you say them ? Remembering their recent quarrel, Dai-yu regretted her careless reintroduction of its theme and hastened to make amends Now dont get excited. I shouldnt have said that - oh come now, it really isnt that important! Look at you! The veins are standing out on your forehead and your face is all covered with sweat. She moved forward and wiped the perspiration from his brow. For some moments he stood there motionless, staring at her. Then he said Dont worry! Hearing this, Dai-yu herself was silent for some moments. Why should I worry? she said eventually. I dont understand you. Would you mind telling me what you are talking about? Bao-yu sighed. Do you really not understand? Can I really have been all this time mistaken in my feelings towards you? If you dont even know your own mind, its small wonder that youre always getting angry on my account. I really dont understand what you mean about not worrying, said Dai-yu. Bao-yu sighed again and shook his head.
When they had galloped without stopping for two or three miles, in the course of which the signs of human habitation had gradually grown more and more sparse, Bao-yu finally reined to a halt and turned back to ask Tealeaf if there was anywhere where they could purchase some incense. I dare say we could find somewhere, said Tealeaf without much conviction. It depends what kind of incense you want. Bao-yu reflected for some moments. Honeybush, sandal and lakawood, he said. It has to be those three. I doubt if youll be able to get them, said Tealeaf, smiling at the navet of one who could expect to make such purchases in such a place. But when he saw that Bao-yu was genuinely distressed, he added Whats it for? Ive noticed that you often carry powdered incense in that sachet you wear. Why not see if youve got any in that? Bao-yu, glad to be reminded, extracted the silk purse that he wore suspended from his neck underneath the front fold of his gown, felt inside it with his fingers, and was delighted to find that there was still a pinch or two of powdered agalloch in the bottom. Seems a bit lacking in respect to use this though, he thought. Still, its more respectful to use something Ive carried all the way here myself than it would be to use something Id just bought in a shop. Having decided that the powdered incense would do, he asked Tealeaf where he could get hold of an incense-burner and some fire. Now those we cant get, said Tealeaf. Where could we, Out here in the middle of the wilds? If you knew you were going to need them, why didnt you tell me beforehand, and we could have brought them with us? Stupid idiot I said Bao-yu. Do you honestly think we could have ridden out at this break-neck pace if wed been carrying an incense-burner full of hot coals with us? Tealeaf, after some moments of reflection, smiled uncertainly I know what we could do, Master, though I dont know what youll think of the idea. Theres little enough hope of our getting the things youve just asked for round here, and the chances are that even if we could, youd only start thinking of something else you needed that was even harder to get. Now if we were to go on for about another two thirds of a mile in this direction, we should come to the Temple of the Water Spirit Bao-yu pricked up his ears. The Temple of the Water Spirit? Is that near here? Good. That will do even better. Lets go there then. With a touch of the whip he was away once more, still talking to Tealeaf over his shoulder as he rode ahead. The nun at the Water Spirit is one of our regular callers. If I see her when we get there and tell her we want to use one of her burners, shes sure to let us. Even if this wasnt one of the temples we subscribe to, said Tealeaf, Im sure they wouldnt dare refuse if you asked them. But why is it that today you are so willing to go to the Temple of the Water Spirit when normally you can scarcely abide to hear it mentioned? The reason I normally feel that way about it, said Bao-yu, is because I hate the silly, senseless way in which vulgar people offer worship and build temples to gods they know nothing about. Ignorant old men and women with too much money to spend hear the name of some god or othertheyve no idea who it is, but the mere fact that theyve heard it from the lips of some ballad-singer or story-teller seems to them incontrovertible proof of the gods existenceand go founding temples in which these fictitious deities can he worshipped. Take this Temple of the Water Spirit. The reason its called that is because the divinity worshipped in it is supposed to be the goddess of the river Luo. Now in point of fact no Goddess -1344 of the Luo ever existed. She was an invention of the poet Cao Zhi. But that didnt stop a lot of people making an image of her and worshipping it. The only reason I feel differently about this temple today is because the idea of a water-goddess just happens to fit in with the thing that is at the moment uppermost in my mind so Im glad to make use of it for my own purpose. By this time they had reached the gate of the temple. The old nun who kept it, hardly less surprised to hear of Bao-yus arrival than she would have been if she had been told that a dragon had just fallen, alive and kicking, out of the sky, hurried out to greet him, and ordered the old temple-servant who did duty as a porter to take care of the horses.
I try and try, but it gets me nowhere and nobody knows or cares. At this pointin spite of himselfhe burst into tears. The palpable evidence of her own eyes and ears had by now wrought a considerable softening on Dai-yus heart. A sympathetic tear stole down her own cheek, and she hung her head and said nothing. Bao-yu could see that he had moved her. I know Im not much use nowadays, he continued, but however bad you may think me, I would never wittingly do anything in your presence to offend you. If I do ever slip up in some way, you ought to tell me off about it and warn me not to do it again, or shout at mehit me, even, if you feel like it I shouldnt mind. But you dont do that. You just ignore me. You leave me utterly at a loss to know what Im supposed to have done wrong, so that Im driven half frantic wondering what I ought to do to make up for it. If I were to die now, I should die with a grievance, and all the masses and exorcisms in the world wouldnt lay my ghost. Only when you explained what your reason was for ignoring me should I cease from haunting you and be reborn into another life. Dai-yus resentment for the gate incident had by now completely evaporated. She merely said Oh well, in that case why did you tell your maids not to let me in when I came to call on you? I honestly dont know what you are referring to, said Bao-yu in surprise. Strike me dead if I ever did any such thing! Hush! said Dai-yu. Talking about death at this time of the morning! You should be more careful what you say. If you did, you did. If you didnt, you didnt. Theres no need for these horrible oaths. I really and truly didnt know you had called, said Bao-yu. Cousin Bao came and sat with me a few minutes last night and then went away again. Thats the only call I know about. Dai-yu reflected for a moment or two, then smiled. Yes, it must have been the maids being lazy. Certainly they can be very disagreeable at such times. Yes, Im sure thats what it was, said Bao-yu. When I get back, Ill find out who it was and give her a good talking-to. I think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to, said Dai-yu, though its not really for me to say so. Its a good job it was only me they were rude to. If Miss Bao or Miss Cow were to call and they behaved like that to her, that would be really serious. She giggled mischievously. Bao-yu didnt know whether to laugh with her or grind his teeth. But just at that moment a maid came up to ask them both to lunch and the two of them went together out of the Garden and through into the front part of the mansion, calling in at Lady Wangs on the way. How did you get on with that medicine of Dr Baos, Lady Wang asked Dai-yu as soon as she saw her, the Court Physician? Do you think you are any better for it? It didnt seem to make very much difference, said Dai-yu. Grandmother has put me back on Dr Wangs prescription. Cousin Lin has got a naturally weak constitution, Mother, said Bao-yu. She takes cold very easily. These strong decoctions are all very well provided she only takes one or two to dispel the cold. For regular treatment its probably best if she sticks to pills. The doctor was telling me about some pills for her the other day, said Lady Wang, but I just cant remember the name. I know the names of most of those pills, said Bao-yu. I expect he wanted her to take Ginseng Tonic Pills. No, that wasnt it, said Lady Wang. Eight Gem Motherwort Pills? said Bao-yu. Zhangs Dextrals?. Zhangs Sinistrals? If it wasnt any of them, it was probably Dr Cuis Adenophora Kidney Pills. No, said Lady Wang, it was none of those. All I can remember is that there was a Vajra in it. Bao-yu gave a hoot and clapped his hands Ive never heard of Vajra Pills. If there are Vajra Pills, I suppose there must be Buddha Boluses ! The others all laughed. Bao-chai looked at him mockingly. I should think it was probably The Deva-king Cardiac Elixir Pills, she said. Yes, yes, thats it! said Lady Wang.
I am about to interrogate you. Dai-yu was mystified. Poor Bao-chai! she said, laughing. The girls gone off her head. Interrogate me about what ? My dear, well-bred young lady! said Bao-chai. My dear, sheltered young innocent! What were those things I heard you saying yesterday? Come now, the truth! Dai-yu, still mystified, continued to laugh. She was beginning to feel somewhat uneasy, though she would not admit it. What awful thing am I supposed to have said? I expect youre making it up, but you may as well tell me. Still acting the innocent? said Bao-chai. What were those things you said yesterday when we were laying that drinking game? I couldnt think where you could have got them from. Dai-yu cast her mind back and remembered, blushing, that the day before, when stumped for an answer, she had got through her turn by citing passages from The Return of the Soul and The Western Chamber. She hugged Bao-chai imploringly. Dear coz! I really dont know. I just said them without thinking. If you tell me not to, I promise not to say them again. I really dont know either, said Bao-chai. I just thought they sounded rather interesting. I thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were. Dear coz! Please dont tell anyone about this. I promise not to repeat such things again. Moved by the scarlet, shame-filled face and pitifully entreating voice, Bao-chai relented and did not pursue her questioning. Having first drawn her down into a seat and handed her some tea, she began, very gently, to address her in the following manner What do you take me for? Im just as bad. At seven or eight I used to be a real little terror. Ours was reckoned to be rather a literary family. My grandfather was a bibliophile, so the house we lived in was full of books. We were a big family in those days. All my boy cousins and girl cousins on my fathers side lived with us in the same house. All of us younger people hated serious books but liked reading poetry and plays. The boys had got lots and lots of plays The Western Chamber, The Lute-player, A Hundred Yuan Plays just about everything you could think of. They used to read them behind our backs, and we girls used to read them behind theirs. Eventually the grown-ups got to know about it and then there were beatings and lectures and burning of booksand that was the end of that. So, you see, in the case of us girls it would probably be better for us if we never learned to read in the first place. Even boys, if they gain no understanding from their reading, would do better not to read at all and if that is true of boys, it certainly holds good for girls like you and me. The little poetry-writing and calligraphy we indulge in is not really our proper business. Come to that, it isnt a boys proper business either. A boys proper business is to read books in order to gain an understanding of things, so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing the country. Not that one hears of that happening much nowadays. Nowadays their reading seems to make them even worse than they were to start with. And unfortunately it isnt merely a case of their being led astray by what they read. The books, too, are spoiled, by the false interpretations they put upon them. They would do better to leave books alone and take up business or agriculture. At least they wouldnt do so much damage. As for girls like you and me spinning and sewing are our proper business. What do we need to be able to read for? But since we can read, let us confine ourselves to good, improving books let us avoid like the plague those pernicious works of fiction, which so undermine the character that in the end it is past reclaiming. This lengthy homily had so chastened Dai-yu that she sat with head bowed low over her teacup and, though her heart consented, could only manage a weak little yes by way of reply. At that moment Candida came into the room Mrs Zhu says will you please come over to discuss an important matter with her? Miss Ying and Miss Tan and Miss Xi and Miss Shi and Master Bao are there already, waiting for you. I wonder what it is this time, said Bao-chai. We shall soon find out if we go, said Dai-yu. So off she went, and Bao-chai with her, to Sweet-rice Village. They found everyone else there, as Candida had said. Li Wan greeted them with a smile.
He was a little shy of ad-dressing her at that particular moment and was still hesitating when Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash. He had to go in again without having spoken to her. While Crimson stood there musing, she suddenly became aware that Aroma was beckoning to her, and hurried up to see what she wanted. Our spittoon is broken, Aroma said. Can you go to Miss Lins and ask them if they will lend us one until we can get a replacement? Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiads House. When she got to Green Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees. She could just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on some rocks supervising them. She would have liked to go over, but did not quite dare, and having collected the spittoon, returned, in very low spirits, and lay down in her own room to brood. The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took no notice. Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-tengs lady. A message had already been received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the invitation was from her brothers wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to. Wang Zi-tengs other. sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until the evening. Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wangs kang, called for a candle to be lit, and, with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and shortly after that informing G6lden ?hat she was standing in his light. The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no noticeall, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly counselled some restraint Try not to throw your weight about so! she said. Its silly to put peoples backs up. Jia Huan scowled angrily I know what Im doing, he said. Iont talk to me like a child! Youre friends with Bao-yu nowadays, arent you? You dont like me any more. I know. Ive watched you both. Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger You ungrateful thing! Youre like the dog that bit L Dong-bin you dont know a friend when you see one. They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink. In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few respectful words to his mother, asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mothers bosom to be fondled and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the days events. Youve been drinking again, child, said Lady Wang. Your face is burning. All this romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there! She made them bring him a head-rest. and he lay down behind her, towards the back of the kang. Sunset was instructed to massage him by gently patting his legs. He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you! He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp.
As much distressed by his mothers words as he was alarmed by her arrival, Jia Zheng hurried out to meet her, She was leaning on the shoulder of a little maid, her old head swaying from side to side with the effort of running, and panting as she ran. Jia Zheng bowed down before her and his face assumed the semblance of a smile. Surely, Mother, in such hot weather as this there is no need for you to come here ? If you have any instructions, you should call for me and let me come to you. Grandmother Jia had stopped when- she heard this voice -and now stood panting for some moments while she regained her breath. When she spoke, her voice had an unnatural shrillness in it. Oh! Are you speaking to me? Yes, as a matter of fact I have got instructions, as you put it but as unfortunately Ive never had a good son who cares for me, theres no one I can give them to. Wounded in his most sensitive spot, Jia Zheng fell on his knees before her The voice in which he replied to her was broken with tears. How can I bear it, Mother, if you speak to me like that? What I did to the boy I did for the honour of the family. Grandmother Jia spat contemptuously. A single harsh word from me and you start whining that you cant bear it. How do you think Bao-yu could bear your cruel rod? And you say youve been punishing him for the honour of the family, but you just tell me this did your own father ever punish yon in such a way? I think not. She was weeping now herself. Dont upset yourself, Mother, said Jia Zheng, with the same forced smile. I acted too hastily. From now on Ill never beat him again, if thats what you wish. Hoity-toity, keep your temper! said Grandmother Jia. Hes your son. If you want to beat him, thats up to you. If we women are in your way, well leave you alone to get on with it. She turned to her attendants. Call my carriage. Your Mistress and I and Bao-you are going back to Nanking. We shall be leaving immediately. The -servants made a show of compliance. No need for you to cry, she said, turning to Lady Wang. You love Bao-yu now that hes young, but when hes grown up and become an important official, hell like enough forget that youre his mother. Much better force yourself not to love him now and save yourself some anguish later on. Jia Zheng threw himself forward on his face. Dont say that, Mother! Dont reject your own son! On the contrary, said Grandmother Jia, it is you who have rejected me . But dont worry. When I have gone back to Nanking, there will be no one here to stop you. You can beat away to your hearts content. She turned to the servants. Come on, hurry up with that packing! And get the carriage and horses ready so that we can be on our way. Jia Zhengs kotows were by now describing the whole quarter circle from perpendicular to ground. But the old lady walked on inside, ignoring him. From the sight that met her eyes she could tell that this had been no ordinary beating. It filled her with anguish for the sufferer and fresh anger for the man who had inflicted it, and for a long time she clung to the inert form and wept, only gradually calming down under the combined coaxing of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Li Wan. At this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted to raise Bao-yu to his feet. Idiots! said Xi-feng. Havent you got eyes in your heads? Cant you see that hes in no fit state to walk? Go and get that wicker summer-bed from inside and carry him in on that. The servants rushed out and presently reappeared carrying a long, narrow couch of woven rattan between them, on to which they lifted Bao-yu. Then, with Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest of the womenfolk leading the way, they carried him to Grandmother Jias apartment and set him down inside it. Jia Zheng, conscious that his mothers wrath against him had not abated and unwilling to leave things where they stood, had followed the little procession inside. His eyes travelled from Bao-yu, who, he now saw, really had been beaten very badly, to Lady Wang. She was sobbing bitterly, interspersing her sobs with cries of My child! and My son!. Presently she broke off and began railing at the object of her sorrow Why couldnt you have died instead of Zhu?
She went up to them Excuse me, does either of you young ladies happen to know where Mrs Lian went to just now, please? Try Mrs Zhus place, said Tan-chun. Crimson hurried off in the direction of Sweet-rice Village. On her way she ran head-on into a party of maids consisting of Skybright, Mackerel, Emerald, Ripple, Musk, Scribe, Picture and Oriole. Here, what are you gadding about like this for? said Skybright as soon as she saw who it was. The flowers want watering the birds need feeding the stove for the tea-water needs seeing to. Youve no business to go wandering around outside! Master Bao gave orders yesterday that the flowers were only to be watered every other day, said Crimson. I fed the birds when you were still fast asleep in bed. What about the stove? said Emerald. It isnt my day for the stove, said Crimson. The tea-water today has nothing to do with me. Listen to Miss Pert! said Mackerel. I wouldnt bother about her, if I were youjust leave her to wander about as she pleases. Im no wandering about, if you really want to know, said Crimson. If you really want to know, Mrs Lian sent me outside to take a message and to fetch something for her. She held up the purse for them to see at which they were silent But when they had passed each other, Skybright laughed sneeringly You can see why shes so uppity. Shes on the climb again. Look at herall cock-a-hoop because someones given her a little message to carry! And she probably doesnt even know who its about. Well, one little message isnt going to get her very far. Its what happens in the long run that counts. Now if she were clever enough to climb her way right out of this Garden and stay there, that would be really something! These words were spoken for Crimson to hear, but in such a way that she was unable to answer them. She had to swallow her anger and hurry on to look for Xi-feng. Xi-feng was in Li Wans room, as Tan-chun had predicted, and Crimson found the two of them in conversation. She went up to Xi-feng and delivered her message Patience says that she found the silver just after you had gone and took care of it and she says that when Zhang Cais wife came for it she did weigh it out in front of her before giving it to her to take away. Crimson now produced the purse and handed it to Xi-feng. Then she added Patience told me to tell you that Brightie has just been in to inquire what your instructions were for his visit, and she said that she gave him a message to take based on the things she thought you would want him to say. Oh? said Xi-feng, amused. And what was this message based on the things she thought I would want him to say? She said he was to tell them Our lady hopes your lady is well and she says that the Master is away at present and may not be back for another day or two, but your lady is not to worry and when the lady from West Lane is better, our lady will come with their lady to see your lady. And our lady says that the lady from West Lane sent someone the other day with a message from the elder Lady Wang saying that she hopes our lady is well and will she please see if our Lady Wang can let her have a few of her Golden Myriad Macrobiotic Pills and if she can, will our lady please send someone with them to her, because someone will be going from there to the el der Lady Wangs in a few days time and they will be able to take them for her Crimson was still in full spate when Li Wan interrupted her with a laugh What an extraordinary number of ladies! I hope you can understand what its all about, Feng. Im sure I cant ! Im not surprised, said Xi-feng. There are four or five different households involved in that message. She smiled graciously at Crimson. Youre a clever girl, my dear, to have got it all rightnot like the simpering little ninnies I usually have to put up with. You have no idea, cousin, she said, turning to Li Wan again. Apart from the one or two girls and one or two older women that I always keep about me, I just dread talking to servants nowadays. They take such an interminable time to tell you anything so long-winded! And the airs and graces they give themselves! and the simpering! and the urn-mg and ah-mg! If they only knew how it makes me fume! Our Patience used to be like that when she first came to me.
Xue Pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his eyes seemed about to pop out of his head. After glaring fixedly for an unconscionable time, he said The girls upset He coughed a couple of times. Then at last it came The girls upset Shes married to a marmoset. The others greeted this with a roar of laughter. What are you laughing at? said Xue Pan. Thats perfectly reasonable, isnt it? If a girl was expecting a proper husband and he turned out to be one of them, shed have cause to be upset, wouldnt she ? His audience were by now doubled up. Thats perfectly true, they conceded. Very good. Now what about the next bit? Xue Pan glared a while very concentratedly, then The girl looks glum But after that was silence. Come on! said the others. Why was she glum? His dads a baboon with a big red bum. Ho! Ho! Ho! Pay the forfeit, they cried. The first one was bad enough. We really cant let this one go. The more officious of them even began filling the sconce-cups for him. But Bao-yu allowed the line. As long as it rhymes, he said, well let it pass. There you are! said Xue Pan. The M. C. says its all right. What are the rest of you making such a fuss about? At this the others desisted. The next two are even harder, said Nuageuse. Shall I do them for you, dear? Piss off! said Xue Pan. Dyou think I havent got any good lines of my own? Listen to this The girl feels blest In bridal bower she takes her rest. The others stared at him in amazement I say, old chap, thats a bit poetical for you, isnt it? Xue Pan continued unconcernedly The girls content Shes got a big prick up her vent. The others looked away with expressions of disgust. Oh dear, oh dear! Hurry up and get on with the song, then. One little gnat went hum hum hum, Xue Pan began tunelessly. The others looked at him open-mouthed What sort of song is that? Xue Pan droned on, ignoring the question Two little flies went bum bum bum, Three little Stop! shouted the others. Sod you lot! said Xue Pan. This is the very latest new hit. Its called the Hum-bum Song. If you cant be bothered to listen to it, youll have to let me off the other thing. Ill agree not to sing the rest of the song on that condition. Yes, yes, well let you off, they said. Just dont interfere with the rest of us, thats all we ask. This meant that it was now Jiang Yu-hans turn to perform. This is what he said -2647 The girls upset Her mans away, she fears he will forget. -2647 The girl looks glum So short of cash she cant afford a crumb. -2647 The girl feels blest Her lampwicks got a lucky crest. -2647 The girls content Shes married to a perfect gent Then he sang this song A mischievous bundle of charm and love, Or an angel come down from the skies above? Sweet sixteen And so very green, Yet eager to see all there is to be seen. Aie aie aie The galaxys high In the roof of the sky, And the drum from the tower Sounds the midnight hour, So trim the lamp, love, and come with me Inside the bed-curtains, and you shall see! He raised the pass cup to his lips, but before drinking it, smiled round at his auditors and made this little speech Im afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited, However, I happened to see a couplet on someones wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind and as one line in it is about something I can see here, I shall use it to finish my turn with. So saying, he drained the cup and then, picking up a spray of cassia, recited the following line The flowers aroma breathes of hotter days. The others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance. Not so Xue Pan, however, who leaped to his feet and began protesting noisily Terrible! Pay the forfeit. Wheres the little doll? I cant see any doll on the table. I didnt say anything about a doll, said Jiang Yu-han. What ate you talking about? Come on, dont try to wriggle out of it! said Xue Pan. Say what you said just now again. The flowers aroma breathes of hotter days. There you are! said Xue Pan. Aroma.
I didnt realize that she had so powerful a protector. Now that I do, I shall never dare to strike her againnot if all the devils in hell are tugging at my elbow! Here, Patience! Miss Patience! Let me apologize to you in front of Mrs Zhu and the young ladies. I did evil in my cups. Please forgive me. The others laughed. There you are! said Li Wan to Patience. I told you Id stick up for you, didnt I? Its all very well for you ladies to joke about it, said Patience, but you make me feel very. uncomfortable. Youve no cause to feel uncomfortable, said Li Wan. Ill look after you. You just get that key and tell your mistress to unlock the store-room and find those things for us. My dear good Wan, please take these girls back to the Garden, said Xi-feng. Ive got the rice accounts to go over Ive got to see Lady Xing about something 1 dont know what, but shes just sent over to say that she wants me and Ive got the New Years clothes to see about. I have to find out what everyone wants and get the orders placed I dont care in the least about these things, said Li Wan airily. You just settle my business first so that I can go back home and rest and not have these girls pestering me any more. Give me a little time! said Xi-feng pleadingly. Youre so considerate towards me as a rule I dont know why Im so Out of favour with you today. I suppose it must be because of Patience. Often in the past youve said to me, Now I know how busy you are, Feng, but your health is important you ought to find means somehow or other of taking a rest. Thats what you would normally say in a situation like this but today you seem more intent on driving me into an early grave! Incidentally, you may not think it matters very much if the arrangements for other peoples winter clothing get put off, but what about the clothing for the girls? Strictly speaking thats your responsibility. Dont you think Grandmother would feel that you were taking non-interference just a little far if she discovered that the girls were going without winter clothes simply for want of a word from you? You know, of course, that I would rather get into trouble myself than involve you in trouble... Listen to her, all of you, said Li Wan. Marvellous, isnt it? Id like to get hold of that clever tongue of yours, Feng, and! Just tell me this one thing, then are you going to keep an eye on our poetry club for us or arent you? What a question! said Xi-feng. If I refused to join your club and spend my money in it, I should be declaring myself in open rebellion against the Prospect Garden Residents Association, and heaven help me then!my life wouldnt be worth living! I shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty, and the first thing I shall do will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the clubs entertainment. I can t write poetryor anything else, for that matterand Im a very common, ignorant sort of person to be joining a poetry club and as for taking on this disciplinary business well, whether I do or whether I dont, I dont suppose therell be much danger of your expelling me once youve seen the colour of my money. The others laughed. Ill open the store-room presently, she continued, and Ill get them to put out anything that looks as if it might be of use for you to have a look at. If you can use it, keep it. Anything youre still short of after that, Ill tell them to buy for you outside. I can get the pongee cut for you straight away. The architects drawing isnt at Lady Wangs, by the way its at Cousin Zhens place. Im telling you this to save you a wasted journey. I can get it for you, if you like then I can have it taken with the pongee to Sir Zhengs gentlemen and ask them to do the sizing for you. Li Wan nodded approvingly. That would be very kind. If youll really do all that for us, we shall have nothing more to say. Come on then, everybody I Lets go home and see what happens. If she doesnt send the stuff we can come back and deal with her later. She began to leave the room as she said this, the cousins following in her wake. I know of only one person who could have stirred all this up, said Xi-feng as they were going, and thats Bao-yu. The mention of his name stopped Li Wan in her tracks. She came back into the room.
Just now as I was on the point of coming over, she said, bringing these reflections to a rapid conclusion, two crates of quails arrived from my aunts. I told the servants to fry them, intending to send them over later for your dinner. Then, on my way in through your gate, I met some of the boys from here with your carriage. They said it had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended. Why not make use of my carriage instead? We can go over together in it now, and you can dine at my place afterwards on the quails. Finding this proposal acceptable, Lady Xing called in her maids to help her change then, supported by her ever-solicitous daughter-in-law, she got into the latters carriage and drove with her to the establishment next door. On their way Xi-feng pointed out that if they arrived at Grandmother Jias place together, the old lady might notice her outdoor clothes and ask her where she had been. It would be better if you went in there alone, while I slip back to my own place to change, she said. Ill join you later, as soon as Ive got into my everyday clothes. Lady Xing thought that this sounded reasonable and went in on her own to see Grandmother Jia. After chatting with her for a few minutes about nothing in particular, she left on the pretext of visiting Lady Wang. This meant that she went out through the rear of the apartment, so that her way took her past Faithfuls room and she was able to look in casually in passing to see if she was there. Faithful was sitting in her room sewing, but stood up as Lady Xing entered. Whats that youre embroidering? Lady Xing asked her. Let me look. She took the embroidery from her hand and inspected it. You are getting very good, she said, laying it down again, and proceeded to scrutinize the girl carefully, from head to foot. Faithful had on an almost new lilac-coloured dress of silk damask over which she wore a dag-edged sleeveless black satin jacket. Her skirt was a pale eau de Nil. Lady Xing observed the slender waist and elegantly sloping shoulders, the oval face, the lustrous, raven-black hair, the slightly aquiline nose, the cheeks slightly spotted with a few tiny moles. Faithful grew embarrassed and apprehensive beneath this scrutiny. What brings Your Ladyship here at this hour? she asked. You dont often come over in the afternoon. Lady Xing made a sign to the maids who had accompanied her to leave the room, then, seating herself in Faithfuls place, she took the maid by the hand and smiled at her graciously. Ive come to wish you joy, my dear. Hearing this, Faithful was able to guess, more or less, what her visitor had come about. She coloured and hung her head in silence while Lady Xing continued. You see, Sir She has no one nowadays he feels he can really rely on. He was thinking of buying someone but you know, you can never trust those girls you get from the dealers. You dont know how clean they are, and often you dont find out what the snags are until it is too late. They seem all right when you buy them, but two or three days later you find them getting up to the most frightful antics. Well, then he thought hed pick someone from among our house-born servants, but he lust couldnt seem to find anyone good enough. Either they werent good-looking enough, or their looks were all right hut their characters wouldnt do, or whatever it was there was always something wrong with them. Anywayto cut a long story shortafter half a years careful study, he has finally decided that you are the cream of the cream. In looks, in character, in behaviour he finds you perfect gentle, reliablein fact, all the things he is looking for in a girl. So hes decided to ask Lady Jia if he can have you for his concubine. Of course , you would get much better treatment than a newly bought girl from outside could expect. In your case we should put your hair back straight away and treat you as a proper chamber-wife. You would be Auntie to the children and Mrs to the maids. In fact, you would have practically the status of a mistress. Now I know you are an ambitious young woman. You know what they say True gold will find its price. In your case its proved by the fact that Sir She has taken this fancy to you. Here is a chance of doing all those things you ever set your heart on doing. And if you have any enemies, you will be in a position now to make them look very silly.
Between them, ace again with four. Apricot trees make the suns red-petalled floor, said Xiang-yun. Together that makes nine ripe cherries. Winged thieves have stripped the Emperors trees of berries, said Xiang-yun, and drank her wine. A pair on the left then, three and three, said Faithful. Swallows in pairs round the old roof-tree, said Bao-chai. A pair of threes upon the right, said Faithful. Green duckweed-trails on the water bright. A three and six between them lie. Three peaks upon the rim of sky, said Bao-chai. Together that gives The lone boat tied with an iron chain, said Faithful. The waves on every hand and the hearts pain, said Bao-chai, and drank what remained in her winecup. Sky on the left, the good fresh air, said Faithful, putting down a double six. Bright air and brilliant morn feed my despair, said Dai-yu. Bao-chai, recognizing the quotation, turned and stared but Dai-yu was too intent on keeping her end up to have noticed. A four and a six, the Painted Screen, said Faithful. No Reddie at the window seen, said Dai-yu, desperately dredging up a line this time from The Western Chamber to meet the emergency. A two and a six, four twos make eight. In twos walk backwards from the Hall of State, said Dai-yu, on safer ground with a line from Du Fu. Together makes A basket for the flowers you pick, said Faithful. A basket of peonies slung from his stick, Dai-yu concluded, and took a sip of her wine. Four and five, the Flowery Nine, said Faithful. The flowering peach-tree drenched with rain, said Ying chun. Forfeit! Forfeit! said the others, laughing. It doesnt rhyme and besides, the words dont fit. Ying-chun laughed and sipped her wine. As a matter of fact her failure was intentional. Eager for more laughs, Xi-feng and Faithful had secretly intimated to the four remaining cousins that they should give the wrong answers on purpose, in order to come the more quickly to Grannie Liu. Accordingly Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Bao-yu, all deliberately fell down on their first calls as well, leaving only Lady Wang to dispose of, which Faithful accomplished by the simple expedient of supplying the answers for her herself. It was now Grannie Lius turn. We often play a game like this ourselves back home when we get together of an evening, said Grannie Liu, only the way we do it, it doesnt sound so pretty as this. Howsomever. I dont mind having a try. Its easy, really, said the others. Dont worry about what it sounds like. Just say what comes naturally. Faithful began to lay. A pair of fours on the left, the Man. Grannie Liu was a good long while puzzling over this. Finally she said. Is it a farmer? The others roared with laughter. Thats all right, said Grandmother Jia reassuringly. That answer will do very well. You young people shouldnt laugh at me, said Grannie Liu to the others. Im a countrywoman born and I cant help my country talk. Green three, red four, contrasting colours, called Faithful. The fire burns up the caterpillars, said Grannie Liu. Why, so it might, said the others. Stick to your country talk, Grannie, youre doing fine! Red four on the right and the ace is red, said Faithful. A turnip and a garlic-head. More laughter. That Flower those three together show, said Faithful. This flower will to a pumpkin grow, said the flower-bedecked ancient, gesturing with her hands to demonstrate the size of the imagined pumpkin. The following chapter will show how the party progressed. CHAPTER 41 Jia Bao-yu tastes some superior tea at Green Bower Hermitage And Grannie Liu samples the sleeping accommodation at Green Delights THIS flower will to a pumpkin grow. As Granule Liu of the flower-studded hair said this, gesturing with her hands to suggest the size of the full-grown pump-kin, a shout of laughter rose from all those present. She drank the pass cup. To be truthful, she said, aiming for another laugh, Im but a clumsy body at the best of times, and having drunk so much, Im scared of breaking this pretty cup youve given me. You should have given me a wooden one then if I dropped it, it wouldnt matter. The others laughed but xi-feng pretended to take her seriously If you really want a wooden cup to drink out of I can find you one.
The old woman needed no second asking. Holding Ban-er tightly by the hand, she scrambled up the stairway and looked inside. The interior was stacked high with folding screens, tables, chairs, lanterns and furniture of every kind. Much of what she saw she could not identify, but the dull gleam of gold, the rich glow of coloured lacquers, and the artistry and sumptuousness of the objects drew many a pious ejaculation from her before she descended. The door of the storeroom was then locked and the remaining maids came down. I wonder how energetic Lady Jia will be feeling today, said Li Wan. Perhaps while you are about it you had better get out the oars and punt-poles and paddles and some boat-awnings as well, in case she decides to go on the water. Yesm, said the maids, and proceeded to unlock the storeroom again and carry down the items specified. Li Wan meanwhile sent one of the pages to tell the boatwomen that they were to pole a couple of punts out from the boathouse and have them by in readiness. While this activity was still in progress, Grandmother Jia arrived at the head of a troupe of females. Li Wan hurried forward to greet her. You are very energetic this morning, Grandmother I didnt expect you in the Garden so soon. I was hoping that you would still be doing your hair. Ive picked some chrysanthemums for you to wear and I was just about to send them round to you. Even as she was saying this, Casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock- green glaze shaped like a lotus4eaf, in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours were being kept in moisture. Grandmother Jia chose a dark red one to fasten in the side of her hair. As she turned her head to do so, she caught sight of Grannie Liu and smiled at her in welcome. Come over here! You must have one too! Before she had finished, Xi-feng had already seized the old woman by the hand and was dragging her over. Come on, let me dress you up properly! She began sticking the chrysanthemums into her hair, putting them in at every angle, and continued until all the flowers in the dish had been used up. The effect was so ludicrous that Grandmother Jia and the rest all burst out laughing. Grannie Liu, not a whit perturbed, good-humouredly joined in the laughter. I dont know what my poor old head can have done to deserve so much honour, she said. You ought to pull them out and throw them in her lace, said the others. Shes made you look like an old vamp! I may be getting on now, said Grannie Liu, but I used to be a stylish young woman in my time. I loved to have a bit of powder for my cheek and a flower to wear in my hair. Tis no matter now I shall be a stylish old un. During this exchange they had been moving towards Drenched Blossoms Pavilion. Maids went on ahead with a rolled-up patterned rug which they spread out on one of the bench-boards that ran along the inner sides of the balustrades. Seating herself on the rug with her back against the railings, Grandmother Jia invited Grannie Liu to sit down beside her and tell her what she thought of the Garden. Holy Name! said Grannie Liu. You know, we country folk like to get a picture at the New Year that we can stick up on the wall. Every year just before New Year the farmers come into town to buy one. Manys the time of an evening when the days work was done weve sat and looked at the picture on our wall and wished we could get inside it and walk around, never imagining that such beautiful places could really be. Yet now I look at this Garden here, and its ten times better than any picture I ever saw. If only I could get someone to make a painting of it all, just the way it is, that I could take back to show the others, I do believe I should die content! Grandmother Jia smilingly pointed a linger in Xi-chun direction. You see my little great-niece over there? She can paint. Shall we get her to do you a painting of it? Grannie Liu jumped up and going over to xi-chun, took her impulsively by the hand. Dear Miss! she said. To think that one so young and pretty should be so gifted and all! I do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape! The simple earnestness with which this was uttered made the others all laugh. After resting a little longer, Grand mother Jia, who intended to show her guest as much of the Garden as possible, got up again and resumed the tour.
Actually, although you wont know this yet, said Dai-yu, that smoke-thread climbs line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet. If I show it to you, I think you will agree that it is even more austerely effective than Wang Weis line. She took down a copy of Tao Yuan-mings Works, hunted out the couplet she had in mind, and handed it to her to look at -1014 Half-lost in haze the distant haunts of men, Whose dawdling smoke the unseen hamlet marks. Caltrop read it and nodded approvingly Yes, I see. He got the idea for climbs from the dawdling of this earlier line. Bao-yu laughed delightedly. Perfect! You must end your discussion there. If you go on any longer, youll begin unlearning what youve already discovered. You can start writing poetry yourself now, straight away. Its sure to be good. I can see I shall soon be writing an invitation asking you to join our poetry club, said Tan-chun smilingly. Dont make fun of me, Miss Tan, said Caltrop. Writing poetry is something Ive always wanted to do, and now Ive got the chance, Im learning for the fun of it. I dont expect I shall ever be any good. Good heavens! we only write for the fun of it ourselves, said Tan-chun. You surely dont imagine that what we write is good poetry? If we set ourselves up to be real poets, people outside this Garden who got to hear of it would laugh so loud that their teeth would drop out! Thats what Mencius calls throwing yourself away, said Bao-yu. You shouldnt do that. The other day, when I was discussing Xi-chuns painting with some of Fathers gentlemen, they told me they had heard about our poetry club and asked if they could see some of our poems, so I wrote a few out for them from memory. I assure you, they were genuinely impressed. In fact, they have calligraphed them for blocks to have them printed. Is this really true? Tan-chun and Dai-yu asked incredulously. If anyones telling lies, it must be the parrot said Bao-yu. The two girls were aghast. You really are the limit! Quite apart from the fact that the poems arent good enough, you have no business to go showing our stuff to people outside. Whats the harm? said Bao-yu. If those famous poems written by poetesses in days gone by had never been -taken outside -the womens quarters, we shouldnt know about them today. Just then Xi-chuns maid Picture arrived and called Bao-yu away to her mistress. Caltrop pressed Dai-yu to lend her the volume of Du Fu she also begged Dai-yu and Tan-chun to set her a subject for a poem. Let me try my hand at writing one myself, she said, -and you can correct it for me. Last night there was a very fine moon, said Dai-yu. Ive been thinking of writing a poem about it myself, but havent yet got round to it. Why dont you write a poem about the moon? You can use sky and light as your rhymes but I wont set the other rhyme words for you, you can use whichever ones you like. Clutching the volume of poems, Caltrop returned in great glee and at once began thinking about her composition. After working out the first line or two, she could not resist peeping at the Du Fu and reading a couple of poems. And in this way she continued, alternately reading and composing by fits and starts, too excited to think about eating or drinking or to sit still in the same place for two or three minutes together. Why give yourself so much trouble when you dont have to? Bao-chai asked her. Its all that Frowners fault. I shall have to go and have it out with her. You are inclined to be a dreamer at the best of times, but now you are becoming a real case I Please, Miss Bao I said Caltrop. You are putting me off. She was writing while she said this. Soon she had completed the draft of a poem and handed it to Bao-chai to look at. Bao-chai read it and laughed. No, this is no good. This isnt the way to write poetry. Still, dont be disheartened. I should take it to her just the same and see what she says. Caltrop followed her advice and went off to look for Dai-yu. Dai-yu took the poem and looked at it. This is what Caltrop had written -1014 A chilly radiance bright, a fair round shape, The cold white moon hangs in the middle sky.
said Jia Zheng. What has become of the people who are supposed to look after you? Why do they allow you to gallop around in this extraordinary fashion? His voice rose to a shout Where are the people responsible for taking this boy to school? Jia Huan saw in his fathers anger an opportunity of exercising his malice. I didnt mean to run, Father, but just as I was going by the well back there I saw the body of a maid who had drowned herselfall swollen up with water, and her head all swollen. It was horrible. I just couldnt help myself. Jia Zheng heard him with incredulous horror. What are you saying? Who has drowned herself? Such a thing has never before happened in our family. Our family has always been lenient and considerate in its treatment of inferiors. It is one of our traditions. I suppose it is because I have been too neglectful of household matters during these last few years. Those in charge have felt encouraged to abuse their authority, until finally an appalling thing like this can happen an innocent young life cut off by violence. What a terrible disgrace to our ancestors if this should get about! He turned and shouted a command. Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da! Sir! chorused the pages, and were on the point of doing so when Jia Huan impulsively stepped forward, threw himself on his knees and clung to his fathers skirts. Dont be angry with me, Father, but apart from the servants in Lady Wangs room, no one else knows anything about this. I heard my mother say He broke off and glanced around behind him. Jia Zheng understood and signaled with his eyes to the pages, who obediently withdrew some distance back to either side of the courtyard. Jia Huan continued in a voice lowered almost to a whisper. My mother told me that the day before yesterday, in Lady Wangs room, my brother Bao-yu tried to rape one of Her Ladyships maids called Golden, and when she wouldnt let him, he gave her a beating and Golden was so upset that she threw herself in the well and was drowned, Jia Zheng, whose face had now turned to a ghastly gold-leaf colour, interrupted him with a dreadful cry. Fetch Bao-yu ! He began to stride -towards -his study, shouting to all and sundry as he went. If anyone tries to stop me this time, I shall make over my house and property and my post at the Ministry and everything else I have to him and Bao-yu. I absolutely refuse to be responsible for the boy any longer. I shall cut off my few remaining hairs those that worry and wretchedness have left me and look for some clean and decent spot to end my days in. Perhaps in that way I shall escape the charge of having disgraced my ancestors by rearing this unnatural monster as my son. When they saw the state he was in, the literary gentlemen and senior menservants who were waiting for him in the study, guessed that Bao-yu must be the cause of it and, looking at each other with various grimaces, biting their thumbs or sticking their tongues out, hastily retreated from the room. Jia-Zheng entered it alone and sat down, stiffly upright, in a chair. He was breathing heavily and his face was bathed in tears. Presently, when he had regained his breath, he barked out a rapid series of commands Bring Bao-yu here. Get a heavy bamboo. Get some rope to tie him with. Close the courtyard gates. If anyone tries to take word through inside, kill him! Sir! Sir!Sir! the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands, and some of them went off to look for Bao-yu. Jia Zhengs ominous Stay where you are as he went out with the chamberlain had warned Bao-yu that something dire was imminentthough just how much more dire as a result of Jia Huans malicious intervention he could not have foreseen and as he stood where his father had left him, he twisted and turned himself about, anxiously looking for some passer-by who could take a message through to the womenfolk inside. But no one came. Even the omnipresent Tealeaf was on this occasion nowhere to be seen. Then suddenly, in answer to his prayers, an old woman appeareda darling, precious treasure of an old woman or so she seemed at that momentand he dashed forward and clung to her beseechingly. Quickly! he said. Go and tell them that Sir Zheng is going to beat me. Quickly! Quickly! Go-and tell. GO AND TELL. Partly because agitation had made him incoherent and partly because, as ill luck would have it, the old woman was deaf, almost everything he said had escaped her except for the Go and tell, which she misheard as in the well.
You may be right, said Xi-feng without much conviction. Its just occurred to me as we havent named the child yet, I wonder if youd like to name her for us? For one thing, being named by someone so old will help her to live longer and for anotherI hope you won t mind my saying this, but you country people do have quite a lot of poverty and hardship to contend withbeing named by a poor person like yourself may help to balance her luck. Granule Liu thought for a bit. When was she born? Ah, thats just the trouble, said Xi-feng. She was born on Qiao-jiethe Seventh of the Seventha very unlucky date. No matter, said Granule Lin. Call her Qiao-jie then. Thats what the doctors mean when they talk about fighting poison with poison and fire with fire. You call her Qiao-jie like I say, and I guarantee that shell live to a ripe old age. I prophesy for this child that when shes a big girl and the others are all going off to get married, she may for a time find that things are not going her way but thanks to this name, all her misfortunes will turn into blessings, and what at first looked like bad luck will turn out to be good luck in the end. Xi-feng was of course delighted with these auspicious words and thanked her warmly. May it turn out for her as you say! She summoned Patience. Were going to be busy tomorrow and may not have the time then. As youve got nothing to do at the moment, why dont you get the things for Grannie together, so that everything will be ready for her to start first thing tomorrow ? Please dont go giving me a lot of things, said Grannie Liu. Ive already put you to so much inconvenience these last few days, I should feel even more uncomfortable carrying a lot of things back with me. These are only very ordinary things, said Xi-feng. Nothing special. Just a few things for you to take back with you and show off to the neighbours. Just so as to be able to say that youve been to town. Come over here, Granule, and have a look, said Patience. Granule Lu followed her into the next room. A full half of the kang was occupied by her piled-up presents. Patience picked them up one by one and explained them to her. This sky- blue material is the gauze you said you wanted. The pale- blue gauze in a closer weave is a present from the Mistress to line it with. These are two lengths of wild-silk pongee. You can use it to make either a dress or a skirt with it would do equally well for either. In this wrapping here there are two lengths of silk for making up into a New Year outfit. This is a box of various kinds of cakes and pastries made in the Imperial kitchens. There are some kinds that youve already eaten and some that you havent. You want to put them out on plates when youre having someone to tea youll find theyre a bit better than the ones you can buy in the shops. These two sacks are the ones you brought the vegetables in when you came. This one has got two bushels of pink Emperor rice in it. It makes a really delicious congee. This one has got fruit and nuts and other things from the Garden in it. And this packet here has got eight taels of silver in it. Everything up to here is from the Mistress. Now these two packets here have each got fifty taels of silver in them - a hundred taels in all. Theyre a present from Her Ladyship, for starting a little business or buying some land with when you get back, so that you can be self-sufficient in future and not have to keep falling back on your friends. The two jacketshere Patience smiled somewhat embarrassedlythe two jackets and the two skirts and the four head-scarves and the packet of embroidery silks are a present from me. The clothes have only been worn a very little but they arent new so if you decide to throw them back at me, I shant complain. Grannie Liu had been exclaiming rapturously as each item was shown to her and must have uttered several dozen Holy Names by the time Patience came to her own gift. Throw them back at you, Miss? she said warmly, touched by the maids kindness and humility. How can you say such a thing? Fine clothes like these? I shouldnt know where to buy them if I had the money! You make me feel ashamed. I dont like to take them off you yet if I dont, you will think me ungrateful. Get away with you! said Patience.
What are you planning to give me for my birthday next month? Something new and out of the ordinary, I hope. I havent really got anything much to give you, said Bao-yu. Things like money and food and clothing I dont want for, but theyre not really mine to give. The only way I could give you something that would really be mine would be by doing some calligraphy or painting a picture for you. Talking of pictures, said Xue Pan genially, thats reminded me. I saw a set of dirty pictures in someones house the other day. They were real beauties. There was a lot of writing on top that I didnt pay much attention to, but I did notice the signature. I think it was Geng Huang, the man who painted them. They were really good! Bao-yu was puzzled. His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both past and present was not in-considerable, but he had never in all his experience come across a Geng Huang. After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began to chuckle and called for a writing-brush. A writing-brush having been produced by one of the servants, he wrote two characters with it in the palm of his hand. Are you quite sure the signature you saw was Geng Huang? he asked Xue Pan. What do you mean? said Xue Pan. Of course Im sure. Bao-yu opened his hand and held it up for Xue Pan to see You sure it wasnt these two characters? They are quite similar. The others crowded round to look. They all laughed when they saw what he had written Yes, it must have been Tang Yin. Mr Xue couldnt have been seeing straight that day. Ha! Ha! Ha! Xue Pan realized that he had made a fool of himself, but passed it off with an embarrassed laugh Oh, Tankin or wankin, he said, what difference does it make, anyway? Just then Mr Feng was announced by one of the servants, which Bao-yu knew could only mean General Feng Tangs son, Feng Zi-ying. Xue Pan and the rest told the boy to bring him in immediately, but Feng Zi-ying was already striding in, talking and laughing as he went. The others hurriedly rose and invited him to take a seat. Ha! said Feng Zi-ying. No need to go out then. Enjoyin yourselves at home, eh? Very nice too! Its a long time since weve seen you around, said Bao-yu. Hows the General? Fahvers in good health, thank you very much, said Feng Zi-ying, but Muvver hasnt been too well lately. Caught a chill or somethin. Observing with glee that Feng Zi-ying was sporting a black eye, Xue Pan asked him how he had come by it Been having a dust-up, then? Who was it this time? Looks as if he left his signature! Feng Zi-ying laughed Dont use the mitts any more nowadaysnot since that time I laid into Colonel Chous son and did him an injury. That was a lesson to me. Ive learned to keep my temper since then. No, this happened the other day durin a huntin expedition in the Iron Net Mountains. I got fficked by a goshawks wing. When was this? Bao-yu asked him. We left on the twenty-eighth of last month, said Feng Zi-ying. Didnt get back till a few days ago. Ah, that explains why I didnt see you at Shens party earlier this month, said Bao-yu. I meant at the time to ask why you werent there, but I forgot. Did you go alone on this expedition or was the General there with you? Fahver most certainly was there, said Feng Zi-ying. I was practically dragged along in tow. Do you think Im mad enough to go rushin off in pursuit of hideous hardships when I could be sittin comfortably at home eatin good food and drinkin good wine and listenin to the odd song or two? Still, some good came of it. It was a lucky accident. As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-ying rose to his feet again and declined. I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you, he said, but theres somethin very important Ive got to see Fahver about now, so Im afraid I really must refuse. But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table. Now look here, this is too bad! Feng Zi-ying good-humouredly protested.
Yellow wouldnt be a sufficient contrast. Black would be too heavy. Ill tell you what. If you were to take a gold thread and a very fine black bugle-thread and twist them together that would look nice. Bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion, and shouted several times for Aroma to fetch the gold thread. She came in while he was still shouting for her, carrying two plates of food and looking puzzled. I cant understand it, -she said. Someones just brought me these from Her Ladyship. Oh, I expect they had more than they wanted there, so shes sent you this to share with the others, said Bao-yu. No, said Aroma. They said it was for me personally but Im not to go over and kotow for it. I dont know what to make of it. Bao-chai laughed. If its for you to eat, I should go ahead and eat it! Never mind the whys and wherefores! But it never happened before, said Aroma. I feel so embarrassed. Bao-chais lips puckered up mockingly. Embarrassed? Before very long youre going to have much more than this to feel embarrassed about! Aroma sensed something behind this remark. She knew Bao-chai too well to suppose that any such remark of hers would be made triflingly. Remembering what Lady Wang had seemed to hint at in her interview of the previous day, she dropped the subject. Ill have these now then, she said, holding the dishes out for Bao-yu to inspect, and as soon as Ive washed, I shall bring you your gold thread. With that she hurried out again. When she returned later, after having lunched and washed her hands, bringing the gold thread for Orioles knotting, Bao-chai was no longer there, since she had been called away by Xue Pans messenger. Bao-yu once more lay back and watched Oriole knotting but soon they were interrupted once more, this time by a couple of maids from Lady Xings. They brought two sorts of fruit and a message for him from their mistress. Her Ladyship says are you able to walk? She says if you are, shed like -you to come over some time and amuse yourself. She says tell him Im thinking of him. Tell her, Bao-yu replied politely, that as soon as I can walk, I shall certainly be round to pay my respects. Tell her that the pain is a little better than it was and that she is not to worry. Asking the two girls to be seated, he called Ripple to him and asked her to take half of the fruit they had brought and offer it to Dai-yu but just as she was about to go, Dai 1 u could be heard talking in the courtyard. He told Ripple to hurry outside and invite her in. For further details, please -consult the following chapter. CHAPTER 36 Bao-chai visits Green Delights and hears strange words from a sleeper Bao-yu visits Pear-tree Court and learns hard facts from a performer WHEN Grandmother Jia got back to her own apartment after lunching with Lady Wang, she was naturally very pleased to have seen Bao-yu making such rapid progress but her pleasure soon gave way to worry when she began wondering what would happen when he was well enough for Jia Zheng to start asking for him again. To guard against that contingency she had Jia Zhengs Head Boy brought before her to receive instructions direct from her own mouth. In future, she told him, whenever the Master is entertaining guests or seeing anybody and asks for Bao-yu, you are to say, straight away, without needing to see me about it, first of all that Master Bao was very seriously injured by his beating and will need several months complete rest before he can walk properly and secondly that he has just made an offering to his star-guardian because of an unlucky conjunction in his horoscope and isnt allowed to see outsiders or go outside the inner gate until the beginning of the eighth month. She called Nannie Li and Aroma to her as soon as the Head Boy had gone and instructed them to tell Bao-yu this, so that no worries should retard the progress of his recovery. Bao-yu had always hated meeting or making conversation with senior males of the scholar-official class and detested all occasions which involved dressing up, such as visits of congratulation and condolence and the various other formal exchanges to which members of that class devote so great a part of their time. His grandmothers dispensation was therefore particularly gratifying to him, and he used it as an excuse for cutting himself off from all contact with visiting relations and friends. He even pleased himself about whether or not he made the customary morning and evening duty-calls on the senior members of the household.
I told him not to go, but he insisted. When he got up first thing this morning, he asked for a suit of mourning to wear. It looks as if some important person in the Prince of Beijings household must have died. If thats really so, said Li Wan, then he ought to have gone. But then, on the other hand, he ought to have got back by now. After a brief discussion the cousins decided to proceed without him and to punish him in some way when he returned. Before they could begin, however, a summons arrived from Grandmother Jia to join her in the mansion. As soon as they had done so, Aroma reported Bao-yus absence. The old lady was displeased and sent someone to fetch him back. Bao-yu, evidently with some secret business on his mind, had spoken the day before to Tealeaf about this excursion, I have to go out first thing tomorrow, he told him. I want you to be waiting for me outside the back gate with two horses ready saddled. No one else is to accompany me but you. Tell Li Gui that I am going to the Prince of Beijings, and that he must stop anyone going out to look for me. He can tell them that the Prince is detaining me and that I shall come back as soon as I can get away. Though somewhat mystified by these orders, Tealeaf felt he had no choice but to follow them out, and before dawn next morning was waiting with two horses ready saddled outside the tear gate of the Garden. As soon as it was light, Bao-yu, dressed in heavy mourning, emerged from the postern, leaped onto one of the waiting horses, and crouching down over the reins, set off at a brisk trot down the streetall without uttering a single word. Tealeaf leaped onto the second horse, gave it the whip, and did his best to catch up with Bao-yu, at the same time shouting after him to inquire where they were going. Where does this road lead to? Bao-yu asked him. This is the main road to the North Gate, said Tealeaf. Outside the city its pretty deserted in that direction. You wont find much to amuse you there. Good, said Bao-yu. The more deserted the better. And by applying the whip he made his horse shoot on ahead, and presently, after a couple of turns, had left the city gate behind him. Tealeaf, more mystified than ever, followed him as closely as he could. When they had galloped without stopping for two or three miles, in the course of which the signs of human habitation had gradually grown more and more sparse, Bao-yu finally reined to a halt and turned back to ask Tealeaf if there was anywhere where they could purchase some incense. I dare say we could find somewhere, said Tealeaf without much conviction. It depends what kind of incense you want. Bao-yu reflected for some moments. Honeybush, sandal and lakawood, he said. It has to be those three. I doubt if youll be able to get them, said Tealeaf, smiling at the navet of one who could expect to make such purchases in such a place. But when he saw that Bao-yu was genuinely distressed, he added Whats it for? Ive noticed that you often carry powdered incense in that sachet you wear. Why not see if youve got any in that? Bao-yu, glad to be reminded, extracted the silk purse that he wore suspended from his neck underneath the front fold of his gown, felt inside it with his fingers, and was delighted to find that there was still a pinch or two of powdered agalloch in the bottom. Seems a bit lacking in respect to use this though, he thought. Still, its more respectful to use something Ive carried all the way here myself than it would be to use something Id just bought in a shop. Having decided that the powdered incense would do, he asked Tealeaf where he could get hold of an incense-burner and some fire. Now those we cant get, said Tealeaf. Where could we, Out here in the middle of the wilds? If you knew you were going to need them, why didnt you tell me beforehand, and we could have brought them with us? Stupid idiot I said Bao-yu. Do you honestly think we could have ridden out at this break-neck pace if wed been carrying an incense-burner full of hot coals with us? Tealeaf, after some moments of reflection, smiled uncertainly I know what we could do, Master, though I dont know what youll think of the idea. Theres little enough hope of our getting the things youve just asked for round here, and the chances are that even if we could, youd only start thinking of something else you needed that was even harder to get.
You dont know the reason, Mother. Bao-chai didnt know a half of what Cousin Xue got up to, even when she was living with her mother outside and now that shes moved into the Garden, she knows even less. When she said she didnt know, she really didnt know she wasnt giving me the lie. What you dont realize is that Cousin Lin was all the time sitting behind her making signs to show that she didnt believe me. Just then a maid came from Grandmother Jias apartment to fetch Bao-yu and Dai-yu to lunch. Without saying a word to Bao-yu, Dai-yu got up and, taking the maids hand, began to go. But the maid was reluctant. Lets wait for Master Bao and we can go together. Hes not eating lunch today, said Dai-yu. Come on, lets go! Whether hes eating lunch or not, said the maid, hed better come with us, so that he can explain to Her Old Ladyship about it when she asks. All right, you wait for him then, said Dai-yu. Im going on ahead. And off she went. I think Id rather eat with you today, Mother, said Bao-yu. No, no, you cant, said Lady Wang. Today is one of my fast-days I shall only be eating vegetables. You go and have a proper meal with your Grandma. I shall share your vegetables, said Bao-yu. Go on, you can go, he said, dismissing the maid and rushing up to the table, he sat himself down at it in readiness. You others had better get on with your own lunch, Lady Wang said to Bao-chai and the girls. Let him do as he likes. You really ought to go, Bao-chai said to Bao-yu. Whether you have lunch there or not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why dont you? Oh, leave her alone! said Bao-yu. Shell be all right presently. Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused. Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao? they asked him. Even your eating and drinking all seems to be done in a rush. You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu, said Bao-chai blandly. Dont make him waste time here with us. Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard where his Grandmother Jias apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of Xi-fengs courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was standing in her doorway with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her direction. Ah, just the person I wanted to see! she said, as soon as she caught sight of Bao-yu. Come inside. I want you to write something down for me. Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone and a brush, and at once began dictating Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths, miscellaneous Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, Here, what is this? said Bao-yu. It isnt an invoice and it isnt a presentation list. How am I supposed to write it? Never you mind about that, said Xi-feng. As long as I know what it is, thats all that matters. just put it down anyhow. Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the paper and folded it away. Now, she said, smiling pleasantly, theres something I want to talk to you about. I dont know whether youll agree to this or not, but theres a girl in your room called Crimson whom Id like to work for me. If I find you someone to replace her with, will you let me have her? There are so many girls in my room, said Bao-yu. Please take any you have a fancy to. You really dont need to ask me about it. In that case, said Xi-feng, Ill send for her straight away. Please do, said Bao-yu, and started to go. Hey, come back! said Xi-feng. I havent finished with you yet.
Come again when you can. She ordered an old servant-woman to fetch two pages from the inner gate to help Grannie Liu out with her things. The old servant undertook to do this and also went with Grannie Liu to collect the things from Xi-fengs apartment. When they had got them all together, she fetched the boys from the outside corner gate who carried them out to the street for her and loaded them into a waiting cab. Granule Liu and Ban-er then got in themselves and Set off without more ado on their journey back home. At this point they pass also out of our narrative, which turns now to other matters. -134 After they had eaten their lunch, Bao-chai and the test of the young people called once more on Grandmother Jia, to see how she was progressing. On their way back, as they reached that point in the Garden where their paths separated, Bao-chai called Dai-yu over to her. Frowner, come with me. Theres something I want to talk to you about. Dai-yu followed her to Allspice Court. When they were inside her room, Bao-chai sat down. Well? she said to Dai-yu. Arent you going to kneel down? I am about to interrogate you. Dai-yu was mystified. Poor Bao-chai! she said, laughing. The girls gone off her head. Interrogate me about what ? My dear, well-bred young lady! said Bao-chai. My dear, sheltered young innocent! What were those things I heard you saying yesterday? Come now, the truth! Dai-yu, still mystified, continued to laugh. She was beginning to feel somewhat uneasy, though she would not admit it. What awful thing am I supposed to have said? I expect youre making it up, but you may as well tell me. Still acting the innocent? said Bao-chai. What were those things you said yesterday when we were laying that drinking game? I couldnt think where you could have got them from. Dai-yu cast her mind back and remembered, blushing, that the day before, when stumped for an answer, she had got through her turn by citing passages from The Return of the Soul and The Western Chamber. She hugged Bao-chai imploringly. Dear coz! I really dont know. I just said them without thinking. If you tell me not to, I promise not to say them again. I really dont know either, said Bao-chai. I just thought they sounded rather interesting. I thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were. Dear coz! Please dont tell anyone about this. I promise not to repeat such things again. Moved by the scarlet, shame-filled face and pitifully entreating voice, Bao-chai relented and did not pursue her questioning. Having first drawn her down into a seat and handed her some tea, she began, very gently, to address her in the following manner What do you take me for? Im just as bad. At seven or eight I used to be a real little terror. Ours was reckoned to be rather a literary family. My grandfather was a bibliophile, so the house we lived in was full of books. We were a big family in those days. All my boy cousins and girl cousins on my fathers side lived with us in the same house. All of us younger people hated serious books but liked reading poetry and plays. The boys had got lots and lots of plays The Western Chamber, The Lute-player, A Hundred Yuan Plays just about everything you could think of. They used to read them behind our backs, and we girls used to read them behind theirs. Eventually the grown-ups got to know about it and then there were beatings and lectures and burning of booksand that was the end of that. So, you see, in the case of us girls it would probably be better for us if we never learned to read in the first place. Even boys, if they gain no understanding from their reading, would do better not to read at all and if that is true of boys, it certainly holds good for girls like you and me. The little poetry-writing and calligraphy we indulge in is not really our proper business. Come to that, it isnt a boys proper business either. A boys proper business is to read books in order to gain an understanding of things, so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing the country. Not that one hears of that happening much nowadays. Nowadays their reading seems to make them even worse than they were to start with. And unfortunately it isnt merely a case of their being led astray by what they read. The books, too, are spoiled, by the false interpretations they put upon them.
I thought it was another girl, but all the time it was that cruel, hate Hateful she had been going to say, but clapped her mouth shut before uttering it. She sighed instead and began to walk away. By the time Bao-yus weeping was over, Dai-yu was no longer there. He realized that she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes. Then he descended from the rockery and began to retrace his steps in the direction of Green Delights. Quite by coincidence Dai-yu was walking along the same path a little way ahead. Stop a minute! he cried, hurrying forward to catch up with her. I know you are not taking any notice of me, but I only want to ask you one simple question, and then you need never have anything more to do with me. Dai-yu had turned back to see who it was. When she saw that it was Bao-yu still, she was going to ignore him again but hearing him say that he only wanted to ask her one question, she told him that he might do so. Bao-yu could not resist teasing her a little. How about two questions? Would you wait for two? Dai-yu set her face forwards and began walking on again. Bao-yu sighed. If it has to be like this now, he said, as if to himself its a pity it was ever like it was in the beginning. Dai-yus curiosity got the better of her. She stopped walking and turned once more towards him. Like what in the beginning? she asked. And like what now? Oh, the beginning! said Bao-yu. In the beginning, when you first came here, I was your faithful companion in all your games. Anything I had, even the thing most dear to me, was yours for the asking. If there was something to eat that I specially liked, I had only to hear that you were fond of it too and I would religiously hoard it away to share with you when you got back, not daring even to touch it until you came. We ate at the same table. We slept in the same bed. I used to think that because we were so close then, there would be something special about our relationship when we grew upthat even if we werent particularly affectionate, we should at least have more understanding and forbearance for each other than the rest. But how wrong I was! Now that you have grown up, you seem only to have grown more touchy. You dont seem to care about me any more at all. You spend all your time brooding about outsiders like Peng and Chai. I havent got any real brothers and sisters left here now. There are Huan and Tan, of course but as you know, theyre only my half-brother and half-sister they arent my mothers children. Im on my own, like you. I should have thought we had so much in common -But whats the use? I try and try, but it gets me nowhere and nobody knows or cares. At this pointin spite of himselfhe burst into tears. The palpable evidence of her own eyes and ears had by now wrought a considerable softening on Dai-yus heart. A sympathetic tear stole down her own cheek, and she hung her head and said nothing. Bao-yu could see that he had moved her. I know Im not much use nowadays, he continued, but however bad you may think me, I would never wittingly do anything in your presence to offend you. If I do ever slip up in some way, you ought to tell me off about it and warn me not to do it again, or shout at mehit me, even, if you feel like it I shouldnt mind. But you dont do that. You just ignore me. You leave me utterly at a loss to know what Im supposed to have done wrong, so that Im driven half frantic wondering what I ought to do to make up for it. If I were to die now, I should die with a grievance, and all the masses and exorcisms in the world wouldnt lay my ghost. Only when you explained what your reason was for ignoring me should I cease from haunting you and be reborn into another life. Dai-yus resentment for the gate incident had by now completely evaporated. She merely said Oh well, in that case why did you tell your maids not to let me in when I came to call on you? I honestly dont know what you are referring to, said Bao-yu in surprise. Strike me dead if I ever did any such thing! Hush! said Dai-yu. Talking about death at this time of the morning! You should be more careful what you say.
Filthy pig! said Xiang-lian. Now eat that up and I let you off Xue Pan began kotowing to him. Please, for your souls sake, earn a bit of merit dont try to make me do that! I couldnt do that if you -killed me. This stench is poisoning me said Xiang-lian and leaving Xue Pan, he unfastened his horse, led it off a few paces, vaulted into the saddle, and galloped away. Observing with relief that Xiang-lian had really gone, Xue Pan, cursing his folly for having been so egregiously mistaken in his man, attempted to struggle to his feet but every part of him was hurting so much that it was impossible for him to rise. -347 Meanwhile, back at the party, Cousin Zhen and the others, suddenly noticing that the two of them were missing, sought them for a while without success. Someone did say that they thought they might have gone out of the North Gate but Xue Pan had told his pages not to follow him, and they were all in such dread of their master that none of them dared go out there to look. In the end Cousin Zhen became so uneasy that he sent Jia Rong with some of the boys to track them down. Their trail led them through the North Gate and about two thirds of a mile along the road which crosses the bridge outside it. There, suddenly, they caught sight of Xue Pans horse, tied up to one of the trees at the side of a reed-filled dyke. Good! they said. Where the horse is, the rider must be. And all of them went over to where the horse was standing. As they did so, they heard someone groaning among the rushes and there, when they went to look, was Xue Pan, his clothes torn, his face cut and swollen almost beyond recognition, and so besmirched with mud from head to foot that he had more the appearance of an old wallowing sow than of a human being. Jia Rong had little difficulty in guessing what had happened. Slipping from his horse, he ordered the servants to help Xue Pan to his feet. Tireless in the pursuit of love, Uncle I he said cheerfully, while they struggled to do his bidding. This time its led you into the reeds of the marshes. I suppose the Dragon King must have taken a fancy to you and carried you off to be his son-in-law. To judge from appearances, I should say that you -must have got caught up on his horn! Xue Pan wished that the earth would open and swallow up his shame. As there was clearly no question of getting him onto his horse, Jia Rong told one of the boys to hurry back to the street outside the North Gate and hire a carrying chair. When Xue Pan had been helped into this, they had him carried into the city, themselves accompanying him on horseback. Jia Rong mischievously proposed that they should take him back to the Lais house to rejoin the party but Xue Pan entreated so piteously and begged him so earnestly not to tell anyone of his plight, that Jia Rong relented and allowed him to go back home alone. Jia Rong himself returned to the party to report back to his father. From his account of the state Xue Pan had been in when they found him Cousin Zhen deduced that he must have been beaten up by Liu Xiang-lian but appeared remarkably unconcerned, for he merely laughed and observed that he could do with the lesson. It is true that he went to inquire after him in the evening, when he got back home from the party but Xue Pan was by that time nursing his injuries in bed and declined to see him on the grounds that he was feeling too ill. When Grandmother Jia and her party had got back to their several apartments, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai found Caltrop with her eyes all swollen from weeping. On discovering the cause, they rushed in to look at Xue Pan. Fortunately he appeared to have no bones broken, but his face and body had taken a terrible battering. Torn between maternal anguish at his plight and anger at the folly which had occasioned it, Aunt Xue inveighed against Xue Pan and Xiang-lian by turns. She wanted to tell Lady Wang and get her to have Xiang-lian arrested, but was dissuaded from doing so by Bao-chai. Its not important enough for that, Mamma. The two of them had been drinking and fell out over their cups, thats all there was to it. Whenever that happens, its always the drunker of the two who gets the worst of it. Besides, everyone knows what a lawless, ungovernable creature Pan is. Its only because youre his mother that you feel differently.
If you go, it will spoil all the fun. She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back. At the doorway they ran into Jia Zhengs two concubines, Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou, come to see Bao-yu. Li Wan, Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk, but Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them, Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid arrived from Lady Wangs to say that Wang Zi-tengs wife had come and the presence of the young ladies was requested. Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go. Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave. I cant go out, said Bao-yu. For heavens sake dont let Aunt Wang come over here! - Cousin Lint he called to Dai-yu. Stay here a bit! Theres something I want to say to you. Hearing him, Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu Do you hear that? Someone wants a word with you. Youd better go back and see what he wants to say! She gave her a push in the direction of the house then she and Li Wan went off, both laughing. When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away. Aiyo! he said. My head! Good! said Dai-yu. It serves you right! Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, lumped two or three feet into the air, and began to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-tengs lady was with them and hurried over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling. Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried Out to him piteously between their sobs my son I, my child!, my darling! Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pannot to mention Zhou Ruis wife and a great bevy of domestics both high and lowcame hurrying into the garden, adding numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators. While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared, brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path. She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou Ruis wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room. Patience and Felicity wept piteously to see their mistress in such a state. On this occasion even Jia Zhengs customary impassivity seemed to have deserted him, as he turned this way and that, uncertain on whom to direct his attention. And if Jia Zheng was distraught, the state of the others can be imagined. Most remarkable, perhaps, was the. spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact, was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu whom he had never seen before and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty. Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff yet in spite of prayers, incantations, divination, and all the expedients that faith and physic could provide, there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients.
Hes beginning to fill out, he said, addressing Grandmother Jia. He looks well enough on the outside, said Grandmother Jia, but underneath hes delicate. And his Pa doesnt improve matters by forcing him to study all the time. Im afraid hell end up by making the child ill. Lately Ive been seeing calligraphy and poems of his in all kinds of places, said Abbot Zhang, all quite remarkably good. I really cant understand why Sir Zheng is concerned that the boy doesnt study enough. If you ask me, I think hes all right as he is. He sighed. Of course, you know who this young man reminds me of, dont you? Whether its his looks or the way he talks or the way he moves, to me hes the spit and image of Old Sir Jia. The old mans eyes grew moist, and Grandmother Jia herself showed a disposition to be tearful. Its quite true, she said. None of our children or our childrens children turned Out like him, except my Bao. Only my little Jade Boy is like his grandfather. Of course, your generation wouldnt remember Old Sir Jia, Abbot Zhang said, turning to Cousin Zhen. its before your time. In fact, I dont suppose even Sir She and Sir Zheng can have a very clear recollection of what their father was like in his prime. He brightened as another topic occurred to him and once more quaked with laughter. I saw a most attractive young lady when I was out visiting the other day. Fourteen this year. Seeing her put me in mind of our young friend here. It must be about time we started thinking about a match for him, surely? In looks, intelligence, breeding, background this girl was ideally suited. What does Your Old Ladyship feel? I didnt want to rush matters. I thought Id better first wait and see what Your Old Ladyship thought before saying anything to the family. A monk who once told the boys fortune said that he was not to marry young, said Grandmother Jia so I think we had better wait until he is a little older before we arrange anything definite. But do by all means go on inquiring for us. It doesnt matter whether the family is wealthy or not as long as the girl looks all right, you can let me know. Even if its a poor family, we can always help Out over the expenses. Money is no problem. Its looks and character that count. Now come on, Papa Zhang! said Xi-feng when this exchange had ended. Wheres that new amulet for my little girl? You had the nerve to send someone round the other day for gosling satin, and of course, as we didnt want to embarrass the old man by refusing, we had to send you some. So now what about that amulet ? Abbot Zhang once more quaked with laughter. Ho! ho! ho I You can tell how bad my eyes are getting I didnt even see you there, dear lady, or I should have thanked you for the satin. Yes, the amulet has been ready for some time. I was going to send it to you two days ago, but then Her Grace unexpectedly asked us for this Pro Viventibus and I stupidly forgot all about it. Its still on the high altar being sanctified. Ill go and get it for you. He went off, surprisingly nimbly, to the main hall of the temple and returned after a short while carrying the amulet on a little tea-tray, using a red satin book-wrap as a tray-cloth. Babys nurse took the amulet from him, and he was just about to receive the little girl from her arms when he caught sight of Xi-feng laughing at him mockingly. Why didnt you bring it in your hand? she asked him. The hands get so sweaty in this weather, he said. I thought a tray would be more hygienic. You gave me quite a fright when I saw you coming in with that tray, said Xi-feng. I thought for one moment you were going to take up a collection! There was a loud burst of laughter from the assembled company. Even Cousin Zhen was unable to restrain himself. Monkey! Monkey! said Grandmother Jia. Arent you afraid of going to the Hell of Scoffers when you die and having your tongue cut out? Oh, Papa and I say what we like to each other, said Xi-feng. Hes always telling me I must acquire merit and threatening me with a short life if I dont pay up quickly. Thats right, isnt it Papa? As a matter of fact I did have an ulterior motive in bringing this tray, said Abbot Zhang, laughing, but it wasnt in order to make a collection, I assure you. I wanted to ask this young gentleman here if he would be so very kind as to lend me the famous jade for a few minutes.
Thats wicked. There you are! said Aunt Zhao. Thats all the help I ever get. And I thought you were such a kind person, always helping those in trouble. Are you prepared to stand by and watch me and my Huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman? I suppose its because you think I wouldnt pay you. If you was to say that I am too tender-hearted to stand by and watch you and your boy being wronged, said Mother Ma, you would be saying no more nor less than the truth. But I dont know what you mean about pay. What have you got that you could tempt me with, dearie, even if I was willing to do it for pay? Aunt Zhao observed that her opposition to the very idea of helping her in the desired way had considerably weakened. For someone so clever, she said, arent you being rather stupid? If you help me and it works, with the two of them safely out of the way, everything in this household will be ours. Youll be able to ask for what you like. Fancy not thinking of that! Mother Ma lowered her head and reflected for a while in silence. When that time comes and youre safely landed, she said eventually, you wont want to have anything more to do with me, dearienot when Ive got no proof to show what I done for you. Thats no problem, said Aunt Zhao. Ive got a few taels put by of my own savings, and Ive got some dresses, and theres my jewellery. You can take some of each to be getting on with and I can give you an IOU promising to pay you so much later on. We can have a witness too, if you like. Are you sure? Why should I tell a lie? said Aunt Zhao, and summoned a trusted crone into whose ear she whispered instructions Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps. The old crone nodded and went out, returning after a few minutes with a promissory note for five hundred taels of silver. Aunt Zhao made her mark on it and then went to the wardrobe to get out her savings. The white shine of silver and the signed and sealed IOU dispelled whatever residual doubts the Wise Woman may have entertained, for she seized and pocketed both with alacrity, giving hearty assurances of her aid as she did so then, after rummaging for some time in the capacious waistband of her trousers, she fished out twelve little paper cut-out figuresten of them demons with green faces and red hair and two of them plain human figuresand handed them to Aunt Zhao. Dropping her voice to a whisper, she instructed her to write the eight symbols of her victims nativitytwo for the year, two for the month, two for the day and two for the houron each of the human figures, wrap five of the demons round each of them, and slip them somewhere under her victims beds. Thats all you have to do, she said. 1 shall be doing other things at home to help you. Its sure to work - no question of that. But you must be very, very careful. And you mustnt be afraid. While she was still talking, one of Lady Wangs maids came in looking for her. Oh, here you are! Her Ladyship is waiting for you. Mother Ma went off in the company of the maid. And there we leave her. Because of the injury to his face, Bao-yu had stopped going out of doors since his accident and Dai-yu spent a good deal 6f time in his apartment talking to him. One morning after lunch she had settled down to read, but after a couple of chapters grew bored with the book and did some sewing instead with the maids Nightingale and Snowgoose. When that, too, became boring, she stood for a while leaning against the doorway, vacantly looking out. The young bamboo shoots were just breaking through in the forecourt, and after inspecting them, she drifted out into the Garden. Everywhere the flowers were blooming, the birds were singing, and the water splashed and tinkled, but not a human soul was to be seen. Almost without thinking where she was going, she made her way to the House of Green Delights. A group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath. A sound of laughter came from inside the house. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-chai were there already. Their friendly laughter greeted Dai-yu as she entered Another one! Come in! Come in! What is this? said Dai-yu, joining in the good humour. A party? I sent someone round to you the other day with two caddies-full of tea, said Xi-feng, but you were out.
The trouble is, I dont know how to do buildings in the Elaborate style, and Im no good at human figures but as I was too scared to refuse, Ive got myself into a mess. Human figures are no problem, said Dai-yu. Its the insect-painting thats going to give you the trouble. Now youre talking nonsense, said Li Wan. What need will there be of insects in a painting of the Garden? A few animals and birds dotted here and there maybe, but no insects, surely? If she has no other insects in it, shes got to have Old Mother Locust, said Dai-yu. Without her the painting would be incomplete. The others all laughed. Dai-yu continued, laughing so much herself that she had to clutch her chest with both hands You must hurry up and get on with the painting. Ive already thought of a title to inscribe on it when its finished. You must call it With Locust to the Chew. The others threw back their heads and roared, Their laughter ended abruptly, however, when a loud crash caused them to look anxiously around them to see what had fallen. It turned out to have been Xiang-yuns chair. It had been a somewhat rickety one to start with, and in laughing she had thrown herself back against it so violently that the two joints connecting the chairback with the seat had sprung, causing her to sink backwards and sideways, still sitting in the disintegrating chair. Fortunately she was saved by the rooms wooden partition from falling onto the floor. The undignified spectacle of her descent provoked fresh shouts of mirth which only gradually subsided when Bao-yu hurried over and helped her to her feet. As he passed Dai-yu he signalled to her with his eyes. Understanding that something must be wrong with her appearance, she slipped into Li Wans bedroom and took the cover off the mirror to have a look. It was the hair above her brows that was coming loose. She pulled out the drawer in Li Wans dressing-box, took out two little vanity-brushes, primmed her hair at the mirror, then, hurriedly replacing everything, went back into the outer room, where the others were still laughing. She pointed a finger accusingly at Li Wan. So this is your idea of supervision in needlework and moral instructioninviting us over here for jokes and horseplay! Did you hear that, all of you? said Li Wan. This is the ringleader who sets everyone else laughing and misbehaving, yet she has the effrontery to blame me for starting it all! Oh, I could - ! Well, all I can say is that I hope when you marry you have a real Tartar for a mother-in-law and lots of nasty sisters-in-law with tongues as sharp as yours. It will serve you right! Dai-yu, blushing, clung to Bao-chais hand. Lets give her a years leave, shall we? Let me suggest what I think is a fair compromise and see what the rest of you think of it, said Bao-chai. Its true that Lotus Dweller can paint, but painting in her case means no more than an occasional sketch in the Impressionistic style. Now of course, you couldnt paint this Garden in the first place if you didnt have impressions of it but the trouble is that the Garden itself was designed rather like a painting, with every rock, every tree, every building in it carefully and precisely placed in order to produce a particular scenic effect and if you tried to get your impressions of all of these different scenes onto paper exactly as they are, they simply wouldnt make a picture. The shape of the paper imposes its own perspectives. You have to make them into a composition. You have to decide which to bring into the foreground and which to push into the background, which to leave out altogether and which to show only in glimpses. When youve done that, you can make your rough draft. And even then, its only when youve studied the draft for a long time and corrected it until youre satisfied that you can go ahead with your transfer. One of your difficulties is going to be the ruler-work. With all those buildings youre going to have to do the straight lines with a ruler, and in ruler-work if youre not very careful its easy to make the most terrible mistakes - railings that slant to one side, leaning pillars, windows on the skew or steps drawn Out of line. Sometimes careless ruling can produce even more grotesque results, like a table squashed into a wall or a flowerpot apparently testing on the side of a curtain. Any one of these things is enough to make a painting look ridiculous. Putting in the human figures is going to be another problem. First of all you have to be very careful that you have got them in the right perspective.
There was nothing Sir She could do about that, of course, except swear all the -time at Mr Lian for being incompetent. But I ask you, Miss Mr Lian had already promised five hundred taels cash down and still old Stony had refused, so what more was there he could do? The matter might have rested there if that black-hearted villain Jia Yu-cun hadnt got to hear about it. He soon thought of a way. He made out that Stony owed the government some money, had him hauled off to the yamen, and when he got there, told him they would have to detrain on his property to pay off the debt. Then he sent his officers round to Stonys house, seized the fans, valued them at a government price, and sent them to Sir She as a present. Poor old Stony! I dont know whether hes alive now or dead. What I do know is that when Sir She was telling Mr Lian how he had come by the fans at last, Mr Lian couldnt help remarking that he didnt see anything very competent about ruining a man and stripping him of all he possessed for so trifling a reason. That made Sir She very angry, because of course he assumed that Mr Lian was really getting at him. That was the main reason for the beating but then there were a number of smaller things a few days laterI dont even remember now what they were. They seem to have brought things to a head, because he suddenly went for him. He didnt pull him down and beat him with a flat-stick or a cudgel in the normal way either he just picked up the first thing that came to handI dont know what it wasand started hitting him with it where he stood. He cut his face open in two places. We heard that Mrs Xue has got some kind of lotion for injuries of this sort and I wondered if youd mind letting me have a tablet. Bao-chai at once sent Oriole for the tablets and told her to bring two of them. I wont go and see your mistress now, under the circumstances, she said, when she handed them to Patience. Give her my regards, though, wont you? Patience thanked her and left. Our story returns now to Caltrop. After dinner, by which time she had finished making her calls, while Bao-chai went to join Bao-yu and the others in Grandmother Jias apartment, Caltrop went off on her own to visit the Naiads House. Dai-yu was by this time well on the way to recovery. She seemed so delighted to hear that Caltrop had moved into the Garden, that Caltrop felt emboldened to make her a request Now that Im here and have got more time to spare, do you think you could teach me .to write poetry? It would be such a piece of luck for me if you would. You can make your kotow and become my pupil if you like said Dai-yu goodnaturedly. Im no expert myself, but I dare say I could teach you the rudiments. Would you really? said Caltrop. Then Ill be your disciple. But you must promise not to get impatient with me. Theres nothing in it really, said Dai-yu Theres really hardly anything to learn. In Regulated Verse there are always four couplets the opening couplet, the developing couplet, the turning couplet and the concluding couplet. In the two middle couplets, the developing and turning ones, you have to have tone-contrast and parallelism. Thats to say, in each of those couplets the even tones of one line have to contrast with oblique tones in the other, and vice versa, and the substantives and non-substantives have to balance each other though if youve got a really good, original line, it doesnt matter all that much even if the tone-contrast and parallelism are wrong. Ah, that explains it I said Caltrop, pleased. Ive got an old poetry-book that I look at once in a while when I can find the time, and I long ago noticed that in some of the poems the tone-contrast is very strict, while in others its not. Someone told me the rhyme -2347 For one, three and five You need not strive But two, four and six You must firmly fix. and at first that seemed to explain the exceptions. But then I found that in some old poems even the second, fourth and sixth syllables seemed to have -the wrong tones, and Ive been puzzling about it ever since. Now, from what youve just said, it sounds as if these rules really arent important after allthat the most important thing is that the language should be original. Youve hit it exactly 1 said Dai-yu.
The burning sun was now in the height of heaven, the contracted shadows were concentrated darkly beneath the trees, and the stillness of noon, filled with the harsh trilling of cicadas, was broken by no human voice but as he approached the bamboo trellises of the rose-garden, a sound like a sup-pressed sob seemed to come from inside the pergola. Uncertain what it was that he had heard, he stopped to listen. Undoubtedly there was someone there. This was the fifth month of the year, when the rambler roses are in fullest bloom. Peeping through the fragrant panicles with which the pergola was smothered, he saw a girl crouching down on the other side of the trellis, scratching at the ground with one of those long, blunt pins that girls use for fastening their back hair with. Can this be some silly maid come here to bury flowers like Frowner? he wondered. He was reminded of Zhuang-zis story of the beautiful Xi-shis ugly neighbour, whose endeavours to imitate the little frown that made Xi-shi captivating produced an aspect so hideous that people ran from her in terror. The recollection of it made him smile. This is imitating the Frowner with a vengeance, he thought, - if that is really what she is doing. Not merely unoriginal, but downright disgusting! Dont imitate Miss Lin, he was about to shout but a glimpse of the girls face revealed to him just in time that this was no maid, but one of the twelve little actresses from Pear-tree Court though which of them, since he had seen them only in their make-up on the stage, he was unable to make Out. He stuck Out his tongue in a grimace and clapped a hand to his mouth. Good job I didnt speak too soon, he thought. Ive been in trouble twice already today for doing that, once with Frowner and once with Chai. It only needs me to go and upset these twelve actresses as well and I shall be well and truly in the cart! His efforts to identify the girl made him study her more closely. It was curious that he should have thought her an imitator of Dai-yu, for she had much of Dai-yus ethereal grace in her looks the same delicate face and frail, slender body the same -1536 ... brows like hills in spring, And eyes like autumns limpid pools even the same little frown that had often made him compare Dai-yu with Xi-shi of the legend. It was now quite impossible for him to tear himself away. He watched her fascinated. As he watched, he began to see that what she was doing with the pin was not scratching a hole to bury flowers in, but writing. He followed the movements of her hand, and each vertical and horizontal stroke, each dot and hook that she made he copied with a finger on the palm of his hand. Altogether there were eighteen strokes. He thought for a moment. The character he had just written in his hand was QIANG. The name of the roses which covered the pergola contained the same character Qiang-wei. The sight of the roses has inspired her to write a poem, he thought. Probably shes just thought of a good couplet and wants to write it down before she forgets it or perhaps she has already composed several lines and wants to work on them a bit. Lets see what she writes next. The girl went on writing, and he followed the movements of her hand as before. It was another QIANG. Again she wrote, and again he followed, and again it was a QIANG. It was as though she were under some sort of spell. As soon as she had finished writing one QIANG she began writing another. QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG QIANG He must have watched her write several dozen QIANGs in succession. He seemed to be as much affected by the spell on his side of the pergola as the girl herself was on hers, for his eyeballs continued to follow her pin long after he bad learned to anticipate its movements. This girl must have something on her mind that she cannot tell anyone about to make her behave in this way, he thought. One can see from her outward behaviour how much she must be suffering inwardly. And she looks so frail. Too frail for suffering. I wish I could bear some of it for you, my dear! In the stifling dog-days of summer the transition from clear to overcast is often sudden, and a little cloudlet can sometimes be the harbinger of a heavy shower. As Bao-yu watched the girl, a sudden gust of cool wind blew by, followed, within moments, by the hissing downpour of rain.
Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence. Next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festivals official commencement was on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month at two oclock in the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer it is about this time that the blossom begins to fail and tradition has it that the flower-spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party for the flowers. This charming custom of speeding the fairies is a special favourite with the fair sex, and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches and palanquins out of willow-twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour. All the young peopleBao-chai, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xichun, Li Wan, Xi-feng and her little girl and Caltrop, and all the maids from all the different apartmentswere outside in the Garden enjoying themselvesall, that is, except Dai-yi, whose absence, beginning to be noticed, was first commented on by Ying-chun Whats happened to Cousin Lin? Lazy girl! Surely she cant still be in bed at this hour? Bao-chai volunteered to go and fetch her The rest of you wait here Ill go and rout her out for you, she said and breaking away from the others, she made off in the direction of the Naiads House. While she was on her way, she caught sight of lgante and the eleven other little actresses, evidently on their way to join in the fun. They came up and greeted her, and for a while she stood and chatted with them. As she was leaving them, she turned back and pointed in the direction from which she had lust come Youll find the others somewhere over there, she said. Im on my way to get Miss Lin. Ill join the rest of you presently. She continued, by the circuitous route that the gardens contours obliged her to take, on her way to the Naiads House. Raising her eyes as she approached it, she suddenly became aware that the figure ahead of her just disappearing inside it was Bao-yu. She stopped and lowered her eyes pensively again to the ground. Bao-yu and Dai-yu have known each other since they were little, she reflected. They are used to behaving uninhibitedly when they are alone together. They dont seem to care what they say to one another and one is never quite sure what sort of mood one is going to find them in. And Dai-yu, at the best of times, is always so touchy and suspicious. If I go in now after him, he is sure to feel embarrassed and she is sure to start imagining things. It would be better to go back without seeing her. Her mind made up, she turned round and began to retrace her steps, intending to go back to the other girls but just at that moment she noticed two enormous turquoise-coloured butterflies a little way ahead of her, each as large as a childs fan, fluttering and dancing on the breeze. She watched them fascinated and thought she would like to play a game with them. Taking a fan from inside her sleeve and holding it outspread of her, she followed them off the path and into the grass. To and fro fluttered the pair of butterflies, sometimes alighting for a moment, but always flying off again before she could reach them. Once they seemed on the point of flying across the little river that flowed through the midst of the garden and Bao-chai had to stalk them with bated breath for fear of startling them out on to the water. By the time she had reached the Raindrop Pavilion she was perspiring freely and her interest in the butterflies was beginning to evaporate. She was about to turn back when she became aware of a low murmur of voices coming from inside the pavilion. Raindrop Pavilion was built in such a way that it projected into the middle of the pool into which the little watercourse widened out at this point, so that on three of its sides it looked out on to the water.
If you dont, it will look as if you are sulking, he said After all, it is Fengs birthday, and Grandma did specially send someone to cheer you up. Inwardly acknowledging the reasonableness of this advice, Patience looked round her for some powder, but could not see any, whereupon Bao-yu darted over to the dressing-table and removed the lid from a box of Early Ming blue -and-white porcelain in which reposed the head of a white day my with five compact, stick like buds on either side of the stem. Pinching off one of these novel powder-containers, he handed it to Patience. There you are. This isnt ceruse, its a powder made by crushing the seeds of garden-jalap and mixing them with perfume. Patience emptied the contents of the tiny phial on to her palm. All the qualities required by the most expert perfumers were there lightness, whiteness with just the faintest tinge of rosiness, and fragrance. It spread smoothly and cleanly on the skin, imparting to it a soft bloom -that was quite unlike the harsh and somewhat livid whiteness associated with lead-based powders. Then the rouge, too, was differentnot in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses. This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge, Bao-yu explained to her, only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. Its so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands for using on your cheeks. Following his directions, .Patience found that her complexion had acquired a radiant freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume. Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patiences hair. At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wans place and she had to leave him in a hurry. Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret. Today wasor would have been if -she had livedGoldens birthday, and for this reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning. The row which bad broken out later in the day between Xi-feng and Jia Lian had proved a godsend. It had at last given him an opportunity of showing Patience something of what he felt for her. This was an unlooked-for happiness he might otherwise have waited a lifetime for in vain. He stretched himself out on his bed in a pleasurable glow of satisfaction. These pleasant feelings were soon marred by the reflection that a coarse sensualist like Jia Lian who never considered anything but his own pleasure would certainly know nothing about the scientific preparation of cosmetics. He thought of Patience serving that precious couple, alone in the world without parents or brothers and sisters to defend her, somehow contriving to steer an even course between Jia Lians boorishness on the one hand and Xi-fengs vindictiveness on the other, yet today, in spite of all her efforts, falling a victim to their cruelty. Truly her lot was an unhappy one -mote unhappy even than Dai-yus! At this point in his reflections he became so upset that he began to shed tears, not bothering on this occasion to restrain them, because Aroma was not there to disapprove. Getting up from his bed, he went over to inspect Patiences dress The samshoo that had been sprayed on it was now neatly dry. He picked up the iron, ironed the dress for her, and neatly folded it. Then he noticed that she had left her handkerchief behind. As it was still marked with tear-stains, he washed it out in the water she had used for her face and hung it up to dry. Feeling a strange sensation in which sadness and happiness commingled, he mused for some minutes in silence before going over to Sweet-rice Village to join the others.
You think that when I do nothing, you have got the better of me. Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence. She climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured boy. She looked at his face. The whole left side of it was badly blistered. It was a wonder that the eye had not been damaged. When Lady Wang saw it, she was both full of anguish for her son and at the same time, when she thought of the questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother jia and wondered what she would say, terrified on her own account. To relieve her fear she turned once more on Aunt Zhao. Then, after tongue-lashing the concubine, she comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part of his face. It does hurt a bit, said Bao-yu when she asked him, but nothing very terrible. When Grandma asks about it we had better tell her that I did it. Shell blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly, even if you say you did it yourself, said Xi-feng. Therell be a row, whatever you say. Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room. It was a great shock to Ar6ma and the other maids when they saw him. Dai-yu had had a dull time of it with Bao-yu away all day, and in the course of the evening sent several times round to his room to inquire whether he was back yet. It was in this way that she heard about his scalding. She hurried round immediately to see for herself how he was. She found him with a mirror in his hand, examining the extent of the damage. The entire left side of his face was thickly plastered with ointment, from which she deduced that the injury must be a serious one. But when she approached him to look closer, he averted his head and waved her away. He knew how squeamish she was, and feared that the sight of it would upset her. Dai-yu for her part was sufficiently aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking. She merely asked him whether it hurt very badly Not so bad as all that, said Bao-yu. A couple of days and it will probably be all right again. Dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room. Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia. Although he told her that he had burned himself through his own careless-ness, the old lady, as had been predicted, berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen. Another day went by, and Bao-yus godmother, old Mother Ma, called round. Mother Ma was a Wise Woman. Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers. She was shocked by her godsons appearance and, on being informed of the cause, shook her head and tutted sympathetically. She made a few signs over his face with her fingers, muttering some gibberish as she did so, after which she assured them that he would soon be better the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory, impermanent nature. She turned to Grandmother Jia Bless you, my lucky lady! Bless you dearie! You dont know a half of the unseen harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of. All the sons of princes and great folks the moment they begin to grow up are f6llowed round everywhere they go by troops of invisible little impsspiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever they can. Some-times they knock the rice bowl from their hands when theyre eating. Sometimes they push them over when they are walking. Its on account of these creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family dont live to make old bones. Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from these unwelcome attentions. Easily, said Mother Ma. By doing good works. Giving a bit more to charity on the young persons behalf. There is another way, though. According to what the Scripture says, theres a Bodhisattva of Universal Light living in the Paradise of the West who spends his time lighting up the dark places where these evil spirits lurk, and if any believer, male or female, will make offerings to that Bodhisattva in a proper spirit of devoutness, he will grant their children and grand-children his holy peace and protect them from possession by devils and from the powers of darkness. What sort of offerings do you make to this Bodhisattva? Grandmother Jia asked her. Nothing very special. Apart from the usual incense offerings, we take a few pounds of sesame oil each day and make what we call a sea of light by burning wicks in it.
They werent really thinking of their loyal duty to their sovereign at all. Now my idea of a glorious death would be to die now, while you are all around me then your tears could combine to make a great river that my corpse could float away on, far, far away to some remote place that no bird has ever flown to, and gently decompose there until thewind had picked my bones clean, and after that never, never to be reborn again as a human beingthat would be a really good death. Im sleepy, said Aroma, unwilling to reply, for she had observed that his mad fit was on him again. And Bao-yu at once closed his eyes -and fell fast asleep. By next morning the subject appeared to have been quite forgotten. A day arrived when Bao-yu seemed to have exhausted the Gardens possibilities, and its charms were beginning to weary him. The Return of the Soul was very much on his mind at this time. He had read it through twice without in any way abating his appetite for more. Having recently been told that the best singer among the twelve little actresses of Pear Tree Court was the soubrette called Charmante, he resolved, for a change of scene, to go over there and look her up, so that he could ask her to sing him some of the arias from it. The only girls he recognized when he arrived there were Tresor and Topaze, who greeted him with smiles and invited him to be seated. When he asked where Charmante was, the girls all answered him in chorus In her room. Bao-yu at once went to the room indicated. Charmante was in there on her own. She was lying stretched out on her bed, but made no attempt to get up when she saw him enter. Nothing daunted, he sat himself down beside her and, in the familiar way he habitually adopted with girls, smilingly requested her to sing the section from the Return that begins with the words In these quiet courts the floating gossamer... But Charmante did not respond in the expected manner. She rose up quickly and drew away from him when he sat down beside her and in answer to his request to sing, she informed him, with a cold, unsmiling expression, that she was not invoice. I strained my voice the other day at a command performance for Her Grace, she said. I am still resting it. She was sitting opposite him as she said this, so that he had a full view of her face. He remembered now, as he studied it, where he had seen that face before. She was the girl he had seen scratching QIANS on the ground that day under the rose pergola. And now here she was behaving as if his very presence was distasteful to her. Never in his life before had he experienced such instant rejection. Reduced to mumbling incoherence by his embarrassment, he coloured, andsince there was obviously no point in stayingleft the room. Surprised to see him come out again so soon, the others asked him the reason. Trsor laughed when he told her what had happened. Wait until Mr Qiang gets back, she said. If he asks her to, shell sing for you. Bao-yu did not know quite what to make of this. Qiang? he said. Where is he, anyway? He went out only a few minutes ago, said Trsor. I expect Charmante said she wanted something and hes gone out to try and get it for her. Bao-yu seemed to find this of enormous interest and decided to stay a little longer and see what happened. Sure enough, Jia Qiang presently returned from his expedition. He was carrying a bird-cage with a bird inside. The cage had a miniature stage fastened to the top of it. Jia Qiang was on his way inside to look for Charmante, obviously feeling very pleased with himself, when he caught sight of Bao-yu and halted. Whats that bird youve got there? Bao-yu asked him. Its a whitecap, said Jia Qiang, smiling proudly. It can hold a flag in its beak and do a little turn on the stage. How much did you pay for it? One tael and sixteen pennyweights of silver. He invited Bao-yu to be seated while he went into Charm-antes room to show off his purchase but Bao-yu, whose desire to hear Charmante sing was now quite forgotten in his eagerness to find out exactly how things lay between her and Jia Qiang, joined the girls as they clustered round the door-way to watch. Look! Look what Ive brought for you, said Jia Qiang, full of smiles. What is it? Charmante had been lying down again, but sat up when he entered.
A boys proper business is to read books in order to gain an understanding of things, so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing the country. Not that one hears of that happening much nowadays. Nowadays their reading seems to make them even worse than they were to start with. And unfortunately it isnt merely a case of their being led astray by what they read. The books, too, are spoiled, by the false interpretations they put upon them. They would do better to leave books alone and take up business or agriculture. At least they wouldnt do so much damage. As for girls like you and me spinning and sewing are our proper business. What do we need to be able to read for? But since we can read, let us confine ourselves to good, improving books let us avoid like the plague those pernicious works of fiction, which so undermine the character that in the end it is past reclaiming. This lengthy homily had so chastened Dai-yu that she sat with head bowed low over her teacup and, though her heart consented, could only manage a weak little yes by way of reply. At that moment Candida came into the room Mrs Zhu says will you please come over to discuss an important matter with her? Miss Ying and Miss Tan and Miss Xi and Miss Shi and Master Bao are there already, waiting for you. I wonder what it is this time, said Bao-chai. We shall soon find out if we go, said Dai-yu. So off she went, and Bao-chai with her, to Sweet-rice Village. They found everyone else there, as Candida had said. Li Wan greeted them with a smile. Weve only just got our poetry club started, and already someone is trying to wriggle out of it. Its Xi-chun. Shes asking for a years leave of absence. I can guess why that is, said Dai-yu. Its because of what Grandmother said about painting the Garden. Shes decided to use that as an excuse. I dont think you should blame Grandmother, said Tan-chun. Its what Grannie Liu said that started it. Grannie Liu, yes, thats right, Dai-yu hurriedly corrected herself. Whose grannie is she anyway, Id like to know? Old Mother Locust we ought to call her, not Grannie Liu. This set them all laughing. If one wants to hear the demotic at its most forceful, said Bao-chai, one has to listen to Cousin Feng. Fortunately for us she cant read, so her jokes are somewhat lacking in finesse and the language she uses can never rise above the level at which it is commonly spoken. The secret of Frowners sarcastic tongue is that she uses the method adopted by Confucius when he edited the Spring and Autumn Annas, that is to say, she extracts the essentials from vulgar speech and polishes and refines them, so that when she uses them to illustrate a point, each word or phrase is given its maximum possible effectiveness. The mere name Old Mother Locust,, for example, is sufficient to evoke the whole scene of yesterdays party and everything that happened at it. Whats more, she is able to do this sort of thing almost without thinking. The others, still laughing, assured Bao-chai that she excelled as a commentator no less than Dai-yu and Xi-feng, in their different ways, as wits. The reason I asked you all here is because I wanted your advice on how long we ought to give her, said Li Wan. I said a month, but she says thats much too short. What do you all think? Logically a year wouldnt be at all too long, said Dai-yu. If it took a whole year to build the Garden, she would naturally require about two years in which to paint it. First shes got to grind her ink, then shes got to soften her brushes, then shes got to fix the paper, then shes got to find her colours, and then -, The others realized that this was a joke at Xi-chuns expense. Yes? they said, playing up to her. What then? Dai-yu, unable to maintain a straight face, was beginning to giggle. and then proceed in like manner, by gradual degrees, to paint it. Prolonged hilarity and clapping of hands. In like manner, by gradual degrees, said Bao-chai. I like that. The telling phrase at the end. The trouble with all those jokes we were laughing at yesterday is that they were funny enough at the time, but on recollection they seem rather stupid. Dai-yus jokes on the other hand, though the words at first appear colourless, are richly humorous to remember.
Black or navy- blue would go well with crimson, said Oriole. With anything lighter the crimson would be too overpowering. What goes with viridian? said Bao-yu. Peach pink . Mm. That sounds very colourful, certainly. What about something colourful but a bit more on the quiet side? What about leek- green and green ish- yellow ? said Oriole. Thats a very tasteful combination. All right, you make me those three then one black, one peach- pink and one leek- green . What pattern do you want for the netting? said Oriole. What patterns are there? said Bao-yu. Theres stick-pattern, ladder-pattern, diamond, double diamond, linked rings, flower-pattern, willow-leaf... What was the pattern of that netting you did the other day for Tan-chun? Ah, that was a flower-pattern with filled-in centres. Id like it in that pattern. Aroma had meanwhile left them to fetch the silks. As she came back with them, an old woman called through the window to say that her lunch was ready. Off with you then, said Bao-yu, and come back as soon as you have finished. How can I possibly leave with a guest here in the room said Aroma. Dont be ridiculous! said Oriole. You go and have your lunch. Aroma smiled at that and tripped off, leaving the two of them alone together, except for two very junior maids who were to remain at hand in case they were wanted. Bao-yu lay and watched Oriole knotting, chatting to her in a desultory way as he watched. How old are you? he asked her. Oriole replied without raising her head from her work. Fourteen. Whats your surname? Huang. Huang? That means yellow . It goes well with your name. They say yellow oriole, dont they? yellow oriole, golden oriole, My name was Golden Oriole originally, said Oriole, but Miss Bao found it too much of a mouthful, so she called me just Oriole for short, and now everyone else does. Miss Bao must be very fond of you, said Bao-yu. I expect later on when she gets married shell want to take you with her. Oriole pulled a face and laughed. Ive often said to Aroma, Bao-yu went on, whoever gets you and your mistress will be a lucky man. Shes a good person, is our Miss Bao, said Oriole, much more than you realize. There are things about her you dont find in many people in this worldmore important things than good looksthough shes good-looking too, of course. Orioles mellifluous, lilting voice and the simple, artless way in which she talked and laughed had powerfully affected Bao-yu. it increased his pleasure to hear her speaking in this way now about her mistress. What things? he asked her eagerly. Tell me about them. If I do, said Oriole, you mustnt let her know that I to you. Of course not. They were interrupted at this point by a voice from the outer room. Youre very quiet in there! As the two of them simultaneously turned to look, it was Bao-chai herself who stepped into the room. Bao-yu at once invited her to take a seat. When she had done so, she inquired what Oriole was making and leaned forward to inspect it. The first of the three sash-ends was already half completed. What do you want to make a thing like that for? she asked. Why dont you make him a necklet to wear with his jade? Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly. He had intended to ask Oriole to do this for him in the first place, but had forgotten. Clever coz! What a good thing you mentioned it! Id quite forgotten. But what would be the right colour for it? Lets see, said Bao-chai. The brighter colours definitely wouldnt do. Crimson would clash. Yellow wouldnt be a sufficient contrast. Black would be too heavy. Ill tell you what. If you were to take a gold thread and a very fine black bugle-thread and twist them together that would look nice. Bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion, and shouted several times for Aroma to fetch the gold thread. She came in while he was still shouting for her, carrying two plates of food and looking puzzled. I cant understand it, -she said. Someones just brought me these from Her Ladyship. Oh, I expect they had more than they wanted there, so shes sent you this to share with the others, said Bao-yu.
But if you cared only for me and had absolutely no inclination at all in another direction, then every time I mentioned gold and jade you would behave quite naturally and let it pass almost as if you hadnt noticed. How is it, then, that when I do refer to it you get so excited? It shows that it must be on your mind. You pretend to be upset in order to allay my suspicions. Meanwhile a quite different thought was running through Bao-yus mind I would do anythingabsolutely anything, he was thinking, if only you would be nice to me. If you would be nice to me, I would gladly die for you this moment. It doesnt really matter whether you know what I feel for you or not. Just be nice to me, then at least we shall be a little closer to each other, instead of so horribly far apart. At the same time Dai-yu was thinking Never mind me. Just be your own natural self. If yon were all right, I should be all right too. All these manoeuvrings to try and anticipate my feelings dont bring us any closer together they merely draw us farther apart. The percipient reader will no doubt observe that these two young people were already of one mind, but that the complicated procedures by which they sought to draw together were in fact having precisely the opposite effect. Complacent reader! Permit us to remind you that your correct understanding of the situation is due solely to the fact that we have been revealing to you the secret, innermost thoughts of those two young persons, which neither of them had so far ever felt able to express. Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of outward appearances. When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once mote made reference to the gold and jade, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the Magic Jade from his neck and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against the floor with all the strength in his body. Beastly thing! he shouted. Ill smash you to pieces and put an end to this once and for all. But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged. Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do. Why smash a dumb, lifeless object? she said. If you want to smash something, let it be me. The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand. He glared at her scornfully. Its my own thing Im smashing, he said. What business is it of yours to interfere? Aroma saw that his face was white with anger and his eyes wild and dangerous. Never had she seen him in so terrible a rage. She took him gently by the hand You shouldnt smash the jade just because of a disagreement with your cousin, she said. What do you think she would feel like and what sort of position would it put her in if you really were to break it? Dai-yu heard these words through her sobs. They struck a responsive chord in her breast, and she wept all the harder to think that even Aroma seemed to understand her better than Bao-yu did. So much emotion was too much for her weak stomach. Suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia leaves she had taken only a short while before. Nightingale quickly held out her handkerchief to receive it and, while Snowgoose rubbed and pounded her back, Dai-yu continued to retch up wave upon wave of watery vomit, until the whole handkerchief was soaked with It. However cross you may be, Miss, you ought to have more regard for your health, said Nightingale. Youd only just taken that medicine and you were beginning to feel a little bit better for it, and now because of your argument with Master Bao youve gone and brought it all up again. Suppose you were to be really ill as a consequence. How do you think Master Bao would feel? When Bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast, and he reflected bitterly that even Nightingale seemed to understand him better than Dai-yu But then he looked again at Dai-yu, who was sobbing and panting by turns, and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspiration and tears, and seeing how pitiably frail and ill she looked, his heart misgave him.
We can have our party for Cousin Shi at the same time, and Grandma will be able to come and look at the chrysanthemums. Grandmas already promised to give a return party for Cousin Shi herself, said Bao-yu, and we are all invited. Wed better wait until thats over before putting on anything of our own. The longer we delay, the colder the weather will be, said Tan-chun. It wont be much fun for Grandma if its too cold. But she loves parties when its raining or snowing, said Bao-yu. Why dont we wait until the first snowfall and have it then? Call it a snow-viewing party. Think how romantic -1536 chanting poems in the falling snow! It would be more romantic still, said Dai-yu drily, if instead of chanting poems we had a big bundle of firewood and took it in turns to tiptoe through the snow and pull out sticks from it. Bao-chai and the other girls all laughed, but Bao-yu stared at Dai-yu rather crossly and said nothing. After the company had dispersed, Bao-yu finally managed to get Grannie Liu into a corner and question her in detail about the mysterious snow maiden. Grannie Lius inventiveness was once more put to the test. On the embankment that runs along the north side of our land, she said, there is a little shrine. The image inside it is not a god or a Buddha, though. There used at one time to be a gentleman living in our parts She broke off at this point and appeared to be trying to remember a name. Never mind his name, said Bao-yu. Dont try to remember it. Just tell me what happened. This gentleman had no son, but he had an only daughter calledI think it was Ruo-yu. She could read books as well as any scholar, this Ruo-yu, and the gentleman loved her more than all the treasure in the world. But sad to say, she took sick and died when she was only seventeen years old Bao-yu groaned and stamped his foot. So what happened then? Because the gentleman loved her so dearly, he had this shrine built for her out in the fields and had a likeness of her made out of wood and clay to put inside it and he arranged for someone to burn incense there and always keep a spark of fire going inside the burner. But as the years went by, both the gentleman and the people who used to tend the shrine for him all died, and now the shrine is falling into ruin and the statue has come to life and started haunting people. No, no, Bao-yu interrupted hurriedly, that wouldnt be the statue coming to life. People like that are never really dead, even after they have died. Holy Name! said Grannie Liu. Fancy that now! And me thinking all along it was the statue. Well, whatever it is, every so often it takes on human shape and goes wandering abroad troubling people. And thats what I saw when I looked out that time and saw someone taking our firewood. The people in our village are talking of breaking up the image and knocking the shrine down so as to put a stop to the haunting. Good gracious! they mustnt do that! said Bao-yu. Thats a terrible sin, knocking a temple down! Now I am glad you told me that, said Grannie Liu gravely. When I get hack, I shall do my best to stop them. My grandmother and Lady Wang and in fact just about everyone in this family is terribly keen on good works, said Bao-yu. Theres nothing they like better than repairing temples and restoring things. Tomorrow Ill write out an appeal and collect some subscriptions for you. You can be the funds Treasurer, and when weve got enough money together, you can supervise the restoration, And Ill get them to send you some money every month for incense, How would that be? Statue or spirit or whatever she is, said Grannie Liu, I shall certainly be grateful to her for the money. Bao-yu pressed her for the names of the nearest farms and villages and the exact location of the shrine in relation to them as well as the distance to it and the general direction in which it lay. Answering all these questions with whatever came first into her head, Grannie Liu supplied a set of fictitious directions which Bao-yu, believing them to be genuine, carefully committed to memory and carried back to his room, where he lay awake half the night planning what he would do for the beautiful wood-thief in the days ahead. He went out of the Garden first thing next morning, and handing Tealeaf a few hundred cash, told him the directions for getting to the shrine as given him by Grannie Liu the night before, and instructed him to follow them, inspect the shrine, and report back on what he saw.
Is there anything you feel like eating yet? If there is, tell them to come round to my place and get it. As soon as Xi-feng had gone, Bao-yu was visited by Aunt Xue, and shortly after that by someone whom his grand-mother had sent to see how he was getting on. At lighting-up time, after taking a few mouthfuls of soup, he settled down into a fitful sleep. Just then a new group of visitors arrived, consisting of Zhou Ruis wife, Wu Xin-dengs wife, Zheng Hao-shis wife, and those other members of the mansions female staff who had had most to do with Bao-yu in the past and who, having heard of his beating, were anxious to see how he was. Aroma came out smiling on to the verandah to welcome them. Youre just too late to see him, ladies, she told them in a low voice. Hes just this minute dropped off. She ushered them into the Outer room, invited them to be seated, and served them with tea. After sitting there very quietly for several minutes, they got up to take their leave, requesting Aroma as they did so that she would inform Bao-yu when he waked that they had been round to ask about him. Aroma promised to do so and showed them out. Just as she was about to go in again, an old woman arrived from Lady Wangs to say that Her Ladyship would like to see one of Master Baos people. After reflecting for a moment, Aroma turned to the house and called softly to Skybright, Musk and Ripple inside. Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so Im going over. Stay indoors and keep an eye on things while Im away. I shant be long. Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wangs apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely pleased when she saw that it was Aroma. You could have sent one of the others, she said. There was no need for you to come and leave him unattended. Aroma smiled reassuringly. Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own. Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted. I have nothing in particular to tell you, said Lady Wang. I merely wanted to ask about my son. How is the pain now? Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him, said Aroma. It was so bad before that he couldnt lie still, but now hes sleeping quite soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was. Has he had anything to eat yet? said Lady Wang. He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent, said Aroma, but thats all he would take. He kept complaining that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum bitters to drink, but of course thats an astringent, and I thought to myself that as hed just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him but after only half a cup of it he said it tasted sickly and he couldnt get it down. Oh dear, I wish youd told me sooner, said Lady Wang. We were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably only get wasted, so I didnt. If he cant manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious. She called Suncloud to her. Fetch me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day. Two will be enough, said Aroma, otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run Out, I can always come back for more later. Suncloud was gone for a considerable time.
Theres a genuine bond between usfor example, she would never take advantage of our relationship, as some girls would, to ask other people for clothes or money for herself. One consequence 6f this is that not only Feng and your sister-in-law, but everyone else in the household, from the highest down to the lowest, is able to trust her. It means that quite apart from the fact that I have someone I can rely on, Feng and -your sister-in-law are saved a great deal of worry because with a girl like that to look after me, I dont suffer when they occasionally forget something, and that keeps me in a good temper. If Faithful were to leave me now, who would you get for me to put in her place? And even if you could find such a jewel, shed need to have a tongue in her head too. Shed be no use to me if she didnt have my Faithfuls gift for expressing herself. As a matter of fact Ive been thinking of sending someone round to your husband to tell him that if he would care to buy himself a girl, hed be very welcome to do it with my money. I dont mind if it costs me eight thousand ten thousand evenbut if its this girl of mine he wants, Im afraid he cant have her. Tell him that if he wants to be a dutiful son, hell be doing more for me by leaving me my Faithful, to serve me during the few years that yet remain, than if he were to come over and wait on me in person, morning, noon and night. Its turned out very conveniently, your coming over just now youll be able to take this message back to him yourself and I can be sure of its being properly delivered. She called for the servants. Whats happened to everybody? We were just in the middle of a nice chat when suddenly everyone went away. The maids, with answering cries, went off to look for the others. Soon all had been reassembled except Aunt Xue, who showed some resistance to the summons. Ive only just got back, she said. Whats the point of going out again? Have a heart, Mrs Xue I said the maid. Her Old Ladyship is in a passion. If you dont come, no one else will ever shift her out of it. If its the walking that bothers you, Ill carry you there on my back I Get along with you, little monkey I said Aunt Xue, laughing. A few hard words wont hurt you. She went with the maid nevertheless. On her arrival she was cordially welcomed by Grandmother Jia. What shall we do? said the old lady. Shall we play cards? Come and sit by me, Mrs Xue. You havent had much practice. If the two of us sit together, there will be less chance of Feng confusing us. Yes, said Aunt Xue. You will have to keep an eye on my hand and help me out a bit. Is it to be just the four of us, or shall we have one or two more? Just us four, surely? said Lady Wang. No, lets have one mote, said Xi-feng. It will make it more interesting. Go and call Faithful, someone, said Grandmother Jia. She can sit below me. Mrs Xues eyesight isnt too good. Faithful will be able to keep an eye on both our hands. Xi-feng laughed. I know you can read and write, she said to Tan-chun. I suppose you havent learned how to tell fortunes too, by any chance ? What a strange question! said Tan-chun. You should be concentrating all your energies on winning some of Grandmas money, not thinking about having your fortune told. -I thought you -might be able to tell me how much Im going to lose today, said Xi-feng. No question of winning anything. Look how Grandmas got me ambushed on every side before weve even started playing! Presently Faithful arrived and sat in the place below Grandmother Jia. Xi-feng sat below Faithful. A red blanket was spread over the table, the cards were shuffled, the players cut for deal, and the game began. After they had been playing for some minutes, Faithful noticed that Grandmother Jia had a nearly full hand and only needed a Two of Coins to go out. She made a sign to Xi-feng, whose turn it was to discard. Xi-feng pretended to be in great doubt as to what she ought to play. Im sure Aunt Xue is hanging on to the card I want. Id better let her have this one, and then perhaps shell part with it. Im sure I havent got anything you want, said Aunt Xue, Id need to look at your hand before I believed that, said Xi-feng.
Tell her that Im getting old and that she is not to be upset by what I said to her. Ask her to forgive me for your sake. Bao-yu quickly went over and knelt before Lady Wang. But before he could relay his grandmothers message, his mother had laughingly prevented him. Get up at once and dont be ridiculous, Bao-yu I How can you possibly apologize for Grandma to me ? Bao-yu hurriedly got up to his feet. What about you, Feng? said Grandmother Jia. Why didnt you try to stop me? Ive been trying to restrain myself from blaming you for whats happened, said Xi-feng. I dont know why you should pick on me. Grandmother Jias laughter was echoed by the others present. Oh? Now this is interesting. I should like to know why you think Im to blame for what has happened. You shouldnt be so good at training your girls, said Xi-feng. When youve brought up a beautiful young bulrush like Faithful, can you blame other people for wanting her? Its a good job Im only your granddaughter-in-law. If Id been your grandson, I should have asked you for her for myself a long time ago. I shouldnt have waited till now, I can tell you! Oh, said Grandmother Jia, laughing. So its all my fault, is it? Of course its your fault, said Xi-feng. In that case I wont try to keep her, said Grandmother Jia. You can take her back with you. Not just now said Xi-feng. In my next life, perhaps. If a good girl in this life, I might be reborn as a man, and I can ask you for her then! Go on, take her with you! said Grandmother Jia. You can give her to your Lian. See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then! -1014 Lian doesnt deserve her, said Xi-feng. All hes fit for is a couple of sad old dumplings like me and Patience! This set everyone laughing. A maid came in to announce someone. Lady Xing, maam. Lady Wang hurried out to meet her. What followed will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 47 In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a hasty getaway HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her. Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithfuls attitude. She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of Grandmother Jias women as she entered the old ladys courtyard. She would have liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late she had already been seen and announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was covered with shame and confusion. By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence might add to Lady Xings embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together, Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence. I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband, she said. I must congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own now why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age? Yet they tell me that you positively encourage his excesses. Lady Xing blushed crimson with embarrassment. I have tried several times to dissuade him, without success. I am sure you must realize that I have acted against my will in this matter. You did what you were told, all the same, said Grandmother Jia sharply. Would you do what you were told if he asked you to kill someone? Just reflect for a moment. There is only your sister-in-law, poor, simple soulshe is always ailing from something or otherto worry about the responsibilities of this household. Its true that she has Lians wife to help her, hut she has so much to do that she hardly knows which way to turnalways putting the rake down to pick up the broom. And I have to cut down on all my activities nowadays.
a Deva King? Every time his dad gives him a few whacks on the bum, the whole household is in a state of uproar about it for days on end. I remember that time Uncle Zheng beat him for doing something he shouldnt have and old Lady Jia decided that Cousin Zhen was at the bottom of it. She had the poor so-and-so hauled up in front of her and there was hell to pay. Now, this time, you want to drag me into it. All right then I dont care. A life for a life. Ill go in there and kill the little blighter then you can all do what you like to me. In the midst of this bawling he had picked up a door bar and was evidently going off to execute his threat but his distraught mother clung to him and prevented him from going. You stupid creature! she said. Who do you think youre going to hit with that? If youre going to hit anyone, youd better begin with me! Xue Pans exasperation had now reached such a pitch that his eyes stood out in his head like a pair of copper bells. This is rich! he shouted. You wont let me go and finish him off, yet you wont stop provoking me by making up all these lies. Every day that fellow stays alive means one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with. Wed much better die, the pair of us, and make an end of it! Have a little self-control! said Bao-chai, joining in her mothers efforts to restrain him. Cant you see how upset poor Mamma is? You ought to be trying to calm her, not making things worse with this uproar. Oh yes ! you can say that now, said Xue Pan, but it was you who started all this by telling her about me, wasnt it? Its all very well to blame me for telling Mamma, said Bao-chai. Why dont you blame yourself for being so careless, you great blabber-mouth ? Me careless ? said Xue Pan. What about the way Bao-yu stirs up trouble for himself then? Let me just give you an example. Let me tell you what happened between him and Bijou the other day. Id met Bijou ten times, near enough, and never had so much as a kind word out of him, yet Bao-yu, that didnt even know him by sight, meets him for the first time the other day, and before you know where you are, hes given him his sash! I hope youre not going to say that that got about because of me ? His mother and sister were indignant. Thats a fine example, isnt it? Its precisely because of that that he was beaten. Now we know it must have been you who told. This is enough to drive a fellow mad! said Xue Pan, Its not so much the lies you keep telling about me. What really gets my goat is the almighty fuss you make about this fellow Bao-yu. Almighty fuss? said Bao-chai. Youve just been waving a door-bar at us, and you say that we have been making a fuss ? Xue Pan could see that Bao-chai had reason on her side and that she was much harder to argue with than his mother. He was therefore eager to find something that would stop her mouth, so that he could say what he wanted to without contradiction. This, coupled with the fact that be was by now far too angry to weigh the seriousness of what he was saying, was responsible for the unpardonable innuendo that followed. All right, sis, he said, you dont need to quarrel with me. I know what your trouble is. Mamma told me long ago that Mr Right would be someone with a jade to match your locket, so naturally, now youve seen -that blasted thing that Bao-yu wears round his neck, you do all you can to stick up for him. Anger at first made Bao-chai speechless then, clinging to Aunt Xue, she burst into tears. Mamma, listen to what Pan is saying to me! Realizing, when he saw his sisters tears, that he had gone too far, Xue Pan retired sulkily to his own room and went to bed Bao-chai was left bursting with injury and outrage which she dared not express for fear of further upsetting her mother. She was obliged to bid the latter a tearful goodnight and go back to her own room in the Garden, where she spent the rest of the night weeping. She was up early next morning. Too dispirited to make a proper toilet, she stopped only to tidy herself a little before setting off for her mothers. On the way she met, of all people, Dai-yu, standing on her own beneath a flowering tree.
All right then, Ill come, said Grandmother Jia, who had been listening. You ll come, Grannie? Well thats splendid, isnt it I That means it will be just as bad for me as it would be if I were watching here at home. Now look here, said Grandmother Jia, I shant want you to stand and wait on me. Let me take the gallery facing the stage and you can have one of the side galleries all to yourself then you can sit down and enjoy yourself in comfort. Xi-feng was touched. Do come! Grandmother Jia said to Bao-chai. Ill see that your mother comes too. The days are so long now, and theres nothing to do at home except go to sleep. Bao-chai had to promise that she would go. Grandmother Jia now sent someone to invite Aunt Xue. The messenger was to call in on the way at Lady Wangs and ask her if the girls might go as well. Lady Wang had already made it clear that she would not be going herself, partly because she was not feeling very well, and partly because she wanted to be at home in case any further messages arrived from Yuan-chun but when she learned of Grandmother Jias enthusiasm, she had word carried into the Garden that not just the girls but anyone else who wanted to might go along with Grandmother Jias party on the first. When this exciting news had been transmitted throughout the Garden, the maids some of whom hardly set foot outside their own courtyards from one years end to the next were all dying to go, and those whose mistresses showed a lethargic disinclination to accept employed a hundred different wiles to make sure that they did so. The result was that in the end all the Gardens inhabitants said that they would be going. Grandmother Jia was quite elated and at once issued orders for the cleaning and preparation of the temple theatre. But these are details with which we need not concern ourselves. On the morning of the first sedans, carriages, horses and people filled all the roadway outside Rong-guo House. The stewards in charge knew that the occasion of this outing was a Pro Viventibus ordered by Her Grace the Imperial Concubine and that Her Old Ladyship was going in person to burn incensequite apart from the fact that this was the first day of the month and the first day of the Summer Festival consequently the turnout was as splendid as they could make it and far exceeded anything that had been seen on previous occasions. Presently Grandmother Jia appeared, seated, in solitary splendour, in a large palanquin carried by eight bearers. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Aunt Xue followed, each in a palanquin with four bearers. After them came Bao-chai and Dai-yu sharing a carriage with a splendid turquoise-coloured canopy trimmed with pearls. The carriage after them, in which Ying chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun sat, had vermilion-painted wheels and was shaded with a large embroidered umbrella. After them rode Grandmother Jias maids, Faithful, Parrot, Amber and Pearl after them Lin Dai-yus maids, Nightingale, Snowgoose and Delicate then Bao-chais maids, Oriole and Apricot then Ying-chuns maids, Chess and Tangerine then Tan-chuns maids, Scribe and Ebony then Xi-chuns maids, Picture and Landscape then Aunt Xues maids, Providence and Prosper, sharing a carriage with Caltrop and Caltrops own maid, Advent then Li Wans maids, Candida and Casta then Xi-fengs own maids, Patience, Felicity and Crimson, with two of Lady Wangs maids, Golden and Suncloud, whom Xi-feng had agreed to take with her, in the carriage behind. In the carriage after them sat another couple of maids and a nurse holding Xi-fengs little girl. Yet more carriages followed carrying the nannies and old women from the various apartments and the women whose duty it was to act as duennas when the ladies of the household went Out of doors. The street was packed with carriages as far as the eye could see in either direction, and Grandmother Jias palanquin was well on the way to the temple before the last passengers in the rear had finished taking their places. A confused hubbub of laughter and chatter rose from the line of carriages while they were doing so, punctuated by an occasional louder and more distinctly audible protest, such as Im not sitting next to you ! or, Youre squashing the Mistresss bundle! or, Look, youve trodden on my spray!
Now when could they have been? said Bao-chai. With parties being held here practically every day this autumn, the Garden has never been free long enough. I cant abide the poems of Li Shang-yin, said Dai-yu, but there is just one line of his that I am rather fond of -720 Leaves but dead lotus-leaves for the rain to play on. -1344 Trust you not to leave the dead lotus-leaves! It is a good line, I agree, said Bao-yu. Well tell them that in future they are not to remove them. They were drifting into Flowery Harbour now, and the dank chill of its creeper-hung grotto seemed to penetrate their bones. Dead reeds and dying caltrop-leaves added to the autumnal melancholy of the scene. A clean, airy-looking building was visible at some distance beyond the bank above. Isnt that Bao-chais place? said Grandmother Jia. On being told that it was, she asked the women to moor the boats there, and having disembarked, ascended from the landing-stage by a flight of cloud-shaped stone steps and proceeded, with the rest of the party, to the gateway of Allspice Court. A delectable fragrance assailed their nostrils as they entered. Outside the house the leaves of the mysterious, unnamable creepers had turned an even intenser green in the colder weather, and where before there had been flowers, there now hung trusses of the most beautiful coral-red berries. Indoors, however, it was stark and bare. The only decoration in Bao-chais room was a vase of the cheaper kind of Ding ware on the table, with a few chrysanthemums in it. Apart from the flowers there were only a few books and some tea-things on the table. The bed-hangings were of black gauze, and the quilts and covers were of the same forbidding plainness as the hangings. This child is really too self-effacing! Grandmother Jia muttered, evidently shocked by what she saw. The tone in which she addressed Bao-chai was a somewhat reproachful one If you havent any things of your own, why ever didnt you as your Aunt Wang for some? Im afraid I never thought about it before. Of course. I realize now. You must have left all your stuff behind in Nanking. She at once ordered Faithful to supply Bao-chai with some Ornaments, and then turned, with some asperity, on Xi-feng. Really, Feng! I do think it rather stingy of you! Couldnt y6u have spared your cousin a few knick-knacks? Lady Wang and Xi-feng both laughed. She said herself that she didnt want any. We g ave her some things, but she sent them all back again. Aunt Xue corroborated this. She was just the same in Nanking, Lady Jia. Shes never cared much for that sort of thing. Grandmother Jia shook her head. That will never do. It saves trouble, no doubt, to keep ones room so bare. But what would any of our relations think if they were to come here and see this? Besides, it isnt natural for a young girl to be so austere. If girls are to live so austerely, what sort of a stable ought an old woman like me to live in? Think of the descriptions of young ladies boudoirs you find in plays and romances such exquisite refinement of luxury! Im not exactly suggesting that you should emulate them but you shouldnt fall too far short, all the same. After all, when the things are there for the asking, it seems silly not to use them. Use them sparingly, by all means, if your tastes are on the austere side but dont dispense with them altogether! Ive always had rather a flair for decorating interiors. I dont exercise it much nowadays, because Im too old but I think the girls have inherited a little of it from me. The thing one always has to be on ones guard against is bad taste -which generally means no more than arranging good things in a bad way. I dont think any of my girls has bad taste. Now why dont you let me decorate this room for you? I promise you it shall look both dignified and austere. There are still a few things tucked away in my dowry that Bao-yu doesnt know about. wouldnt let him see them, or theyd have disappeared long ago!. She called Faithful to her and instructed her what to bring. I want you to fetch that bonseki and the little screen and the little tripod of smoky agate.
But when he saw that Bao-yu was genuinely distressed, he added Whats it for? Ive noticed that you often carry powdered incense in that sachet you wear. Why not see if youve got any in that? Bao-yu, glad to be reminded, extracted the silk purse that he wore suspended from his neck underneath the front fold of his gown, felt inside it with his fingers, and was delighted to find that there was still a pinch or two of powdered agalloch in the bottom. Seems a bit lacking in respect to use this though, he thought. Still, its more respectful to use something Ive carried all the way here myself than it would be to use something Id just bought in a shop. Having decided that the powdered incense would do, he asked Tealeaf where he could get hold of an incense-burner and some fire. Now those we cant get, said Tealeaf. Where could we, Out here in the middle of the wilds? If you knew you were going to need them, why didnt you tell me beforehand, and we could have brought them with us? Stupid idiot I said Bao-yu. Do you honestly think we could have ridden out at this break-neck pace if wed been carrying an incense-burner full of hot coals with us? Tealeaf, after some moments of reflection, smiled uncertainly I know what we could do, Master, though I dont know what youll think of the idea. Theres little enough hope of our getting the things youve just asked for round here, and the chances are that even if we could, youd only start thinking of something else you needed that was even harder to get. Now if we were to go on for about another two thirds of a mile in this direction, we should come to the Temple of the Water Spirit Bao-yu pricked up his ears. The Temple of the Water Spirit? Is that near here? Good. That will do even better. Lets go there then. With a touch of the whip he was away once more, still talking to Tealeaf over his shoulder as he rode ahead. The nun at the Water Spirit is one of our regular callers. If I see her when we get there and tell her we want to use one of her burners, shes sure to let us. Even if this wasnt one of the temples we subscribe to, said Tealeaf, Im sure they wouldnt dare refuse if you asked them. But why is it that today you are so willing to go to the Temple of the Water Spirit when normally you can scarcely abide to hear it mentioned? The reason I normally feel that way about it, said Bao-yu, is because I hate the silly, senseless way in which vulgar people offer worship and build temples to gods they know nothing about. Ignorant old men and women with too much money to spend hear the name of some god or othertheyve no idea who it is, but the mere fact that theyve heard it from the lips of some ballad-singer or story-teller seems to them incontrovertible proof of the gods existenceand go founding temples in which these fictitious deities can he worshipped. Take this Temple of the Water Spirit. The reason its called that is because the divinity worshipped in it is supposed to be the goddess of the river Luo. Now in point of fact no Goddess -1344 of the Luo ever existed. She was an invention of the poet Cao Zhi. But that didnt stop a lot of people making an image of her and worshipping it. The only reason I feel differently about this temple today is because the idea of a water-goddess just happens to fit in with the thing that is at the moment uppermost in my mind so Im glad to make use of it for my own purpose. By this time they had reached the gate of the temple. The old nun who kept it, hardly less surprised to hear of Bao-yus arrival than she would have been if she had been told that a dragon had just fallen, alive and kicking, out of the sky, hurried out to greet him, and ordered the old temple-servant who did duty as a porter to take care of the horses. Bao-yu went on inside. Instead of bowing down before the image, however, he stood and contemplated it appraisingly. Though the goddess was only a thing of wood and plaster and paint, the sculptor who made her had succeeded in capturing some of the spirit of Cao Zhis famous description. To Bao-yus gazing eyes she did indeed appear as the poet portrayed her -640 Fluttering like the wing-beats of a startled swan, Swaying with the lissome curves of a water-dragon... Cao Zhis beautiful images came crowding into his mind -640 Like a lotus flower emerging from the green water, Like the morning sun rising above the mist-bank...
Her Ladyship wants to see someone, so Im going over. Stay indoors and keep an eye on things while Im away. I shant be long. Then she followed the old woman out of the Garden and round to Lady Wangs apartment in the central courtyard. She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely pleased when she saw that it was Aroma. You could have sent one of the others, she said. There was no need for you to come and leave him unattended. Aroma smiled reassuringly. Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own. Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted. I have nothing in particular to tell you, said Lady Wang. I merely wanted to ask about my son. How is the pain now? Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him, said Aroma. It was so bad before that he couldnt lie still, but now hes sleeping quite soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was. Has he had anything to eat yet? said Lady Wang. He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent, said Aroma, but thats all he would take. He kept complaining that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum bitters to drink, but of course thats an astringent, and I thought to myself that as hed just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him but after only half a cup of it he said it tasted sickly and he couldnt get it down. Oh dear, I wish youd told me sooner, said Lady Wang. We were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably only get wasted, so I didnt. If he cant manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious. She called Suncloud to her. Fetch me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day. Two will be enough, said Aroma, otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run Out, I can always come back for more later. Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of-them was labelled Essence of Cassia Flower and the other one Essence of Roses. What tiny little bottles! said Aroma. They cant hold very much. I suppose the stuff inside them must be very precious. It was made specially for the Emperor, said Lady Wang. Thats what the yellow labels mean. Havent you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and dont let the stuff in them get wasted. Aroma promised -to be careful and began to go. Just a minute! said Lady Wang. Ive thought of some-thing else that I wanted to ask you. Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else was in the room, then she said I think I heard someone say that Bao-yus beating today was because of something that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you dont happen to have heard anything about that? No. I havent heard anything about that, said Aroma. What I heard was that it was because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or others players and the Master was told about it by someone who called. Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously. Yes, that was one of the reasons. But -there was another reason as well. I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Ladyship, said Aroma. She dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. I wonder if I might be rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship?
Do you suppose she really thinks her girl would have had such a terrible time with me? Dont be so touchy, said Li Wan. Her mother is not to blame. The girl had already started service in the Garden before you ever spoke to her about it. Oh well, in that case, said Xi-feng, recovering her good humour, Ill have a word with Bao-yu about it tomorrow. Ill tell him to find someone else and let me have this girl to work under me. Still she turned to Crimson, perhaps we ought to ask the party most concerned if she is willing. Crimson smiled. As to being willing or not, madam, I dont think its my place to say. But I do know this that if I was to work for you, I should get to know whats what and all the inside and outside of household management. Im sure it would be wonderful experience. Just then a maid arrived from Lady Wangs asking for Xi-feng, who promptly excused herself to Li Wan and left. Crimson returned to Green Delightswhere our story now leaves her. We now return to Dai-yu, who, having slept so little the night before, was very late getting up on the morning of the festival. Hearing that the other girls were all out in the garden speeding the fairies and fearing to be teased by them for her lazy habits, she hurried over her toilet and went out as soon as it was completed. A smiling Bao-yu appeared in the gate-way as she was stepping down into the courtyard. Well, coz, he said, I hope you didnt tell on me yesterday. You had me worrying about it all last night. Dai-yu turned back, ignoring him, to address Nightingale inside When you do the room, leave one of the casements open so that the parent swallows can get in. And put the lion doorstop on the bottom of the blind to stop it flapping. And dont forget to put the cover back on the burner after youve lighted the incense. She made her way across the courtyard, still ignoring him. Bao-yu, who knew nothing of the little drama that had taken place outside his gate the night before, assumed that she was still angry about his unfortunate lapse earlier on that same day, when he had offended her susceptibilities with a somewhat risqu quotation from The Western Chamber. He offered her now, with energetic bowing and hand-pumping, the apologies that the previous days emergency had caused him to neglect. But Dai-yu walked straight past him and out of the gate, not deigning so much as a glance in his direction, and stalked off in search of the others. Bao-yu was nonplussed. He began to suspect that something more than he had first imagined must be wrong. Surely it cant only be because of yesterday lunchtime that shes carrying on in this fashion? There must be something else. On the other hand, I didnt get back until late and I didnt see her again last night, so how could I have offended her? Preoccupied with these reflections, he followed her at some distance behind. Not far ahead Bao-chai and Tan-chun were watching the ungainly courtship dance of some stork. When they saw Dai-yu coming, they invited her to join them, and the three girls stood together and chatted. Then Bao-yu arrived. Tan-chun greeted him with sisterly concern How have you been keeping, Bao? Its three whole days since I saw you last. Bao-yu smiled back at her. How have you been keeping, sir? I was asking Cousin Wan about you the day before yesterday. Come over here a minute, said Tan-chun. I want to talk to you. He followed her into the shade of a pomegranate tree a little way apart from the other two. Has Father asked to see you at all during this last day. or two? Tan-chun began. No. I thought I heard someone say yesterday that he had been asking for you. No, said Bao-yu, smiling at her concern. Whoever it was was mistaken. He certainly hasnt asked for me. Tan-chun smiled and changed the subject. During the past few months, she said, Ive managed to save up another ten strings or so of cash. Id like you to take it again like you did last time, and next time you go out, if you see a nice painting or calligraphic scroll or some amusing little thing that would do for my room, Id like you to buy it for me. Well, I dont know, said Bao-yu. In the trips I make to bazaars and temple fairs, whether its inside the city or round about, I cant say that I ever see anything really nice or out of the ordinary.
She found Lady Wang sitting on a cane summer-bed and fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She appeared not entirely pleased when she saw that it was Aroma. You could have sent one of the others, she said. There was no need for you to come and leave him unattended. Aroma smiled reassuringly. Master Bao has just settled down for the night, Madam. If he should want anything, the others are nowadays quite capable of looking after him on their own. Your Ladyship has no need to worry. I thought I had better come myself and not send one of the others, in case Your Ladyship had something important to tell us. I was afraid that if I sent one of the others, they might not understand what you wanted. I have nothing in particular to tell you, said Lady Wang. I merely wanted to ask about my son. How is the pain now? Much better since I put on some of the lotion that Miss Bao brought for him, said Aroma. It was so bad before that he couldnt lie still, but now hes sleeping quite soundly, so you can tell it must be better than it was. Has he had anything to eat yet? said Lady Wang. He had a few sips of some soup Her Old Ladyship sent, said Aroma, but thats all he would take. He kept complaining that he felt dry. He wanted me to give him plum bitters to drink, but of course thats an astringent, and I thought to myself that as hed just had a beating and not been allowed to cry out during it, a lot of hot blood and hot poison must have been driven inwards and still be collected round his heart, and if he were to drink some of that stuff, it might stir them up and bring on a serious illness, so I talked him out of it. After a lot of persuading, I got him to take some rose syrup instead, that I mixed up in water for him but after only half a cup of it he said it tasted sickly and he couldnt get it down. Oh dear, I wish youd told me sooner, said Lady Wang. We were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that I could have let you have. As a matter of fact I was going to send him some of them, but then I thought that if I did they would probably only get wasted, so I didnt. If he cant manage the rose syrup, I can easily give you a few of them to take back with you. You need only mix a teaspoonful of essence in a cupful of water. The flavours are quite delicious. She called Suncloud to her. Fetch me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day. Two will be enough, said Aroma, otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run Out, I can always come back for more later. Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of-them was labelled Essence of Cassia Flower and the other one Essence of Roses. What tiny little bottles! said Aroma. They cant hold very much. I suppose the stuff inside them must be very precious. It was made specially for the Emperor, said Lady Wang. Thats what the yellow labels mean. Havent you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and dont let the stuff in them get wasted. Aroma promised -to be careful and began to go. Just a minute! said Lady Wang. Ive thought of some-thing else that I wanted to ask you. Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else was in the room, then she said I think I heard someone say that Bao-yus beating today was because of something that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you dont happen to have heard anything about that? No. I havent heard anything about that, said Aroma. What I heard was that it was because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or others players and the Master was told about it by someone who called. Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously. Yes, that was one of the reasons. But -there was another reason as well. I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Ladyship, said Aroma. She dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. I wonder if I might be rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship? Really and truly She faltered. Please go on. I will if Your Ladyship will promise not to he angry with me. Thats all right, said Lady Wang. Just tell me what you have to say. Well, really and truly, said Aroma, Master Bao needed punishing.
Come on, you must hurry back, Mother, said Jia Lian. He sent me to fetch you a long time ago. He saw his mother out of the main part of the mansion and round to Jia Shes quarters next door. Lady Xing then gave her husband, in briefest possible outline, a report of what had happened and since it was now evident that nothing more could be done about Faithful, Jia She had to put up with his mortification as best he could. He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls on her in his stead. Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our story. The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up. Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record. -347 The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Das wife came round once more to renew her invitation. Grandmother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part of the day in the Lai familys private garden. Lai Das garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty. The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer part of the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias. One of these last was a young gentleman called Liu Xianglian whom Xue Pan had met on some previous occasion and hankeringly remembered ever since. The discovery that he was a keen amateur actor one, moreover, who specialized in romantic roles had led Xue Pan to jump to the wrong conclusion and assume that he must share the same wind and moonlight proclivities as himself. Eager to make his closer acquaintance but hitherto denied any opportunity of doing so, he was overjoyed at finding him among the company on this occasion and consequently in a state of excitement which rendered his behaviour extremely unpredictable. Cousin Zhen had also heard of Liu Xiang-lian and admired him. Today, under pretext of being a little drunk, he had taken the liberty of asking him to perform for them, and Liu Xiang-lian, supported by the hired professional players, had obliged by appearing on the stage in two operatic numbers. When he rejoined the company, Xue Pan took the opportunity of moving over to his table and began plying him with all sorts of questions and insinuations. Liu Xiang-lian was a young man of excellent family who, having lost both his parents in early youth, had failed to complete his education. He was of a dashing, impulsive nature, impatient of niceties. His chief pleasures were exercising with spear or sabre, drinking, and gambling but he was not averse to gentler pastimes he frequented the budding groves and could play on both the flute and the zither. Because he was so young and handsome, many who did not know him mistakenly supposed that, being an actor, he must have the usual actors propensities. Lai Das son Lai Shang-rong had been a good friend of his for years and it was only natural that he should invite him on this occasion to help him entertain his guests. Under these circumstances Lin Xiang-lian was prepared to put up with a certain amount of drunken horse-play but Xue Pan was too much for him, and soon his attentions were becoming so distasteful that Xiang-lian resolved -347 -to leave at the earliest opportunity in -order to escape from them. Before he could break away, however, Lai Shang-rong detained him. Bao-yu gave me a message for you just now. He said that though he saw you briefly when he arrived, with so many other people around, be didnt have a chance of talking to you properly. Hes most anxious that you should stay on so that he can talk to you afterwards. If you are really set on going, wait while I call him out and you can have a word with him now. What you do after that is your own affair I certainly shant try to detain you.
And this packet here has got eight taels of silver in it. Everything up to here is from the Mistress. Now these two packets here have each got fifty taels of silver in them - a hundred taels in all. Theyre a present from Her Ladyship, for starting a little business or buying some land with when you get back, so that you can be self-sufficient in future and not have to keep falling back on your friends. The two jacketshere Patience smiled somewhat embarrassedlythe two jackets and the two skirts and the four head-scarves and the packet of embroidery silks are a present from me. The clothes have only been worn a very little but they arent new so if you decide to throw them back at me, I shant complain. Grannie Liu had been exclaiming rapturously as each item was shown to her and must have uttered several dozen Holy Names by the time Patience came to her own gift. Throw them back at you, Miss? she said warmly, touched by the maids kindness and humility. How can you say such a thing? Fine clothes like these? I shouldnt know where to buy them if I had the money! You make me feel ashamed. I dont like to take them off you yet if I dont, you will think me ungrateful. Get away with you! said Patience. That sort of talk is for strangers, and you are one of us. If I didnt think of you so, Id never have dared make the offer. You just take them and stop worrying. In any case, theres something I want from you in return. Next New Year, bring us some of your home-dried mixed vegetables pigweed and cowpeas and kidney beans and dried aubergines and dried gourd-shavings. Everyone here loves them. You just bring us some of them. We dont want anything else from you, mind, so dont go wondering what else to bring. Just bring some of them, and well be quits. Grannie Liu thanked her warmly and promised to remember the dried vegetables. Now off to bed with you! said Patience. Ill look after this lot for you. You can leave it here tonight, and tomorrow well send the boys out for a cab and get them to load it for you. So youve got nothing to worry about. Overwhelmed by so much kindness, Grannie Liu went back into the other room to take her leave of Xi-feng, and after thanking her many times over, went off to Grandmother Jias apartment to spend the night. She was up betimes next morning and would like to have said good-bye to Grandmother Jia as soon as she had completed her toilet, and made an early start but the family forestalled her. Knowing that the old lady was indisposed, they had trooped in first thing to inquire how she was and had already sent outside for a doctor. The latters arrival at the mansion was shortly after announced by an old woman servant, whereupon the old women in attendance on Grand mother Jia urged her to conceal herself behind the curtains of the summer-bed. But Grandmother Jia refused to budge. Im old, too, womanold enough to be his mother, I shouldnt wonder. What have I got to fear from him at my age? Im not going behind any curtains. Let him examine me where I am. Seeing that she was resolved to stay, the old women brought up a little table and put a small pillow on it for her to rest her arm on. These preparations completed, they gave orders for the doctor to be admitted. Dr Wang was shortly to be observed crossing the courtyard below, conducted by Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong. Modestly declining to walk up the central ramp, he followed Cousin Zhen up the right-hand side steps onto the terrace, where two old women, one on either side of the doorway, were holding up the door-blind in readiness. Bao-yu came forward to welcome the doctor as the two old women were conducting him through the outer room, and led him, still accompanied by the other gentlemen, to his grandmother inside. The old lady was sitting up very stiffly on a couch. She was wearing a black crepe jacket lined with pearly-haired baby lambs skin. Four little maids, their hair still done up in childish horns, stood two on either side of her, holding fly whisks and spittoons, and five or six old serving-women were fanned out in a sort of bodyguard behind her. Vaguely discernible glimpses of brightly-coloured dresses and golden hair-ornaments betrayed the presence of numerous younger women behind the green muslin curtains at the back. Not daring to raise his head in so much female company, Dr Wang advanced and saluted his patient.
Were going to take four wordslets say upset, glum, blest and content. You have to begin by saying The girl is, and then you say one of the four words. Thats your first line. The next line has to rhyme with the first line and it has to give the reason why the girl is whatever it says upset or glum or blest or content When youve done all four, youre entitled to drink the wine in front of you. Only, before drinking it, youve first got to sing some new popular song and after youve drunk it, youve got to choose some animal or vegetable object from the things in front of us and recite a line from a well-known poem, or an old couplet, or a quotation from the classics Before he could finish, Xue Pan was on his feet, protesting vigorously You can count me out of this Im taking no part in this. This is just to make a fool of me, isnt it? Nuageuse, too, stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat What are you so afraid of, a practiced drinker like you? You cant be any worse at this sort of thing than I am, and Im going to have a go when my turn comes. If you do it all right, youve got nothing to worry about, and even if you cant, youll only be made to drink a few cups of wine whereas if you refuse to follow the rules at the very outset, youll have to drink ten sconces straight off in a row and then be thrown out of the party and made to pour drinks for the rest of us. Bravo! cried the others, clapping and Xue Pan, seeing them united against him, subsided. Bao-yu now began his own turn -576 The girls upset -768 The years pass by, but no ones claimed her yet. The girl looks glum Her true-loves gone to follow ambitions drum. The girl feels blest -1014 The mirror shows her looks are at their best. The girls content Long summer days in pleasant pastimes spent. The others all applauded, except Xue Pan, who shook his head disapprovingly No good, no good! he said. Pay the forfeit. Why, whats wrong with it? they asked him. I couldnt understand a word of it. Nuageuse gave him a pinch Keep quiet and try to think what youre going to say, she advised him otherwise youll have nothing ready when your own turn comes and youll have to pay the forfeit yourself. Thereupon she picked up her lute and accompanied Bao-yu as he sang the following song -2148 Still weeping tears of blood about our separation Little red love-beans of my desolation. Still blooming flowers I see outside my window growing. Still awake in the dark I hear the wind a-blowing. Still oh still I cant forget those old hopes and fears. Still cant swallow food and drink, cos Im choked with tears. Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me its not true Do I look so thin and pale, do I look so blue ? Mirror, mirror, this long night bow shall I get through? Ohohoh! Blue as the mist upon the distant mountains, Blue as the water in the ever-flowing fountains. General applauseexcept from Xue Pan, who objected that there was no rhythm. Bao-yu now drank his well-earned cupthe pass cup as they call itand, picking up a slice of pear from the table, concluded his turn with the following quotation Rain whips the pear-tree, shut fast the door. Now it was Feng Zi-yings turn The girls upset Her husbands ill and shes in debt. The girl looks glum The gale has turned her room into a slum. The girl feels blest Shes got twin babies at the breast. The girls content Waiting a certain pleasurable event. Next, holding up his cupful of wine in readiness to drink, he sang this song Youre so exciting, And so inviting Youre my Mary Contrary Youre a crazy, mad thing. Youre my goddess, but oh I youre deaf to my praying Why wont you listen to what I am saying? If you dont believe me, make a small investigation You will soon find out the true depth of my admiration. Then he drained his bumper and, picking up a piece of chicken from one of the dishes, ended the performance, prior to popping it into his mouth, with a line from Wen Ting-yun From moonlit cot the cry of chanticleer. Next it was the turn of Nuageuse The girls upset -5947 she began, Not knowing how the futures to be met Xue Pan laughed noisily. Thats all right, my darling, dont you worry!
Suddenly the truth dawned on her Ive heard of rich folks having what they call dressing mirrors in their houses. Mayhap Im standing in front of one of them and its myself Im looking at. She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no doubt of it it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She laughed at her own error. Yes, but how do I get out of here? she thought, as she continued to finger the mirrors carved surround. Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some moments she rolled her eyes in terror. The mirror mirror in fact a kind of door. It had a West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Grannie Liu, in feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror slide back into the panelling, revealing the doorway underneath. Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet. But though she intended no more than a few moments rest, as soon as she had sat down, her weariness overcame her. Her head went down and her feet went up as though she was no longer in possession of them a darkness closed over her eyes, and she sank back on the bed, fast asleep. Outside in the Garden meanwhile, the cousins were beginning to wonder what had become of her, and Ban-er, missing his grandmother, became panicky and began to cry. Perhaps shes fallen into the privy, one of the young people suggested cheerfully. Wed better send someone to have a look. Two old women were sent to the privy to investigate. When they reported back hat she was not there, the others were at a loss to think where she could have got to. It was Aroma who hit on the correct hypothesis. She must have missed the way back because she was drunk. If she followed the path in the wrong direction, it will have taken her to our back Courtyard. Now if she went through the pergola and then on into the house through the back door, shell probably have been seen by one of the maids. If she didnt go in through the pergola but went on walking in a south-westerly direction, Heaven only knows where shell end up! I think Id better go and have a look. She hurried back to Green Delights, intending to ask the junior maids if they had seen her but the place was deserted they had all sneaked off elsewhere to play. Entering the main building by way of the front door, she made her way through the complicated carved partition. A thunderous snoring could be heard coming from the bedroom at the back. She hurried through. As she entered the bedroom, a heavy stink, compounded of farts and wine-fumes, assailed her nostrils. Her eyes travelled to the bed, from which the sounds were coming, and saw Grannie Liu, spreadeagled on her back and fast asleep. As soon as she had overcome her shock, she rushed up to the bed and shook her relentlessly until she woke. Grannie Liu opened her eyes wide and saw Aroma standing over her. Oh, miss! She scrambled hurriedly to her feet. C Oh, I am sorry! Anywaypraise be! I havent dirtied the bed. She felt it nervously, to make sure. Aroma, mortally afraid that someone would overhear and Bao-yu get to know of what had happened, gestured to her violently not to speak. Hurriedly she threw three or four whole handfuls of Hundred Blend aromatic onto the incense burner that stood always smouldering beside the bed and replaced its cover. At least its a mercy she wasnt sick, she thought to herself. Speaking to her in an urgent whisper, she nevertheless contrived to smile at her reassuringly Its all right. Ill look after this. Just follow me. Grannie Liu nodded gratefully and followed her to the junior maids quarters outside, where Aroma made her sit down. If they ask what happened, just say that you passed Out and had a little nap on the rockery. Grannie Liu willingly agreed, and Aroma gave her some tea. By the end of the second cup she had sobered up completely and was able to converse. Which of the young ladies does the bedroom belong to? she asked Aroma. Its the most beautiful I ever saw. I thought I was in paradise. Aroma gave a wry little smile. Itsactually its Master Baos bedroom. Grannie Liu fell silent, horrified by the enormity of her trespass.
Ill bury this lot for her and remind her about it next time I see her. He became aware that Bao-chai was arranging for him and Tan-chun to go with her outside. Ill join you two presently, he said, and waited until they were a little way off before stooping down to gather the fallen blossoms into the skirt of his gown. It was quite a way from where he was to the place where Dai-yu had buried the peach-blossom on that previous occasion, but he made his way towards it, over rocks and bridges and through plantations. of trees and flowers. When he had almost reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature mountain between him and the burial-place of the flowers, he heard the sound of a voice, coming from the other side of the rock, whose continuous, gentle chiding was occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs. It must be a maid from one of the apartments, thought Bao-yu. Someone has been ill-treating her, and she has run here to cry on her own. He stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying. She appeared to be reciting something The blossoms fade and falling fill the air, Of fragrance and bright hues bereft and bare. Floss drifts and flutters round the Maidens bower, Or softly strikes against her curtained door. The Maid, grieved by these signs of springs decease, Seeking some means her sorrow to express, Has rake in hand into the garden gone,. Before the fallen flowers are trampled on. Elm-pods and willow-floss are fragrant too Why care, Maid, where the fallen flowers blew? Next year, when peach and plum-tree bloom again, Which of your sweet companions will remain? This spring the heartless swallow built his nest Beneath the eaves of mud with flowers compressed. Next year the flowers will blossom as before, But swallow, nest, and Maid will be no more. -1983 -1983 Three hundred and three-score the years full tale From swords of frost and from the slaughtering gale How can the lovely flowers long stay intact, Or, once loosed, from their drifting fate draw back? Blooming so steadfast, fallen so hard to find! Beside the flowers grave, with sorrowing mind, The solitary Maid sheds many a tear, Which on the boughs as bloody drops appear. At twilight, when the cuckoo sings no more, The Maiden with her rake goes in at door And lays her down between the lamplit walls, While a chill rain against the window falls. I know not why my hearts so strangely sad, Half grieving for the spring and yet half glad Glad that it came, grieved it so soon was spent. So soft it came, so silently it went! Last night, outside, a mournful sound was heard The spirits of the flowers and of the bird. But neither bird nor flowers would long delay, Bird lacking speech, and flowers too shy to stay. And then I wished that I had wings to fly After the drifting flowers across the sky Across the sky to the worlds farthest end, The flowers last fragrant resting-place to find. But better their remains in silk to lay And bury underneath the wholesome clay, Pure substances the pure earth to enrich, Than leave to soak and stink in some foul ditch. Can I, that these flowers obsequies attend, Divine how soon or late my life will end? Let others laugh flower-burial to see Another year who will be burying me? As petals drop and spring begins to fail, The bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale. One day, when spring has gone and youth has fled. The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead. -1983 All this was uttered in a voice half-choked with sobs for the words recited seemed only to inflame the grief of the reciterindeed, Bao-yu, listening on the other side of the rock, was so overcome by them that he had already flung him-self weeping upon the ground. But the sequel to this painful scene will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER 28 A crimson cummerbund becomes a pledge of friendship And a chaplet of medicine-beads becomes a source of embarrassment ON the night before the festival, it may be remembered, Lin Dai-yu had mistakenly supposed Bao-yu responsible for Sky-brights refusal to open the gate for her. The ceremonial farewell to the flowers of the following morning had transformed her pent-up and still smouldering resentment into a more generalized and seasonable sorrow. This had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave. Meditation on the fate of flowers had led her to a contemplation of her own sad and orphaned lot she had burst into tears, and soon.
Cant we leave together in the evening? Im afraid its that cousin of yours, said Xiang-lian. The usual problem. If I stay any longer, theres sure to be some kind of trouble. Id much better go now and avoid it. Bao-yu reflected for some moments. Yes, I suppose in that case youd better. Only, if you really and truly are going away for a long time, do please let me know before you start. Please dont just slip away without telling me. His eyes brimmed over with tears. Of course Ill come and say good-bye to you, said Xiang-lian . As long as you promise not to tell anyone. He stood up to go. You go in again now. Dont try to see me out. He left the study and made his way to the main gate but there, unfortunately, was the very person he was trying to avoid. Whos let my little Liu get away? Xue Pan bawled. Xiang-lians eyes flashed angrily. In other circumstances he would have laid him out there and then with a single blow of his fist but reflecting that to do so now would be interpreted by the others as drunken brawling and would moreover be embarrassing to his host, he restrained himself with some effort Xue Pan, in whose besotted eyes he appeared as a coveted treasure that was moving at last within his grasp, lurched towards him, smiling happily, and gripped him firmly by the arm. Where are you off to little pal? Just-going out for a stroll, said Xiang-lian. Ill be back again directly. It wont be any more fun here without you, said Xue Pan. Do stay a bit longerjust to show me that you care for me, eh? If its business thats taking you away, dont worry, leave it to me! I dont care how important it is whether its a career youre after or making a pilewith me for a pal youll have no more to worry about! Angered and revolted by his odious intimacy, Xiang-lian quickly thought of a plan for disposing of him. Drawing him aside to a spot where they could not be overheard, he pretended to question his sincerity. Are you really so fond of me, or are you just pretending? Xue Pan was almost beside himself. His eyes became tiny slits of pleasure How can you ask such a question, my dear? Pretending? May I die this instant if I am! Good. This place here is not convenient. Wed better go in again now and sit with the others for a bit. Then Ill leave, and you can leave a bit after me and follow me back to my place. Well make a night of it. Ive got a couple of very nice little boys there whove never been out before so you neednt bring anyone with you all the service well need is there already. Xue Pan was by now so delighted that his drunkenness had already half left him. Do you mean this? What a person! said Xiang-lian. One opens ones heart to you and you dont trust them. No, no, no, said Xue Pan hurriedly. I trust you. Im no fool. Theres only one thing, though I dont know where you live. If you leave before I do, where am I to look for you? My place is outside the North Gate, said Xiang-lian. Do you think you can tear yourself from home and spend a whole night outside the city? What do I need a home for if Ive got you? said Xue Pan. All right, said Xiang-lian. Ill wait for you on the bridge then, outside the North Gate. Wed better get back to the party now. Dont forget wait a bit after Ive gone before going yourself then -no one should suspect anything. Yes, said Xue Pan, yes. The two of them then went in again and resumed their places. Xue Pan found waiting difficult and kept his eyes constantly on Xiang-lian, watching for him to go. At the same time he began, in joyous anticipation of the pleasures in store, to drink with greater and greater abandon, not waiting for the wine to be offered, but stretching out rudely to left and right of him and plying himself from the wine-kettles of his neighbours. Soon he was very drunk indeed. Xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved. First he gave an order to his page Almond, who was waiting there You go home now. I have some business outside the city to attend to. Ill be back later. Then he vaulted into the saddle and rode off until he came to the North Gate of the city. Passing through, he rode on till he came to the bridge, where he halted and took up his-station-to wait for Xue Pans arrival.
Youve already told me once today how clumsy I am. I cant even drop a fan without treading on it. So Im much too clumsy to get your fruit for you. Suppose I were to break a plate. That would be terrible! If you want to break it, by all means break it, said Bao-yu. These things are there for our use. what we use them for is a matter of individual taste. For example, fans are made for fanning with but if you prefer to tear them up because it gives you pleasure, theres no reason why you shouldnt. What you mustnt do is to use them as objects to vent your anger on. Its the same with plates and cups. Plates and cups are made to put food and drink in. But if you want to smash them on purpose because you like the noise, its perfectly all right to do so. As long as you dont get into a passion and start taking it Out on things that is the golden rule. All right then, said Skybright with a mischievous smile. Give me your fan to tear. I love the sound of a fan being torn. Bao-yu held it out to her. She took it eagerly and chah! promptly tore it in half. And again chah! Chah! chah! she tore it several more times. Bao-yu, an appreciative onlooker, laughed and encouraged her. Well torn! Well torn! Now again - a really loud one! Just then Musk appeared. She stared at them indignantly. Dont do that! she said. Its wicked to waste things like that. But Bao-yu leaped up to her, snatched the fan from her hand, and passed it to Skybright, who at once tore it into several pieces. The two of them, Bao-yu and Skybright, then burst into uproarious laughter. What do you think youre doing? said Musk. Thats my fan youve just ruined. Whats an old fan? said Bao-yu. Open up the fan box and get yourself another. If thats your attitude, said Musk, we might as well carry Out the whole boxful and let her tear away to her hearts content. All right. Go and get it, said Bao-yu. And be born a beggar in my next life? said Musk. No thank you I She hasnt broken her arm. Let her go and get it herself. Skybright stretched back on the bed, smiling complacently. Im rather tired just now. I think I shall tear some more tomorrow. Bao-yu laughed. The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels are well spent. For a few old fans its cheap at the price! He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan, and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool. But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening. -1344 About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in Grandmother Jias room, someone came in to announce that Miss Shi had arrived. Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps to welcome her. For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere months separation is an occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports, when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot, Xiang-yun should remove her Outer garments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused. Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I dont think Ive ever seen anyone wearing so much. Its my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all, said Xiang yun. You wouldnt catch me wearing this stuff if I didnt have to. You dont know our Xiang-yun, Aunt, Bao-chai interposed. Shes really happiest in boys clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yus gowns and put a pair of his boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, Bao-yu, come over here!
Instead you can pay her two taels and a string of cash a month out of my personal allowance of twenty taels. And in future, whatever arrangements are made about Aunt Zhaos and Aunt Zhous allowances, I want you to pay Aroma at exactly the same rate only whatever it is, its all to come out of my personal allowance. I dont want Accounts getting mixed up in this. Having promised to carry out these instructions, Xi-feng turned to Aunt Xue and nudged her playfully. There you are I What did I tell you? Its turned out exactly as I said. And so it should, said Aunt Xue warmly. It should have been done long ago. Shes a lovely girland it isnt only her looks Im referring to, either. She has such a generous, open way of doing things, and she is so polite and friendly to talk to. Theres a strong little will there, thoughplenty of determination underneath it all. Oh, I think shes a real treasure. She is a dear, good child, said Lady Wang. I dont think the rest of you realize just how good she is. Ten times better than my Bao-yu, thats quite certain. If Bao-yu can keep her with him always, hell he a very lucky boy. If you think that, Aunt, said Xi-feng, why not have her plucked and painted and make her his chamber-wife openly? No, it wouldnt do, said Lady Wang. First of all he is too young secondly Sir Zheng would never agree to it and in the third place, even if we allow a certain amount of freedom between them, as long as he still thinks of her as his maid, there is some chance that he will listen to what she says, but once we make her his chamber-wife, she will feel less free to tell him what she thinks of him when he is being silly. No, I think for the moment at any rate we should leave it a little vague. We can make a more definite arrangement in two or three years time. After pausing long enough to ascertain that Lady Wang had nothing more to say, Xi-feng turned and went. A group of stewards wives were waiting for her under the eaves in the narrow alley-way at the back to report to her on various household matters. They smiled at her as she emerged, and one of them chaffed her about the length of her visit. Youve been a long time today, Madam. What can you have been talking about to keep you so long? I hope you havent overheated yourself with so much talking! Xi-feng stood in the doorway in a very unladylike attitude, one foot on the threshold, rolling her sleeves back and smiling at no one in particular. Theres a nice little draught out here. I think Ill stand here for a bit and cool off. She turned to the women. Did you say Ive been a long time? Its hardly surprising. Today Her Ladyship has been asking about just about everything thats happened here during the past two hundred years. Her voice lost its jocular tone and became suddenly harsher. From now on if I ever feel like doing something really spiteful, I shall do it. Let her complain to Her Ladyship if she has a mind to, I dont care. Stupid woman I Stupid, chicken-witted, evil-tongued, snivelling, misbegotten bitch! She ought to wake up. One of these days theyll make a dean sweep and take the whole lot away then shell have something to shout about! Complain about me, would she, because her maids allowance has been cut? Who the Holy Name does she think she is? Shes only a bit of bought goods herself. Whats the likes of her doing with maids to wait on her any way? Leaving the stewardesses to make what they would of this explosion, she strode off to look for someone suitable to take a message in to Grandmother Jia. At which point we leave her. After Aunt Xue and the two girls had finished their watermelon, they sat talking for a few minutes longer with Lady Wang before leaving, Aunt Xue to return to her own apartment, Bao-chai and Dai-yu to go back into the Garden. Bao-chai invited Dai-yu to accompany her to the Lotus Pavilion to pay a call on Xi-chun, but Dai-yu said she was going to have a bath, and presently parted company with Bao-chai, leaving her to continue on her way there alone. Bao-chais route took her past the House of Green Delights, and as she drew near it, she thought she would call in to chat for a while with Bao-yu and help him to dispel the sleepiness of the early afternoon.
This time its led you into the reeds of the marshes. I suppose the Dragon King must have taken a fancy to you and carried you off to be his son-in-law. To judge from appearances, I should say that you -must have got caught up on his horn! Xue Pan wished that the earth would open and swallow up his shame. As there was clearly no question of getting him onto his horse, Jia Rong told one of the boys to hurry back to the street outside the North Gate and hire a carrying chair. When Xue Pan had been helped into this, they had him carried into the city, themselves accompanying him on horseback. Jia Rong mischievously proposed that they should take him back to the Lais house to rejoin the party but Xue Pan entreated so piteously and begged him so earnestly not to tell anyone of his plight, that Jia Rong relented and allowed him to go back home alone. Jia Rong himself returned to the party to report back to his father. From his account of the state Xue Pan had been in when they found him Cousin Zhen deduced that he must have been beaten up by Liu Xiang-lian but appeared remarkably unconcerned, for he merely laughed and observed that he could do with the lesson. It is true that he went to inquire after him in the evening, when he got back home from the party but Xue Pan was by that time nursing his injuries in bed and declined to see him on the grounds that he was feeling too ill. When Grandmother Jia and her party had got back to their several apartments, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai found Caltrop with her eyes all swollen from weeping. On discovering the cause, they rushed in to look at Xue Pan. Fortunately he appeared to have no bones broken, but his face and body had taken a terrible battering. Torn between maternal anguish at his plight and anger at the folly which had occasioned it, Aunt Xue inveighed against Xue Pan and Xiang-lian by turns. She wanted to tell Lady Wang and get her to have Xiang-lian arrested, but was dissuaded from doing so by Bao-chai. Its not important enough for that, Mamma. The two of them had been drinking and fell out over their cups, thats all there was to it. Whenever that happens, its always the drunker of the two who gets the worst of it. Besides, everyone knows what a lawless, ungovernable creature Pan is. Its only because youre his mother that you feel differently. If its satisfaction you want, that can easily be arranged. Just wait a few days until Pan is better and can get about again. Im sure Mr Zhen and Mr Lian and the other menfolk will be unwilling to pass over this in silence. Probably they will get up a little party and ask this person to it and make him apologize to Pan in front of everyone and admit that he was to blame. But if you insist on making an issue of it now and telling Aunt about it, you will make it appear that you are so blind to Pans faults that you allow him to go around provoking other people, but that as soon as someone stands up to him, you fly up in arms and use our relations influence to oppress them. -336 Aunt Xue at once saw the force of this. You are quite right, my child. I was being silly. Dear Mamma! But now you are being sensible. He doesnt fear you, and he wont listen to anyone else. He just goes on getting worse and worse. One or two good, sharp shocks like this might bring him to his senses. Meanwhile Xue Pan lay on the kang in his bedroom, cursing Xiang-lian by every name he could think of and calling on his boys to smash up his house, to beat him to death, to have the law on him. Aunt Xue shouted to them that they were to do no such thing. To Xue Pan she explained that Xiang-lian was in any case beyond the reach of his vengeance. Xiang-lian behaved very bad because he was drunk. When he came to himself afterwards he was very sorry and now, because he is afraid of the consequences, he has fled the country. When Xue Pan heard that, he But you shall learn that if you wish in the following chapter. CHAPTER 48 -214 The Love Deluded One turns his thoughts to trade and travel And the Poetry Enthusiast applies herself to making verses XUE PAN gradually calmed down when his mother told him that Xiang-lian had fled. After four or five days the pain of his injuries had subsided, but not the bumps and bruises and as, while these still disfigured him, he was unwilling to meet any of his acquaintance, he kept to his room on the pretext that he was still too ill to go out.
She was weeping now herself. Dont upset yourself, Mother, said Jia Zheng, with the same forced smile. I acted too hastily. From now on Ill never beat him again, if thats what you wish. Hoity-toity, keep your temper! said Grandmother Jia. Hes your son. If you want to beat him, thats up to you. If we women are in your way, well leave you alone to get on with it. She turned to her attendants. Call my carriage. Your Mistress and I and Bao-you are going back to Nanking. We shall be leaving immediately. The -servants made a show of compliance. No need for you to cry, she said, turning to Lady Wang. You love Bao-yu now that hes young, but when hes grown up and become an important official, hell like enough forget that youre his mother. Much better force yourself not to love him now and save yourself some anguish later on. Jia Zheng threw himself forward on his face. Dont say that, Mother! Dont reject your own son! On the contrary, said Grandmother Jia, it is you who have rejected me . But dont worry. When I have gone back to Nanking, there will be no one here to stop you. You can beat away to your hearts content. She turned to the servants. Come on, hurry up with that packing! And get the carriage and horses ready so that we can be on our way. Jia Zhengs kotows were by now describing the whole quarter circle from perpendicular to ground. But the old lady walked on inside, ignoring him. From the sight that met her eyes she could tell that this had been no ordinary beating. It filled her with anguish for the sufferer and fresh anger for the man who had inflicted it, and for a long time she clung to the inert form and wept, only gradually calming down under the combined coaxing of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Li Wan. At this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted to raise Bao-yu to his feet. Idiots! said Xi-feng. Havent you got eyes in your heads? Cant you see that hes in no fit state to walk? Go and get that wicker summer-bed from inside and carry him in on that. The servants rushed out and presently reappeared carrying a long, narrow couch of woven rattan between them, on to which they lifted Bao-yu. Then, with Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and the rest of the womenfolk leading the way, they carried him to Grandmother Jias apartment and set him down inside it. Jia Zheng, conscious that his mothers wrath against him had not abated and unwilling to leave things where they stood, had followed the little procession inside. His eyes travelled from Bao-yu, who, he now saw, really had been beaten very badly, to Lady Wang. She was sobbing bitterly, interspersing her sobs with cries of My child! and My son!. Presently she broke off and began railing at the object of her sorrow Why couldnt you have died instead of Zhu? Zhu wouldnt have made his father angry the way you do and I should have been spared this constant anxiety. What is to become of me if you go away and leave me, too? Then, with a cry of Poor, worthless boy!, she fell once more to weeping. When Jia Zheng heard this, his own heart was softened and he began to wish that he had not beaten the boy quite so savagely. He tried to find words of comfort for his old mother, but she answered him tearfully. A father ought to punish his son if hes done wrong, but not like that!Why dont you go now? Wont you be content until youve seen the boy die under your own eyes? Jia Zheng, with flustered deference, withdrew. By now Aunt Xue, Bao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and Shi Xiang-yun were there too. Aroma was deeply distressed, but could not show the extent of her feelings in the presence of so many others. Indeed, Bao-yu was so ringed around with people fanning him or forcing water through his lips that there was nothing she could have done for him if she had tried. Feeling somewhat superfluous, she left the apartment and went out to the inner gate, where she asked the pages to look for Tealeaf, so that she could find out what had happened. Why did the Master suddenly beat him like that? she asked Tealeaf when he arrived. He hadnt been doing anything. And why couldnt you have warned us in time? Tealeaf was indignant. I couldnt help it, I wasnt there. He was half-way through eating him before I even got to hear about it.
It took her in time to the courtyard wall of a house, but she could find no gate in it, and after wandering round a long while looking for one, she came upon a bamboo trellis, which she contemplated with some astonishment. Hmn. Bean-sticks. What are they doing here? The bean-sticks resolved themselves into a rose-covered pergola. After walking alongside it for a while, she came to a round moon-gate, which she entered. Ahead of her was a channel of crystal-clear water, five or six feet wide. Its banks were reinforced with stone, and a large, flat slab of white stone had been laid across it to make a bridge. After she had crossed the bridge there was a raised cobbled path which, after a couple of right-angled bends, brought her up to the door of the house. The first thing she saw on entering it was a young woman smiling at her in welcome. Grannie Liu smiled back. Im lost, miss. The young ladies have left me to find my own way and Ive wandered in here by mistake. Surprised that the girl did not reply, Grannie Thu stepped forward to take her hand and bang! hit her head a most painful thump on the wooden wall. The girl was a painting, as she found on closer inspection. Strange! she thought. How can they paint a picture so that it sticks out like that? Grannie Liu was ignorant of the foreign mode of light-and-shadow painting and was sorely puzzled to discover, on touching the picture, that it did not in fact stick out but was flat all over. Turning from it with a sigh and a shake of her head, she moved on to a little doorway in the wooden partition-wall, over which hung a green, flower-patterned portire. She raised the portiere and went inside. In the room she now entered everything, from the top of the surrounding walls, delicately incised with shapes of swords, vases, musical instruments, incense-burners and the like, to the lavish furnishing below, in which The weavers glowing art combined With gleam of gold and. orient pearl, and thence down to the very floor of brilliantly patterned green glazed tiles beneath her feet, was such as to make even more dazzled the eyes of an already intoxicated old woman. She looked for the way out - but where was it? To the left of her there was a bookcase, to the right a screen. She tried behind the screen. Ah, yes! There was the door. But there too, to her intense surprise, approaching her from the opposite direction and causing her a momentary palpitation of the heart, was another old woman, whom she took to be her old gossip from the village. What? are you here too? she asked her, I suppose you were wondering what had become of me these last few days. Well, it was neighbourly to come and look for me. Which of the young women brought you in? She noticed, with much amusement, that her old neighbours head was covered all over with flowers. Hoo! Youll catch it! Picking the flowers from their garden to put in your own hair. Well I never! The other merely grinned back at her and said nothing. Grannie Liu stretched out a hand to give her the touch of shame. The other old woman stretched her hand out too to stop her. After a. brief soundless skirmish, Grannie Liu managed to get her finger onto the other ones face. But no sooner had she done so than she recoiled in horror, for the cheek she touched was as cold and hard as a block of ice. Suddenly the truth dawned on her Ive heard of rich folks having what they call dressing mirrors in their houses. Mayhap Im standing in front of one of them and its myself Im looking at. She stretched out her hand again to feel and closely examined the surface. Yes, no doubt of it it was a mirror, let into the carved surface of the wooden partition. She laughed at her own error. Yes, but how do I get out of here? she thought, as she continued to finger the mirrors carved surround. Suddenly there was a loud clunk! which so frightened the old woman that for some moments she rolled her eyes in terror. The mirror mirror in fact a kind of door. It had a West Ocean mechanism by which it could be opened or closed, and Grannie Liu, in feeling around it, had accidentally touched the spring which had made the mirror slide back into the panelling, revealing the doorway underneath. Pleasantly surprised, she passed through the doorway into a room whose main feature was a rich and elegantly patterned bed. Now Grannie Liu was seven or eight parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking. Seeing a bed in front of her, she sat down on it gratefully, to rest her feet.
I want you to go to Miss Lins for me, he said. just see what shes doing, and if she asks about me, tell her Im all right. I cant go rushing in there bald-headed without a reason, said Skybright. Youd better give me some kind of a message, just to give me an excuse for going there. I have none to give, said Bao-yu. Well, give me something to take, then, said Skybright, or think of something I can ask her for. Otherwise it will look so silly. Bao-yu thought for a bit and then, reaching out and picking up two of his old handkerchiefs, he tossed them towards her with a smile. All right. Tell her I said you were to give her these. Thats an odd sort of present! said Skybright. Whats she going to do with a pair of your old handkerchiefs? Most likely shell think youre making-fun of her and get upset again. No she wont, said Bao-yu. Shell understand. Skybright-deemed it pointless to argue, so she picked up the handkerchiefs and went off to the Naiads House. Little Delicate, who was hanging some towels out to dry on the verandah railings, saw her enter the courtyard and attempted to wave her away. Shes gone to bed. Skybright ignored her and went on inside. The lamps had not been lit and the room was in almost total darkness. The voice of Dai-yu, lying awake in bed, spoke to her out of the shadows. Who is it? Skybright. What do you want? Master Bao has sent me with some handkerchiefs, Miss? Dai-yu seemed to hesitate. She -found the gift puzzling and was wondering what it could mean. I suppose they must be very good ones, she said. Probably someone gave them to him. Tell him to keep them and give them to some body else. I have no use for them just now myself. Skybright laughed. Theyre not new ones, Miss. Theyre two of his did, everyday ones. This was even more puzzling. Dai-yu thought very hard for some moments. Then suddenly, in a flash, she understood. Put them down. You may go now. Skybright did as she was bid and withdrew. All the way back to Green Delights she tried to make sense of what had happened, but it continued to mystify her. Meanwhile the message that eluded Skybright had thrown Dai-yu into a turmoil of conflicting emotions. I feel so happy, she thought, that in the midst of his own affliction he has been able to grasp the cause of all my trouble. And yet at the same time I am sad, she thought because how do I know that my trouble will end in the way I want it to? Actually, I feel rather amused, she thought. Fancy his sending a pair of old handkerchiefs like that! Suppose I hadnt understood what he was getting at? But I feel alarmed that he should be sending presents to me in secret. Oh, and I feel so ashamed when I think how I am forever crying and quarrelling, she thought, and all the time he has understood! And her thoughts carried her this way and that, until the ferment of excitement within her cried out to be expressed. Careless of what the maids might think, she called for a lamp, sat herself down at her desk, ground some ink, softened her brush, and proceeded to compose the following quatrains, using the handkerchiefs them-selves to write on 1 -907 Seeing my idle teats, you ask me why These foolish drops fall from my teeming eye Then know, your gift, being by the merfolk made, In mermans currency must be repaid. 2 -907 Jewelled drops by day in secret sorrow shed Or, in the night-time, in my wakeful bed, Lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain, Shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain. 3 -907 Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiads tears Each salty trace of them fast disappears. Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow Outside the window still her tear marks show. She had only half-filled the second handkerchief and was preparing to write another quatrain, when she became aware that her whole body was burning hot all over and her cheeks were afire. Going over to the dressing table, she removed the brocade cover from the mirror and peered into it. Hmn! Brighter than the peach-flowers hue, she murmured complacently to the flushed face that stared out at her from the glass, and, little imagining that what she had been witnessing was the first symptom of a serious illness, went back to bed, her mind full of handkerchiefs.
Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the invitation was from her brothers wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to. Wang Zi-tengs other. sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until the evening. Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wangs kang, called for a candle to be lit, and, with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and shortly after that informing G6lden ?hat she was standing in his light. The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no noticeall, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly counselled some restraint Try not to throw your weight about so! she said. Its silly to put peoples backs up. Jia Huan scowled angrily I know what Im doing, he said. Iont talk to me like a child! Youre friends with Bao-yu nowadays, arent you? You dont like me any more. I know. Ive watched you both. Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger You ungrateful thing! Youre like the dog that bit L Dong-bin you dont know a friend when you see one. They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink. In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few respectful words to his mother, asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mothers bosom to be fondled and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the days events. Youve been drinking again, child, said Lady Wang. Your face is burning. All this romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there! She made them bring him a head-rest. and he lay down behind her, towards the back of the kang. Sunset was instructed to massage him by gently patting his legs. He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you! He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp. If you do that again, she said, I shall call out! Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this flirting with Sunset his Sunsetwas the last straw. He must be revenged or burst. A moments reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight on to Bao-yus face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light Bao-yus face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did so Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not fit for decent company. I dont know why Aunt Zhao hasnt taught you better. Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed all her wrath upon that luckless concubine This is a fine son you bore us, I must say!
Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she recognized Melilot, a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself. Yes, Im in, she said. Come inside! Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle. Im in luck I she said. I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked for some tea to be taken round to Miss Lins for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job of taking it. When I got there, Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids, so when she saw me she just said Here you are! and gave me two big handfuls of it. Ive no idea how much it is. Will you look after it for me, please? She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins. Crimson carefully counted them for her and put them away in a safe place. Whats been the matter with you lately? said Melilot. If you ask me, 1 think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor. I expect you need some medicine. Silly! said Crimson. Im perfectly all right. What should I want to go home for? I know what, then, said Melilot. Miss Lins very weakly. Shes always taking medicine. Why dont you ask her to give you some of hers? It would probably do just as well. Oh, nonsense! said Crimson. You cant take other peoples medicines just like that! Well, you cant go on in this way, said Melilot, never eating or drinking properly. What will become of you? Who cares? said Crimson. The sooner Im dead the better! You shouldnt say such things, said Melilot, It isnt right. Why not? said Crimson. How do you know what is on my mind? Melilot sho6k her head sympathetically. I cant say I really blame you, she said. Things are very difficult here at times. Take yesterday, for example. Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery, all those who had the trouble of nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades. Well now, I can understand the very young ones like me not being included, but why should they leave you out? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that theyd left you out. Aroma, of course, youd expect to get more than anyone else. I dont blame her at all. In fact, I think its owing to her. Lets be honest none of us can compare with Aroma. I mean, even if she didnt always take so much trouble over everything, no one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share. What makes me so angry is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when everyone knows theyre only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu. Doesnt it make you angry? I dont see much point in getting angry, said Crimson. You know what they said about the mile-wide marquee Even the longest party must have an end? Well, none of us is here for ever, you know. Another four or five years from now when weve each gone our different ways it wont matter any longer what all the rest of us are doing. Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes. She thought shame to cry without good cause, however, and masked her emotion with a smile Thats perfectly true. Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things hes going to do to his rooms and the clothes hes going to have made and everything, just as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in. Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilots simplicity or at Bao-yus improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girls horns. She was carrying some patterns and sheet of paper. Youre to copy out these two patterns. She threw them in Crimsons direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson shouted after her Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off. What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for you and youre afraid theyll get cold? Theyre for Mackerel. The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam, plim-plam, pimpam, as fast as she had come.
I think youll find that besides the old rose pieces you saw in that chest, theres a lot of clear-sky blue somewhere as well. If there is, get it all out give a length of it to our kinswoman here I should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings and any left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats for the girls. Theres no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed. Xi-feng, having first promised that she would do all these things, told the servant who had brought the sample to take it back to the storeroom. Were a bit cramped in here, said Grandmother Jia. Lets move on to somewhere else now. They say that great families live in great houses, said Grannie Liu, and truly, when I first went into Your Ladyships apartment yesterday and saw those great chests and cupboards and tables and beds, the size of everything fairly took my breath away. That great wardrobe of yours is higher and wider than one of our rooms back home. Im not surprised you keep a ladder in the back courtyard. When I first saw it, I thought to myself, Now what can they need a ladder for? They dont ripen things on the roofs as we do, so it cant be for that. And then of course I realized it must be for getting things out of the compartment on top of that ward-robe of yours, for you could never reach it else. And yet this place here, for all its so much smaller, seems to me more perfect than your big one. The things here are all so pretty. I dont know what they are, some of them, but the more I look at them, the less I want to leave! There are other pretty places besides this, said Xi-feng. Were taking you to see them all. As they left the Naiads House, they could make out, at some distance from where they stood, a number of people punting on the lake. Remarking that since the boats were already out they might just as well use them, Grandmother Jia conducted her little party in the general direction of Amaryllis Eyot and Flowery Harbour. Before they had reached the waters edge, however, a number of elderly women approached, each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they make in Soochow, with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately patterned in needle-engraving of gold, and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in their sides. Seeing them approach, Xi-feng asked Lady Wang where she wanted lunch to be laid. Ask Grandmother, said Lady Wang. Wherever she wants it, of course. Grandmother Jia, who had been moving on, now turned back to tell them. Your Cousin Tans would be a nice place to have it. You go on ahead and lay it there, and the rest of us will follow by boat. Xi-feng, accompanied by Li Wan, Tan-chun, Faithful and Amber, led the women with the lunch-boxes by a short cut to the Autumn Studio. They put Out a couple of tables there in the Paulownia Room. Were often hearing how the gentlemen at their parties outside have a buffoon to provide them with their laughs, said Faithful while they were getting ready. Today weve got a buffoon of our owna female one. Li Wan, being a good, simple soul, did not understand what she meant but Xi-feng knew immediately that she was referring to Grannie Liu and gleefully agreeing that they should have some laughs at the old womans expense, at once began plotting something with Faithful. You two are awful! Li Wan protested laughingly. Anyone would think you were a couple of mischievous children. And what will Lady Jia say? Dont worry, Mrs Zhu! said Faithful. You wont be involved in this one little bit. I promise to keep you out of it. Grandmother Jia now arrived with the others, the company sat down informally, and maids went round and served every one with tea. When they had all finished their tea, Xi-feng came in carrying a bundle of silver-tipped and silver-ornamented ebony chopsticks wrapped in a West Ocean linen napkin, and proceeded to lay the places. Put that little yellow cedar-wood table next to my place so that Mrs Liu can sit by me, said Grandmother Jia. As the maids hastened to comply, Xi-feng tipped a wink at Faithful, who took the opportunity presented by this diversion to draw Grannie Lu aside and quietly brief her on the decorums to be observed by anyone eating with the family. Its part of the rules of this household, she told tile old woman in conclusion.
Bao-chai asked Xiang-yuns nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing. I dont mind her being tomboyish, said Ying-chun, but I do wish she wasnt such a chatterbox. You wouldnt believe Iteven when shes in bed at night it still goes on. Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber. Then she laughs. Then she talks a bit more. Then she laughs again. And you never heard such a lot of rubbish in your life, I dont know where she gets it all from. Well, perhaps shell have got over that by now, said Lady Wang. I hear that someone was round the other day to talk about a betrothal. Now that theres a future mother-in-law to think about, she cant be quite as tomboyish as she used to be. Are you staying this time, or do you have to go back tonight? asked Grandmother Jia. Your Old Ladyship hasnt seen all the clothes shes brought, said Nurse Zhou. Shell be staying two days here at the very least. Isnt Bao at home? said Xiang-yun. Listen to her! said Bao-chai. Cousin Bao is the only one she thinks about. He and she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief. You can see she hasnt really changed. Perhaps now that youre getting older you had better stop using baby-names, said Grandmother Jia, reminded by the talk of betrothal that her babies were rapidly turning into grown-ups. Just then Bao-yu came in. Ah! Hallo, Yun! Why didnt you come when we sent for you the other day? Grandmother has just this moment been saying that it is time you all stopped using baby-names, said Lady Wang. I must say, this isnt a very good beginning. Our cousin has got something nice to give you, said Dai-yu to Xiang-yun. Oh? what is it? said Xiang-yun. Dont believe her, said Bao-yu. Goodness! Its no time since you were here last, but you seem to have grown taller already. Xiang-yun laughed. Hows Aroma? Shes fine. Thank you for asking. Ive brought something for her, said Xiang-yun. She produced a knotted-up silk handkerchief. What treasure have you got wrapped up in there? said Bao-yu. The best present you could have brought Aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings like the ones you sent us the other day. What are these, then? With a triumphant smile she opened her little bundle and revealed four rings, each inset with the veined red agate they had so much admired on a previous occasion. What a girl! said Dai-yu. These are exactly the same as the ones you sent us the other day by messenger. why didnt you get him to bring these too and save yourself some trouble? I thought you must have got some wonderful rarity tied up in that handkerchief, seeing that youd gone to all the trouble of bringing it here yourselfand all the time it was only a few more of those! You really are rather a silly. Thilly yourthelf! said Xiang-yun. The others can decide which of us is the silly one when I have explained my reason. If I send things for you and the girls, its assumed that they are for you without the messenger even needing to say anything but if I send things for any of the maids, I have to explain very carefully to the messenger which ones I mean. Now if the messenger is someone intelligent, thats all right but if its someone not so bright who has difficulty in remembering names, theyll probably make such a mess of it that theyll get not only the maids presents mixed up, but yours as well. Then again, if the messenger is a woman, its not so bad but the other day it was one of the boys - and you know how hopeless they are over girls names. So you see, I thought it would be simpler if I delivered the maids ones myself. There!she laid the rings down one after another on the tableOne for Aroma one for Faithful one for Golden and one for Patience. Can you imagine one of the boys getting those four names right ? The others laughed. Clever! Clever! they said. Youre always so eloquent, said Bao-yu. No one else gets a chance. If she werent so eloquent, she wouldnt be worthy of the gold kylin, said Dai-yu huffily, rising from her seat and walking off as she spoke.
Xi-feng and the rest rose to greet her. They begged her to be seated and offered her their congratulations. The old woman sat down on the edge of the kang and smiled round at them with pleasure. The way I see it, since you are our employers, our good fortune is really yours. If it werent for your family, how would the likes of us ever have come by a piece of good fortune like this in the first place? Yesterday when you sent young Sunshine round with those presents, my grandson kotowed upwards. in the doorway to show his gratitude. When will he be leaving to take up his post? said Li Wan. Old Mrs Lai sighed, as though the thought made her melancholy. Oh, I dont concern myself with their affairs. I just let them get on with it. When he came round to me to kotow the other day, I didnt have a good word for him. I said to him, Young man, dont tell me youre a mandarin now, because its just plain ridiculous. Thirty years it is since you were born, I said, and all that time, in actual fact, youve been a bondservant. Yet through the kindness of our Masters you were set apart from the moment you came out of your mothers womb. Thanks to the Masters and your parents, I said, you were taught to read and write like a gentlemans son and fussed over by a parcel of maids and nannies and wet-nurses as if you was some sort of young phoenix. I doubt you know how the word bondservant is written. Youve known nothing but soft living since you were born, I said. You dont know the bitterness your father and your grandfather had to go through. You dont appreciate the generations of hardship that went into the making of a fine gentleman like you. And the money they spent on you, I said nursing you through all the fevers and calamities of youth for you were a sickly, ailing child it would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver Then, when you were twenty, the Master, out of the kindness of his heart, undertook to buy you a place in the Service, so that your future would be assured. Think how many freeborn members of the clan go hungry, I said, yet be did this fox you, that was born a slave. Such great fortune should make you fearful. And now, after ten years of fooling around, youve talked the Masterby what jiggery-pokery I do not know -into getting you selected for a posting. A district magistrate may not be very high in the scale, I said, but the mandarin who goes to a district to be its magistrate is supposed to be the father and mother of all the people who live there. So mind you dont go getting above yourself, I said. Do all in your power to show that you are worthy of the trust. And always let the Master see how much you appreciate what he has done for you. Otherwise Heaven will surely cast you off. Li Wan and Xi-feng both laughed. You worry too much, Mrs Lai, said Xi-feng. Hes all right. Its true we dont see much of him nowadays. He used to come in once in a while, but these last few years all weve seen of him has been his visiting-card at New Years and birthdays. He did come in the other day, however, to kotow to Her Old Ladyship and Lady Wang. We saw him in Hei Old Ladyships courtyard, dressed in his new uniform. He looked very imposing. A little bit fatter than he used to be. You ought to be happy now that hes a mandarin, not making yourself miserable with all this worrying about him. Even if he doesnt behave himself, I should leave his parents to do the wolrying. All you have to do now is sit back and enjoy your-self. If ever youre at a loose end, you can always jump in your chair and have yourself carried round here for a game of cards and a chat with Her Old Ladyship. Im sure no one here would dream of making you feel uncomfortable. After all, youve got upstairs and downstairs and halls and reception-rooms back home just the same as we have. Youre as good as any lady in the land now, you know. Im sure you will be respected as such. Mrs Lai hurriedly rose to her feet as Patience came up to pour tea for her. You shouldnt do that, miss. You should let one of the younger ones do it. Taint right you should pour for me. Sitting down again she continued to hold forth between sips. You dont know that boy, Mrs Lian. Hes like all young people you have to be strict with them all the time.
The painting was on the wall, masked by a covering of gauze. The cousins woke up Xi-chun and removed the cover from the painting. Barely three-tenths of it had been completed. Several female figures were to be seen scattered about here and there in the landscape. Look, they said, pointing them out to Caltrop, anyone who can write poetry gets put into the picture. You must hurry up and learn, so that she can put you in too! After chatting and joking for a while, they broke up and went off to their several apartments. Caltrop could think of nothing else but her poem. in the evening she sat by the lamp thinking about it, and it was after midnight when she went to bed. Even in bed she lay with her eyes wide open, continuing to think about it and it was not until three or four in the morning that she gradually dropped off to sleep. At daybreak Bao-chai woke up and listened Caltrop appeared to be fast asleep. She was tossing about all night, thought Bao-chai. I wonder if she managed to finish her poem. I wont call her now she must be exhausted. Just then she heard Caltrop laugh and call out in her sleep Ha! Got it! Let her try saying that this one isnt any good! Bao-chai was both touched and amused. What have you got? she asked, quickly waking her. This poetry business is becoming positively unnatural! I dont know about learning how to write poetry what youll likelier get, if you go on much longer in this fashion, is a serious illness! The intensity of Caltrops application had, in fact, induced a concentration of the vital fluids which, finding no outlet during the daytime, had resulted in her being able to produce a whole eight4ine poem in her sleep. She wrote it down as soon as she had combed and washed, and then went out to look for the others. At Drenched Blossoms, in the little pavilion on the bridge, she came upon Li Wan and the cousins on the way back from their morning duty-call on Lady Wang. Bao-chai was just telling them how Caltrop had composed a poem while she was dreaming and how she had cried out in her sleep, and the others were laughing as they listened. When they looked up and saw Caltrop herself approaching them, they eagerly asked her if they might see her poem. For further details, please see the following chapter.
There were three generations of the family above me when I came to this household as a young bride, and now there are three generations below me, and Ive seen many shocking and many wicked and many peculiar things during the fifty-four years since first I came here, but this sort of thing is simply outside my experience. Now be off with you! Jia Lian bolted, not daring to say a word. Patience, who had been standing meanwhile outside the window, quietly mocked him as he came out I told you so, but you wouldnt listen. You walked straight into the net, didnt you? Just at that moment Lady Xing came out. This is all Fathers doing, said Jia Lian. Now we have to face the consequences. Unfilial wretch I said Lady Xing. Some people would die for their fathers, but you a few harmless words and you are already whining and complaining. Whats the matter with you? You havent been hurt yetthough I should look out, if I were you Fathers been pretty angry these last few days. Come on, you must hurry back, Mother, said Jia Lian. He sent me to fetch you a long time ago. He saw his mother out of the main part of the mansion and round to Jia Shes quarters next door. Lady Xing then gave her husband, in briefest possible outline, a report of what had happened and since it was now evident that nothing more could be done about Faithful, Jia She had to put up with his mortification as best he could. He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls on her in his stead. Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our story. The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up. Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record. -347 The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Das wife came round once more to renew her invitation. Grandmother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part of the day in the Lai familys private garden. Lai Das garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty. The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer part of the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias. One of these last was a young gentleman called Liu Xianglian whom Xue Pan had met on some previous occasion and hankeringly remembered ever since. The discovery that he was a keen amateur actor one, moreover, who specialized in romantic roles had led Xue Pan to jump to the wrong conclusion and assume that he must share the same wind and moonlight proclivities as himself. Eager to make his closer acquaintance but hitherto denied any opportunity of doing so, he was overjoyed at finding him among the company on this occasion and consequently in a state of excitement which rendered his behaviour extremely unpredictable. Cousin Zhen had also heard of Liu Xiang-lian and admired him. Today, under pretext of being a little drunk, he had taken the liberty of asking him to perform for them, and Liu Xiang-lian, supported by the hired professional players, had obliged by appearing on the stage in two operatic numbers. When he rejoined the company, Xue Pan took the opportunity of moving over to his table and began plying him with all sorts of questions and insinuations. Liu Xiang-lian was a young man of excellent family who, having lost both his parents in early youth, had failed to complete his education. He was of a dashing, impulsive nature, impatient of niceties. His chief pleasures were exercising with spear or sabre, drinking, and gambling but he was not averse to gentler pastimes he frequented the budding groves and could play on both the flute and the zither. Because he was so young and handsome, many who did not know him mistakenly supposed that, being an actor, he must have the usual actors propensities.
I was just sending her off to do that when you came, said Bao-chai. Well, you can leave nr out, Patience told Caltrop. Mr Lian is ill at home in bed. Caltrop murmured a reply and went off to make her calls, beginning with Grandmother Jia. As soon as she had gone, Patience -seized Bao-chais hand and asked her, in a low and urgent voice, whether she had heard their news. No, said Bao-chai. Ive been so busy these last few days helping to get Pan off that I havent heard anyones news. I havent even seen any of the girls during the past day or two. Sir She has beaten Mr Lian so badly that he can hardly move. Do you mean to say you havent even heard that? I heard something to that effect, said Bao-chai, but I didnt know whether to believe it or not. Id been thinking of going to ask your mistress about it when you came in just now. What did he beat him for? It was that toad Jia Yu-cuns doing, said Patience bitterly. Horrible man! It was a bad day for this family when they got to know him. I don t know how much trouble he hasnt stirred up in the few years since first he came here. Last spring Sir She saw some antique fans somewhere which so impressed him that when he got home and looked at his own collection he decided that they were all no good and at once sent everyone scouring around for some mote. Now there was a certain poor, unlucky devil they call Stonythats a nickname, of course I dont know what his real name isso hard up that he never had enough to eat but who, it go happened, was the owner of a collection of twenty antique fans that he guarded very closely, not even allowing them to be taken out of his door. Mr Lian had a terrible job even getting to see this man. In the end he did though, and eventually, after a great deal of persuasion, managed to get himself invited into the house to have a look at the fans. Mr Lian said he was only allowed a glimpse of them even then, but he said you could see at once that they were the kind of fans that simply cant be had anywhere today. The fansticks were made of very special kinds of bamboonaiads tears, black bamboo, fawnskin and jadewoodand the paintings on them were all by old masters. When he told Sir She about them, Sir She said at once that come what may he must have them and that Stony could name his price. But Stony didnt want a price not if they offered him a thousand taels a fan, he said. He said he would rather die of hunger and cold than sell them. There was nothing Sir She could do about that, of course, except swear all the -time at Mr Lian for being incompetent. But I ask you, Miss Mr Lian had already promised five hundred taels cash down and still old Stony had refused, so what more was there he could do? The matter might have rested there if that black-hearted villain Jia Yu-cun hadnt got to hear about it. He soon thought of a way. He made out that Stony owed the government some money, had him hauled off to the yamen, and when he got there, told him they would have to detrain on his property to pay off the debt. Then he sent his officers round to Stonys house, seized the fans, valued them at a government price, and sent them to Sir She as a present. Poor old Stony! I dont know whether hes alive now or dead. What I do know is that when Sir She was telling Mr Lian how he had come by the fans at last, Mr Lian couldnt help remarking that he didnt see anything very competent about ruining a man and stripping him of all he possessed for so trifling a reason. That made Sir She very angry, because of course he assumed that Mr Lian was really getting at him. That was the main reason for the beating but then there were a number of smaller things a few days laterI dont even remember now what they were. They seem to have brought things to a head, because he suddenly went for him. He didnt pull him down and beat him with a flat-stick or a cudgel in the normal way either he just picked up the first thing that came to handI dont know what it wasand started hitting him with it where he stood. He cut his face open in two places. We heard that Mrs Xue has got some kind of lotion for injuries of this sort and I wondered if youd mind letting me have a tablet. Bao-chai at once sent Oriole for the tablets and told her to bring two of them.
Two will be enough, said Aroma, otherwise it will only get wasted. If we run Out, I can always come back for more later. Suncloud was gone for a considerable time. Eventually she returned with two little glass bottles, each about three inches high, which she handed to Aroma. They had screw on silver tops and yellow labels. One of-them was labelled Essence of Cassia Flower and the other one Essence of Roses. What tiny little bottles! said Aroma. They cant hold very much. I suppose the stuff inside them must be very precious. It was made specially for the Emperor, said Lady Wang. Thats what the yellow labels mean. Havent you seen labels like that before? Mind you look after them and dont let the stuff in them get wasted. Aroma promised -to be careful and began to go. Just a minute! said Lady Wang. Ive thought of some-thing else that I wanted to ask you. Aroma returned. Lady Wang first glanced about her to make sure that no one else was in the room, then she said I think I heard someone say that Bao-yus beating today was because of something that Huan had said to Sir Zheng. I suppose you dont happen to have heard anything about that? No. I havent heard anything about that, said Aroma. What I heard was that it was because Master Bao had been going around with one of Prince Somebody or others players and the Master was told about it by someone who called. Lady Wang nodded her head mysteriously. Yes, that was one of the reasons. But -there was another reason as well. I really know nothing about any other reason, Your Ladyship, said Aroma. She dropped her head and hesitated a moment before going on. I wonder if I might be rather bold and say something very outspoken to Your Ladyship? Really and truly She faltered. Please go on. I will if Your Ladyship will promise not to he angry with me. Thats all right, said Lady Wang. Just tell me what you have to say. Well, really and truly, said Aroma, Master Bao needed punishing. If the Master didnt keep an eye on him, theres no knowing what he mightnt get up to. My child, said Lady Wang with a warmth rarely seen in her, those are exactly my own sentiments. How clever of you to have understood! Of course, I know perfectly well that Bao-yu is in need of discipline and anyone who saw how strict I used to be with Mr Zhu would realize that I am capable of exercising it. But I have my reasons. A woman of fifty cannot expect to bear any more children and Bao-yu is now the only son I have. He is not a very strong boy and his Grannie dotes on him. I darent risk being strict. I darent risk losing another son. I darent risk angering Her Old Ladyship and upsetting the whole household. I do once in a while have it out with him but though I have argued and pleaded and wept, it doesnt do any good. He seems all right at the time, but hell be just the same again a short while afterwards and I always know that I have failed to reach him. Jam afraid he has to suffer before he can learn but suppose its too much for him? suppose he doesnt get over this beating? What will become of me? She began to cry. Seeing her mistress so distressed, Aroma herself was affected and began to cry too. I can understand Your Ladyship being so upset, she said, when hes your own son. Even we servants that have been with him for a few years get worried about him. The most that we can ever hope for is to do our duty and get by without too much trouble but even that wont be possible if he goes on the way he has been doing. Im always telling him to change his ways. Every day every hour I tell him. But its no use he wont listen. Of course, if these people will make so much fuss of him, you can hardly blame him for going round with them though it does make our job more difficult. But now that Your Ladyship has spoken like this, it puts me in mind of something thats been worrying me which I should like to have asked Your Ladyships advice about, only I was afraid you might take it amiss, and then not only should I have spoken to no purpose, but I should leave myself without even a grave to lie in... It was evident to Lady Wang that what she was struggling to get out was a matter of some consequence. What is it you want to tell me, my child? she said kindly. Ive heard a lot of people praising you recently, and I confess that I assumed it must be because you took special pains in serving Bao-yu or in making yourself agreeable to other peoplelittle things of that sort.
Let us now return from the contemplation of inner thoughts to the recording of outward appearances. When Dai-yu, far from saying something nice to him, once mote made reference to the gold and jade, Bao-yu became so choked with rage that for a moment he was quite literally bereft of speech. Frenziedly snatching the Magic Jade from his neck and holding it by the end of its silken cord he gritted his teeth and dashed it against the floor with all the strength in his body. Beastly thing! he shouted. Ill smash you to pieces and put an end to this once and for all. But the jade, being exceptionally hard and resistant, was not the tiniest bit damaged. Seeing that he had not broken it, Bao-yu began to look around for something to smash it with. Dai-yu, still crying, saw what he was going to do. Why smash a dumb, lifeless object? she said. If you want to smash something, let it be me. The sound of their quarrelling brought Nightingale and Snowgoose hurrying in to keep the peace. They found Bao-yu apparently bent on destroying his jade and tried to wrest it from him. Failing to do so, and sensing that the quarrel was of more than usual dimensions, they went off to fetch Aroma. Aroma came back with them as fast as she could run and eventually succeeded in prising the jade from his hand. He glared at her scornfully. Its my own thing Im smashing, he said. What business is it of yours to interfere? Aroma saw that his face was white with anger and his eyes wild and dangerous. Never had she seen him in so terrible a rage. She took him gently by the hand You shouldnt smash the jade just because of a disagreement with your cousin, she said. What do you think she would feel like and what sort of position would it put her in if you really were to break it? Dai-yu heard these words through her sobs. They struck a responsive chord in her breast, and she wept all the harder to think that even Aroma seemed to understand her better than Bao-yu did. So much emotion was too much for her weak stomach. Suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia leaves she had taken only a short while before. Nightingale quickly held out her handkerchief to receive it and, while Snowgoose rubbed and pounded her back, Dai-yu continued to retch up wave upon wave of watery vomit, until the whole handkerchief was soaked with It. However cross you may be, Miss, you ought to have more regard for your health, said Nightingale. Youd only just taken that medicine and you were beginning to feel a little bit better for it, and now because of your argument with Master Bao youve gone and brought it all up again. Suppose you were to be really ill as a consequence. How do you think Master Bao would feel? When Bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast, and he reflected bitterly that even Nightingale seemed to understand him better than Dai-yu But then he looked again at Dai-yu, who was sobbing and panting by turns, and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspiration and tears, and seeing how pitiably frail and ill she looked, his heart misgave him. I shouldnt have taken her up on that gold and jade business, he thought. Ive got her into this state and now theres no way in which I can relieve her by sharing what she suffers. As he thought this, he, too, began to cry. Now that Bao-yu and Dai-yu were both crying, Aroma instinctively drew towards her master to comfort him. A pang of pity for him passed through her and she squeezed his hand sympathetically. It was as cold as ice. She would have liked to tell him not to cry but hesitated, partly from the consideration that he might be suffering from some deep-concealed hurt which crying would do something to relieve, and partly from the fear that to do so in Dai-yus presence might seem presumptuous. Torn between a desire to speak and fear of the possible consequences of speaking, she did what girls of her type often do when faced with a difficult decision she avoided the necessity of making one by bursting into tears. As for Nightingale, who had disposed of the handkerchief of vomited tisane and was now gently fanning her mistress with her fan, seeing the other three all standing there as quiet as mice with the tears streaming down their faces, she was so affected by the sight that she too started crying and was obliged to have recourse to a second handkerchief.
Red four on the right and the ace is red, said Faithful. A turnip and a garlic-head. More laughter. That Flower those three together show, said Faithful. This flower will to a pumpkin grow, said the flower-bedecked ancient, gesturing with her hands to demonstrate the size of the imagined pumpkin. The following chapter will show how the party progressed. CHAPTER 41 Jia Bao-yu tastes some superior tea at Green Bower Hermitage And Grannie Liu samples the sleeping accommodation at Green Delights THIS flower will to a pumpkin grow. As Granule Liu of the flower-studded hair said this, gesturing with her hands to suggest the size of the full-grown pump-kin, a shout of laughter rose from all those present. She drank the pass cup. To be truthful, she said, aiming for another laugh, Im but a clumsy body at the best of times, and having drunk so much, Im scared of breaking this pretty cup youve given me. You should have given me a wooden one then if I dropped it, it wouldnt matter. The others laughed but xi-feng pretended to take her seriously If you really want a wooden cup to drink out of I can find you one. But Id better warn you. The wooden ones arent like these porcelain ones they come in sets of different sizes, and if we get them out for you, youll have to drink out of every one in the set. Granule Liu calculated. I was only joking, she thought. I didnt think theyd really have any. When Ive dined with the gentry back home, Ive seen many a gold and silver cup in their houses, but never a wooden one. I expect these will be wooden bowls that the children use. Its a trick to make me drink a lot. Well, never mind. This stuffs not much more than sugared water anyway. It can do me no harm if I drink a bit extra. Having so reflected, she made reply Very well. Lets see them first though. Go to the inner room of the front apartment, Xi-feng told Felicity, and fetch me that set of ten winecups on the bookcasethe ones carved Out of bamboo root. But before Felicity could go on her errand, Faithful made a counter-proposal I know that set of yours theyre not very big cups, and in any case, you promised her wooden ones and yours are only made of bamboo. Much better give her ten boxwood ones and make her drink out of Them. All right, said Xi-feng. Better still. So Faithful sent someone to fetch them. The sight of these cups when they arrived both alarmed and delighted Grannie Liu. What alarmed her was their size. The largest was as big as a small hand-basin and even the smallest one was twice as big as the cup she held in her hand. What delighted her was the consummate artistry of the carving. On each of the ten cups, in smaller and smaller replicas, was the same landscape with little trees and human figures in it and even some lines of minute grass character writing and a tiny carved representation of an artists seal. Ill take the smallest one, she said hurriedly. Oh no! said Xi-feng, smiling. These cups have never been used before, because up to now weve never found anyone with a big enough capacity to drink from them. Now that youve asked for them and weve been to the trouble of getting them out for you, we must insist on your drinking from every one of them. I couldnt, said Grannie Lin in a panic. Please, Mrs Lian, dont make me! Grandmother Jia, Aunt Xue and Lady Wang all realized that a person of Grannie Lius advanced years could not p05sibly be expected to imbibe so huge a quantity of liquor without the direst consequences, and laughingly pleaded for her. Come now, a joke is a joke. You mustnt make her drink too much. Let her just drink from the largest one. Holy name! said Grannie Liu. Cant I just drink from the smallest one, like I said? I can take the largest one home with me and drink it up by degrees. The others laughed. Faithful, obliged to relent, ordered one of the larger, but not the largest cup to be filled, and Grannie Liu, holding it in both her hands, began to drink. Drink it slowly, now, Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue counselled her. Dont make yourself choke. Aunt Xue told Xi-feng to offer the old woman something to eat with her bowlful. What would you like, Grannie ? said Xi-feng. Just name it and Ill feed you some.
-320 Faithful took up the cards with a laugh. No, only Mrs Lian hasnt paid up yet. Oh, hasnt she? said Grandmother Jia. Shell be lucky if she gets away with that! She called one of the junior maids to her. Take that string of cash from in front of Mrs Lian and bring it here. -320 The little maid did as she was bid -and laid the money on the table beside Grandmother Jia. Please let me have it back, Xi-feng pleaded, so that I can give you the right amount. Feng really is rather mean, said Aunt Xue jokingly. Its only a game, after all. Xi-feng stood up and, laying a hand on Aunt Xues arm, pointed out to her the wooden chest in which Grandmother Jia kept her money. You see that, Aunt? I dont know how much of my money has at one time or another found its way in there. Before Ive been playing half an hour, my money in the chest begins calling to my money on the table to come and join it. All I have to do now is wait until its called it all in, then the game will be over and Grannie will be in a good temper again and I shall be able to go and get on with my work. By the time she had finished -saying this, Grandmother Jia and all the others present were laughing. They were still laughing when Patience, fearing that her mistress might have insufficient money by her, came in bringing another string of cash. Dont put it down in front of me, Xi-feng told her. Put it down beside Her Old Ladyship, so that all my money can go into the chest together. We dont want the money in the chest to have to go through the -business of calling for it all over again. This made Grandmother Jia laugh so much that she scattered the cards she was holding all over the table. Tear her mouth! she said to Faithful, giving her a playful push. Patience laid the money down as she was bidden, and after laughing a while with the others, went out again. On her way out of the courtyard she ran into Jia Lian, who was just about to enter the gate. Wheres Lady Xing? he asked her. Sir She has sent me to look for her. Shes been standing in there with Her Old Ladyship for the last half hour, said Patience. She hasnt dared to move yet, but I dare say shell get away as soon as she can. Her Old Ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning, but thanks to the Mistress, whos been all this time humouring her, shes gradually beginning to calm down a bit. Oh well, when I go in I shall say that Ive come to find out if Her Old Ladyship is going to Lai Das place on the fourteenth, so that I know whether or not to have the carriages ready, said Jia Lian. I can mention that Lady Xing is wanted as an afterthought. And after that perhaps I shall stay on and chaff the old lady a bit for a few minutes. That should he all right, shouldnt it? If youre asking my opinion, I think youd do much better not to go in at all, said Patience. Everyones been in trouble with her today even Her Ladyship and Bao-yu. If you go in now, youll walk straight into it. Oh, surely its all over now, isnt it? said Jia Lian. Surely shes not going to start all over again? Its nothing to do with me, in any case. And Sir She did ask me to go and fetch Mother myself. If he finds that Ive sent someone else to do it, hes in such a bad temper already, that hell probably use that as an excuse to take it out on me. He began to go in, and Patience, to whom this sounded reasonable enough, turned back and followed him in across the courtyard. Entering Grandmother Jias outer door, Jia Lian crossed the reception room on tiptoe and peered into the inner room at the back. He could see his mother standing there. Xi-feng, who had sharper eyes than the rest, spotted him at once and made a sign to him not to enter and another sign to Lady Xing indicating that she was wanted outside. Lady Xing could not simply walk out, so she filled a cup with some tea and set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. This caused the old lady to turn round and as Jia Lian chanced at that very moment to be looking in at the doorway and was unable to withdraw his head in time, she caught a momentary glimpse of him before he disappeared.
I know. Ive watched you both. Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger You ungrateful thing! Youre like the dog that bit L Dong-bin you dont know a friend when you see one. They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink. In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few respectful words to his mother, asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mothers bosom to be fondled and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the days events. Youve been drinking again, child, said Lady Wang. Your face is burning. All this romping about will make you sick. Lie down quietly for a while over there! She made them bring him a head-rest. and he lay down behind her, towards the back of the kang. Sunset was instructed to massage him by gently patting his legs. He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him, but she barely acknowledged his questions and answered frigidly, directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia Huan. Bao-yu seized her hand Come, my dear! You must take notice of me if I speak to you! He tugged at her hand as he spoke, but she snatched it from his grasp. If you do that again, she said, I shall call out! Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this flirting with Sunset his Sunsetwas the last straw. He must be revenged or burst. A moments reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight on to Bao-yus face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light Bao-yus face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did so Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not fit for decent company. I dont know why Aunt Zhao hasnt taught you better. Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed all her wrath upon that luckless concubine This is a fine son you bore us, I must say! He is a black-hearted little monster! You might at least try to teach him better. But no. Time and again I have overlooked this sort of thing, but instead of feeling sorry, you glory in it. You think that when I do nothing, you have got the better of me. Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence. She climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured boy. She looked at his face. The whole left side of it was badly blistered. It was a wonder that the eye had not been damaged. When Lady Wang saw it, she was both full of anguish for her son and at the same time, when she thought of the questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother jia and wondered what she would say, terrified on her own account. To relieve her fear she turned once more on Aunt Zhao. Then, after tongue-lashing the concubine, she comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part of his face. It does hurt a bit, said Bao-yu when she asked him, but nothing very terrible. When Grandma asks about it we had better tell her that I did it. Shell blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly, even if you say you did it yourself, said Xi-feng. Therell be a row, whatever you say. Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room. It was a great shock to Ar6ma and the other maids when they saw him.
He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls on her in his stead. Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our story. The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up. Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record. -347 The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Das wife came round once more to renew her invitation. Grandmother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part of the day in the Lai familys private garden. Lai Das garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty. The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer part of the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias. One of these last was a young gentleman called Liu Xianglian whom Xue Pan had met on some previous occasion and hankeringly remembered ever since. The discovery that he was a keen amateur actor one, moreover, who specialized in romantic roles had led Xue Pan to jump to the wrong conclusion and assume that he must share the same wind and moonlight proclivities as himself. Eager to make his closer acquaintance but hitherto denied any opportunity of doing so, he was overjoyed at finding him among the company on this occasion and consequently in a state of excitement which rendered his behaviour extremely unpredictable. Cousin Zhen had also heard of Liu Xiang-lian and admired him. Today, under pretext of being a little drunk, he had taken the liberty of asking him to perform for them, and Liu Xiang-lian, supported by the hired professional players, had obliged by appearing on the stage in two operatic numbers. When he rejoined the company, Xue Pan took the opportunity of moving over to his table and began plying him with all sorts of questions and insinuations. Liu Xiang-lian was a young man of excellent family who, having lost both his parents in early youth, had failed to complete his education. He was of a dashing, impulsive nature, impatient of niceties. His chief pleasures were exercising with spear or sabre, drinking, and gambling but he was not averse to gentler pastimes he frequented the budding groves and could play on both the flute and the zither. Because he was so young and handsome, many who did not know him mistakenly supposed that, being an actor, he must have the usual actors propensities. Lai Das son Lai Shang-rong had been a good friend of his for years and it was only natural that he should invite him on this occasion to help him entertain his guests. Under these circumstances Lin Xiang-lian was prepared to put up with a certain amount of drunken horse-play but Xue Pan was too much for him, and soon his attentions were becoming so distasteful that Xiang-lian resolved -347 -to leave at the earliest opportunity in -order to escape from them. Before he could break away, however, Lai Shang-rong detained him. Bao-yu gave me a message for you just now. He said that though he saw you briefly when he arrived, with so many other people around, be didnt have a chance of talking to you properly. Hes most anxious that you should stay on so that he can talk to you afterwards. If you are really set on going, wait while I call him out and you can have a word with him now. What you do after that is your own affair I certainly shant try to detain you. He called a waiter to him Look inside and get hold of one of the old women. Tell her to have a quiet word with Master Bao to say that hes wanted here outside. After about the time it would take to drink a cup of tea in, Bao-yu appeared. Here you are, Uncle Bao! said Lai Shang-rong when he had joined them. I leave Xiang-lian in your bands, Ive got to go and look after my guests now.
Instead he threw himself on his knees, kotowed several times, and began praying aloud in the direction of the well O spirit, in all the years I have served Master Bao this is the first time he has ever kept anything from me. But though I dont know who you are, O spirit, and dont like to ask, one thing I do know, and that is that you are sure to be some wondrously beautiful, clever, refined young female. And since Master Bao isnt able to tell you Out loud what he wants of you, I, Tealeaf, am praying to you on his behalf. I beseech you, if you still have feelings as you used to when you were on earth, watch over my master from time to time, O spirit. I know you belong to a different world now, but being as its for a special friend of yours that Im asking this, please do it if you can, spirit, for old times sake. And please use what influence you can to see that Master Bao is reborn in his next life as a girl, so that he can spend all his time with you and dont let him be reborn as one of those horrible Whiskered Males he is always on about. At this point he knocked his head several more times on the ground. Bao-yu, who had been listening, could no longer hold back his laughter. Observing that Tealeaf had raised himself once more on all fours and appeared to be about to go on, he kicked him and told him to get up. Stop this nonsense! If anyone hears you, I shall become a laughing-stock. Tealeaf scrambled to his feet, picked up the burner and followed Bao-yu inside. Ive already spoken to the nun about getting you some food, he told Bao-yu as they were going in together. I told her you hadnt eaten yet. You ought to get something inside you. I realize that you came out here because theres a big party and lots of racket at home today and you wanted somewhere peaceful where you could do this. But I think just staying out here in the quiet all day is showing all the respect you need to this person youve just made the offering to. You dont need to fast all day as well. Thats out of the question. That seems reasonable, said Bao-yu. As Im missing the patty all the time that Im here, I am in a way abstaining already so I suppose there can be no harm in my taking a bit of vegetarian stuff. Im glad to hear you say so, said Tealeaf. Of course, there is another way of looking at it. Your going off like this is sure to cause others at home to worry. Now if no one at home was likely to worry, thered be no harm in our not going back until evening. But since they are going to worry, I really think you ought to be getting back soon. For one thing it will set Their Ladyships minds at rest, and for another, it will, in the long run, be more respectful to this person youve just made the offering to. Because if you go home, even if you drink and watch plays, it wont be because you want to, but out of duty to Their Ladyships. Whereas if you stay out here thinking only about the spirit and not caring how worried you make Their Ladyships, youll in fact be making the spirit herself uneasy to think of all the anxiety thats being caused on her behalf. Think it over, Master Bao, and see if you dont agree with me. I can see whats on your mind without much difficulty, said Bao-yu, laughing. Youre afraid that as you are the only one who came out here with me, you will bear all the blame for this outing when we get back. Thats the real reason why Im being treated to all this high-minded advice, isnt it? Well, dont worry! It was all along my intention to go back to the party when I had made the offering. I never said anything about staying out here all day. Ive discharged my vow. If I hurry home now so that the others arent too worried, it seems to me that my obligations to the dead and the living swill both be met. Tealeaf expressed his relief. Still talking, they made their way to the old nuns parlour, or hall of meditation, where they found she had set out a very presentable though, of course, vegetarian repast for them. After briefly sampling it, the two of them mounted and set off again along the road by which they had come Bao-yu at such a pace that Tealeaf was obliged to call out after him to slacken it. Go easy on that horse, Master Bad! He hasnt been ridden very much you need to keep a pretty tight rein on him.
She awoke at first daylight next morning to find Bao-yu smiling down at her We might have been burgled last night for all youd have known about itLook at your trousers! Looking down, Aroma saw the sash that Bao-yu had been wearing yesterday tied round her own waist, and knew that he must have exchanged it for hers during the night. She tore it off impatiently. I dont want the horrible thing. The sooner you take it away the better. Bao-yu was anxious that she should keep it, and after a great deal of coaxing she consented, very reluctantly, to tie it on again. But she took it off once and for all as soon as he was out of the room and threw it into an empty chest, having first found another one of her own to put on in its place. Bao-yu made no comment on the change when they were together again. He merely inquired whether anything had happened the day before, while he was out. Mrs Lian sent someone round to fetch Crimson, said Aroma. She wanted to wait for you but it seemed to me that it wasnt all that important, so I took it on myself to send her off straight away. Quite right, said Bao-yu. I already knew about it. There was no need to wait till I got back. Aroma continued Her Grace sent that Mr Xia of the Imperial Bedchamber yesterday with a hundred and twenty taels of silver to pay for a three-day Pro Viventibus by the Taoists of the Lunar Queen temple starting on the first of next month There are to be plays performed as part of the Offering and Mr Zhen and all the other gentlemen are to go there to burn incense. Oh, and Her Graces presents for the Double Fifth have arrived. She ordered a little maid to get Out Bao-yus share of the things sent. There were two Palace fans of exquisite workmanship, two strings of red musk-scented medicine-beads, two lengths of maidenhair chiffon and a grass-woven lotus mat to lie on in the hot weather. Did the others all get the same? he asked. Her Old Ladyships presents were the same as yours with the addition of a perfume-sceptre and an agate head-rest, and Sir Zhengs, Lady Wangs and Mrs Xues were the same as Her Old Ladyships but without the head-rest Miss Baos were exactly the same as yours Miss Lin, Miss Ying-chun, Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xi-chun got Only the fans and the beads and Mrs Zhu and Mrs Lian both got two lengths of gauze, two lengths of chiffon, two perfume sachets and two moulded medicine-cakes. Funny! said Bao-yu. I wonder why Miss Lin didnt get the same as me and why only Miss Baos and mine were the same. There must have been some mistake, surely ? When they unpacked them yesterday, the separate lots were all labelled, said Aroma. I dont see how there could have been any mistake. Your share was in Her Old Ladyships room and I went round there to get it for you. Her Old Ladyship says she wants you to go to Court at four oclock tomorrow morning to give thanks. Yes, of course, said Bao-yu inattentively, and gave Ripple instructions to take his presents round to Dai-yu Tell Miss Lin that I got these things yesterday and that if theres anything there she fancies, I should like her to keep it. Ripple went off with the presents. She was back in a very short time, however. Miss Lin says she got some yesterday too, and will you please keep these for yourself. Bao-yu told her to put them away. As soon as he had washed, he left to pay his morning call on Grandmother Jia but just as he was going out he saw Dai-yu coming towards him and hurried forward to meet her. Why didnt you choose anything from the things I sent you? Yesterdays resentments were now quite forgotten today Dai-yu had fresh matter to occupy her mind. Im not equal to the honour, she said. You forget, Im not in the gold and jade class like you and your Cousin Bao. Im only a common little wall-flower! The reference to gold and jade immediately aroused Bao-yus suspicions. I dont know what anyone else may have been saying on the subject, he said, but if any such thought ever so much as crossed my mind, may Heaven strike me dead, and may I never be reborn as a human being! Seeing him genuinely bewildered, Dai-yu smiled in what was meant to be a reassuring manner. I wish you wouldnt make these horrible oaths.
Tear her mouth! she said to Faithful, giving her a playful push. Patience laid the money down as she was bidden, and after laughing a while with the others, went out again. On her way out of the courtyard she ran into Jia Lian, who was just about to enter the gate. Wheres Lady Xing? he asked her. Sir She has sent me to look for her. Shes been standing in there with Her Old Ladyship for the last half hour, said Patience. She hasnt dared to move yet, but I dare say shell get away as soon as she can. Her Old Ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning, but thanks to the Mistress, whos been all this time humouring her, shes gradually beginning to calm down a bit. Oh well, when I go in I shall say that Ive come to find out if Her Old Ladyship is going to Lai Das place on the fourteenth, so that I know whether or not to have the carriages ready, said Jia Lian. I can mention that Lady Xing is wanted as an afterthought. And after that perhaps I shall stay on and chaff the old lady a bit for a few minutes. That should he all right, shouldnt it? If youre asking my opinion, I think youd do much better not to go in at all, said Patience. Everyones been in trouble with her today even Her Ladyship and Bao-yu. If you go in now, youll walk straight into it. Oh, surely its all over now, isnt it? said Jia Lian. Surely shes not going to start all over again? Its nothing to do with me, in any case. And Sir She did ask me to go and fetch Mother myself. If he finds that Ive sent someone else to do it, hes in such a bad temper already, that hell probably use that as an excuse to take it out on me. He began to go in, and Patience, to whom this sounded reasonable enough, turned back and followed him in across the courtyard. Entering Grandmother Jias outer door, Jia Lian crossed the reception room on tiptoe and peered into the inner room at the back. He could see his mother standing there. Xi-feng, who had sharper eyes than the rest, spotted him at once and made a sign to him not to enter and another sign to Lady Xing indicating that she was wanted outside. Lady Xing could not simply walk out, so she filled a cup with some tea and set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. This caused the old lady to turn round and as Jia Lian chanced at that very moment to be looking in at the doorway and was unable to withdraw his head in time, she caught a momentary glimpse of him before he disappeared. Whos that outside? she said. It looked like one of the boys peeping in there just now. Yes said Xi-feng, quickly rising to her feet and going over to the doorway, I thought I saw someones shadow there just now. Jia Lian walked smiling into the room. Ive come to ask if you are going on the fourteenth, Grandma, so, that I shall know whether to get the carriages ready or not. In that case why didnt you come in straight away, said Grandmother Jia, instead of lurking around outside? I could see that you were playing cards, said Jia Lian with a somewhat artificial smile. I didnt like to interrupt you. I was hoping to get my wife to come out so that I could ask her. And what is there so extraordinarily urgent about this that you needed to ask her now? said Grandmother Jia. If youd waited until she got home, you could have asked her all you wanted to then. Why this extraordinary conscientiousness all of a sudden? Eavesdropping is what you were up to more likely, or spying for somebody else. Whatever it was, you gave me a nasty turn, creeping around in that sneaky, underhand way. Disgusting creature! Your wife will be with me a long time yet playing cards. Better get back to that Zhao Er woman while you have the chance and carry on where you left off with your plans- for poisoning her! The others all laughed. It was Bao Ers wife, my old love, not Zhao Ers, said Faithful, laughing. Thats what I said, didnt I? Grandmother Jia snapped. Well, Zhao or Bao or brown cow how can !be expected to remember such things? The very mention of them makes me feel angry. There were three generations of the family above me when I came to this household as a young bride, and now there are three generations below me, and Ive seen many shocking and many wicked and many peculiar things during the fifty-four years since first I came here, but this sort of thing is simply outside my experience.
The loud laughter which greeted this pronouncement was interrupted by the arrival of an old woman who reported to Grandmother Jia that the young actresses were in the Lotus Pavilion awaiting instructions. Were they to perform now, or should they go on waiting a little longer? Bless me! I had completely forgotten about them, said Grandmother Jia. Yes, tell them to begin straight away. The old woman departed, and presently, in the cold, clear air of autumn, the ululation of flutes rising above a drone of pipes and organs came stealing through the trees and across the water, ravishing the hearts and minds of those who heard it. Bao-yu, the first to be affected, seized his wine-kettle, poured himself a cupful of wine, and drained it in a single gulp. He then poured himself a second cup but just as he was about to drink it, he noticed that his mother had evidently been affected in the same way, for she was just at that moment giving orders to a servant to fetch her a supply of freshly-heated wine. At once he crossed over to where she was sitting and held his cup to her mouth for her to drink from. Soon the newly-heated wine arrived and Bao-yu went back to his seat. Lady Wang rose from hers and picked up the wine-kettle that had just been brought, intending to pour some for Grandmother Jia. This was a signal for the others present, including Aunt Xue, to rise from their seats as well but Grandmother Jia hurriedly gave orders for Li Wan and Xi-feng to take over. Let your Aunt sit down, so that the others can be at their ease, she said to Xi-feng, whereupon Lady Wang relinquished the wine-kettle and went back to her seat. Were having such fun today, said Grandmother Jia when Xi-feng had poured for her. All of you must drink! She raised her cup to Aunt Xue, then, reaching beyond her, to Xiang-yun and Bao-chai. Come on, you two! You must have a cup too. And your Cousin Lin - were not letting her off. I know she cant drink very much, but today is an exception. She drained her cup, and xiang-yun, Bao-chai and Dai-yu drank something from theirs. Grannie Liu, meanwhile, who had seldom before heard such fine music and was more than a little drunk, was showing bet appreciation of it with vigorous movements of hands and feet. Bao-yu, catching sight of her, slipped from his seat to whisper in Dai-yus ear. Look at the old grannie! It reminds me of the passage in the History Classic about the animals dancing to the music of Shun, said Dai-yu. Only in this case its just one old cow! The other girls, overhearing this, all laughed. After a little while the music stopped and Aunt Xue suggested that as everyone appeared to have had about as much to drink as was good for them, perhaps it would be a good idea to break up and walk around for a bit. At this Grandmother Jia, who was herself beginning to feel like some exercise, rose to her feet. The others rose too and followed her outside. Anxious to keep Grannie Liu with her as a source of diversion, Grandmother Jia took her by the hand to walk with her among the trees at the foot of the rockery. She spent a goodish while circumambulating this area with her, explaining what the various trees, rocks and flowers were called. Grannie Liu listened very attentively. Seems that in the city it isnt only the folks that are grander, she remarked. The creatures too seem to be grander than what they are outside. Even the birds here are prettier, and they can talk. What birds? they asked her, curious. I know the one on the golden perch on the verandahhim with the green feathers and red beak isa polly parrot, she said defensively, but that old black crow in the cage hes grown a thingummy on his head and learned to talk, as well. The crow that she was referring to was a mynah. The others laughed at her mistake. A little after this some maids came up and invited them to take a snack. After drinking all that wine, I dont feel hungry, said Grandmother Jia. Still, bring it here anyway, and those who want to can help themselves. The maids went off and returned carrying two small tables. A couple of food-boxes followed. Each, when its cover was removed, was found to contain two different kinds of delicacy. In the first box there were two kinds of steamed things marzipan cakes made of ground lotus-root and sugared cassia-flowers, and pine-nut and goose-fat rolls, The second box contained two sorts of fried things, one of them a heap of tiny jiao-zi only about one inch long What have they got inside them?
When Bao-chai arrived at Lady Wangs apartment she found the whole place hushed and still and Lady Wang sitting in the inner room on her own, crying. Deeming it an unsuitable moment to raise the subject of her visit, Bao-chai sat down beside her in silence. Where have you just come from? Lady Wang asked her. The Garden. The Garden, Lady Wang echoed. Did you by any chance see your cousin Bao-yu there? I saw him going out just now wearing his outdoor clothes, but I dont know where he was going to. Lady Wang nodded and gave a sigh. I dont know if youve heard. Something very strange has happened. Golden has drowned herself in a well. That is strange, said Bao-chai. Why ever did she do that? The day before yesterday she broke something of mine, said Lady Wang, and in a moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mothers. I had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me as to drown herself. Now that she has, I feel that it is all my fault. Its only natural that a kind person like you should see it in that way, said Bao-chai, but in my opinion Golden would never have drowned herself in anger. Its much more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally. While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for-her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. Theres no earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself. If she did, all I can say is that she was a stupid person and not worth feeling sorry for! Lady Wang sighed and shook her head doubtfully. Well, it may be as you say, but I still feel very uneasy in my mind. Im sure you have no cause, Aunt, said Bao-chai, but if you feel very much distressed, I suggest that you simply give her family a little extra for the funeral. In that way you will more than fulfill any moral obligation you may -have towards her as a mistress. I have just given her mother fifty taels, said Lady Wang. I wanted to give her two new outfits as well from one of the girls wardrobes, but it just so happens that at the moment none of them apart from your Cousin Lin has got anything new that would do. Your Cousin Lin has got two sets that we had made for her next birthday, but she is such a sensitive child and has had so much sickness and misfortune in her life that Im afraid she would almost certainly feel superstitious about the clothes made for her birthday being used for dressing a corpse with, so Ive had to ask the tailors to make up a couple in a hurry. Of course, if it were any other maid, I should have given the mother a few taels and that would have been the end of the matter. But though Golden was only a servant, she had been with me so long that she had become almost like a daughter to me. She began to cry again as she said this. Theres no need to hurry the tailors about this, said Bao-chai. Ive got two new outfits that I recently finished making for myself. Why not let her mother have them and save them the trouble? Golden once or twice wore old dresses of mine in the past, so I know they will fit her. Thats very kind of you, but arent you superstitious? said Lady Wang. Bao-chai laughed. Dont worry about that, Aunt. That 5-ort of thing has never bothered me. At that she rose and went off to fetch them. Lady Wang hurriedly ordered two of the servants to go after her. When Bao-chai returned with the clothes, she found Bao-yu sitting beside his mother in tears. Lady Wang was evidently in the midst of rebuking him about something, but as soon as she caught sight of Bao-chai, she closed her mouth and fell silent. From the scene before her eyes and the word or two she had overheard, Bao-chai was able to form a pretty good idea of what had been happening. She handed the clothes over to Lady Wang and Lady Wang summoned Goldens mother to come and fetch them. What happened after that will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER 33 -1307 An envious younger brother puts in a malicious word or two And a scapegrace elder brother receives a terrible chastisement OUR story last told how Goldens mother was summoned to take away the clothing that Bao-chai had brought for Goldens laying-out.
Just how many times can one person become a monk? I think I had better see what the others think about that remark. Bao-yu had realized at once that she would be offended but the words were already out of his mouth before he could stop them. He turned very red and hung his head in silence. It was a good thing that no one else was in the room at that moment to see him. Dai-yu glared at him for some seconds - evidently too enraged to speak, for she made a sound somewhere between a snort and a sigh, but said nothing - then, seeing him almost purple in the face with suppressed emotion, she clenched her teeth, pointed her finger at him, and, with an indignant Hmn!, stabbed the air quite savagely a few inches away from his forehead You! But whatever it was she had been going to call him never got said. She merely gave a sigh and began wiping her eyes again with her handkerchief. Bao-yu had been in a highly emotional state when he came to see Dai-yu and it had further upset him to have inadvertently offended her so soon after his arrival. This angry gesture and the unsuccessful struggle, ending in sighs and tears, to say what she wanted to say now affected him so deeply that he, too, began to weep. In need of a handkerchief but finding that he had come out without one, he wiped his eyes on his sleeve. Although Dai-yu was crying, the spectacle of Bao-yu using the sleeve of his brand-new lilac-coloured summer gown as a handkerchief had not escaped her, and while continuing to wipe her own eyes with one hand, she leaned over and reached with the other for the square of silk that was draped over the head-rest at the end of the bed. She lifted it off and threw it at himall without uttering a word - then, once more burying her face in her own handkerchief, resumed her weeping. Bao-yu picked up the handkerchief she had thrown him and hurriedly wiped his eyes with it. When he had dried them, he drew up close to her again and took one of her hands in his own, smiling at her gently. I dont know why you go on crying, he said. I feel as if all my insides were shattered. Come! Lets go and see Grand mother together. Dai-yu flung off his hand. Take your hands off me! Were not children any more. You really cant go on mauling me about like this all the time. Dont you understand anything? Bravo! The shouted interruption startled them both. They spun round to look just as Xi-feng, full of smiles, came bustling into the room. Grandmother has been grumbling away something awful she said. She insisted that I should come over and see if you were both all right. Oh, I said, theres no need to go and look, Grannie theyll have made it up by now without any interference from us. So she told me I was lazy. Well, here I amand of course its exactly as I said it would be. I dont know. I dont understand you two. What is it you find to argue about? For every three days that youre friends you must spend at least two days quarrelling. You really are a couple of babies. And the older you get, the worse you get. Look at you now holding hands crying! And a couple of days ago you were glaring at each other like fighting-cocks. Come on! Come with me to see Grandmother. Lets put the old ladys mind at rest. As she said this, she seized Dai-yus hand and began marching off with her. Dai-yu turned back and called for her maids, but there was no response. What do you want to call them for? said Xi-feng. Youve got me to wait on you, havent you? She continued to walk away, still holding Dai-yu by the hand. Bao-yu followed a little way behind. They went out of the Garden and through into Grandmother Jias apartment. I told you they could be left to themselves to make it up and that there was no need for you to worry, said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia. when they were all in the old ladys presence but you wouldnt believe me, would you? You insisted on my going there to act the peacemaker. Well, I went there and what did I find? I found the two of them together apologizing to each other. It was like the kite and the kestrel holding hands they were positively locked in a clinch! No need of a peacemaker that I could see. There was a burst of laughter from all present. Bao-chai was among these, but Dai-yu slipped past her without speaking and took a seat next to Grandmother Jia.
You dont cost them a penny. And anytime you feel like it, you can just get up and go. Ive got nothing at all of my own, absolutely nothing. Yet everything they give mefood. clothing, pocket-money, even the flowers and trees in my garden -are the same as they give their own gifts. Can you wonder that the servants are so resentful ? Your being here only means one more dowry for them to find, said Bao-chai. Surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them? Dai-yu coloured. Ive been telling you my troubles because I thought you really cared, but you turn them into a joke. Perhaps, said Bao-chai, smiling. But its true, all the same. However, dont you worry as long as Im here, I promise to do my best to make it easier for you. If you will promise always to let me know when anything is bothering you, I will promise to deal with it if it is in my power to do so. I have a brother, its true but you know as well as I do what hes like. Its really only in having a mother that I can count myself a bit luckier than you. In other respects we have enough in common to think of ourselves as fellow-sufferers. If you can see thisas with your intelligence I am sure you mustyou have no cause to go echoing Si-ma Nius complaint All men have brothers, only I have none. Now, you have suggested that the less trouble the better ought to be your motto here, and I take your point. I shall have a word with Mother next time I see her about this. Ill be surprised if we havent got some birds nest of our own at home. If we have, I shall tell them to send you a few ounces, so that you can get your own maids to prepare it for you every morning. That way will be handier for you and will also avoid the risk of any alarms and excursions with the staff. Dai-yu smiled at her gratefully. It may be only a little thing, but it is very kind indeed of you to have thought of it. Nonsense! said Bao-chai. Its not worth speaking of. Im only afraid that by spending so much time with other people I may have been neglecting you rather. Well, Id better be going now. Im afraid Im tiring you. Come again this evening and talk to me for a bit, said Dai-yu. Bao-chai promised to do so and departed. And at this point she departs for a little while from our narrative. Left alone, Dai-yu ate a few mouthfuls of congee and then lay down on her bed. Towards sundown a change of weather came, bringing the whisper and rustle of rain. It was the pulsing, steady rain of autumn, so constant that you sometimes wonder if it has stopped. The afternoon slid imperceptibly into a somber evening, blackened by lowering rain clouds and made yet more melancholy for Dai-yu by the persistent drip of the rain on her bamboos. Reflecting that Bao-chai would now be unable to come, she picked up a book at random to read beneath the lamp. It was a volume of The Lyric Miscellany consisting largely of songs of sorrow and separation The Autumn Bride, The Grief of Parting and suchlike. Moved by what she read, she was inevitably drawn to give outlet to her feelings in composition and had soon completed a song of separation of her own. As she had modelled it on Zhang Ruo-xus famous poem Spring River A Night of Flowers and Moonlight, she decided to call it Autumn Window A Night of Wind and Rain. This is how it went Autumn Window A Night of Wind and Rain -534 The autumn flowers are dead, the leaves are sere Lamp-light comes soon, the nights grow long again. Outside my window autumns signs appear More dismal in the wind and rustling rain. -534 The rustling rain came in such swift downpour It startled me from autumn-dream-filled sleep. Now, in a muse, unable to sleep more, I watch the candle at my bedside weep. -534 The candle weeps down to its socket low, -427 And my heart weeps and desolation feels. -534 Yet the same wind in other courts must blow The sound of rain through other windows steals. -534 The winds chill strikes through quilt and counterpane, The rain drums like a mad clock in my ears, All night, in whispering, monotone refrain, Companion to my own swift-coursing tears. -534 The courtyard now with mist begins to fill, The bamboos drip persists without a pause.
-1014 Lian doesnt deserve her, said Xi-feng. All hes fit for is a couple of sad old dumplings like me and Patience! This set everyone laughing. A maid came in to announce someone. Lady Xing, maam. Lady Wang hurried out to meet her. What followed will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 47 In pursuit of love the Oaf King takes a fearful beating And from fear of reprisal the Reluctant Playboy makes a hasty getaway HEARING that Lady Xing had arrived, Lady Wang at once hurried out to meet her. Lady Xing had come over to see if there had been any change in Faithfuls attitude. She was ignorant of the fact that the secret was now out and that Grandmother Jia knew everything. The first she heard of it was when quietly informed by some of Grandmother Jias women as she entered the old ladys courtyard. She would have liked to turn back, but by then it was already too late she had already been seen and announced by the servants inside, and when her sister-in-law Lady Wang came out to meet her, she was obliged to go in with her and pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Finding that her greetings were received by the old lady in stony silence, she was covered with shame and confusion. By this time Xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and Faithful had gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone. Fearing that their presence might add to Lady Xings embarrassment, Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the rest also, one after another, withdrew. When she saw that she and Lady Xing were alone together, Grandmother Jia at last broke her silence. I hear you have been playing the matchmaker for your husband, she said. I must congratulate you on your wifely virtue though I must say, I think that in this case you are carrying wifeliness a little far. You have children and grand-children of your own now why should you be frightened of his temper still at your age? Yet they tell me that you positively encourage his excesses. Lady Xing blushed crimson with embarrassment. I have tried several times to dissuade him, without success. I am sure you must realize that I have acted against my will in this matter. You did what you were told, all the same, said Grandmother Jia sharply. Would you do what you were told if he asked you to kill someone? Just reflect for a moment. There is only your sister-in-law, poor, simple soulshe is always ailing from something or otherto worry about the responsibilities of this household. Its true that she has Lians wife to help her, hut she has so much to do that she hardly knows which way to turnalways putting the rake down to pick up the broom. And I have to cut down on all my activities nowadays. So if there is ever anything that your sister-in-law and Feng have overlooked, Faithful is the only one left to make sure that my needs are attended to. She is a child who notices things. If she sees that I lack something, she will either ask for it herself or have a word with one of the other two and make sure that I get it. Think of all the hundreds and thousands of things there are to be done in this household. If I hadnt got Faithful, how could the other two avoid overlooking something once in a while? So what would you have me do then? Would you expect me to start worrying about all these things myself? Should I have to start calculating what I needed every day and go running off to the other two to ask them for it? Of all the girls Ive ever had, Faithful is the only one left me now who is a bit older and more responsible than the restwho understands my little ways and knows how I like things done. Theres a genuine bond between usfor example, she would never take advantage of our relationship, as some girls would, to ask other people for clothes or money for herself. One consequence 6f this is that not only Feng and your sister-in-law, but everyone else in the household, from the highest down to the lowest, is able to trust her. It means that quite apart from the fact that I have someone I can rely on, Feng and -your sister-in-law are saved a great deal of worry because with a girl like that to look after me, I dont suffer when they occasionally forget something, and that keeps me in a good temper. If Faithful were to leave me now, who would you get for me to put in her place? And even if you could find such a jewel, shed need to have a tongue in her head too. Shed be no use to me if she didnt have my Faithfuls gift for expressing herself.
Bao-chai called out after her. If you go, it will spoil all the fun. She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back. At the doorway they ran into Jia Zhengs two concubines, Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou, come to see Bao-yu. Li Wan, Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk, but Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them, Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid arrived from Lady Wangs to say that Wang Zi-tengs wife had come and the presence of the young ladies was requested. Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go. Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave. I cant go out, said Bao-yu. For heavens sake dont let Aunt Wang come over here! - Cousin Lint he called to Dai-yu. Stay here a bit! Theres something I want to say to you. Hearing him, Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu Do you hear that? Someone wants a word with you. Youd better go back and see what he wants to say! She gave her a push in the direction of the house then she and Li Wan went off, both laughing. When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away. Aiyo! he said. My head! Good! said Dai-yu. It serves you right! Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, lumped two or three feet into the air, and began to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-tengs lady was with them and hurried over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling. Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried Out to him piteously between their sobs my son I, my child!, my darling! Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pannot to mention Zhou Ruis wife and a great bevy of domestics both high and lowcame hurrying into the garden, adding numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators. While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared, brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path. She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou Ruis wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room. Patience and Felicity wept piteously to see their mistress in such a state. On this occasion even Jia Zhengs customary impassivity seemed to have deserted him, as he turned this way and that, uncertain on whom to direct his attention. And if Jia Zheng was distraught, the state of the others can be imagined. Most remarkable, perhaps, was the. spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk, one moment afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush, the next that Bao-chai might be ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male. Cousin Zhen, he knew for a fact, was a notorious womanizer. Then he caught sight of Dai-yu whom he had never seen before and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty. Although no one knew what to do themselves, there were a great many opinions about what ought to be done. Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits, some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out, some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff yet in spite of prayers, incantations, divination, and all the expedients that faith and physic could provide, there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients.
Then the rouge, too, was differentnot in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses. This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge, Bao-yu explained to her, only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. Its so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands for using on your cheeks. Following his directions, .Patience found that her complexion had acquired a radiant freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume. Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patiences hair. At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wans place and she had to leave him in a hurry. Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret. Today wasor would have been if -she had livedGoldens birthday, and for this reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning. The row which bad broken out later in the day between Xi-feng and Jia Lian had proved a godsend. It had at last given him an opportunity of showing Patience something of what he felt for her. This was an unlooked-for happiness he might otherwise have waited a lifetime for in vain. He stretched himself out on his bed in a pleasurable glow of satisfaction. These pleasant feelings were soon marred by the reflection that a coarse sensualist like Jia Lian who never considered anything but his own pleasure would certainly know nothing about the scientific preparation of cosmetics. He thought of Patience serving that precious couple, alone in the world without parents or brothers and sisters to defend her, somehow contriving to steer an even course between Jia Lians boorishness on the one hand and Xi-fengs vindictiveness on the other, yet today, in spite of all her efforts, falling a victim to their cruelty. Truly her lot was an unhappy one -mote unhappy even than Dai-yus! At this point in his reflections he became so upset that he began to shed tears, not bothering on this occasion to restrain them, because Aroma was not there to disapprove. Getting up from his bed, he went over to inspect Patiences dress The samshoo that had been sprayed on it was now neatly dry. He picked up the iron, ironed the dress for her, and neatly folded it. Then he noticed that she had left her handkerchief behind. As it was still marked with tear-stains, he washed it out in the water she had used for her face and hung it up to dry. Feeling a strange sensation in which sadness and happiness commingled, he mused for some minutes in silence before going over to Sweet-rice Village to join the others. He remained there a long while talking. The lamps had already been lit when he returned. As Patience spent that night at Li Wans place and Xi-feng slept with Grandmother Jia, Jia Lian returned to his room in the evening to find it gloomy and deserted. Not caring to call for anyone, however, he managed for himself as hest he could and spent the night there alone. On waking next morning he felt nothing but revulsion and remorse when he remembered what had happened. His mother, Lady Xing, still worrying about the drunken exhibition he had made of himself the day before, came hurrying over first thing to urge him to go with her to see Grandmother Jia. This, despite the most acute feelings of shame and embarrassment, he now had to do. Well? the old lady asked him, when he knelt before her. I had too much to drink yesterday, Grandmother, and Im afraid I broke in on you and made a scene. Ive come here now to apologize. Grandmother Jia snorted. Disgusting wretch! If you must go filling yourself with liquor, why cant you lie down quietly and sleep it off like a good, sensible creature? Fancy knocking your own wife about!
Bao-yu laughed. The ancients used to say that for one smile of a beautiful woman a thousand taels are well spent. For a few old fans its cheap at the price! He called to Aroma, who had just finished changing into clean clothes, to come outside and join them. Little Melilot came and cleared away the broken bits of fan, and everyone sat for a while and enjoyed the cool. But our narrative supplies no further details of that evening. -1344 About noon next day, while Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the girls were sitting in Grandmother Jias room, someone came in to announce that Miss Shi had arrived. Shortly afterwards Shi Xiang-yun appeared in the courtyard, attended by a bevy of matrons and maids. Bao-chai, Dai-yu and the rest hurried out to the foot of the steps to welcome her. For young girls like the cousins a reunion after a mere months separation is an occasion for touching demonstrations of affection. After these initial transports, when they were all indoors and the greetings, introductions and salutations had been completed, Grandmother Jia suggested that, as the weather was so hot, Xiang-yun should remove her Outer garments. Xiang-yun rose to her feet with alacrity and divested herself of one or two layers. Lady Wang was amused. Gracious, child! What a lot you have on! I dont think Ive ever seen anyone wearing so much. Its my Aunt Shi who makes me wear it all, said Xiang yun. You wouldnt catch me wearing this stuff if I didnt have to. You dont know our Xiang-yun, Aunt, Bao-chai interposed. Shes really happiest in boys clothes. That time she was here in the third or fourth month last year, I remember one day she dressed up in one of Bao-yus gowns and put a pair of his boots on and one of his belts round her waist. At first glance she looked exactly like Cousin Bao. It was only the ear-rings that gave her away. When she stood behind that chair over there, Grandmother was completely taken in. She said, Bao-yu, come over here! Youll get the dust from that hanging lamp in your eyes if youre not careful. But Xiang-yun just smiled and didnt move. It was only when everyone couldnt hold it in any longer and started laughing that Grand-mother realized who it was and joined in the laugh. She told her that she made a very good4ooking boy. Thats nothing, said Dai-yu. What about that time last year when she came to stay for a couple of days with us in the first month and it snowed? Grandma and Auntie Wang had just got back from somewhereI think it was from visiting the ancestors portraitsand she saw Grandmas new scarlet felt rain-cape lying there and put it on when no one was looking. Of course, it was much too big and much too long for her, so she hitched it up and tied it round her waist with a sash and went out like that into the back courtyard to help the maids build a snowman. And then she slipped over in it and got covered all over with mud The others all laughed at the recollection. Bao-chai asked Xiang-yuns nurse, Mrs Zhou, whether Xiang-yun was still as tomboyish as ever. Nurse Zhou laughed but said nothing. I dont mind her being tomboyish, said Ying-chun, but I do wish she wasnt such a chatterbox. You wouldnt believe Iteven when shes in bed at night it still goes on. Jabber-jabber, jabber-jabber. Then she laughs. Then she talks a bit more. Then she laughs again. And you never heard such a lot of rubbish in your life, I dont know where she gets it all from. Well, perhaps shell have got over that by now, said Lady Wang. I hear that someone was round the other day to talk about a betrothal. Now that theres a future mother-in-law to think about, she cant be quite as tomboyish as she used to be. Are you staying this time, or do you have to go back tonight? asked Grandmother Jia. Your Old Ladyship hasnt seen all the clothes shes brought, said Nurse Zhou. Shell be staying two days here at the very least. Isnt Bao at home? said Xiang-yun. Listen to her! said Bao-chai. Cousin Bao is the only one she thinks about. He and she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief. You can see she hasnt really changed.
Im so looking forward to some nice, fresh farm vegetables. The stuff we buy outside isnt as tasty as your home-grown stuff, you know. Thats the countrymans idea of a treat, said Grannie Liu. He cant afford meat and fish, so when he fancies a little luxury, he likes to eat his food fresh from the ground. Now that youre one of the family, said Grandmother Jia, I hope you will stay long enough to enjoy your visit. Dont go hurrying back again. Stay here a couple of days or so, if you can put up with us. Weve got a garden too, you know, and we grow a certain amount of fruit in it. Tomorrow you must try some of our stuff- and you must take some back home with you when you go. It will seem more like a proper visit to relations if you stay a bit, instead of popping in and popping straight out again. Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia took pleasure in the old womans company and added her own persuasion. Its probably not as roomy here as your farmyard, but I expect well manage to tuck you in somewhere. And youll be able to tell our old lady all the village gossip. Feng! said Grandmother Jia, laughing in spite of herself. Dont make fun! Shes a simple countrywoman. You cant expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way that we can. She gave orders for Ban-er to be given some sweetmeats. He was unwilling to eat in front of so many people, however, so she told them to give him some money instead, and to get some of the younger pages to take him outside to play. After Grannie Liu had taken tea, she regaled Grandmother Jia with some anecdotes of village life, thus further endearing herself to her new acquaintance. She was still holding forth when Xi-feng, who had slipped Out some time previously, sent someone round to invite her back for dinner. Grand-mother Jia selected some food from her own dishes and sent them to Xi-fengs place for Grannie Liu to try in addition to what Xi-feng was giving her. Xi-feng could see that Grandmother Jia had taken a fancy to the old woman, so after dinner she sent her back to Grand-mother Jias apartment. As soon as she arrived, Faithful ordered some of the older domestics to conduct her to a bath. She herself went off to fetch her a change of clothes. She selected two fairly modest items from her own wardrobe and sent them to the bathroom with instructions that Grannie Liu should change into them after her bath. Such goings-on were outside even the old grannies extensive experience, but she took them all in good part, and having submitted to the ordeal of the bath, quickly dressed herself in the proffered clothes and went in to take her place once more beside the couch and resume her role of raconteuse. In this she was eminently successful, since Bao-yu and the girls, now seated on all sides around her, found her simple country talk much more fascinating than any of the fictions told by the blind ballad-singers who sometimes visited the house. Indeed, there was more than an element of fiction in what she told them for Grannie Liu, though born and bred in the country, was a shrewd old soul to whom the years had given a pretty good understanding of human weakness, and when she sensed the old ladys pleased excitement and the avid attention of her younger listeners, she did her best not to disappoint them by supplying from her own invention whatever memory and experience were inadequate to provide. We country-folk working out there on the landyear in, year Out, rain or fine, spring, summer, autumn and winterwe never get any time off, she told them. If we rest, its only as you might say napping in harness, like the old post-horse in the story. And many a strange happening do we see, out there on the land. Take what happened last winter, for instance. It had been snowing for several days without a stop and the snow was two or three feet thick on the ground, and this particular morning I rose up early, and while I was still indoors, I heard the sound of something stirring outside in the woodpile. I thought to myself, Thatll be someone stealing the firewood. So I put my eye to the hole in the shutter, and sure enough there was someone there but it wasnt anyone from the village. It was probably some traveller, Grandmother Jia interrupted. He was feeling cold and helped himself to a bit to make a fire with, so that he could get warm. Ah, but it wasnt a traveller, said Grannie Liu. That was the strange thing about it.
Faithful herself was still extremely angry and for some time continued to hurl invectives at her retreating back but Patience and Aroma reasoned with her, and gradually she began to calm down. Why were you hiding there just now? Patience asked Aroma when Faithfuls composure had been restored. Its funny that we didnt see you. Id been over to Miss Xi-chuns to see Master Bao, said Aroma, but I got there a moment too late. They said he had just that minute left for home. I couldnt understand why in that case I hadnt run into him on the way, so I thought perhaps he might have gone to Miss Lins but just as I was going there to look for him, I met one of Miss Lins people who said that he wasnt with her, so I began wondering if he might have gone out of the Garden altogether. Then just at that moment you came along from the direction I was looking in, so I slipped behind a tree and hid. When Faithful came, I slipped out from behind my tree and hid behind this rock. I could see you both sitting there talking, but your two pairs of eyes couldnt see me. And your three pairs of eyes couldnt see me! said a mocking voice behind them. The three girls jumped in surprise. When they turned to look, it was Bao-yu himself who walked out from behind the rock. Aroma was the first to recover her voice. You led me a nice dance! she said. Where have you been all this time? As I came out of Xi-chuns place, I could see you coming towards me, said Bao-yu. I knew it must be me you had come for, so I hid .myself to give you a surprise. I watched you as you walked by with your head in the air. Then I watched you go into Xi-chuns courtyard. Then I saw you come out again. Then I saw you stop and ask someone something. It was terribly funny. I was hoping that you would eventually come by the place where I was hiding, so that I could pop out and make you jump. But then you started dodging around, and I could see that you were hiding from someone else and evidently planning to play the same trick on them. So I peeped out to see who it was and found that it was these two. Then I began gradually working my way round behind you, and when you stepped out and showed yourself, I slipped forward and hid in the place where you had been biding. Wed better go behind and have another look, said Patience. Well probably find two more people hidden back there! No, I think there really are no more now,- said Bao-yu. When she realized that Bao-yu must have heard everything that had been said, Faithful lay face downwards on the rock and pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu laughed at her and gave her a little prod. Its damp on that stone. Much better come indoors if you want to lie down. He tried to pull her up, at the same time inviting Patience to accompany them back home for some tea. When Patience and Aroma added their own coaxing to his, Faithful finally rose to her feet and the four of them went together to Green Delights. Bao-yu had, indeed, heard everything from his hiding-place, and his concern for Faithful made him very unhappy. When they were back, he lay back silent on his bed worrying about it while the three girls laughed and chattered in the adjoining room. When Lady Xing asked Xi-feng about Faithfuls parents, she learned that her fathers name was Jin Cai and that he and her mother lived as caretakers at the Jia family mansion in Nanking and seldom came up to the capital. But she has an elder brother Jin Wen-xiang, who is one of Grandmothers buyers, said Xi-feng, and her sister-in-law is Grandmothers chief laundress. The laundress was duly summoned and Lady Xing carefully explained what was required of her. The woman was naturally delighted and went off in a great bustle of self-importance to look for Faithful, confident that she had only to state her mission for the matter to be successfully concluded. Ill prepared, therefore, for Faithfuls acrimonious rebuff or the strictures of Patience and Aroma which followed it, she re-turned to Lady Xing to make her report in a state of angry mortification. Its no good, Im afraid. She just swore at me. Since Xi-feng was present, the woman dared not mention Patience, That Aroma was there, too, helping her. Some of the things she said to mewell, I wouldnt offend Your Ladyships ears by repeating them.
Perhaps you can tell me. Certainly, said Dai-yu. Discussion is what I was hoping for. it is the only way of making progress. Tell me what you think they have taught you. Well, said Caltrop, as I see it, poetry is very good at saying things which you cant exactly explain but which leave a very vivid impression in your mind also it often says things which at first seem illogical but are quite logical and natural when you stop to think about them. That sounds very perceptive, said Dai-yu. What about giving an example or two of what you mean? Take that third couplet from his poem On the Frontier, said Caltrop -1307 Over a lone fire the straight smoke hangs In the long river the round sun sets. -1094 Now how can smoke really be straight? And why the round sun? Of course the sun is round! Yet when you close the book and start thinking about those lines, the scene they de scribe is so vivid that its almost as though you had been there. And if you ask yourself what other two words be could have used instead of straight and round, you realize that there arent any. Then again, in a couplet from another of his poems -1307 When the sun sets, the water whitens When the tide rises, all the world is green. -1094 Whitens and green at first seem like nonsense but when you start thinking about it, you realize that he had to use those two words in order to describe the scene exactly as it was. When you read those lines out loud, the flavour of them is so concentrated that its as though you had an olive weighing several -thousand catties inside your mouth! And theres another couplet of his -1307 Down by the ford the late sun lingers Over the village a smoke-thread climbs. Lingers and climbs so simple, but so clever! I remember that year we came up to the capital we moored the boat one evening towards dusk in a very lonely stretch of country with only a few trees on the bank and a few houses far away in the distance from which the blue smoke of peasants cooking their evening meal was rising high, high into the clouds. When I read this couplet last night, it suddenly took me back to that very spot. Bao-yu and Tan-chun had come in while she was talking and quietly sat down to listen. Bao-yu was impressed. To judge by what youve just said, you dont need to read any more poetry. The Emperor Jian-wen once remarked that appreciation needs not to seek far afield. From your discussion of that last couplet, I should say that you have already reached the sam dhi! Actually, although you wont know this yet, said Dai-yu, that smoke-thread climbs line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet. If I show it to you, I think you will agree that it is even more austerely effective than Wang Weis line. She took down a copy of Tao Yuan-mings Works, hunted out the couplet she had in mind, and handed it to her to look at -1014 Half-lost in haze the distant haunts of men, Whose dawdling smoke the unseen hamlet marks. Caltrop read it and nodded approvingly Yes, I see. He got the idea for climbs from the dawdling of this earlier line. Bao-yu laughed delightedly. Perfect! You must end your discussion there. If you go on any longer, youll begin unlearning what youve already discovered. You can start writing poetry yourself now, straight away. Its sure to be good. I can see I shall soon be writing an invitation asking you to join our poetry club, said Tan-chun smilingly. Dont make fun of me, Miss Tan, said Caltrop. Writing poetry is something Ive always wanted to do, and now Ive got the chance, Im learning for the fun of it. I dont expect I shall ever be any good. Good heavens! we only write for the fun of it ourselves, said Tan-chun. You surely dont imagine that what we write is good poetry? If we set ourselves up to be real poets, people outside this Garden who got to hear of it would laugh so loud that their teeth would drop out! Thats what Mencius calls throwing yourself away, said Bao-yu. You shouldnt do that. The other day, when I was discussing Xi-chuns painting with some of Fathers gentlemen, they told me they had heard about our poetry club and asked if they could see some of our poems, so I wrote a few out for them from memory. I assure you, they were genuinely impressed. In fact, they have calligraphed them for blocks to have them printed.
I dont care, said Ripple. It was still very kind of Her Ladyship, for all that. If it had been me, I shouldnt have wanted them, said Skybright. What? take someone elses old left-overs? All of us here are only maids none of us is supposed to be any higher than the rest, you know. Why should she give someone else the best and give me the left-overs? No, Im sorry. I should have had to refuse, even if it meant offending her. I couldnt take a thing like that lying down! Which of us was it that she gave those other dresses to? said Ripple, curious. Ive been home ill these last few days. I must have been away when it happened. Be a sport, Skyeytell us who it was! Why, if I tell you, will you give those dresses back again? Of course not, silly! Id just like to know, said Ripple. I dont care if it was Master Baos little puppy-dog she gave them to, I still think Her Ladyship meant to do me a kindness, and as far as Im concerned, thats all that matters. The other maids laughed. Youd better watch what you say! Thats just who she did give them to Master Baos little dog, Flower. Wicked girls! said Flowers Aroma, laughing in spite of herself, taking my name in vain! Whenever youve got a few moments to spare you are making fun of me. Theres not one of you that will come to a good end! Oh, it was you, said Ripple. Im go sorry, I didnt realize. Oh, I do apologize. All right, thats enough fooling for now, said Aroma. The question is, which of you is going to get that saucer? Better get the vases back too, while were about it, said Musk. The one in Her Old Ladyships room should be safe enough, but I wouldnt be too sure about the one at Her Ladyships. There are so many people in and out of that place especially You Know Who and her lot. If they see anything from our room in there, theyre sure to find some way of breaking it accidentally-on-purpose, if they get half a chance. Her Ladyship wont stop them. She never notices. We ought to get that one back, at least, as soon as we can. Youre right, said Skybright, laying down her sewing. Ill go and get it now. No, Ill go for that, said Ripple. You go and get your saucer. Im going for the vase, said Skybright. Why should you have all the windfalls? You others have all had a go. Now its my turn. You do exaggerate, said Musk. Its only Ripple whos had the luck. And it was only because of the coincidence that Her Ladyship happened to be going through her dresses when she arrived. Do you suppose shell be going through them again if you go there now ? Maybe not, said Skybright, with a tinge of malice. On the other hand maybe shell notice how conscientious I am and pay me two taels a month out of her allowance. You seeshe paused to add this on her way out of the room I know what goes on in here. Theres no need for the play-acting. She ran off with a mocking laugh. Ripple went, too, and fetched the onyx saucer from Tan-chuns room, after which Aroma made ready the things that were to go to Xiang-yun, and called in old Mamma Song One of the nannies attached to Green Delightsto give her instructions for their delivery. Get yourself smartened up and change into your best things, she said. I want you to go out presently and take some things for me to Miss Shis. You can give them to me now, Missand any message that you want me to deliver, said Mamma Song then I can go off straight away, as soon as Ive got myself ready. Aroma fetched two little boxes of lacquer and bamboo basketwork and taking the tops off them, put foxnuts and caltrops in one and a saucerful of chestnut fudge made of chestnut puree steam-cooked with cassia-flavored sugar in the other. These are all our own things or made from our own things freshly gathered in the Garden that Master Bao is sending Miss Shi a taste of, she said. Tell her the onyx saucer the fudge is on is the one she was admiring last time she was here and she is to keep it. This silk bag has got the sewing in that she asked me to do for her. Tell her the needleworks a bit on the rough side, but Im sure shell understand.
When was this? Bao-yu asked him. We left on the twenty-eighth of last month, said Feng Zi-ying. Didnt get back till a few days ago. Ah, that explains why I didnt see you at Shens party earlier this month, said Bao-yu. I meant at the time to ask why you werent there, but I forgot. Did you go alone on this expedition or was the General there with you? Fahver most certainly was there, said Feng Zi-ying. I was practically dragged along in tow. Do you think Im mad enough to go rushin off in pursuit of hideous hardships when I could be sittin comfortably at home eatin good food and drinkin good wine and listenin to the odd song or two? Still, some good came of it. It was a lucky accident. As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-ying rose to his feet again and declined. I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you, he said, but theres somethin very important Ive got to see Fahver about now, so Im afraid I really must refuse. But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table. Now look here, this is too bad! Feng Zi-ying good-humouredly protested. All the years weve been knockin around togevver weve never before insisted that a fellow should have to stay if he dont want to. The fact is, I really cant. Oh well, if I must have a drink, fetch some decent-sized cups and Ill just put down a couple of quick ones! This was dearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced. Two sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled, Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue Pan pouring from the wine-kettle. Feng Zi-ying drank them standing, one after the other, each in a single breath. Now come on, said Bao-yu, lets hear about this lucky accident before you go! Feng Zi-ying laughed Couldnt tell it properly just now, he said. Its somethin that needs a special party all to itself. Ill invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the details then. Theres a favour I want to ask too, by the bye, so well be able to talk about that then as well. He made a determined movement towards the door. Now youve got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity! said Xue Pan. You might at least tell us when this party is going to be, to put us out of our suspense. Not more than ten days time and not less than eight, said Feng Zi-ying and going out into the courtyard, he jumped on his horse and clattered away. Having seen him off, the others went in again, reseated themselves at table, and resumed their potations. When the party finally broke up, Bao-yu returned to the Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation. Moma, who had had no idea what the summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had become of him, at once demanded to know the cause of his condition. He gave her a full account of what had happened. Well really! said Aroma. Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety, and all the time you were there enjoying yourself! You might at least have sent word to let us know you were all tight. I was going to send word, said Bao-yu. Of course I was. But then old Feng arrived and it put it out of my mind, At that moment Bao-chai walked in, all smiles. I hear youve made a start on the famous present, she said. But surely you and your family must have had some already ? said Bao-yu. Bao-chai shook her head Pan was very pressing that I should have some, but I refused. I told him to save it for other people. I know Im not really the right sort of person for such superior delicacies. If I were to eat any, I should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking me. A maid poured tea for her as she spoke, and conversation of a desultory kind proceeded between sips. -1014 Our narrative returns now to Dai-yu. Having been present when Bao-yu received his summons, Dai-yu, too, was greatly worried about him - the more so as the day advanced and he had still not returned, Then in the evening, some time after dinner, she heard that he had just got back and resolved to go over and ask him exactly what had happened.
The rest of them only got a taste - some of them not even that. Good crabs like that are selling at a pennyweight a catty this year, said Grannie Liu. If one catty is a pennyweight, fifty catties is two taels ten, and another thirty is one and ten ten and two is twelve and twice ten is a tael, thats thirteen, and then theres the wine and the other dishes. It couldnt have cost less than twenty taels in all. Bless us and save us thatd keep a farmer and his family for a year I I take it youve already seen Mrs Lian, said Patience. Yes, said Grannie Lu. She told us to wait. She glanced through the open window as she said this and noticed that the day was drawing on towards evening. Its getting dark earlier these days, she said. Wed better be on our way. We dont want to find the city gates shut, or we shall be in a proper pickle. Just wait while I slip over and find out what the Mistress is up to, said Zhou Ruis wife. She left the room and was gone for some considerable time. When she eventually returned, she was full of smiles. Its Grannies lucky day, she said. Shes struck lucky with both of them. How do you mean ? said Patience. Well, said Zhou Ruis wife, Mrs Lian was with Her Old Ladyship when I got there, so I went up to her and told her on the side that Grannie wanted to go now to make sure of getting to the gates in time. Oh she said, she came such a long way with all that stuff. If its getting late, shed better spend the night here and leave tomorrow morning. Well, that was one piece of luck but thats nothing to what followed, because Her Old Ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this Grannie Liu was, and when Mrs Lian told her, she said, Oh, Ive been just longing for someone with a bit of age and experience to talk to! Bring her here! Introduce her to me! Now that really was a stroke of luck! She urged Grannie Liu to leave her place on the kang and go over to the other apartment but the old countrywoman was seized with a sudden attack of shyness. Look at me! Dear soul, Im in no fit state to see her now! Tell her Ive already left! Go on, you go and see her! said Patience. Itll be all right. Our old lady is always very nice to poor or elderly people Shes not the least bit pretentious or stuck-up like some I could mention. If youre nervous about meeting high-ups, Mrs Zhou and I will go with you to give you confidence. She proceeded, with Mrs Zhous assistance, to conduct the old woman to her interview. When they saw Patience coming out of the courtyard, the pages on duty at the gate stood up, and two of them came running up to her. Miss! Miss! Whats it this time? said Patience. Ive been waiting to catch you for hours, Miss, said the first of the boys. My mas took ill and Ive got to go and fetch the doctor for her. Will it be all right if I take the night -1536 off? Youre a nice lot! said Patience. Its my belief that youve got it all worked out between you so that one of you gets a holiday every day. And instead of telling the Mistress proper-1 y, as youre supposed to do, you come round to me with these sad stories and make me take the responsibility. When Stoppo did this the other day, the Master called for him while he was still away and I got into trouble by speaking jip for him. The Master accused me of doing favours. And now you want to do the same thing. His ma really is ill, Miss, said Zhou Ruis wife. Im sure it would be in order for you to let him go. All right, then. But mind youre back first thing tomorrow, Patience told the boy. Now you heard that, didnt you? First thing. Because Ive got work for you to do. No lying in bed until you can feel the sun on your backside I And I want you to take a message to Brightie for me on the way. Tell him the Mistress says that if he hasnt handed in the test of that interest by tomorrow, she wont ask him for it again, because shell know that hes keeping it for himself. The boy promised to deliver the message and scampered off, delighted to be released. By the time Patience and her charges arrived at Grandmother Jias apartment, all the young denizens of Prospect Garden had for some time been assembled there in attendance, so that as Grannie Liu entered the room, she was confronted by a bevy of unfamiliar young ladies, all resplendent in ornaments of pearl and kingfisher, like a bed of beautiful flowers, none of which she could give a name to.
The discussion consisted quite simply in finding out what would give Grandmother Jia most pleasure and deciding that that was what they should do. When all had been settled between them and You-shi was rising to go, she took out the two taels that Faithful had contributed and handed them back to her. Here you are. We shant be needing this. From Grandmother Jias apartment she went over to have a few words with Lady Wang. When Lady Wang presently left her to go into her Buddhist chapel, You-shi took advantage of her absence to return Sunclouds contribution then, since xi-feng was safely out of the way, she offered Aunt Zhou and Aunt Zhao their contributions as well. But the concubines were too scared to take them. Go on I said You-shi encouragingly. I know how hard-up you are. You cant afford to give away money like this. If Feng finds Out, I shall take full responsibility myself. They took the money then, voluble in their gratitude. In a twinkling the second of the ninth was upon them. The denizens of the Garden had been informed that You-shi was planning an impressive variety of entertainment not only the customary plays, but also juggling, acrobatics, story-telling by blind ballad-singersin short, everything one could possibly think of that might contribute to the success of the occasion and the pleasure of the participants. Li Wan reminded the cousins that the second of the month was also one of the regular meeting-days of the poetry club. Xi-chun was, of course, excused. But why hasnt Bao-yu turned up? she asked. I suppose hes so intent on enjoying the film that he has forgotten his former enthusiasm for these more civilized amusements!Go and see what hes doing, she said to one of the maids, and tell him to come here immediately. The maid was a long time gone. Miss Aroma says he went out first thing this morning, she reported when she eventually returned. The others were incredulous. Thats ridiculous. How could he possibly have gone out? The girl must have got the message wrong. They sent Ebony over to ask again but Ebony only confirmed what the first maid had said. Yes, lie really has gone out. It seems that one of his friends has died and hes had to go out to condole. Thats absolutely absurd, said Tan-chun. Whatever the reason, he cant possibly have gone out today. Fetch Aroma here and Ill speak to her myself. As if anticipating a summons, Aroma herself walked in while she was saying this. Li Wan tackled her at once. Theres absolutely no justification for his going out today, whatever the reason, she said. In the first place its Mrs Lians birthday and Her Old Ladyship was particularly anxious that we should all join in celebrating it this year its monstrous that he should go off on his own like this when everyone else from both houses is here for the celebration. And in the second place this is the first regular meeting of our poetry club and he hasnt even asked leave to stay away. Aroma sighed miserably. Last night he told me that he had some important business to attend to first thing this morning. He said he had to go to the Prince of Beijings palace, but that he would be back again as soon as possible. I told him not to go, but he insisted. When he got up first thing this morning, he asked for a suit of mourning to wear. It looks as if some important person in the Prince of Beijings household must have died. If thats really so, said Li Wan, then he ought to have gone. But then, on the other hand, he ought to have got back by now. After a brief discussion the cousins decided to proceed without him and to punish him in some way when he returned. Before they could begin, however, a summons arrived from Grandmother Jia to join her in the mansion. As soon as they had done so, Aroma reported Bao-yus absence. The old lady was displeased and sent someone to fetch him back. Bao-yu, evidently with some secret business on his mind, had spoken the day before to Tealeaf about this excursion, I have to go out first thing tomorrow, he told him. I want you to be waiting for me outside the back gate with two horses ready saddled. No one else is to accompany me but you. Tell Li Gui that I am going to the Prince of Beijings, and that he must stop anyone going out to look for me. He can tell them that the Prince is detaining me and that I shall come back as soon as I can get away. Though somewhat mystified by these orders, Tealeaf felt he had no choice but to follow them out, and before dawn next morning was waiting with two horses ready saddled outside the tear gate of the Garden.
I swear to you there isnt a fifth. Theres no need for you to swear, said Dai-yu. I know very well that Cousin Dai has a place in your heart. The trouble is that as soon as Cousin Chai comes along, Cousin Dai gets forgotten. You imagine these things, said Bao-yu. It really isnt as you say. Yesterday when Little Miss Bao wouldnt tell lies for you, why did you turn to me and expect me to? How would you like it if I did that sort of thing to you? Bao-chai happened to come along while they were still talking and the two of them moved aside to avoid her. Bao-chai saw this clearly, but pretended not to notice and hurried by with lowered eyes. She went and sat with Lady Wang for a while and from there went on to Grandmother Jias. Bao-yu was already at his grandmothers when she got there. Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be Someone who had a jade to match the gold. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her mothers chatter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of her, was unaware of her embarrassment. But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest. Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads? She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to pull it off now in obedience to his request. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off While she was struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm, and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him. If that arm were growing on Cousin Lins body, he speculated, I might hope one day to touch it. What a pity its hers I Now I shall never have that good fortune. Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yus remark had reminded him of. He looked again at Bao-chai -2458 that face like the full moons argent bowl those eyes like sloes those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived and brows by none but Natures pencil lined. This was beauty of quite a different order from Dai-yus. Fascinated by it, he continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression so that when she handed him the chaplet, which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist, he failed to take it from her. Seeing that he had gone off into one of his trances, Bao-chai threw down the chaplet in embarrassment and turned to go. But Dai-yu was standing on the threshold, biting a corner of her handkerchief, convulsed with silent laughter. I thought you were so delicate, said Bao-chai. What are you standing there in the draught for? Ive been in the room all the time, said Dai-yu. I just this moment went to have a look outside because I heard the sound of something in the sky. It was a gawping goose. Where? said Bao-chai. Let me have a look. Oh, said Dai-yu, as soon as I went outside he flew away with a whir-r-r- She flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of Bao-yus face. Ow! he exclaimedShe had flicked him in the eye. The extent of the damage will be examined in the following chapter. CHAPTER 29 In which the greatly blessed pray for yet greater blessings And the highly strung rise to new heights of passion WE told in the last chapter how, as Bao-yu was standing lost in one of his trances, Dai-yu flicked her handkerchief at him and made him jump by inadvertently catching him in the eye with it. Who did that? he asked. Dai-yu laughingly shook her head. Im sorry. I didnt mean to. Bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose, and I accidentally flicked you while I was showing her how it went. Bao-yu rubbed his eye.
Then they looked at Bao-chais Guard the sweet scent behind closed courtyard door, And with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot! The carmine hue their summer sisters wore These snowy autumn blossoms envy not Pot beauty in plain whiteness best appears, And only in white jade is found no spot. Chaste, lovely flowers! Silent, they seem to pray To autumns White God at the close of day. -1014 Li Wan smiled. That has the All-spice touch all right! Next they looked at Bao-yus poem. White Autumns sister stands beside the door Like summer snow her blossoms till the pot A Yang-fei rising naked from the bath, With a cool, chaste allure that she had not. The dawn wind could not dry those pearly tears With which nights rain each flowerets eye did spot. Pensive and grave, her blossoms gently sway, While a sad flute laments the dying day 5 . When they had finished reading, Bao-yu said he liked Tan-chuns poem best of the three, but Li Wan insisted that Bao-chais was superior. It had more character she said. She was about to press Dai-yu for her contribution when Dai-yu sauntered in of her own volition. Oh! have you all finished? She picked up a brush and proceeded, writing rapidly and without a pause, to set down the poem that was already completed in her mind. She wrote on the first sheet of paper that came to hand and, having finished, threw it nonchalantly across the table for the others to inspect. -720 Beside the half-raised blind, the half-closed door, Crushed ice for earth and white jade for the pot, They had got no further than the first couplet, when Bao-yu broke out into praises. Clever! How do you get these ideas? -720 Three parts of whiteness from the pear-tree stolen, -384 One part from plum for scent which pear has not All of them were impressed by this second couplet. This is good. Original. Its quite different from the other three. -720 Moon-maidens stitched them with white silken thread, And virgins tears the new-made flowers did spot, Which now, like bashful maids that no word say, Lean languid on the breeze at close of day. Yes, this is the best, they said. This is the best of the four. For elegance and originally, yes, said Li Wan but for character and depth I prefer Lady All-spices. I think thats a fair judgement, said Tan-chun. I think River Queens has to take second place. At all events, said Li Wan, Green Boys is bottom. Do you accept that judgement, Green Boy? Oh yes, said Bao-yu. Its a perfectly fair one. Mine is just not a good poem. Buthe smiled hopefullyI think we ought to reconsider the placing of All-spices and River Queens contributions. You agreed to abide by my decisions, said Li Wan. I dont think the rest of you have any say in the matter. If anyone questions a decision of mine in future, he will have to pay a penalty. Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter drop. I propose that our two meetings should be on the second and sixteenth of each month, said Li Wan. On those occasions I shall be responsible for choosing the subjects and the rhymes. If any of you ever feels like having an extra meeting in between those dates, theres nothing to stop you. In fact, theres nothing to stop you having a meeting every day, if you feel like it. But thats entirely up to you. On the second and sixteenth you must all come round to my place, and the meetings on those two days are my responsibility. We really ought to have a name for the club, said Bao-yu. We dont want anything banal, said Tan-chun on the other hand we dont want anything too weird and wonderful. As we started off with a poem about white crab-blossom, why dont we simply call ourselves The Crab-flower Club? That might have seemed a somewhat banal title other things being equal, but in our case it wouldnt be because it would commemorate our founding meeting. Tan-chuns proposal was followed by general discussion. After partaking of the liquid and other refreshment which she provided, the party then broke up, some returning to their own apartments in the Garden, some going on to Grandmother Jias or Lady Wangs apartments outside. Our record leaves them at this point and does not specify. Aroma had been present when Bao-yu received Tan-chuns letter and had seen him rush off excitedly with Ebony as soon as he had finished reading it, but without having any idea what the cause of his excitement might be.
He could see several girls there sweeping, all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and ornaments in their hair, but no sign of the quiet, neat girl of the day before. He went outside in his slippers to look around, pretending that he had gone out to inspect the flowers. He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of the cloister-like covered walk, but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he could not make out who it was. He approached and looked more closely. It was she, yesterdays girl, standing there on her own, apparently lost in thought. He was a little shy of ad-dressing her at that particular moment and was still hesitating when Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash. He had to go in again without having spoken to her. While Crimson stood there musing, she suddenly became aware that Aroma was beckoning to her, and hurried up to see what she wanted. Our spittoon is broken, Aroma said. Can you go to Miss Lins and ask them if they will lend us one until we can get a replacement? Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiads House. When she got to Green Haze Bridge, she stopped a moment to look around. She noticed that cloth screens had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill, and remembered that this was the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees. She could just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on some rocks supervising them. She would have liked to go over, but did not quite dare, and having collected the spittoon, returned, in very low spirits, and lay down in her own room to brood. The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took no notice. Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-tengs lady. A message had already been received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the invitation was from her brothers wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to. Wang Zi-tengs other. sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until the evening. Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wangs kang, called for a candle to be lit, and, with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and shortly after that informing G6lden ?hat she was standing in his light. The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no noticeall, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly counselled some restraint Try not to throw your weight about so! she said. Its silly to put peoples backs up. Jia Huan scowled angrily I know what Im doing, he said. Iont talk to me like a child! Youre friends with Bao-yu nowadays, arent you? You dont like me any more. I know. Ive watched you both. Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger You ungrateful thing! Youre like the dog that bit L Dong-bin you dont know a friend when you see one. They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in, having just got back from the birthday party. Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited, whether the plays had been any good, and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink. In a little while Bao-yu, too, arrived, and after a few respectful words to his mother, asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots. Disencumbered, he flung himself into his mothers bosom to be fondled and petted by her, then, worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck, he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the days events. Youve been drinking again, child, said Lady Wang. Your face is burning.
The chamberlain smiled. If you say so, then no doubt that is where we shall find him. I shall go and look there immediately. If I do find him there, you will hear no more from me if not, I shall be back again for further instructions. So saying, he hurriedly took his leave. Jia Zheng, his eyes glaring and his mouth contorted with rage, went after the chamberlain to see him out. He turned briefly towards Bao-yu as he was leaving the hall. You stay where you are. I shall deal with you when I get back. As he was on his way in again after seeing the chamberlain off the premises, Jia Huan with two or three pages at his heels came stampeding across the courtyard. Hit that boy! Jia Zheng shouted, outraged. But Jia Huan, reduced to a quivering jelly of fear by the sight of his father had already jolted to a halt and was standing with bowed head in front of him. And what is the meaning of this? said Jia Zheng. What has become of the people who are supposed to look after you? Why do they allow you to gallop around in this extraordinary fashion? His voice rose to a shout Where are the people responsible for taking this boy to school? Jia Huan saw in his fathers anger an opportunity of exercising his malice. I didnt mean to run, Father, but just as I was going by the well back there I saw the body of a maid who had drowned herselfall swollen up with water, and her head all swollen. It was horrible. I just couldnt help myself. Jia Zheng heard him with incredulous horror. What are you saying? Who has drowned herself? Such a thing has never before happened in our family. Our family has always been lenient and considerate in its treatment of inferiors. It is one of our traditions. I suppose it is because I have been too neglectful of household matters during these last few years. Those in charge have felt encouraged to abuse their authority, until finally an appalling thing like this can happen an innocent young life cut off by violence. What a terrible disgrace to our ancestors if this should get about! He turned and shouted a command. Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da! Sir! chorused the pages, and were on the point of doing so when Jia Huan impulsively stepped forward, threw himself on his knees and clung to his fathers skirts. Dont be angry with me, Father, but apart from the servants in Lady Wangs room, no one else knows anything about this. I heard my mother say He broke off and glanced around behind him. Jia Zheng understood and signaled with his eyes to the pages, who obediently withdrew some distance back to either side of the courtyard. Jia Huan continued in a voice lowered almost to a whisper. My mother told me that the day before yesterday, in Lady Wangs room, my brother Bao-yu tried to rape one of Her Ladyships maids called Golden, and when she wouldnt let him, he gave her a beating and Golden was so upset that she threw herself in the well and was drowned, Jia Zheng, whose face had now turned to a ghastly gold-leaf colour, interrupted him with a dreadful cry. Fetch Bao-yu ! He began to stride -towards -his study, shouting to all and sundry as he went. If anyone tries to stop me this time, I shall make over my house and property and my post at the Ministry and everything else I have to him and Bao-yu. I absolutely refuse to be responsible for the boy any longer. I shall cut off my few remaining hairs those that worry and wretchedness have left me and look for some clean and decent spot to end my days in. Perhaps in that way I shall escape the charge of having disgraced my ancestors by rearing this unnatural monster as my son. When they saw the state he was in, the literary gentlemen and senior menservants who were waiting for him in the study, guessed that Bao-yu must be the cause of it and, looking at each other with various grimaces, biting their thumbs or sticking their tongues out, hastily retreated from the room. Jia-Zheng entered it alone and sat down, stiffly upright, in a chair. He was breathing heavily and his face was bathed in tears. Presently, when he had regained his breath, he barked out a rapid series of commands Bring Bao-yu here. Get a heavy bamboo. Get some rope to tie him with. Close the courtyard gates. If anyone tries to take word through inside, kill him! Sir! Sir!Sir! the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands, and some of them went off to look for Bao-yu.
Yes said Xi-feng, quickly rising to her feet and going over to the doorway, I thought I saw someones shadow there just now. Jia Lian walked smiling into the room. Ive come to ask if you are going on the fourteenth, Grandma, so, that I shall know whether to get the carriages ready or not. In that case why didnt you come in straight away, said Grandmother Jia, instead of lurking around outside? I could see that you were playing cards, said Jia Lian with a somewhat artificial smile. I didnt like to interrupt you. I was hoping to get my wife to come out so that I could ask her. And what is there so extraordinarily urgent about this that you needed to ask her now? said Grandmother Jia. If youd waited until she got home, you could have asked her all you wanted to then. Why this extraordinary conscientiousness all of a sudden? Eavesdropping is what you were up to more likely, or spying for somebody else. Whatever it was, you gave me a nasty turn, creeping around in that sneaky, underhand way. Disgusting creature! Your wife will be with me a long time yet playing cards. Better get back to that Zhao Er woman while you have the chance and carry on where you left off with your plans- for poisoning her! The others all laughed. It was Bao Ers wife, my old love, not Zhao Ers, said Faithful, laughing. Thats what I said, didnt I? Grandmother Jia snapped. Well, Zhao or Bao or brown cow how can !be expected to remember such things? The very mention of them makes me feel angry. There were three generations of the family above me when I came to this household as a young bride, and now there are three generations below me, and Ive seen many shocking and many wicked and many peculiar things during the fifty-four years since first I came here, but this sort of thing is simply outside my experience. Now be off with you! Jia Lian bolted, not daring to say a word. Patience, who had been standing meanwhile outside the window, quietly mocked him as he came out I told you so, but you wouldnt listen. You walked straight into the net, didnt you? Just at that moment Lady Xing came out. This is all Fathers doing, said Jia Lian. Now we have to face the consequences. Unfilial wretch I said Lady Xing. Some people would die for their fathers, but you a few harmless words and you are already whining and complaining. Whats the matter with you? You havent been hurt yetthough I should look out, if I were you Fathers been pretty angry these last few days. Come on, you must hurry back, Mother, said Jia Lian. He sent me to fetch you a long time ago. He saw his mother out of the main part of the mansion and round to Jia Shes quarters next door. Lady Xing then gave her husband, in briefest possible outline, a report of what had happened and since it was now evident that nothing more could be done about Faithful, Jia She had to put up with his mortification as best he could. He did, however, from that day onwards, discontinue all duty calls on his mother on the pretext of being ill. Lady Xing and Jia Lian were sent to make the mandatory calls on her in his stead. Meanwhile his agents scoured the market for likely girls. A suitable one was eventually purchased for the sum of five hundred taels a seventeen-year-old girl called Carmine, who was duly installed in his room. But that is another part of our story. The card-game continued until dinner-time, and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up. Of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record. -347 The fourteenth came. Before it was yet daylight, Lai Das wife came round once more to renew her invitation. Grandmother Jia responded enthusiastically and, taking Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and the young people along with her, spent a considerable part of the day in the Lai familys private garden. Lai Das garden was not, of course, to be compared with Prospect Garden nevertheless it was spacious and well-made and among its pools, rocks, trees and pavilions were to be found several features of striking interest or beauty. The menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer part of the establishment included Xue Pan, Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Rong and a number of the more closely related members of the Jia clan outside the immediate family. Jia She was conspicuously absent. Young Lai had also invited some of his office holding colleagues and a few young men of good family as congenial company for the Jias.
Whether you have lunch there or not, you ought to keep Cousin Lin company. She is very upset, you know. Why dont you? Oh, leave her alone! said Bao-yu. Shell be all right presently. Soon they had finished eating, and Bao-yu, afraid that Grandmother Jia might be worrying and at the same time anxious to rejoin Dai-yu, hurriedly demanded tea to rinse his mouth with. Tan-chun and Xi-chun were much amused. Why are you always in such a hurry, Bao? they asked him. Even your eating and drinking all seems to be done in a rush. You should let him finish quickly, so that he can get back to his Dai-yu, said Bao-chai blandly. Dont make him waste time here with us. Bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea, and made straight for the west courtyard where his Grandmother Jias apartment was. But as he was passing by the gateway of Xi-fengs courtyard, it happened that Xi-feng herself was standing in her doorway with one foot on the threshold, grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her direction. Ah, just the person I wanted to see! she said, as soon as she caught sight of Bao-yu. Come inside. I want you to write something down for me. Bao-yu was obliged to follow her indoors. Xi-feng called for some paper, an inkstone and a brush, and at once began dictating Crimson lining-damask forty lengths, dragonet figured satin forty lengths, miscellaneous Imperial gauze one hundred lengths, gold necklets four, Here, what is this? said Bao-yu. It isnt an invoice and it isnt a presentation list. How am I supposed to write it? Never you mind about that, said Xi-feng. As long as I know what it is, thats all that matters. just put it down anyhow. Bao-yu wrote down the four items. As soon as he had done so, Xi-feng took up the paper and folded it away. Now, she said, smiling pleasantly, theres something I want to talk to you about. I dont know whether youll agree to this or not, but theres a girl in your room called Crimson whom Id like to work for me. If I find you someone to replace her with, will you let me have her? There are so many girls in my room, said Bao-yu. Please take any you have a fancy to. You really dont need to ask me about it. In that case, said Xi-feng, Ill send for her straight away. Please do, said Bao-yu, and started to go. Hey, come back! said Xi-feng. I havent finished with you yet. Ive got to see Grandma now, said Bao-yu. If youve got anything else to say, you can tell me on my way back. When he got to Grandmother Jias apartment, they had all just finished lunch. Grandmother Jia asked him if he bad had anything nice to eat with his mother. There wasnt anything nice, he said. But I had an extra bowl of rice. Then, after the briefest pause Wheres Cousin Lin ? In the inner room said Grandmother Jia. In the inner room a maid stood below the kang blowing on a flat-iron. Up on the kang two maids were marking some material with a chalked string, while Dai-yu, her head bent low over her work, was engaged in cutting something from it with her shears. What are you making? he asked her. Youll give yourself a headache, stooping down like that immediately after your lunch. Dai-yu took no notice and went on cutting. That corner looks a bit creased still, said one of the maids. it will have to be ironed again. Leave it alone! said Dai-yu, laying down her shears. It will be all right presently. Bao-yu found her reply puzzling. Bao-chai, Tan-chun and the rest had now arrived in the outer room and were talking to Grandmother Jia. Presently Bao-chai drifted inside and asked Dai-yu what she was doing then, when she saw that she was cutting material, she exclaimed admiringly. What a lot of things you can do, Dai! Fancy, even dress-making now! Dai-yu smiled malignantly. Oh, its all lies, really. I just do it to fool people. Ive got something to tell you that I think will amuse you, Dai, said Bao-chai pleasantly.
At twilight, when the cuckoo sings no more, The Maiden with her rake goes in at door And lays her down between the lamplit walls, While a chill rain against the window falls. I know not why my hearts so strangely sad, Half grieving for the spring and yet half glad Glad that it came, grieved it so soon was spent. So soft it came, so silently it went! Last night, outside, a mournful sound was heard The spirits of the flowers and of the bird. But neither bird nor flowers would long delay, Bird lacking speech, and flowers too shy to stay. And then I wished that I had wings to fly After the drifting flowers across the sky Across the sky to the worlds farthest end, The flowers last fragrant resting-place to find. But better their remains in silk to lay And bury underneath the wholesome clay, Pure substances the pure earth to enrich, Than leave to soak and stink in some foul ditch. Can I, that these flowers obsequies attend, Divine how soon or late my life will end? Let others laugh flower-burial to see Another year who will be burying me? As petals drop and spring begins to fail, The bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale. One day, when spring has gone and youth has fled. The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead. -1983 All this was uttered in a voice half-choked with sobs for the words recited seemed only to inflame the grief of the reciterindeed, Bao-yu, listening on the other side of the rock, was so overcome by them that he had already flung him-self weeping upon the ground. But the sequel to this painful scene will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER 28 A crimson cummerbund becomes a pledge of friendship And a chaplet of medicine-beads becomes a source of embarrassment ON the night before the festival, it may be remembered, Lin Dai-yu had mistakenly supposed Bao-yu responsible for Sky-brights refusal to open the gate for her. The ceremonial farewell to the flowers of the following morning had transformed her pent-up and still smouldering resentment into a more generalized and seasonable sorrow. This had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave. Meditation on the fate of flowers had led her to a contemplation of her own sad and orphaned lot she had burst into tears, and soon. after had begun a recitation of the poem whose words we recorded in the preceding chapter. Unknown to her, Bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by rockery. At first he merely nodded and sighed sympathetically but when he heard the words Can J, that these flowers obsequies attend, Divine how soon or late my life will end? and, a little later, -800 One day when spring has gone and youth has fled, The Maiden and the flowers will both be dead. he flung himself on the ground in a fit of weeping, scattering the earth all about him with the flowers he had been carrying in the skirt of his gown. Lin Dai-yu dead! A world from which that delicate, flowerlike countenance had irrevocably departed! It was unutterable anguish to think of it. Yet his sensitized imagination did now consider itwent on, indeed, to consider a world from which the others, tooBao-chai, Caltrop, Aroma and the resthad also irrevocably departed. Where would he be then? What would have become of him? And what of the Garden, the rocks, the flowers, the trees? To whom would they belong when he and the girls were no longer there to enjoy them? Passing from loss to loss in his imagination, he plunged deeper and deeper into a grief that seemed inconsolable. As the poet says Flowers in my eyes and bird-song in my ears Augment my loss and mock my bitter tears. Dai-yu, then, as she stood plunged in her own private sorrowing, suddenly heard the sound of another person crying bitterly on the rocks above her. The others are always telling me Im a case, she thought. Surely there cant be another case up there? But on looking up she saw that it was Bao-yu. Pshaw! she said crossly to herself. I thought it was another girl, but all the time it was that cruel, hate Hateful she had been going to say, but clapped her mouth shut before uttering it. She sighed instead and began to walk away. By the time Bao-yus weeping was over, Dai-yu was no longer there. He realized that she must have seen him and have gone away in order to avoid him. Feeling suddenly rather foolish, he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes.
Lets drop the whole subject and say no more about it. Well have Caltrop in and get her to pour you a nice cup of tea. I don t want any tea, thank you, said Bao-chai. As soon as Mamma has washed, I shall be going back into the Garden with her. Let me look at that-locket of yours, said Xue Pan. I-think it needs dipping again. Whatever for? said Bao-chai. The gildings as bright as new. Isnt it time you had a few more clothes? said Xue Pan. Let me know what colours and what sort of patterns you want. I wouldnt know what to do with them, said Bao-chai. I havent yet worn all the things Ive got. Shortly after this exchange Aunt Xue re-emerged from changing her clothes and, taking Bao-chai by the hand, went through into the Garden with her, leaving Xue Pan to go off on his own. Once in the Garden, Aunt Xue and Bao-chai made their way straight to Green Delights. From the large number of maids and older women they found when they got there waiting outside on the verandah or in the ante-room inside, they knew that Grandmother Jia and the other ladies must have arrived there before them. They exchanged greetings with the latter on entering, after which they went over to the couch on which Bao-yu lay, to inquire if he was feeling any better. Seeing Aunt Xue, he attempted to raise himself a little. Thank you, he said, I am a little better. But what a lot of trouble I am causing! I feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me. Aunt Xue made him lie down again. If theres anything you want, she said, do please let me know. I certainly shall, he said, if I can think of anything. Is there anything you fancy to eat? said Lady Wang. We can order it for you when we go back presently. I cant think of anything, said Bao-yu, unless I did quite like that soup we had once with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it. Xi-feng, who was standing by listening, gave a crow of laughter. Listen to that, now! What low tastes the boy has! What-ever makes you want to eat that leathery old stuff ? Have it made, have it made! said Grandmother Jia vehemently. Let the boy have it by all means. Dont be in such a hurry, Grannie! said Xi-feng laughing. Im trying to think whos got the moulds that they need for making the little shapes with. She turned and ordered one of the old women in attendance to go and ask the chief cook but though the old woman was a long time gone, she came back empty-handed. Cook says the four moulds for the soup-shapes were handed in some time ago on your instructions. Xi-feng thought for a bit. Yes, I remember now I did get them back from her. But I cant remember who I gave them to. I should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room. She sent someone to the tea-room stewardess but she hadnt got them either. In the end they turned out to be with the plate stewardess, who looked after the gold and silver. Aunt Xue was the first to examine them when they arrived. There were four moulds fitted into a single box. They were made of silver, a foot or so long and about an inch wide. Along the face of each mould were rows of very finely cut dies, each about the size of a bean, thirty or forty on each mould. On one of the moulds the dies were in the shape of chrysanthemums, on another of plum-flowers, on the third of lotus pods and leaves, and on the remaining one of caltrops. Aunt Xue turned to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang with amusement. You people really do think of everything! All these patterns for a bowl of soup! If you hadnt told me, I should never have guessed what these things were for. Xi-feng answered her before either of the older ladies could reply. You wouldnt know about these anyway, Aunt. Its something they thought up last year for Her Graces visit. They cut shapes with these things out of some special doughIm not sure exactly what its made ofand put them in a clear soup. Theres supposed to be a suggestion of autumn lotuses in the flavour, but it doesnt taste very much really. Its certainly not the sort of thing youd want to eat very often. In fact, I think the only time we ever had it was when they made some for the visit.
Xi-feng registered surprise You mean to tell me that this is the Lins daughter? She laughed. That couple of old sticks? I can never get a peep out of either of them. Ive always maintained that Lin Zhi-xiao and his wife were the perfect match one hears nothing and the other says nothing. Well! To think they should have produced a bright little thing like this between them!How old are you? she asked Crimson. Sixteen. And whats your name? Crimson, madam. I used to be called Jade, but they made me change it on account of Master Bao. Xi-feng looked away with a frown of displeasure. I should think so too, she muttered. Odious people! One can hear them saying it Weve got a Jade in our family the same as you, or some such impertinence. She turned to Li Wan again I dont think you know, Wan, but I told this girls mother that as Lai Das wife is so busy nowadays that she doesnt even know who half the girls in the household are any longer, I wanted her to pick out a couple of likely-looking girls to work under me. Now she promised that she would do this but you see, not only has she not done so, but shes actually gone and sent her own daughter to work for someone else. Do you suppose she really thinks her girl would have had such a terrible time with me? Dont be so touchy, said Li Wan. Her mother is not to blame. The girl had already started service in the Garden before you ever spoke to her about it. Oh well, in that case, said Xi-feng, recovering her good humour, Ill have a word with Bao-yu about it tomorrow. Ill tell him to find someone else and let me have this girl to work under me. Still she turned to Crimson, perhaps we ought to ask the party most concerned if she is willing. Crimson smiled. As to being willing or not, madam, I dont think its my place to say. But I do know this that if I was to work for you, I should get to know whats what and all the inside and outside of household management. Im sure it would be wonderful experience. Just then a maid arrived from Lady Wangs asking for Xi-feng, who promptly excused herself to Li Wan and left. Crimson returned to Green Delightswhere our story now leaves her. We now return to Dai-yu, who, having slept so little the night before, was very late getting up on the morning of the festival. Hearing that the other girls were all out in the garden speeding the fairies and fearing to be teased by them for her lazy habits, she hurried over her toilet and went out as soon as it was completed. A smiling Bao-yu appeared in the gate-way as she was stepping down into the courtyard. Well, coz, he said, I hope you didnt tell on me yesterday. You had me worrying about it all last night. Dai-yu turned back, ignoring him, to address Nightingale inside When you do the room, leave one of the casements open so that the parent swallows can get in. And put the lion doorstop on the bottom of the blind to stop it flapping. And dont forget to put the cover back on the burner after youve lighted the incense. She made her way across the courtyard, still ignoring him. Bao-yu, who knew nothing of the little drama that had taken place outside his gate the night before, assumed that she was still angry about his unfortunate lapse earlier on that same day, when he had offended her susceptibilities with a somewhat risqu quotation from The Western Chamber. He offered her now, with energetic bowing and hand-pumping, the apologies that the previous days emergency had caused him to neglect. But Dai-yu walked straight past him and out of the gate, not deigning so much as a glance in his direction, and stalked off in search of the others. Bao-yu was nonplussed. He began to suspect that something more than he had first imagined must be wrong. Surely it cant only be because of yesterday lunchtime that shes carrying on in this fashion? There must be something else. On the other hand, I didnt get back until late and I didnt see her again last night, so how could I have offended her? Preoccupied with these reflections, he followed her at some distance behind. Not far ahead Bao-chai and Tan-chun were watching the ungainly courtship dance of some stork. When they saw Dai-yu coming, they invited her to join them, and the three girls stood together and chatted. Then Bao-yu arrived. Tan-chun greeted him with sisterly concern How have you been keeping, Bao?
Dont take it to heart so, it was only a joke. You shouldnt be so excitable. Dont, whatever you do, admit that what you said was wounding, said Xiang-yun. Say Im excitable and put me in the wrong! While she said this, she was undoing the knotted silk hand-kerchief and extracting one of the three rings from it. She handed it to Aroma. Aroma was greatly touched. Ive got one like this already, she said. It was given to me when you sent those ones the other day to the young ladies. But fancy your bringing this one here specially! Now I know you havent forgotten me. Its little things like this that show you what a person really is. The ring itself isnt worth much, I know. Its the thought behind it. Who gave you the one youve already got? said Xiang-yun. Miss Bao, said Aroma. Ah, said Xiang-yun, Miss Bao. And I was thinking it must have been Miss Lin. Often when Im at home I think to myself that of all my cousins Bao-chai is the one I like best. Its a pity we couldnt have been born of the same mother. With her for an elder sister it wouldnt matter so much being an orphan. Her eyelids reddened as she said this and she seemed to be on the verge of tears. Now, now, now! said Bao-yu. Dont say things like that. And why not? said Xiang-yun. Oh, I know your trouble. Youre afraid that Cousin Lin might hear and get angry with me again for praising Cousin Bao. Thats whats worrying you, isnt it? Aroma giggled. Oh Miss Yun! Youre just as outspoken as you used to be. Well, Ive said that you lot are difficult to talk to, said Bao-yu, and I was certainly right! Dont make me sick, said Xiang-yun. You say what you like to us. Its with your Cousin Lin that you have to be so careful. Never mind about that, said Aroma. Joking apart, now I want to ask you a favour. What is it? said Xiang-yun. Ive got a pair of slipper-tops here that Ive already cut the openwork pattern in, but as I havent been very well this last day or two, I havent been able to sew them on to the backing material. Do you think youd have time to do them for me ? Thats rather a strange request, said Xiang-yun. Quite apart from all the clever maids this household employs you have your own full4ime tailors and embroiderers. Why ask me to do your sewing? You could give it to anyone here you liked. They could hardly refuse you. You cant be serious, said Aroma. None of the sewing in this room is allowed to go outside. Surely you knew that? Xiang-yun inferred from this that the slippers in question were for Bao-yu. Oh well, she said, in that case I suppose Id better do them for you. On one condition, though Ill do them if they are for you to wear, but if they are for anyone else, Im afraid I cant. Get along with you! said Aroma. Ask you to make slippers for me? I wouldnt have the nerve. No, Ill be honest with you, theyre not for me. Never mind who theyre for. Just tell yourself that Im the one youll be doing the favour. It isnt that, said Xiang-yun. In the past Ive done lots of things for you. Surely you must know what makes me unwilling now? Im sorry, I dont, said Aroma. What about the person who got in a temper the other day when that fan-case I made for you was compared with hers and cut it up with a pair of scissors? I heard all about that, so dont start protesting. If you expect me to do sewing for you after that, youre just treating me as your drudge. I didnt know at the time it was you who made it, Bao-yu put in hurriedly. He really didnt, said Aroma. I pretended there was someone outside wed just discovered who could do very fine and original needlework. I told him Id got them to do that fan-case for him as a sample. He believed what I said and went around showing it to everyone. Unfortunately while he was doing this he upset you know who and she took a pair of scissors and cut it in pieces. Afterwards he was very anxious to have some more work done by the same person, so I had to tell him who it really was.
Bao-chai laughed. Ive had a hard enough job thinking of lines for this first one. Youve nothing to worry about as far as Im concerned. Dai-yu, without saying a word, quietly relieved Bao-chai of the brush, ticked first Questioning the Chrysanthemums and then the eleventh title, The Dream of the Chrysanthemums, and wrote River underneath each of them. After her, Bao-yu took up the brush and ticked Seeking the Chrysanthemums,. He signed himself Green . Tan-chun now drifted over and looked at the list. Oh, hasnt anyone chosen Wearing the Chrysanthemums yet? she said. Let me do that one. She turned, smilingly, to Bao-yu and pointed a warning finger at him. Weve just made a new rule, by the way. No naked ladies this time, please. You have been warned! Xiang-yun strolled up while she was saying this and ticked Numbers Four and Five Admiring the Chrysanthemums and Arranging the Chrysanthemumsin rapid succession. She signed herself Xiang underneath them. You ought to have a pen-name like the test of us, said Tan-chun. There are various pavilions and studios at home, of course, said Xiang-yun, but I dont live in any of them. It would be rather pointless to call myself after a building like the rest of you. What about that water pavilion Above the Clouds that Lady Jia was telling us about? said Bao-chai. You could call that yours. Even if it doesnt exist any more, you can pretend that it would have been yours. You should call yourself Cloud Maiden. Yes, yes, said the others and before Xiang-yun herself could do anything, Bao-yu had crossed out the Xiang and substituted the word Cloud beneath it. In less time than it would take to eat a meal, poems had been completed for each of the twelve titles. The young poets then wrote out their poems and handed them in to Ying-chun, who copied them out, each with the full pen-name of its author, on to the finest Snow Wave notepaper. Li Wan then read them all through, the others overlooking her. Remembering the Chrysanthemums by Lady Allspice -560 The autumn wind that through the knotgrass blows Blurs the sad gazers eye with unshed tears -560 But autumns guest, who last year graced this plot, Only, as yet, in dreams of night appears. The wild geese from the North are now returning The dhobis thump at evening fills my ears. -560 Those golden flowers for which you see me pine Ill meet once more at this years Double Nine. Seeking the Chrysanthemum by Green Boy -560 The crisp day bids us go on an excursion Resistant to the wineshop doors temptation Some garden, where, before the frosts, was planted The glory of autumn, being our destination Which after weary walk having found, well sing An autumn song with unsubdued elation. And you, gold flowers, if all the poet told You understood, would not refuse his gold! Planting the Chrysanthemums by Green Boy Brought from their nursery and, with loving hands, -560 Planted along the fence and by the door A shower last night their wilting leaves revived, Opening the morning-buds all silver-hoar. Sweet flowers! a thousand autumn songs Ill sing To praise your beauty, and libations pour, And water you, and ridge with earth around. No dust on my wet well-path shall be found! Admiring the Chrysanthemums by Cloud Maiden Transplanted treasures, dear to me as gold Both the pale clumps and those of darker hue! -934 Rare-headed by your wintry bed I sit And, musing, hug my knees and sing to you. -1344 None more than you the villain world disdains None understands your proud heart as I do. -1344 The precious hours of autumn Ill not waste, -934 But bide with you and savour their full taste. Arranging the Chrysanthemums by Cloud Maiden -1344 What greater pleasure than the lute to strum Or sip wine by your delicate display? To hold the gardens fragrance in one vase, -934 And see all autumn in a single spray? -1344 On frosty nights Ill dream you back again, Brave in your garden bed at close of day. Since with your shy disdain I sympathize, -934 Tis you, not summers gaudy blooms I prize. Celebrating the Chrysanthemums by River Queen Down garden walks, in search of inspiration, -934 A restless demon drives me all the time -1344 Then brush blooms into praises, and the mouth Grows scud-sweet, hymning those scents sublime.
And since Master Bao isnt able to tell you Out loud what he wants of you, I, Tealeaf, am praying to you on his behalf. I beseech you, if you still have feelings as you used to when you were on earth, watch over my master from time to time, O spirit. I know you belong to a different world now, but being as its for a special friend of yours that Im asking this, please do it if you can, spirit, for old times sake. And please use what influence you can to see that Master Bao is reborn in his next life as a girl, so that he can spend all his time with you and dont let him be reborn as one of those horrible Whiskered Males he is always on about. At this point he knocked his head several more times on the ground. Bao-yu, who had been listening, could no longer hold back his laughter. Observing that Tealeaf had raised himself once more on all fours and appeared to be about to go on, he kicked him and told him to get up. Stop this nonsense! If anyone hears you, I shall become a laughing-stock. Tealeaf scrambled to his feet, picked up the burner and followed Bao-yu inside. Ive already spoken to the nun about getting you some food, he told Bao-yu as they were going in together. I told her you hadnt eaten yet. You ought to get something inside you. I realize that you came out here because theres a big party and lots of racket at home today and you wanted somewhere peaceful where you could do this. But I think just staying out here in the quiet all day is showing all the respect you need to this person youve just made the offering to. You dont need to fast all day as well. Thats out of the question. That seems reasonable, said Bao-yu. As Im missing the patty all the time that Im here, I am in a way abstaining already so I suppose there can be no harm in my taking a bit of vegetarian stuff. Im glad to hear you say so, said Tealeaf. Of course, there is another way of looking at it. Your going off like this is sure to cause others at home to worry. Now if no one at home was likely to worry, thered be no harm in our not going back until evening. But since they are going to worry, I really think you ought to be getting back soon. For one thing it will set Their Ladyships minds at rest, and for another, it will, in the long run, be more respectful to this person youve just made the offering to. Because if you go home, even if you drink and watch plays, it wont be because you want to, but out of duty to Their Ladyships. Whereas if you stay out here thinking only about the spirit and not caring how worried you make Their Ladyships, youll in fact be making the spirit herself uneasy to think of all the anxiety thats being caused on her behalf. Think it over, Master Bao, and see if you dont agree with me. I can see whats on your mind without much difficulty, said Bao-yu, laughing. Youre afraid that as you are the only one who came out here with me, you will bear all the blame for this outing when we get back. Thats the real reason why Im being treated to all this high-minded advice, isnt it? Well, dont worry! It was all along my intention to go back to the party when I had made the offering. I never said anything about staying out here all day. Ive discharged my vow. If I hurry home now so that the others arent too worried, it seems to me that my obligations to the dead and the living swill both be met. Tealeaf expressed his relief. Still talking, they made their way to the old nuns parlour, or hall of meditation, where they found she had set out a very presentable though, of course, vegetarian repast for them. After briefly sampling it, the two of them mounted and set off again along the road by which they had come Bao-yu at such a pace that Tealeaf was obliged to call out after him to slacken it. Go easy on that horse, Master Bad! He hasnt been ridden very much you need to keep a pretty tight rein on him. Soon they had entered the city gate, and not long after-wards might have been seen slipping into the back gate of the Garden. Bao-yu hurried straight to Green Delights, which he found deserted except for a few old nannies left behind as care-takers. Holy name! they said, their old faces lighting up with pleasure when they saw who it was. Youve come at last! Youve had Miss Aroma nigh out of her mind with worry.
It sounds a very good one, said Lady Wang. But how do we go about collecting the subscriptions ? At this Grandmother Jia became still more animated. Let Aunt Xue and Lady Xing be invited without delay, she told them. Let Bao-yu and the girls be sent for. And You-shi from the other mansion. And why not Lai Das wife and some of the more respected older members of the female staff? Infected by her enthusiasm, the maids and older women-servants went scurrying off in all directions to summon or invite. In less time than it would take to eat a meal, all those invited, young and old, mistress and servant, had been assembled, and the room was packed. Aunt Xue and Grandmother Jia sat on their own facing the multitude, Lady Xing and Lady Wang on chairs at the opposite side of the room beside the door. Bao-chai, Dai-yu, Xiang-yun and the Three Springs sat in a row at the back of the kang behind Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue. Bao-yu half reclined in his grandmothers lap. All the rest stood, shoulder to shoulder, on the floor below. As soon as she saw that they were all assembled, Grandmother Jia gave orders for stools to be brought so that Lai Das mother and various other of the more aged and respected servants present might sit down. It was customary in the Jia household to treat the older generation of servants those who had served the parents of the present masterswith even greater respect than the younger generation of masters, so that in this instance it was not thought at all surprising that You-shi, Xi-feng and Li Wan should remain standing while old Mrs Lai and three or four other old nannies though not without first apologizing for the liberty seated themselves on the stools. Grandmother Jia now smilingly announced the proposal that she had already outlined to Lady Wang. All present, it need hardly be said, were willing to fall in with itsome because they were on good terms with Xi-feng and were genuinely happy to give her pleasure, some because they were afraid of her and welcomed this as an opportunity of getting themselves into her good books, and all because in any case they could afford to do so. Accordingly, as soon as Grandmother Jia had finished speaking, they all enthusiastically and with one voice agreed. Grandmother Jia opened the list with her own subscription Ill give twenty taels. Ill follow Lady Jia, said Aunt Xue. Twenty taels. Lady Xing and Lady Wang called next We obviously cant put ourselves on a level with Lady Jia. Sixteen taels. You-shi and Li Wan, decreasing their call by a like amount, came next Twelve taels. We cant have you paying out that sort of money, Grandmother Jia said to Li Wan, a young widow with no mean of her own. Ill pay yours for you. Now dont get carried away, Grandma! said xi-feng. You ought to do your sums first before you start interfering. Dont forget youve already got two of the young folk, Bao-yu and Cousin Lin, to pay for besides your own contribution. Its all very well promising to pay these additional twelve taels for Li Wan in the heat of the moment, but later on youll be wishing you hadnt. Youll probably end up by saying that it was all because of that wretched Feng that you had to pay out so much money and think of some trick for getting it back from me three or four times over. I know. Dont tell me Im imagining this. This made everyone laugh. All right, said Grandmother Jia, laughing herself. Then what do you propose? Well now, it isnt even my birthday yet, but already Im feeling uncomfortable because so much is being done for me, said Xi-feng. It seems unluckyso many people being put to so much expense on my account while I dont pay a penny myself. Pd feel a lot easier if youd let me pay this contribution for Li Wan then, when the day comes, I shall be able to eat and drink as much as I like without any fear of spoiling my luck. Grandmother Jia hesitated, but consented when Lady Xing and Lady Wang both insisted that this was the best solution. Ive got another suggestion to make, said xi-feng. Your own contribution Is twenty taels, Grandma, and on top of that youre going to be paying contributions for Bao-chai and Cousin Lin. Its true that Aunt Xue will be paying Cousin Chais contribution on top of her twenty taels, but that doesnt seem quite so unfair. What does seem unfair to me is that Mother and Aunt Wang should be paying only sixteen taels each for themselves, yet paying no extras at all for any of the young people.
If it is, take it but if it isnt, I must return it to Mr Yun. Of course its mine, said the second voice. Come on, let me have it! Are you going to give me a reward? I hope I havent taken all this trouble for nothing. I promised you I would give you a reward, and so I shall. Surely you dont think I was deceiving you? All right, I get a reward for bringing it to you. But what about the person who picked it up? Doesnt he get anything? Dont talk nonsense, said the second voice. Hes one of the masters. A master picking up something belonging to one of us should give it back as a matter of course How can there be any question of rewarding him? If you dont intend to reward him, what am I supposed to tell him when I see him? He was most insistent that I wasnt to give you the handkerchief unless you gave him a reward. There was a long pause, after which the second voice replied Oh all right. Let him have this other handkerchief of mine then. That will have to do as his reward - But you must swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone else about this. May my mouth rot and may I die a horrible death if I ever tell anyone else about this, amen! said the first voice. Goodness! said the second voice again. Here we are talking away, and all the time someone could be creeping up outside and listening to every word we say. We had better open these casements then even if anyone outside sees us, theyll think we are having an ordinary conversation and we shall be able to see them and know in time when to stop. Bao-chai, listening outside, gave a start. No wonder they say venery and thievery sharpen the wits, she thought. If they open those windows and see me here, they are going to feel terribly embarrassed. And one of those voices sounds like that proud, peculiar girl Crimson who works in Bao-yus room. If a girl like that knows that I have overheard her doing something she shouldnt be doing, it will be a case of the desperate dog will jump a wall, the desperate man will hazard all therell be a great deal of trouble and I shall be involved in it. There isnt time to hide. I shall have to do as the cicada does when he jumps out of his skin give them something to put them off the scent There was a loud creak as the casement yielded. Bao-chai advanced with deliberately noisy tread. Frowner! she called out gaily. I know where youre hiding. Inside the pavilion Crimson and Trinket, who heard her say this and saw her advancing towards them just as they were opening the casement, were speechless with amazement but Bao-chai ignored their confusion and addressed them genially Have you two got Miss Un hidden away in there? I havent seen Miss Lin, said Trinket. I saw her just now from the river-bank, said Bao-chai. She was squatting down over here playing with something in the water. I was going to creep up and surprise her, but she spotted me before I could get up to her and disappeared round this corner. Are you sure shes not hiding in there? She made a point of going inside the pavilion and searching then, coming out again, she said in a voice loud enough for them to hear If shes not in the pavilion, she must have crept into that grotto. Oh well, if shes not afraid of being bitten by a snake! As she walked away she laughed inwardly at the ease with which she had extricated herself from a difficult situation. I think Im fairly safely Out of that one, she thought. I wonder what those two will make of it. What indeed! Crimson believed every word that Bao-chai had said, and as soon as the latter was at a distance,. she seized hold of Trinket in alarm Oh how terrible! If Miss Lin was squatting there, she must have heard what we said before she went away. Her companion was silent. Oh dear! What do you think shell do? said Crimson. Well, suppose she did hear, said Trinket, its not her back-ache. If we mind our business and she minds hers, theres no reason why anything should come of it. If it were Miss Bao that had heard us, I dont suppose anything would, said Crimson but Miss Lin is so critical and so intolerant. If she heard it and it gets aboutoh dear! But just at that moment Caltrop, Advent, Chess and Scribe were seen approaching the pavilion, and Crimson and Trinket had to drop the subject in a hurry and join in a general conversation.
All of us here are only maids none of us is supposed to be any higher than the rest, you know. Why should she give someone else the best and give me the left-overs? No, Im sorry. I should have had to refuse, even if it meant offending her. I couldnt take a thing like that lying down! Which of us was it that she gave those other dresses to? said Ripple, curious. Ive been home ill these last few days. I must have been away when it happened. Be a sport, Skyeytell us who it was! Why, if I tell you, will you give those dresses back again? Of course not, silly! Id just like to know, said Ripple. I dont care if it was Master Baos little puppy-dog she gave them to, I still think Her Ladyship meant to do me a kindness, and as far as Im concerned, thats all that matters. The other maids laughed. Youd better watch what you say! Thats just who she did give them to Master Baos little dog, Flower. Wicked girls! said Flowers Aroma, laughing in spite of herself, taking my name in vain! Whenever youve got a few moments to spare you are making fun of me. Theres not one of you that will come to a good end! Oh, it was you, said Ripple. Im go sorry, I didnt realize. Oh, I do apologize. All right, thats enough fooling for now, said Aroma. The question is, which of you is going to get that saucer? Better get the vases back too, while were about it, said Musk. The one in Her Old Ladyships room should be safe enough, but I wouldnt be too sure about the one at Her Ladyships. There are so many people in and out of that place especially You Know Who and her lot. If they see anything from our room in there, theyre sure to find some way of breaking it accidentally-on-purpose, if they get half a chance. Her Ladyship wont stop them. She never notices. We ought to get that one back, at least, as soon as we can. Youre right, said Skybright, laying down her sewing. Ill go and get it now. No, Ill go for that, said Ripple. You go and get your saucer. Im going for the vase, said Skybright. Why should you have all the windfalls? You others have all had a go. Now its my turn. You do exaggerate, said Musk. Its only Ripple whos had the luck. And it was only because of the coincidence that Her Ladyship happened to be going through her dresses when she arrived. Do you suppose shell be going through them again if you go there now ? Maybe not, said Skybright, with a tinge of malice. On the other hand maybe shell notice how conscientious I am and pay me two taels a month out of her allowance. You seeshe paused to add this on her way out of the room I know what goes on in here. Theres no need for the play-acting. She ran off with a mocking laugh. Ripple went, too, and fetched the onyx saucer from Tan-chuns room, after which Aroma made ready the things that were to go to Xiang-yun, and called in old Mamma Song One of the nannies attached to Green Delightsto give her instructions for their delivery. Get yourself smartened up and change into your best things, she said. I want you to go out presently and take some things for me to Miss Shis. You can give them to me now, Missand any message that you want me to deliver, said Mamma Song then I can go off straight away, as soon as Ive got myself ready. Aroma fetched two little boxes of lacquer and bamboo basketwork and taking the tops off them, put foxnuts and caltrops in one and a saucerful of chestnut fudge made of chestnut puree steam-cooked with cassia-flavored sugar in the other. These are all our own things or made from our own things freshly gathered in the Garden that Master Bao is sending Miss Shi a taste of, she said. Tell her the onyx saucer the fudge is on is the one she was admiring last time she was here and she is to keep it. This silk bag has got the sewing in that she asked me to do for her. Tell her the needleworks a bit on the rough side, but Im sure shell understand. And say Master Bao sends his regards. And of course I present my compliments. I think thats all. Isnt there any message from Master Bao ? said Mamma Song. Perhaps youd better ask him, Miss, just in case.
Last time she was here, she told me that its quite normal for her to sit up sewing until midnight, said Bao-chai and if her aunt or the other women catch her doing the slightest bit of work for anyone else, they are angry with her. Its all the fault of that pig-headed young master of mine, said Aroma. He refuses to let any of his sewing be done by the seamstresses outside. Every bit of work, large or small, has to be done in his room and I just cant manage it all on my own. Bao-chai laughed. Why do you take any notice of him? Why not simply give it to the seamstresses without telling him? Hes not so easy to fool, said Aroma. He can tell the difference. Im afraid theres nothing for it. I shall just have to work through it all gradually on my own Now just a minute! said Bao-chai. Well think of a way round this. Suppose I were to do some of it for you? Would you really? said Aroma. Id be so grateful if you would. Ill come over with some this evening then. She had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a state of great agitation. Isnt it dreadful? Miss Golden has drowned herself in the well. Which Golden? said Aroma, startled. Which Golden? said the old woman. There arent two Goldens that I know of. Golden from Her Ladyships room, of course, that was dismissed the day before yesterday. Shed been crying and carrying on at home ever since, but nobody paid much attention to her. Then suddenly, when they went to look for her, she wasnt there, and just now someone going to-fetch-water from the well by the south-east corner found body in it and rushed inside for help, and when they fished it out, they found that it was Golden. They did all they could to revive her, but it was too late. She was dead. How strange! said Bao-chai Aroma shook her head wonderingly and a teat or two stole down her cheek. She and Golden had been like sisters to each other. Bao-chai hurried off to Lady Wangs to offer her sympathy. Aroma went back to Green Delights. When Bao-chai arrived at Lady Wangs apartment she found the whole place hushed and still and Lady Wang sitting in the inner room on her own, crying. Deeming it an unsuitable moment to raise the subject of her visit, Bao-chai sat down beside her in silence. Where have you just come from? Lady Wang asked her. The Garden. The Garden, Lady Wang echoed. Did you by any chance see your cousin Bao-yu there? I saw him going out just now wearing his outdoor clothes, but I dont know where he was going to. Lady Wang nodded and gave a sigh. I dont know if youve heard. Something very strange has happened. Golden has drowned herself in a well. That is strange, said Bao-chai. Why ever did she do that? The day before yesterday she broke something of mine, said Lady Wang, and in a moment of anger I struck her a couple of times and sent her back to her mothers. I had only been meaning to leave her there a day or two to punish her. After that I would have had her back again. I never dreamed that she would be so angry with me as to drown herself. Now that she has, I feel that it is all my fault. Its only natural that a kind person like you should see it in that way, said Bao-chai, but in my opinion Golden would never have drowned herself in anger. Its much more likely that she was playing about beside the well and slipped in accidentally. While she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for-her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside. Theres no earthly reason why she should have felt angry enough with you to drown herself. If she did, all I can say is that she was a stupid person and not worth feeling sorry for! Lady Wang sighed and shook her head doubtfully. Well, it may be as you say, but I still feel very uneasy in my mind. Im sure you have no cause, Aunt, said Bao-chai, but if you feel very much distressed, I suggest that you simply give her family a little extra for the funeral. In that way you will more than fulfill any moral obligation you may -have towards her as a mistress. I have just given her mother fifty taels, said Lady Wang. I wanted to give her two new outfits as well from one of the girls wardrobes, but it just so happens that at the moment none of them apart from your Cousin Lin has got anything new that would do.
-1094 O fragrant frailty, that so fears the wind! Most radiant whiteness! Pull moon without spot! White flower-sprite, shake your silken wings! Away! And join with me to hymn the dying day! All complimented Tan-chun on her poem when they had finished reading it. Then they looked at Bao-chais Guard the sweet scent behind closed courtyard door, And with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot! The carmine hue their summer sisters wore These snowy autumn blossoms envy not Pot beauty in plain whiteness best appears, And only in white jade is found no spot. Chaste, lovely flowers! Silent, they seem to pray To autumns White God at the close of day. -1014 Li Wan smiled. That has the All-spice touch all right! Next they looked at Bao-yus poem. White Autumns sister stands beside the door Like summer snow her blossoms till the pot A Yang-fei rising naked from the bath, With a cool, chaste allure that she had not. The dawn wind could not dry those pearly tears With which nights rain each flowerets eye did spot. Pensive and grave, her blossoms gently sway, While a sad flute laments the dying day 5 . When they had finished reading, Bao-yu said he liked Tan-chuns poem best of the three, but Li Wan insisted that Bao-chais was superior. It had more character she said. She was about to press Dai-yu for her contribution when Dai-yu sauntered in of her own volition. Oh! have you all finished? She picked up a brush and proceeded, writing rapidly and without a pause, to set down the poem that was already completed in her mind. She wrote on the first sheet of paper that came to hand and, having finished, threw it nonchalantly across the table for the others to inspect. -720 Beside the half-raised blind, the half-closed door, Crushed ice for earth and white jade for the pot, They had got no further than the first couplet, when Bao-yu broke out into praises. Clever! How do you get these ideas? -720 Three parts of whiteness from the pear-tree stolen, -384 One part from plum for scent which pear has not All of them were impressed by this second couplet. This is good. Original. Its quite different from the other three. -720 Moon-maidens stitched them with white silken thread, And virgins tears the new-made flowers did spot, Which now, like bashful maids that no word say, Lean languid on the breeze at close of day. Yes, this is the best, they said. This is the best of the four. For elegance and originally, yes, said Li Wan but for character and depth I prefer Lady All-spices. I think thats a fair judgement, said Tan-chun. I think River Queens has to take second place. At all events, said Li Wan, Green Boys is bottom. Do you accept that judgement, Green Boy? Oh yes, said Bao-yu. Its a perfectly fair one. Mine is just not a good poem. Buthe smiled hopefullyI think we ought to reconsider the placing of All-spices and River Queens contributions. You agreed to abide by my decisions, said Li Wan. I dont think the rest of you have any say in the matter. If anyone questions a decision of mine in future, he will have to pay a penalty. Bao-yu was obliged to let the matter drop. I propose that our two meetings should be on the second and sixteenth of each month, said Li Wan. On those occasions I shall be responsible for choosing the subjects and the rhymes. If any of you ever feels like having an extra meeting in between those dates, theres nothing to stop you. In fact, theres nothing to stop you having a meeting every day, if you feel like it. But thats entirely up to you. On the second and sixteenth you must all come round to my place, and the meetings on those two days are my responsibility. We really ought to have a name for the club, said Bao-yu. We dont want anything banal, said Tan-chun on the other hand we dont want anything too weird and wonderful. As we started off with a poem about white crab-blossom, why dont we simply call ourselves The Crab-flower Club? That might have seemed a somewhat banal title other things being equal, but in our case it wouldnt be because it would commemorate our founding meeting. Tan-chuns proposal was followed by general discussion. After partaking of the liquid and other refreshment which she provided, the party then broke up, some returning to their own apartments in the Garden, some going on to Grandmother Jias or Lady Wangs apartments outside.
I realized then that I had all along been wrong about you right from the very start. I suddenly realized Im fifteen this year and have no brothers or sisters ever since my m6ther died there has been no oneliterally no one - who has ever spoken to me in that sort of way. Im not surprised Cousin Yun speaks so highly of you. I used to hate it when I heard her praise your kindness, but since experiencing it myself, I know what she means. If it had been you whod said those things in the drinking game, I should have been quite merciless. I should never have kept quiet about it at the time and gently remonstrated about it later, when we were alone together, as you did I knew from that that I had been wrong about you, and that you must really care for me. If my eyes hadnt been opened for me then, I should never be talking to you like this today. Now about this birds nest syrup you want me to take. I know birds nest is fairly easy to come by, but this illness of mine is something I suffer from every year because of my weak constitution. Theres nothing particularly serious about it, its just something that I always get. Yet already everyones put to a huge amount of inconvenience because of it, fetching doctors, brewing medicines, buying ginseng for me and Saigon cinnamon. If I now come up with some fancy new idea like asking to have birds nest syrup made for me every day, then even though Grandmother and Aunt Wang and Cousin Feng may not say anything, the old nannies and maids on the staff are sure to resent the extra work. Cousin Bao and Cousin Feng are Grandmas favourites, yet you should see the looks these people give them sometimes and you should hear the things they say about them behind their backs! So you can imagine what they must be like about me. Im not even a proper member of the family Im just a refugee, with no family of my own, living here as a hanger-on. That in itself is enough to make them resent me. Its difficult enough for? me as it is, without deliberately thinking up new ways to make them hate me. Im just as much an outsider as you are, said Bao-chai. Theres no comparison between us said Dai-yu. Youve got your mother and your brother for a start. Youve got property and businesses. Youve still got land and a home of your own back in Nanking. Its true that as marriage-relations they allow you to live here free of charge, but you provide everything for yourselves apart from the accommodation. You dont cost them a penny. And anytime you feel like it, you can just get up and go. Ive got nothing at all of my own, absolutely nothing. Yet everything they give mefood. clothing, pocket-money, even the flowers and trees in my garden -are the same as they give their own gifts. Can you wonder that the servants are so resentful ? Your being here only means one more dowry for them to find, said Bao-chai. Surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them? Dai-yu coloured. Ive been telling you my troubles because I thought you really cared, but you turn them into a joke. Perhaps, said Bao-chai, smiling. But its true, all the same. However, dont you worry as long as Im here, I promise to do my best to make it easier for you. If you will promise always to let me know when anything is bothering you, I will promise to deal with it if it is in my power to do so. I have a brother, its true but you know as well as I do what hes like. Its really only in having a mother that I can count myself a bit luckier than you. In other respects we have enough in common to think of ourselves as fellow-sufferers. If you can see thisas with your intelligence I am sure you mustyou have no cause to go echoing Si-ma Nius complaint All men have brothers, only I have none. Now, you have suggested that the less trouble the better ought to be your motto here, and I take your point. I shall have a word with Mother next time I see her about this. Ill be surprised if we havent got some birds nest of our own at home. If we have, I shall tell them to send you a few ounces, so that you can get your own maids to prepare it for you every morning. That way will be handier for you and will also avoid the risk of any alarms and excursions with the staff. Dai-yu smiled at her gratefully. It may be only a little thing, but it is very kind indeed of you to have thought of it.
No ones ever seen one. You just answer that, Miss. What does a Yin-yang look like? Yin-yang is a sort of force, said Xiang-yun. Its the force in things that gives them their distinctive forms. For example, the sky is Yang and the earth is Yin water is Yin and fire is Yang the sun is Yang and the moon is Yin. Ah yes! Now I understand, said Kingfisher happily. Thats why astrologers call the sun the Yang star and the moon the Yin star. Holy name! said Xiang-yun. She understands. Thats not so difficult, said Kingfisher. But what about things like mosquitoes and fleas and midges and plants and flowers and bricks and tiles? Surely you are not going to say that they are all Yin-yang too? Certainly they are! said Xiang-yun. Take the leaf of a tree, for example. Thats divided into Yin and Yang. The side facing upwards towards the sky is Yang the underside, facing towards the ground, is Yin. Kingfisher nodded. I see. Yes. I can understand that. But take these fans we are holding. Surely they dont have Yin and Yang? Yes they do. The front of the fan is Yang the back of the fan is Yin. Kingfisher nodded, satisfied. She tried to think of some other object to ask about, but being for the moment unable to, she began looking around her for inspiration. As she did so, her eye chanced to light on the gold kylin fastened in the intricate loopings of her mistresss girdle. Well, Miss, she said, pointing triumphantly to the kylin, youre not going to say that thats got Yin and Yang? Certainly. In the case of birds and beasts the males are Yang and the females are Yin. Is this a daddy one or a mummy one? said Kingfisher. A daddy one or a mummy one! Silly girl! All right, then, said Kingfisher. But why is it that every-thing else has Yin and Yang but we havent? Get along with you, naughty girl! What subject wilt you get on to next? Why? Why cant you tell me? said Kingfisher. Anyway, I know so theres no need for you to be so nasty to me. Xiang-yun suppressed a giggle. Youre Yang and Im Yin, said Kingfisher. Xiang-yun held her handkerchief to her mouth and laughed Well, thats right, isnt it? said Kingfisher. What are you laughing at? Yes, yes, said Xiang-yun. Thats quite right. Thats what they always say, said Kingfisher the master is Yang and the servant is Yin. Even I can understand that principle. Im sure you can, said Xiang-yun. Very good. While they were talking, a glittering golden object at the foot of the rose pergola caught Xiang-yuns eye. She pointed it out to Kingfisher. Go and see what it is, Kingfisher bounded over and picked it up. Ah ha! she said, examining the object in her hand. Now we shall be able to see whether its Yin or Yang. She took hold of the kylin fastened to Xiang-yuns girdle and held it up to look at it more closely. Xiang-yun wanted to see what it was that she held in her hand, but Kingfisher wouldnt let her. Its my treasure, she said with a laugh. I wont let you see it, Miss. Funny, though. I wonder where it came from. Ive never seen anyone here wearing it. Come on! Let me look, said Xiang-yun. There you are, Miss! Kingfisher opened her hand. Xiang-yun looked. It was a beautiful, shining gold kylin, both larger and more ornate than the one she was wearing. Reaching out and taking it from Kingfisher, she held it on the palm of her hand and contemplated it for some moments in silence. Whatever reverie the contemplation inspired was broken by the sudden arrival of Bao-yu. What are you doing, standing out here in the blazing sun? he asked her. Why dont you go and see Aroma? We were on our way, said Xiang-yun, hurriedly concealing the gold kylin. The three of them entered the courtyard of Green Delights together. Aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at the foot of the front door steps. As soon as she caught sight of Xiang-yun, she hurried down into the courtyard to welcome her, and taking her by the hand, led her into the house, animatedly exchanging news with her as they went.
If you refuse to take these things, I am afraid you will destroy my credit with these people. They will say that I cannot really have the connection with your honoured family that I have always claimed to have. After this Grandmother Jia could no longer decline She told one of the servants to receive the tray. We obviously cant refuse, Grannie, after what Papa Zhang has just said, said Bao-yu but I really have no use for this stuff. Why not let one of the boys carry it outside for me and Ill distribute it to the poor? I think thats a very good idea, said Grandmother Jia. But Abbot Zhang thought otherwise and hastily intervened Im sure it does our young friend credit, this charitable impulse. However. Although these things are, as I said, of no especial value, they arewhat shall I sayobjects of virt, and if you give them to the poor, in the first place the poor wont have much use for them, and in the second place the objects themselves will get spoiled. If you want to give something to the poor, a largesse of money would, I suggest, be far more appropriate. Very well, look after this stuff for me, then, said Bao-yu to the servant, and this evening you will distribute a largesse. This being now settled, Abbot Zhang withdrew, and Grandmother Jia and her party went up to the galleries. Grandmother Jia sat with Bao-yu and the girls in the gallery facing the stage and Xi-feng and Li Wan sat in the east gallery. The maids all sat in the west gallery and took it in turns to go off and wait on their mistresses. Not long after they were all seated, Cousin Zhen came upstairs to say that the gods had now chosen which plays were to be performedby which was meant, of course, that the names had been shaken from a pot in front of the altar, since this was the only way in which the will of the gods could be known. The first play selected was The White Serpent. Whats the story? said Grandmother Jia. Cousin Zhen explained that it was about the emperor Gao-zu, founder of the Han dynasty, who began his rise to greatness by decapitating a monstrous white snake. The second choice was A Heap of Honours, which shows the sixtieth birthday party of the great Tang general Guo Zi-yi, attended by his seven sons and eight sons-in-law, all of whom held high office, the heap of honours of the title being a reference to the table in his reception-hall piled high with their insignia. It seems a bit conceited to have this second one played, said Grandmother Jia. Still, if thats what the gods chose, I suppose wed better have it. Whats the third one going to be? The South Branch, said Cousin Zhen. Grandmother Jia was silent. She knew that The South 13ranch likens the world to an ant-heap and tells a tale of power and glory which turns out in the end to have been a dream. Hearing no reply, Cousin Zhen went off downstairs again to see about the Offertory Scroll, which had to be ceremonially burnt in front of the holy images along with paper money and paper ingots before the theatrical performance could begin. Our record omits any description of that ceremony and moves back to Bao-yu, who was sitting in the central gallery beside his grandmother, and who now called for a maid to bring the tray up so that he could put on his Magic Jade again. When he had done so, he began to pick over the other trinkets with which the tray was covered and to hand them one by one to Grandmother Jia for her inspection. Her attention was taken by a little red-gold kylin with kingfisher-feather inlay. She stretched out her hand to take it. Now where have I seen something like this before? she said. I feel certain Ive seen some girl wearing an ornament like this. Cousin Shis got one, said Bao-chai. Its the same as this one only a little smaller. Funny! said Bao-yu. All the times shes been to our house, I dont remember ever having seen it. Cousin Ban is observant, said Tan-chun. No matter what it is, she remembers everything. Well, perhaps not quite everything, said Dai-yu wryly. But shes certainly very observant where things like this are concerned. Bao-chai turned her head away and pretended not to have heard. Now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that Shi Xiang-yun wore, Bao-yu hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket.
If you really like it, said Bao-yu, youre welcome to have mine. Ive still got quite a bit left, said Xi-feng. If you really like it, you can have it all. Thank you very much, said Dai-yu. Ill send someone round to fetch it. No, dont do that, said Xi-feng. Ill send it round to you. Theres something I want you to do for me. The person I send round about it can bring the tea as well. Dai-yu laughed mockingly Do you heat that, everybody? Because shes given me a hit of her old tea, I have to start doing odd jobs for her. Thats fair enough, said Xi-feng. You know the rule drink the familys tea, the familys bride-to-be. Everyone laughed at this except Dai-yu, who turned her head away, blushing furiously, and said nothing. Cousin Feng will have her little joke, Li Wan observed to Bao-chai with a smile. Do you call that a joke? said Dai-yu. It was a silly, idle remark, and very irritating. She gave a snort of disgust by way of reinforcement. Xi-feng laughed Whats so irritating about it? Look at him!She pointed at Bao-yu - Isnt he good enough for you? Good looks, good family, good income. There are no snags that I can see. Its a perfect match! Dai-yu rose and fled. Oh, Frowners in a rage! Come back Frowner! Bao-chai called out after her. If you go, it will spoil all the fun. She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back. At the doorway they ran into Jia Zhengs two concubines, Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou, come to see Bao-yu. Li Wan, Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk, but Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them, Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid arrived from Lady Wangs to say that Wang Zi-tengs wife had come and the presence of the young ladies was requested. Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go. Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave. I cant go out, said Bao-yu. For heavens sake dont let Aunt Wang come over here! - Cousin Lint he called to Dai-yu. Stay here a bit! Theres something I want to say to you. Hearing him, Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu Do you hear that? Someone wants a word with you. Youd better go back and see what he wants to say! She gave her a push in the direction of the house then she and Li Wan went off, both laughing. When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away. Aiyo! he said. My head! Good! said Dai-yu. It serves you right! Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, lumped two or three feet into the air, and began to shout and babble deliriously. Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-tengs lady was with them and hurried over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling. Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried Out to him piteously between their sobs my son I, my child!, my darling! Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the household next door and Jia She, Lady Xing, Cousin Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue and Xue Pannot to mention Zhou Ruis wife and a great bevy of domestics both high and lowcame hurrying into the garden, adding numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators. While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu, Xi-feng appeared, brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path. She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now, seeing people ahead, glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou Ruis wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while the others looked on helplessly, clasped her about the arms and body, wrested the knife from her hand, and carried her off to her room.
Whats got hold of your tongue? is there any particular thing about this arrangement that doesnt suit you? Please let me know if there is, and I promise that it shall be altered. But Faithful still said nothing. Oh, I know what it is, said Lady Xing. I expect youve got parents and dont like to say anything until youve heard from them. Why yes, very right and proper. I shall get in touch with your parents and no doubt you will be hearing from them in due course. Then anything you want to say, you will be able to say to them. With that she left, and went round to Xi-fengs apartment. Xi-feng had long since changed back into her ordinary clothes. As no one else was about, she had taken the opportunity of telling Patience about her interview with Lady Xing. Patience was amused, but shook her head doubtfully at Lady Xings optimism. If you ask me, I think its very uncertain. From the way shes always spoken in the past when weve been alone together, I should think shell-refuse. Anyway, well just have to wait and see. Lady Xing is sure to come here afterwards to talk about what happened, said Xi-feng. If Faithful has accepted, it will be all right but if Faithful hasnt accepted, shes not going to be in a very good mood, and it would embarrass her to have you here while she was telling me about it. Youd better order them to prepare some of those quails and a few other dishes to go with them so that I can offer her dinner when she arrives but after youve done that, youd better take yourself off for a bit and dont come hack until you think shes gone. Patience gave Xi-fengs instructions to the cook and then went off to enjoy herself in the Garden. When Lady Xing left, Faithful felt sure that she would go straight to Xi-fengs for consultation and that soon after that someone else would arrive and put the same question to her again. it seemed to her that the best way of avoiding this would be to decamp. She sought out Amber in order to give some cover to her exit. If Her Old Ladyship should ask for me, tell her that Im not feeling well and couldnt eat any lunch today. Say Ive gone to walk in the Garden for a bit and shall be back again shortly. Amber agreed to do this and Faithful went off to wander about in the Garden. While she -was doing so, she came by coincidence upon Patience doing exactly the same thing. Seeing no one else but the two of them around, Patience felt no compunction in revealing her newly acquired knowledge. Look whos here!, she called out teasingly. Mrs Faithful! Faithful blushed bright red. I suppose youre in the plot against me too. Well, never mind. Ill be having it out with your mistress presently. Patience could see that Faithful was really angry, and regretted her foolish jibe. Taking her by the hand, she led her to some rocks beneath a stand of maple trees where they could sit down together, and proceeded to tell her all that Xi-feng had a few minutes earlier told her. Thank you, said Faithful when she had finished. You and I at least are still friends. When I think of our set how many were we?Aroma, Amber, Candida, Nightingale, Suncloud, Silver, Musk, Ebony, Kingfishershe left to go with Miss ShiCharmer and Goldenthey both diedSnow pink that was dismissedyou and methere must have been a dozen of us altogether when we were young we always told each other everything and shared everything together but now that we are older, the others all seem to go their different ways and just arent interested. Not me, though I havent changed. Im just the same as I always was. I dont have any secrets from any of you. Now listen Im telling you this now for you to rememberonly dont go passing it on to your Mrs Lian. Its not just a question of not wanting to be his concubine. I wouldnt go to Sir She, not if Lady Xing had died and he sent matchmakers and witnesses and asked me to be his proper wife! Patience was about to answer when there was a laugh from behind the rocks on which they were sitting and a voice called out. Whats this shameless boasting I hear? Its enough to set ones teeth on edge! Startled, the two of them rose to their feet and went to look behind the rockery to find out who it was. Aroma emerged, laughing, as they did so. Whats all this about? Tell me about it too., The three of them sat down on the rocks together and Patience retold all that she had just told Faithful.
Id like to find the comedian whos been making up these stories about me, he shouted, turning in anger upon the domestics. Ill smash his rotten face in if I do. Of course, I know what this is all about you all want to show how concerned you are for poor, darling Bao-yu, so youve decided to do it at my expense. What is he, anyway? a Deva King? Every time his dad gives him a few whacks on the bum, the whole household is in a state of uproar about it for days on end. I remember that time Uncle Zheng beat him for doing something he shouldnt have and old Lady Jia decided that Cousin Zhen was at the bottom of it. She had the poor so-and-so hauled up in front of her and there was hell to pay. Now, this time, you want to drag me into it. All right then I dont care. A life for a life. Ill go in there and kill the little blighter then you can all do what you like to me. In the midst of this bawling he had picked up a door bar and was evidently going off to execute his threat but his distraught mother clung to him and prevented him from going. You stupid creature! she said. Who do you think youre going to hit with that? If youre going to hit anyone, youd better begin with me! Xue Pans exasperation had now reached such a pitch that his eyes stood out in his head like a pair of copper bells. This is rich! he shouted. You wont let me go and finish him off, yet you wont stop provoking me by making up all these lies. Every day that fellow stays alive means one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with. Wed much better die, the pair of us, and make an end of it! Have a little self-control! said Bao-chai, joining in her mothers efforts to restrain him. Cant you see how upset poor Mamma is? You ought to be trying to calm her, not making things worse with this uproar. Oh yes ! you can say that now, said Xue Pan, but it was you who started all this by telling her about me, wasnt it? Its all very well to blame me for telling Mamma, said Bao-chai. Why dont you blame yourself for being so careless, you great blabber-mouth ? Me careless ? said Xue Pan. What about the way Bao-yu stirs up trouble for himself then? Let me just give you an example. Let me tell you what happened between him and Bijou the other day. Id met Bijou ten times, near enough, and never had so much as a kind word out of him, yet Bao-yu, that didnt even know him by sight, meets him for the first time the other day, and before you know where you are, hes given him his sash! I hope youre not going to say that that got about because of me ? His mother and sister were indignant. Thats a fine example, isnt it? Its precisely because of that that he was beaten. Now we know it must have been you who told. This is enough to drive a fellow mad! said Xue Pan, Its not so much the lies you keep telling about me. What really gets my goat is the almighty fuss you make about this fellow Bao-yu. Almighty fuss? said Bao-chai. Youve just been waving a door-bar at us, and you say that we have been making a fuss ? Xue Pan could see that Bao-chai had reason on her side and that she was much harder to argue with than his mother. He was therefore eager to find something that would stop her mouth, so that he could say what he wanted to without contradiction. This, coupled with the fact that be was by now far too angry to weigh the seriousness of what he was saying, was responsible for the unpardonable innuendo that followed. All right, sis, he said, you dont need to quarrel with me. I know what your trouble is. Mamma told me long ago that Mr Right would be someone with a jade to match your locket, so naturally, now youve seen -that blasted thing that Bao-yu wears round his neck, you do all you can to stick up for him. Anger at first made Bao-chai speechless then, clinging to Aunt Xue, she burst into tears. Mamma, listen to what Pan is saying to me! Realizing, when he saw his sisters tears, that he had gone too far, Xue Pan retired sulkily to his own room and went to bed Bao-chai was left bursting with injury and outrage which she dared not express for fear of further upsetting her mother.
Once more the sense of injustice overcame her and she could not restrain her tears. Dont be upset, Patience! said Bao-yu consolingly. I offer you an apology on their behalf Patience laughed. It has nothing to do with you. Were all cousins, said Bao-yu. What one of us does concerns all the others. If they have done you an injury, its up to me to apologize. He turned his attention to her appearance. What a pity! Youve made your new dress all damp. Aromas dresses are in here. Why dont you change into one of hers, then you can spray some samshoo on this one and iron it? Youll need to do your hair again as well. He called to the junior maids to fetch water for washing and heat a flat-iron. Up to this moment Patience had known only by hearsay of the remarkable understanding shown by Bao-yu in his dealings with girls. He had deliberately kept away from her in the past, knowing her to be Xi-fengs confidante and he supposed Jia Lians cherished concubine. It had indeed been a source of frequent regret to him that he had been unable to show her how much he admired her. Seeing him like this for the first time, Patience reflected on the truth of what she bad heard. He really has thought of everything, she told herself, as she watched Aroma open up a large chestspecially for her and select two scarcely worn garments from it for her to change into. Then, since the water had already arrived, she took off her own dress and skirt and quickly washed her face. Bao-yu, who stood by smiling while she washed, now urged her to put on some make-up. If you dont, it will look as if you are sulking, he said After all, it is Fengs birthday, and Grandma did specially send someone to cheer you up. Inwardly acknowledging the reasonableness of this advice, Patience looked round her for some powder, but could not see any, whereupon Bao-yu darted over to the dressing-table and removed the lid from a box of Early Ming blue -and-white porcelain in which reposed the head of a white day my with five compact, stick like buds on either side of the stem. Pinching off one of these novel powder-containers, he handed it to Patience. There you are. This isnt ceruse, its a powder made by crushing the seeds of garden-jalap and mixing them with perfume. Patience emptied the contents of the tiny phial on to her palm. All the qualities required by the most expert perfumers were there lightness, whiteness with just the faintest tinge of rosiness, and fragrance. It spread smoothly and cleanly on the skin, imparting to it a soft bloom -that was quite unlike the harsh and somewhat livid whiteness associated with lead-based powders. Then the rouge, too, was differentnot in the usual sheets or tissues, but a tiny white-jade box filled with a crimson substance that looked like comfiture of roses. This is made from safflower, the same as ordinary rouge, Bao-yu explained to her, only the stuff they sell in the shops is impure and its colour is inferior. This is made by squeezing the juice from the best quality safflower, carefully extracting all the impurities, mixing it with rose water, and then further purifying it by distillation. Its so concentrated that you need only a dab of it on the end of a hairpin to do your lips with and still have enough left over to dilute with water in the palms of your hands for using on your cheeks. Following his directions, .Patience found that her complexion had acquired a radiant freshness that she had never seen in it before. At the same time her whole face seemed to be bathed in the most delectable perfume. Using a pair of bamboo scissors, Bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in Patiences hair. At that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to Li Wans place and she had to leave him in a hurry. Never before had Bao-yu been able to have Patience actually with him so that he could do things for her. She was such a superior sort of girl, so handsome, so intelligent, so different from the average run of common, insensitive creatures. His previous inability to serve her had been a source of deep regret. Today wasor would have been if -she had livedGoldens birthday, and for this reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning. The row which bad broken out later in the day between Xi-feng and Jia Lian had proved a godsend.
Thats why I came so promptly when I got your invitation. Feng Zi-ying laughed. You and your cousin are such simple soulsI find it rahver touchin! Afraid it was pure invention, what I said yesterday. I said it to make you come, because I fought that if I asked you outright to come and drink wiv me, youd make excuses. Anyway, it worked. The company joined in his merriment. Wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them. Feng Zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them then he called on Nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn. Xue Pan, by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him, was already beginning to be obstreperous. He seized Nuageuse by the hand and drew her towards him If youd sing me a nice new song - one of your specials, Id drink a whole jarful for you. How about it, eh? Nuageuse had to oblige him by taking up her lute and singing the following song for him to her own accompaniment Two lovely boys Are both in love with me And I cant get either from my mind. Both are so beautiful So wonderful So marvellous To give up either one would be unkind. Last night I promised I would go To meet one of them in the garden where the roses grow The other came to see what he could find. And now that we three are all Here in this tribunal, There are no words that come into my mind. There you are I she said. Now drink your jarful! That ones not worth a jarful, said Xue Pan. Sing us a better one. Now just a minute, said Bao-yu. Just guzzling like this will make us drunk in no time without giving us any real enjoyment. Ive got a good new drinking-game for you. Let me first drink the M. C.s starting-cup, and Ill tell you the rules. After that, anyone who doesnt toe the line will be made to drink ten Sconce-cups straight off as a forfeit, give up his seat at the party, and spend the rest of the time pouring Out drinks for the rest of us. Feng Zi-ying and Jiang Yu-han agreed enthusiastically, and Bao-yu picked up one of the extra large cups that had now been provided and drained its contents at a single draught. Now, he said. Were going to take four wordslets say upset, glum, blest and content. You have to begin by saying The girl is, and then you say one of the four words. Thats your first line. The next line has to rhyme with the first line and it has to give the reason why the girl is whatever it says upset or glum or blest or content When youve done all four, youre entitled to drink the wine in front of you. Only, before drinking it, youve first got to sing some new popular song and after youve drunk it, youve got to choose some animal or vegetable object from the things in front of us and recite a line from a well-known poem, or an old couplet, or a quotation from the classics Before he could finish, Xue Pan was on his feet, protesting vigorously You can count me out of this Im taking no part in this. This is just to make a fool of me, isnt it? Nuageuse, too, stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat What are you so afraid of, a practiced drinker like you? You cant be any worse at this sort of thing than I am, and Im going to have a go when my turn comes. If you do it all right, youve got nothing to worry about, and even if you cant, youll only be made to drink a few cups of wine whereas if you refuse to follow the rules at the very outset, youll have to drink ten sconces straight off in a row and then be thrown out of the party and made to pour drinks for the rest of us. Bravo! cried the others, clapping and Xue Pan, seeing them united against him, subsided. Bao-yu now began his own turn -576 The girls upset -768 The years pass by, but no ones claimed her yet. The girl looks glum Her true-loves gone to follow ambitions drum. The girl feels blest -1014 The mirror shows her looks are at their best. The girls content Long summer days in pleasant pastimes spent. The others all applauded, except Xue Pan, who shook his head disapprovingly No good, no good! he said. Pay the forfeit. Why, whats wrong with it? they asked him.
Bao-yu was already at his grandmothers when she got there. Bao-chai had on more than one occasion heard her mother telling Lady Wang and other people that the golden locket she wore had been given her by a monk, who had insisted that when she grew up the person she married must be Someone who had a jade to match the gold. This was one of the reasons why she tended to keep aloof from Bao-yu. The slight embarrassment she always felt as a result of her mothers chatter had yesterday been greatly intensified when Yuan-chun singled her out as the only girl to receive the same selection of presents as Bao-yu. She was relieved to think that Bao-yu, so wrapped up in Dai-yu that his thoughts were only of her, was unaware of her embarrassment. But now here was Bao-yu smiling at her with sudden interest. Cousin Bao, may I have a look at your medicine-beads? She happened to be wearing one of the little chaplets on her left wrist and began to pull it off now in obedience to his request. But Bao-chai was inclined to plumpness and perspired easily, and for a moment or two it would not come off While she was struggling with it, Bao-yu had ample opportunity to observe her snow-white arm, and a feeling rather warmer than admiration was kindled inside him. If that arm were growing on Cousin Lins body, he speculated, I might hope one day to touch it. What a pity its hers I Now I shall never have that good fortune. Suddenly he thought of the curious coincidence of the gold and jade talismans and their matching inscriptions, which Dai-yus remark had reminded him of. He looked again at Bao-chai -2458 that face like the full moons argent bowl those eyes like sloes those lips whose carmine hue no Art contrived and brows by none but Natures pencil lined. This was beauty of quite a different order from Dai-yus. Fascinated by it, he continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression so that when she handed him the chaplet, which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist, he failed to take it from her. Seeing that he had gone off into one of his trances, Bao-chai threw down the chaplet in embarrassment and turned to go. But Dai-yu was standing on the threshold, biting a corner of her handkerchief, convulsed with silent laughter. I thought you were so delicate, said Bao-chai. What are you standing there in the draught for? Ive been in the room all the time, said Dai-yu. I just this moment went to have a look outside because I heard the sound of something in the sky. It was a gawping goose. Where? said Bao-chai. Let me have a look. Oh, said Dai-yu, as soon as I went outside he flew away with a whir-r-r- She flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of Bao-yus face. Ow! he exclaimedShe had flicked him in the eye. The extent of the damage will be examined in the following chapter. CHAPTER 29 In which the greatly blessed pray for yet greater blessings And the highly strung rise to new heights of passion WE told in the last chapter how, as Bao-yu was standing lost in one of his trances, Dai-yu flicked her handkerchief at him and made him jump by inadvertently catching him in the eye with it. Who did that? he asked. Dai-yu laughingly shook her head. Im sorry. I didnt mean to. Bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose, and I accidentally flicked you while I was showing her how it went. Bao-yu rubbed his eye. He appeared to be about to say something, but then thought better of it. And so the matter passed. Shortly after this incident Xi-feng arrived and began talking about the arrangements that had been made for the purification ceremonies, due to begin on the first of next month at the Taoist temple of the Lunar Goddess. She invited Bao-chai, Bao-yu and Dai-yu to go with her there to watch the plays. Oh no I said Bao-chai. Its too hot. Even if they were to do something we havent seen beforewhich isnt likelyI think I should still not want to go. But its cool there, said Xi-feng. There are upstairs galleries on all three sides that you can watch from in the shade. And if we go, I shall send someone a day or two in advance to turn the Taoists out of that part of the temple and make it nice and clean for us and get them td put up blinds.
Faithful shouted back, amidst laughter. Mrs Lian came over here and stole some of our crab. Patience didnt like it, so she smeared crab-yolk all over her mistresss face, and now the two of them are having a fight. Hoots of laughter from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. Poor Mrs Lian! said Grandmother Jia. You ought to feel sorry for her. Couldnt you spare her a few-of the legs or some of the underneath bits? There was renewed laughter from the maids. Faithful shouted back again. She can have all the crabs-legs on this table, and very welcome to them! Xi-feng, taking all in good part, finished washing her face and went back to help Grandmother Jia and the others at the centre table with their crabs. Dai-yu dared not eat very much because of her delicate health, and after consuming a little of the claw-meat, excused herself from the table. Soon Grandmother Jia, too, had finished eating, and everyone washed their hands and broke off for a while to amuse themselves, some going off to admire the flowers, some to drop things in the water and watch the fish rise. Its rather windy for you here, Mother, said Lady Wang, especially after youve just been eating crab. Perhaps you ought to go back to your own room now and test. If you have enjoyed it, we could come again tomorrow. Yes, perhaps you are right, said Grandmother Jia. I hadnt been going to leave, because I could see how much they were all enjoying themselves and was afraid of spoiling the fun. But perhaps you and I ought to be getting along now. As she rose to leave, she turned to address Xiang-yun. Dont let your Cousin Bao-yu eat too much I No, Grandma. She turned once more as she was leaving, this time including Bao-chai in her admonition. And dont you two eat too much, either. Crab is very good to eat, but it isnt very good for you. If you eat too much of it, it will give you stomach-ache. Yes, Grandma. The two girls saw her out of the Garden. When they were back again, they gave orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid but Bao-yu objected. No, dont lay again, he said. We want to get on with the poetry. Put the big round table in the middle with all the food and drink on it so that we can help ourselves when we feel like it and sit where we like. That will be much nicer than having set places. Bao-chai agreed but Xiang-yun reminded them that there were others besides themselves to be considered, and having first ordered a separate table to be laid and some good hot crabs to be selected, she invited Aroma, Nightingale, Chess, Scribe, Picture, Oriole and Ebony to come and sit at it. After that she had a couple of carpets spread out on the ground beneath the cassia-trees at the foot of the rockery and made the old nannies and junior maids sit down on them and eat and drink to their hearts content, insisting that they need only get up to wait on them if they were specially called for. Then she took the list of poem-titles and pinned it to the inside wall of the pavilion. Very original! the others commented when they had finished reading the titles, but went on to express the fear that they might find them difficult to write on. Xiang-yun explained what they had decided about rhymes viz. that there should be no set rhyme-scheme and everyone should be free to choose their own. Now thats what I call sensible I said Bao-yu. I cant stand set rhymes. Dai-yu had a barrel-shaped porcelain tabouret moved up to the verandahs edge, and having selected a fishing-rod for herself, sat leaning on the railing, fishing. Bao-chai sat for some time silently contemplating a spray of cassia she had picked, then, leaning over the railings and idly plucking off the flowerets, dropped them one by one into the water and watched the fish swim up from below and nibble at them with plopping noises as they floated on the surface. Xiang-yun for the most part sat quietly musing, occasionally getting up to look after Aroma and the other maids at the table outside, or to make sure that the people sitting on the carpets were getting enough to eat and drink. Tan-chun stood with Li Wan and Xi-chun in the shade of a weeping willow, watching the water-fowl.
