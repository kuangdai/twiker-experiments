Bolton manager Neil Lennon has given up on signing Celtic forward Kris Commons this month. The former Parkhead boss had hoped to use the uncertainty over the former Scotland international's future to his gain and lure Commons south. But he has now ruled out a late January move after Celtic made it clear the out-of-contract attacker will not be sold in this transfer window. Bolton boss Neil Lennon used to be manager of Celtic before taking over the Championship club . Lennon wanted Kris Commons (right) to join him at Bolton but accepts it will not happen in January . Lennon told STV: 'Celtic have come out publicly and said he's not for sale, he won't be leaving and we haven't pursued that any further. 'I've got a great relationship with Celtic, a great relationship with Peter [Lawwell] and I don't want to damage that. 'People keep asking me about Kris and I feel uncomfortable talking about him because he is Celtic's player at the end of the day.' Commons, was a central figure under Lennon, netting 31 goals in the Northern Irishman's final season in charge. But under Ronnie Deila, he has been in and out of the side as he was forced to accept his position was not guaranteed. However, Lennon believes Celtic should look to tap into more than just his playing abilities as he recommended the 31-year-old for a future coaching role with the Hoops. Commons has not been a regular in the Celtic team under manager Ronny Deila . Lennon said: 'It was something that myself and Peter talked about. Kris gets the club, he gets Celtic. 'He was having a great season last year and we talked about it in terms of working again together when his career finished. He's an intelligent boy, I think he'd have plenty to offer on the coaching side of things.
'I think he would be an asset for Celtic in a coaching capacity.'

A divorcee who convinced her lover, a former NFL player, to shoot dead her millionaire boyfriend to access his life insurance has been jailed for life. Nanette Ann Packard, 46, was convicted of murder earlier this year after her live-in boyfriend William McLaughlin was shot dead in his kitchen in December 1994. Packard was living with McLaughlin, 21 years her senior, while also dating former New England Patriots linebacker Eric Naposki, who worked as a bouncer at a local nightclub. Jailed: Nanette Ann Packard is led from court in handcuffs after being handed a life prison term yesterday . Theft: Packard's murder trial heard she also stole $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death . She convinced the former NFL star to murder McLaughlin, having stood to collect $1million on the medical technology boss's life insurance, along with a further $150,000 and free rent for a year in one of his properties. Naposki entered McLaughlin's lavish house in Newport Beach using a key given to him by Packard, and shot the millionaire in the chest six times. Killer: Eric Naposki, a former NFL linebacker, was the man who killed millionaire William McLaughlin by shooting him six times in the chest . Packard's murder trial earlier this year also heard she went on to steal at least $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death. She admitted grand theft in 1996 and was sentenced to a year in jail, but the murder case went cold for 13 years before new evidence in 2009 connected Packard and Naposki to the shooting. Authorities subsequently arrested Johnston, living in Ladera Ranch with her third husband, and Naposki, living in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Investigators had long suspected Packard and Naposki, but it was only when new technology was used to identify the murder weapon, along with a new witness, that charges were filed. McLaughlin's family today branded Packard 'vile' as the mother-of-two was handed a life jail term without parole for the millionaire's murder, having been convicted of first degree murder in January. Naposki, 45, who played for the New England Patriots between 1988 and 1989, was convicted of first degree murder last July, and will be sentenced on August 10. The court heard during Packard's trial she met McLaughlin after he responded to an advert she had placed in a dating magazine for wealthy men. She had described herself as 'a well-educated woman who knows how to take care of her man'.

Speaking outside Orange County Superior COurt yesterday after Packard's sentencing, Kim McLaughlin Bayless said: 'The fact that you, Nanette, destroyed so many lives, including my Dad's, is vile.

The Burrell Collection will shut on Sunday evening and will reopen in 2020 after the multi-million pound redevelopment is complete. This weekend the museum is hosting a range of free activities including live music, a family ceilidh, and guided tours. The building is said to be no longer fit for purpose and needs a new roof. The Burrell Collection, in the heart of Pollok Country Park, opened to the public in 1983. Only a fifth of the collection, donated to the city by collector Sir William Burrell in 1944, is currently on display as many items have had to be removed to protect them from damage. It is estimated that the total cost of the project will be between £60m and £66m. Under the modernisation plans, a new roof and high performance glazing will make the museum more energy-efficient. Two new floors of exhibition space will be created so that 90% of the 8,000 objects can be viewed by the public. Throughout the Burrell's refurbishment, some of the works from its collection will be on display at Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow. Burrell at Kelvingrove will showcase a series of changing displays, providing visitors continued access to treasures from the collection. The first exhibition 'Burrell at Kelvingrove: Joseph Crawhall', will offer visitors a rare opportunity to see 23 of the finest works by one of the radical group of young Scottish painters, the Glasgow Boys. It will run from 24 October, 2016 until July next year.
Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday proposed a package of measures that would provide at least $58 million in additional funding for oil spill relief efforts and raise the tax that oil companies pay to maintain an emergency fund. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting congressional approval of the package, Obama said oil giant BP -- which owns the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico -- was responsible for all cleanup costs. In addition, Obama said, the government would seek full compensation for all damages from BP. "We cannot allow the potentially protracted pursuit of claims to prevent us from swift action to help those harmed by this spill," Obama said in the letter. The proposals would increase by 1 cent the current tax of 8 cents a barrel that oil companies pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and also increase the amounts that could be spent from that fund on single incidents. Efforts to staunch the gusher continued Wednesday. The "top-hat" oil containment device has reached the sea floor and should be in position over the wellhead and operational by the end of the week, BP said. A larger containment vessel was unsuccessful in stopping the flow of oil from the gusher about 5,000 feet underwater. The spill is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. The "top-hat" cofferdam, a 5-foot-tall, 4-foot-diameter structure, weighs less than 2 tons. The structure was deployed by the drill ship Enterprise. BP built the smaller dome after a much larger, four-story containment vessel, designed to cap the larger of two leaks in the well, developed glitches Saturday. Ice-like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water and blocked the top of the dome, making it buoyant.
The new device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production. Methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the success of this latest attempt to cap the well could be known in the next few days. "On this Thursday, we should know whether or not this alternative top-hat cofferdam is going to work," Salazar said on CNN's "The Situation Room." "And then the next key date is Saturday, because by Saturday they will have the diagnostics completed through X-rays and gamma rays and pressure ratings to be able to make decisions about what the next steps are." If attempts to cap the well fail, BP may try to plug the leak by shooting debris -- shredded tires, golf balls and similar objects -- under extremely high pressure into the well's blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak. The blowout preventer has been partially successful in sealing the well, but did not fully close when the rig exploded and sank. Suttles said BP also is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe. "That started about a week ago," Suttles said. "That work continues. The well is at about 9,000 feet." It may take up to three months to reach the target area, and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes, said David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America. Federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon, which was owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. The oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later, about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana.
BP is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $75 million. But Florida Sen. Bill Nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $10 billion. iReport: Share images from the Gulf . "If this gusher continues for several months, it's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it's going to get down into the loop current, and that's going to take it down the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida," Nelson said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union. "And you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism, our beaches, to our fisheries, very possibly disruption of our military testing and training," he said. CNN's David Mattingly contributed to this report.

A woman was arrested at John F. Kennedy International in New York on Monday for trying to smuggle two disassembled .40 caliber handguns, 350 rounds of ammunition, four magazines for the guns and 33 pounds of marijuana, according to the federal Transportation Security Administration. TSA officers discovered the contraband after opening two pieces of checked luggage for inspection. "The officers saw the suitcases were jam-packed with cans and boxes for baby wipes, coffee, floor dusting sheets, lemonade mix, iced tea mix, a box of cat litter and a box of laundry tablets," the TSA statement read.

(CNN) -- A woman who said she had a mother-daughter relationship with slain model Jasmine Fiore told CNN's Larry King on Thursday night that Fiore never informed her that she had been married. An arrest warrant has been issued for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, wanted in the death of ex-wife Jasmine Fiore. Gwendolyn Beauregard said Fiore was a close friend of her two sons, and she met the future model when Fiore was just 11. Despite the close ties -- "she called me mommy and she was my daughter" -- Beauregard was in the dark about Fiore's marriage to Ryan Jenkins. The marriage reportedly was annulled a few weeks after their Las Vegas, Nevada, wedding. An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. Authorities believe he's fled to Canada. Fiore's body was found Saturday, stuffed into a suitcase and left in a Dumpster in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County, California. Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore. "She didn't tell me that she married him. She told me [about] the day that they met, which was St. Patrick's Day," Beauregard said. "She called me the day after and she said: 'Mommy, I met the most perfect guy in the world and -- and his name is Ryan.' And she just went on and on and on about Ryan and how perfect he was. And that was all I knew." Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins. Mike Fleeman, the West Coast editor of People.com, described more details of Fiore's whirlwind courtship with Jenkins to King. "They met in Las Vegas. Two days later [in March], they got married at the Little White Wedding Chapel.
That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married," Fleeman told King. "It was a quickie wedding. We today talked to somebody who was at the wedding. One of the witnesses was an employee of the chapel. A lot of people were shocked that both of them were married. They kept it under wraps. And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning," Fleeman said. Fleeman told King that Jenkins was arrested and charged with domestic assault against Fiore in Nevada in June and that Jenkins was supposed to go to trial in December. Beauregard told King that Fiore, who was 28 when she died, started modeling in her early 20s. Despite their deep bond, Beauregard said Fiore had ties with her biological mother, Lisa Lepore. "She was close to her mother, as well, but it was a different type of closeness." Adding to the horror of the slaying was that Fiore's teeth had been extracted and her fingers removed. Criminal profiler Pat Brown told Larry King that act provided key crucial evidence early in the investigation. "It was very clear from the very beginning, when they found her body in a piece of luggage, that we weren't dealing with a serial killer. I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified," Brown said. "This is why he [the suspect[ ended up cutting off her fingers taking out her teeth. He even got smart. He watched too many crime shows and thought he would get rid of all ID, took away her clothes, put her in the luggage, probably because it's one way to get her of an apartment. And throw it a Dumpster and hope that time will take care of it, she'll decompose, they'll never be able to identify her," Brown said.
Jenkins has appeared on VH1 shows "Megan Wants a Millionaire" and "I Love Money 3." "This is a very arrogant man," Brown said. "Megan said it right on the show. She said he's a manipulator. He is. He has evidence of psychopathy there." The brutality of the crime has hit Fiore's circle of friends hard. "Ryan Jenkins is an animal," said Robert Hasman, a family friend who said Fiore had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years. Watch Hasman speak out » . "What he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable. It's just not right." He described her as "a beautiful person who was a very caring individual." Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said on "Larry King Live" that Jenkins is the only suspect. "There is no indication that anybody else might be involved," he said. "We believe he's armed because there's a handgun missing from his apartment, which is the last place he was before he fled. So it appears that he's armed. And he's certainly dangerous because he's desperate," Rackauckas said.
Some of New York’s most talented subway musicians have made history with the world’s first performance by a ‘wifi orchestra’. The eclectic musicians united for a live experiment that saw them simultaneously connect to a conductor while performing separately in nine different subway stations on a Sunday morning in September. Using the underground system’s wifi connection, composer Ljova Zhurbin led the orchestra through a performance of Signal Strength, an original piece he wrote for the landmark concert. The musicians simultaneously connected to a conductor while performing in different subway stations . Composer Ljova Zhurbin led the orchestra through a performance of an original piece he wrote for the concert . The performance included a variety of instruments, including a saw (left) and theremin . With nearly a dozen laptop computers in front of him, Mr Zhurbin drew curious stares from locals and tourists as he conducted the 11-piece performance from sunny Bryant Park in Manhattan. The performers – equipped with a variety of instruments, including an accordion, bass guitar, saw and theremin – followed along on smartphones that were linked to a Skype connection. Commuters dropped change into their cases, seemingly unaware that they were witnessing music history. A three-minute video, directed by Chris Shimojima, has been viewed nearly 100,000 times since it was uploaded two weeks ago. Ljova Zhurbin (left) conducted the 11-piece orchestra, including beatboxer Adam Matta, from Bryant Park . Violinist Allyson Clare (left) and other musicians used mobile phones to connect with Mr Zhurbin . Performers connected to their conductor using the underground wifi connection in New York's subway system . Mr Shimojima and his team recruited musicians from all types of backgrounds for the experiment, which was carried out on a Sunday morning as the wifi connection would be stronger.
On his website he wrote: ‘The signal did drop or become uneven at points … but enough takes (about eight) were filmed to work around this. Wifi latency was about a half-second but was removed in editing. A portable audio recorder was placed close to each musician for better quality sound.’ He added: ‘If you happened to walk by one of our musicians, you would not have noticed anything unusual, hearing only that instrument. It was, in fact, only one part out of nine. The musicians, luckily, were not stopped by the NYPD.’
GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Extreme sexual violence against women is pervasive in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and local authorities do little to stop it or prosecute those responsible, a U.N. investigator said on Monday. A woman struggles to describe her rape by military members. Health workers call rape an epidemic. Rape and brutality against women and girls are "rampant and committed by non-state armed groups, the Armed Forces of the DRC, the National Congolese Police, and increasingly also by civilians", said Turkish lawyer Yakin Erturk. "Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal," she added in a report after an 11-day trip to the strife-torn country. Erturk, special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council on violence against women, said the situation in South Kivu province, where rebels from neighboring Rwanda operate, was the worst she had ever encountered. The atrocities perpetrated there by armed groups, some of whom seemed to have been involved in the 1994 Rwandan massacres in which 800,000 people were killed, "are of an unimaginable brutality that goes far beyond rape," she said. "Women are gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In numerous cases, male relatives are forced at gun point to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters," she said. After rape, many women were shot or stabbed in the genital area, and survivors told Erturk that while held as slaves by the gangs they had been forced to eat excrement or the flesh of their murdered relatives. Women who have been raped are systematically rejected by their families and society. Widespread sexual abuse in the various conflicts racking the republic -- which last year held elections hailed as marking a new era -- "seems to have become a generalized aspect of the overall oppression of women," Erturk said.
Her report followed charges from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour last week that soldiers and police used excessive force, including summary executions, in quelling opposition protesters in the west of the DRC earlier this year. In the central Equateur province, the police and army often responded to civil unrest "with organized armed reprisals that target the civilian population and involve indiscriminate pillage, torture and mass rape", the report found. Although the DRC parliament outlawed sexual violence in July 2006, "little action is taken by the authorities to implement the law and perpetrators continue to enjoy immunity, especially if they wear the state's uniform," Erturk said. Erturk said Congo's justice system was corrupt and in "a deplorable state," while conditions in prisons were "scandalous". Senior army and police officers shielded their men from prosecution, and when some were arrested they escaped easily, probably "with the complicity of those in charge." In a few cases courts had ordered the state and individuals to compensate victims. But "to this day the government has not paid reparations to a single victim who has suffered sexual violence at the hand of state agents," said E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: "If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."
Kvyat replied: "We didn't crash." Vettel responded: "You didn't. You were lucky this time." Kvyat shrugged: "I'm on the podium; you're on the podium." In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: "You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium." Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr. "The car was pretty damaged," said the 31-year-old afterwards.
"I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place." Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a "lot of aerodynamic performance". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

(CNN) -- Three former Penn State University officials -- including ex-President Graham Spanier -- have been charged with conspiring to cover up years of sexual abuse against children by former football coach Jerry Sandusky. Spanier, along with former Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz, each face the same eight counts related to the Sandusky scandal, including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly announced Thursday. Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a preliminary arraignment at Magisterial District Judge William C. Wenner's office at 2 p.m. on Friday, and Spanier's preliminary arraignment is slated for next Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at the same judge's office, according to a Pennsylvania courts spokesman Jim Koval. Each of the three men is expected to attend his arraignment, said Koval. This is the first time Spanier has been charged in the wake of the scandal, which started unfolding publicly a year ago. Curley and Schultz previously had been charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse. The three men "essentially turned a blind eye to serial predatory acts" by Sandusky, Kelly told a news conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Jerry Sandusky proclaims his innocence in jailhouse audio recording . "This was not a mistake by these men. It was not an oversight. It was not misjudgment on their part. This was a conspiracy of silence by top officials working to actively conceal the truth, with total disregard for the children who were Sandusky's victims in this case," she said. Spanier's attorneys said "there is no factual basis to support these charges" and accused Kelly of acting as a pawn for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, who they said "has made no secret of his personal hostility toward Dr. Spanier."
"These charges are the work of a vindictive and politically motivated governor working through an unelected attorney general, Linda Kelly, whom he appointed to do his bidding and who will be a lame duck five days from now," according to a statement from the attorneys. They also accused Kelly and her staff of "steadfastly" refusing to meet with Spanier or his legal representatives "despite repeated attempts to do so." Gov. Corbett's spokesman Kevin Harley responded, "Graham Spanier's statement is the ranting of a man who has just been indicted for covering up for a convicted pedophile. His arrogance reveals a man who has just found out that he is not above the law after all." As a result of the charges, Penn State said Spanier -- who was removed as president in November 2011 -- will be placed on immediate leave. He had continued to serve as a tenured professor, although he was on a sabbatical. Attorneys blast Freeh report as Spanier speaks out . Penn State said it recently informed Curley that his fixed-term contract will not be renewed when it expires in June. Schultz had retired after he was initially charged last year. The university refused to comment on the charges "out of respect for the legal process." Curley's attorney Caroline Roberto said prosecutors didn't give her team any advance notice of the new charges. "To be clear, Tim Curley is innocent of all charges," Roberto said in a statement. "We are carefully reviewing the presentment and will reserve a more comprehensive comment for a later time." Roberto filed a pre-trial motion Wednesday, asking to dismiss or suppress Curley's grand jury testimony. The motion alleges a conflict of interest because the woman Curley believed was representing him at the time, was actually representing Penn State University. CNN has reached out to Schultz's attorney Thomas Farrell, who previously said Schultz is innocent of the initial charges and he would fight to clear Schultz's name.
Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. Last month, he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, meaning he'll likely die behind bars. Speaking Thursday, Kelly cited as evidence a series of e-mails among Spanier, Schultz, and Curley from February 2001, referring, somewhat in code, to the infamous incident in which assistant coach Mike McQueary walked in on Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in a university shower room. CNN first reported in June about the allegedly incriminating e-mails. Ousted Penn State president says he was abused as a child . In July, in a 267-page report commissioned by the university, former FBI Director Louis Freeh blamed the three men and legendary former head football coach Joe Paterno for having "never demonstrated any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest," while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties. Paterno died on January 22. "I'm not going to speculate or comment on Mr. Paterno's relationship to this investigation," Kelly said Thursday. "He's deceased, and that's the end of it." In an August interview published in the New Yorker magazine, Spanier ripped the Freeh report. "It's unfair, it's deeply flawed, it has many errors and omissions," the former university president told Jeffrey Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and CNN senior legal analyst. "They interviewed, they say, over 430 people; many of those folks have spoken to me about their interviews. Many of them describe those interviews to me as a witch hunt." Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a January trial on the initial two charges.
Kelly said she thinks now that Spanier has been charged, the three men should face a joint trial, because of the intertwined nature of the charges. In July, the National Collegiate Athletic Association vacated Penn State's football wins dating back to 1998, the year when allegations that Sandusky was abusing children were first made. That penalty removed Paterno from the top of the list of Division I college football's winningest coaches. Sandusky, Paterno's top defensive assistant for more than two decades, has been placed in protective custody at the State Correctional Institution at Greene in Waynesburg, where he'll serve out his sentence for sexually abusing boys. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . "Given the high-profile nature of this individual, coupled with the nature of his crimes, this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting," Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said. He was transferred to the state prison Wednesday from the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, where he was physically and mentally evaluated. In the 1,800-inmate prison in Waynesburg, the former coach is being held in a single cell and has additional supervision and an escort when he's out of his cell for the three showers and five hours of exercise he is allotted weekly. All meals and any counseling or medical visits will take place in Sandusky's cell, according to a statement from the state's Department of Corrections. All visits will be "noncontact," the statement said. Sandusky will be allowed to have a television, radio and other personal property as authorized by prison officials. Jurors determined that Sandusky, who retired from Penn State in 1999, used his access to university facilities and his foundation for underprivileged youths to abuse the boys sexually. During the trial, a 23-year-old man identified as Victim No. 4 testified that he was 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. Sandusky is appealing his conviction.

This is a symbol to remember those who have given their lives in war. This year, over 45 million poppies will be given out by 150,000 volunteers. But why do we wear these red flowers to remember people in this way? The reason poppies are used to remember those who have given their lives in battle is because they are the flowers which grew on the battlefields after World War One ended. This is described in the famous World War One poem In Flanders Fields, which you can read below. Ever since then, they have come to be a symbol of remembering not just those who gave their lives in World War One, but all those who have died on behalf of their country. Every year, volunteers make poppies available throughout the country and people make a donation in order to get their poppy. The money raised from these donations is used to help servicemen and women who are still alive, whose lives have been changed by wars that they fought in. It might help them to get jobs and somewhere to live, and will also help older war veterans with any support they may need. It is also used to help those who have lost loved ones because of wars. The charity that runs this Poppy Appeal is called The Royal British Legion. Wearing poppies like this to raise money to help people who had fought in wars started in 1921. This was year that the Royal British Legion was founded on 15 May. However, back then the poppies weren't made out of paper like they are today. They were made out of silk. They sold out straight away and raised more than Â£106,000 for those whose lives had been affected by the war, by helping to find them jobs and somewhere to live once they were no longer serving in the army. In 1922, a factory was set up where disabled former soldiers were employed to make the poppies.
This factory is still running - and producing many millions of poppies each year - to this very day. While the majority of people wear their poppy on their chest, there is in fact no right or wrong way to wear a poppy. As the Royal British Legion says: "We only ask you to wear it with pride." In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. - We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. - Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.
Rogers, 38, will play in next season's County Championship and Maynard is delighted with the signing. "He has agreed to come in and bat at three for the summer and that's a real top signing for us, a marquee player," Maynard told BBC Radio Somerset. "He is a great acquisition, I'm really looking forward to working with him." Maynard says the Sydney-born left-hander will be a huge asset to the side and will help support the opening duo of Marcus Trescothick and 21-year-old Tom Abell. "I think it was quite evident that apart from Marcus and Tom at the top of the order, we needed a bit more stability at three. "He's got a world of experience, he is still very athletic, he is a very fit lad, he has got that Aussie determination, that steely quality and we saw during the summer he is a high-class player on tough wickets." Rogers announced his retirement from Test cricket prior to this summer's Ashes series and Maynard hopes his experience can help the younger members of Somerset's squad. "We can't stifle our young talent and ask Tom Abell to bat out of position. He has established himself as an opener, he still has a long way to go but has the potential to go all the way and bat for England for a number of years. "Obviously Marcus is still at the top of his game. Chris has batted at three a number of times in his career and is happy there. Also it will give him time to bed in, he is a quality performer and we're hoping for an excellent season from him."
(CNN) -- In keeping with President Obama's pledge of an administration that is "transparent and accountable," the White House has launched a site that promises to show taxpayers where their stimulus-package dollars are being spent. Visitors to Recovery.gov are greeted with a video message from President Obama. The site, Recovery.gov, allows visitors to track efforts to jump-start a teetering economy in the midst of a slumping housing market and massive job losses. It breaks down the $787 billion package by category: $288 billion for tax relief, $59 billion for health care, and so on. The site promises that more detailed spending information will be posted once federal agencies decide how they are going to allocate the money. Learn more about where the money is going » . Using graphs, charts and layman's terminology, the online portal is an example of how the tech-savvy Obama administration is taking its message to the American people. While running for president, Obama harnessed the Web's fundraising and social-networking capabilities to energize his grass-roots campaign. And the moment he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, administration officials unveiled a sleek interactive version of Whitehouse.gov, the official White House Web site. Recovery.gov, launched within hours of Obama's signing of the stimulus bill Tuesday, continues the theme of offering information in a user-friendly format. Visitors are greeted by a brief video address from Obama. "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan represents a strategic and significant investment in our country's future," the president explains. "The size and scale of this plan demand unprecedented efforts to root out waste, inefficiency and unnecessary spending. Recovery.gov will be the online portal for these efforts." The site will publish information on how the stimulus funds will be spent in a "timely, targeted and transparent manner," Obama said.
Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said transparency has "been a watch word for good government types for years." "There is sense that taxpayers will feel a lot better about this if they actually know where their money is going," Glaeser said. "Better transparency makes evaluation much easier." Glaeser pointed out that the idea behind Recovery.gov is not entirely new. He noted that the Office of Management and Budget has for years had a site where citizens can learn the available cost-benefit information of several government programs. Clicking on "Where is Your Money Going" on the new site brings up a chart displaying key areas where the $787 billion will be distributed, including tax relief, energy, health care and infrastructure and science. Under "Accountability and Transparency," there is a statement that reads, "This is your money. You have a right to know where it's going and how it's being spent. Learn what steps we're taking to ensure you can track our progress every step of the way." Like other Obama online portals, the site encourages user interaction. The public is invited to share stories on how the Recovery Act is affecting them. Scrolling over a map of the United States reveals data on the number of jobs created and saved in each state. Those with some time on their hands can also read, in its entirety, the full text of the legislation.
There is no doubt the perfect baby name is hard to pick, but a unique one is even harder to come by. Reddit user thebdizzle spawned a viral thread by asking: 'What are people naming their children that they really shouldn't be? ', after a Facebook friend announced that they had named their child 'Dude Lorenzo'. And it seems thebdizzle was not alone in his shock over the newborn's name - which could be a tip of the hat to actor Jeff Bridges' character named 'The Dude' in cult hit, The Big Lebowski or a reference to the Ashton Kutcher movie, Dude Where's My Car?. Scroll down for video . Some parents have drawn inspiration from popular book and TV series Game of Thrones, by naming their child Khaleesi (played by Emilia Clarke, pictured) 'Well, its only 6am and I found my story of the day that makes me question my faith in humanity, thanks,' Slikrick98 wrote. While theschizophreniac agreed: 'Poor kid. I can only imagine the hilarity of his teachers referring to him as dude.' While it seems some parents took inspiration from literature - including Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games - others left Redditors scratching their heads. User technicolours also came across parents who gave the royal monikers Your Highness and Your Majesty, a new twist. Redditors have also heard of parents calling their children, Katniss, from The Hunger Games book and TV series . thebdizzle posted a screen shot of the announcement for those who did not believe him at first . A Reddit thread was started after it emerged a baby was named Dude, which could be a nod to Jeff Bridges' (pictured) character The Dude in The Big Lebowski . 'I did a clinical rotation at a pediatric facility, and I had two patients named YrHyness & YrMagesty.
It's really hard not to laugh when you're asking a 3 year old, "Does your tummy hurt YrHyness?"' they said. While Exodia101 claimed to know someone named 'iMajesty' to which Animalgeologist replied: 'Is he a new Apple product?' Other baby names included Susej (pronounced 'Suzy'), Starblanket, Cviiitlyn (a version of Caitlin), Jew'lrii ('jewellery'), Yoonik ('eunuch'), Sharkeisha, Iysabeyl (a take on Isabel), Cevyn ('seven'), Ziggy, Sincerely Yours, Macaroni and Spaghetti. Meanwhile others took inspiration from fiction and made it there own form of reality with names like Katniss from The Hunger Games, Aragorn and Elrond from The Lord of the Rings, Khaleesi from Game of Thrones and Holden from The Catcher in the Rye. Of The Hunger Games reference, bastocrat said: 'You just know that all the other kids will call her "catp***".' And nfriel had a bone to pick with the nod to Game of Thrones: '"Khaleesi" is the worst. It's not even the character's name! It's a title in a made-up fantasy language.' The latest celebrity to jump on board with the unique baby names trend is former British glamour model, Katie Price. She hit back at critics last week after she was mocked for naming her newborn daughter, Bunny. The new mum wrote in her column for Now magazine: 'Bunny is an old-fashioned name and I love it. Some may ridicule our choice and some will love it - I really don't care to be honest.' Price said the name suits the tiny tot because she embodies all things a bunny rabbit represents - 'soft, cute, cuddly, unique fun'.
Other names mentioned in the thread included Starblanket, Jew'lrii, Yoonik, Sharkeisha and Iysabeyl .
Crowds paid their respects to Alessandro Giancaterino, 42, and Gabriele D'Angelo, 31, waiters at the Hotel Rigopiano. Another body, of a woman, was found on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 16. But rescuers continue to search for 13 people still missing, and say there is a chance survivors could be trapped in the hotel bar. They are trying to punch their way in through the 80cm (2ft 7in) concrete wall, in the hope that some could still be alive in air pockets there. "We are working on the theory that the avalanche did not necessarily hit or destroy every room and that we haven't yet reached the heart of the structure," said a spokesman for the fire service, Luca Cari. He said rescuers were working around the clock at the remains of the hotel - which in 2009 hosted Hollywood star George Clooney. So far, 11 people have been found alive following the 120,000-ton avalanche - which police have calculated had the equivalent impact of the hotel being hit by 4,000 fully loaded trucks travelling at over 100 km/h (60 mph). On Tuesday, first victims were laid to rest - chief waiter Giancaterino in the next village of Farindola, while fellow waiter D'Angelo was being buried a few kilometres away. Giancaterino was in the hotel at the time as he had offered to stay for a double shift on 18 January to cover a fellow worker who was struggling to get in through the snow drifts, said AP news agency. "He was a great hard worker. He was very professional," said his brother, Massimiliano Giancaterino. "This is the memory that I want to keep of my brother, beyond obviously the private ones that I keep in my heart."
At the hotel, rescuers have been able to excavate a path into the hotel which allows access for heavy machinery, said firefighters' spokesman Mr Cari. They will now try to create a shaft through the thick concrete wall dividing the bar from the kitchen, in the hope that there could be an air pocket - and possible survivors - in the space behind. As the search continued, a rescue team was sent from the base co-ordinating the avalanche operation to help in an unrelated helicopter crash nearby, public broadcaster Rai reported. Italian President Sergio Mattarella has called for a "united effort and common front in the face of disaster". But further concerns have been raised about the emergency services' handling of the disaster and authorities have opened an official inquiry into the circumstances of the tragedy. Details have emerged of an emergency phone call between a restaurant owner and a senior official at the local authority co-ordinating rescues in Pescara. A transcript has been published by Italian daily La Repubblica. At 18:20 local time (19:20 GMT), after the hotel's collapse, Quintino Marcello tells the official that his chef, Giampiero Parete, who was staying at the Rigopiano, contacted him on Whatsapp five minutes before. "The Rigopiano hotel has collapsed, there's nothing left. He's there with his wife and little children. Act immediately. Go up there!" But La Repubblica says the official insists the hotel is fine and that the fire brigade checked it out during the morning. It was a barn containing sheep at a farm that had collapsed, the official says. Mr Parete had already contacted emergency services some time before, La Repubblica says, but they checked with the hotel owner, Bruno di Tommaso, who told them he was unaware of an avalanche - though crucially he was not at the scene.
Earlier, relatives of the missing complained that the snow-bound hotel should have been evacuated before the avalanche hit late on Wednesday afternoon. One relative, Alessio Feniello, accused authorities of wrongly telling him that his son, Stefano, had been rescued. It has also emerged that the hotel owner sent the authorities an email asking for help a few hours before the avalanche, saying that guests were "terrorised by the earthquakes and have decided to stay out in the open". Prosecutor are also examining whether environmental risks were properly assessed during the construction and subsequent renovation of the hotel.

RM Auctions has billed it as one of the most attractive post-war racing cars, calling it a 'masterpiece' of the then Aston Martin owner Sir David Brown’s vision. Don Rose, RM Car Specialist, said: 'Aston made very few sports racers in their storied history, with a mere 21 DB3S models available to privateers. 'DB3S/118 is among the best of the examples extant, with a fully documented race and ownership history and a factory engine upgrade to the "Works competition" twin-plug head specification in its first year and which is still retains today. 'An important and fascinating car, you will not see another one in its brilliant orange Dutch national racing livery, as it was when it took first place at its native Zandvoort circuit two years running.' Rob Myers, Chairman & Founder, RM Auctions, called the Aston a 'fantastic car with great history'.
The jet engine maker reported a loss before tax of £4.6bn for 2016. However, once one-off costs have been stripped out, the company's underlying profit was better than many experts had predicted. Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities and it has written off £4.4bn from currency related contracts. Like many international businesses, Rolls-Royce usually "hedges" its bets to protect itself from fluctuating currency markets. Most international aerospace contracts are priced in dollars, but, as a UK company, much of Rolls-Royce's costs are in pounds. Simon Jack: Rolls Royce – The good, the bad and the ugly It takes out long-term currency trades. These were designed to protect the firm against what seemed the most likely risk- the fall in the dollar - and many of them were put in place before the EU referendum was even announced. Since the Brexit vote, the pound has fallen sharply against the US dollar, which has led to the accounting loss. Underlying profits, which ignore these factors, fell to £813m, down from £1.4bn the previous year, although the fall was much less than many analysts had forecast. Rolls-Royce, which has been a completely separate company to the car-maker since 1971, said the outlook for this year was for a "modest performance improvement", while chief executive Warren East said more needed to be done to improve profit margins. Mr East took over as chief executive in 2015 with the task of turning round the struggling company. It is in the process of carrying out a major cost-cutting drive. "We must ensure our wide ranging business transformation programme delivers the full benefits expected, not only in terms of cost savings but also the cultural and behavioural changes necessary to ensure the transformation is sustained and high standards of business conduct are maintained," said Mr East.
"These are essential if we are to become a more trusted, resilient company." Rolls-Royce has apologised "unreservedly" for the corruption cases, which spanned 25 years, and involved illegally using local middlemen and paying bribes to win deals in Indonesia, Thailand, China and Russia. In the whacky world of the City, bad headlines can sometimes be ignored. That has been the case with Rolls-Royce; when it said last month it would pay £671m to settle a long-running bribery investigation its shares went up 6%. Investors were relieved the worst was behind it, and the same may apply to today's whacking loss. While it underlines the complicated nature of Rolls-Royce's business - it has a £30bn currency hedging book, designed, ironically, to flatten out volatility, and has unkindly been described as a hedge fund with an engine maker attached - shareholders will focus on underlying trading. There, the news is a bit better than expected, with cashflow and profit both slightly ahead of market expectations. After an annus horribilis (or two) Rolls-Royce still has some big strategic questions. It is still expanding production at a breakneck pace, which drains its reserves, and must still decide whether to take the drastic medicine advocated by some and shed some of its operations, such as the marine engine operation. Warren East, the chief executive, gave a hint that he is coming to some conclusions on the future of the company - he said he expected to set out a "vision" in the next few months.
By . Rebecca Evans . and Vanessa Allen . Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . A gang that hacked to death a former Parachute Regiment officer in Kenya may be linked to a previous attack on a British couple, police revealed yesterday. Nature reserve manager Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, was killed by five robbers at his remote home. They took the equivalent of £1.90 in cash plus a laptop and bottles of wine after Sonja Parkinson, 52, managed to escape and barricade herself in the house’s panic room. A local man has been detained and questioned over the attack on the Parkinsons but has not been formally arrested in connection with Sunday’s break-in at their home in Lolldaiga Hills, near Mount Kenya National Park. The couple were asleep when the robbers used smashed their way into their bedroom and demanded money and guns. Mrs Parkinson was tied up and threatened and her husband attacked as he fought to defend her. Police believe he may have been knocked unconscious before being struck with broad-bladed machetes, known locally as pangas. Lt Co Parkinson, from Brighton. East Sussex, was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where Prince William spent part of his gap year. He was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his military service. Police said there were parallels with the robbery and a raid on the home of another former British army officer and his wife in the region in June. Two men are expected to face trial for that attack, but two other raiders had not been traced. It is likely that Lt Col Parkinson bled to death during a raid in which by an armed gang stole a laptop, $3 and bottles of wine.
A former grammar school pupil from Brighton, he was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service. Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety. Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns.

She . came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’ Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008. Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects. In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed. The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’ Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death.
Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock. 'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George) A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very . dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and . the community. He was a very well-liked man.’ Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely' Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief . Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst. On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi. In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project. The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’
The fight started slowly but came to life and ended in brutal fashion as both slugged it out until the end. Groves, 23, was wobbled in the third and was cut badly in the 11th but boxed stylishly throughout to earn victory. Unbeaten Groves earned a majority decision, one judge scoring it 115-115 while the other two had it at 115-114. In contrast to the explosive build-up to the fight, the first round at the O2 Arena was cagey and tense with DeGale, who was booed on his way into the ring, shading it by landing the only scoring shots and ending with a sharp left jab. Whether it was respect or more likely nerves, neither boxer seemed to settle in the opening minute of the second round with both throwing just single shots. But Groves improved as the round wore on and landed a decent right on the bell. The fencing and feinting continued into the third before DeGale landed a right hook to the top of the head of Groves, who responded with one of his own while also later throwing two jabs that found the target. It was a fascinating start to the contest which Groves had just about shaded but he appeared marked below the right eye. Groves continued to impress with two-punch combinations and seemed to be in control of the fourth round but a solid left hook in the final minute wobbled him and DeGale unleashed a cluster of punches to finish on top. DeGale took a strong right hand at the start of the fifth and Groves' footwork was proving frustrating for his opponent who chased but could not catch his rival. Groves then landed a further right that appeared to hurt the tense-looking Olympic gold medallist. It was another quiet start to the sixth that drew boos from the 19,000 crowd, and that seemed to spur on DeGale who landed a big left that hurt Groves.
DeGale followed that up with another left as he tried to assert himself and he continued on the front foot, landing a quality straight left on the bell. DeGale began the seventh round confidently as Groves' defence continued to drop lower but he still managed to land a clubbing left. DeGale responded with a left of his own with his punches seeming to hold more power and the round ended with a left uppercut from the British champion. A straight left from DeGale rocked Groves and sparked the Commonwealth champion into life but despite boxing much of the eighth round on the front foot he failed to land a meaningful punch. Groves boxed behind his jab in the ninth, inviting DeGale to box on the front foot. There was a flurry of punches and after a clash of head a cut opened up above the left eye of Groves. The final minute of the ninth round was the most entertaining of the fight with both boxers opening up as DeGale rocked his opponent with 30 seconds to go and then, just before the bell, had him wobbling with a huge left, which had Groves desperately holding on. Groves still appeared dazed at the start of the 10th but found success with his jab, although his punches appeared to lack spite with DeGale looking the more dangerous fighter. In the final minute of the round they again trade punches, with Groves taking a big right hook to the side of the head, and both boxers went to their stools with bloodied faces following a brutal exchange. With two rounds to go the fight was in the balance, and another clash of heads resulted in a huge cut opening up on the forehead of Groves which attracted a lot of attention from the referee. Perhaps sensing the fight could be stopped, Groves opened up and DeGale showed great skill in picking off his opponent who looked desperate and battered.
But Groves battled on despite cuts on his forehead, left eye and right cheekbone and DeGale hurt his opponent again with a left but they again traded and landed in a contest that was turning into a classic. Going into the final round DeGale looked the fresher, but Groves landed more scoring punches, with both boxers knowing they needed a big performance to secure victory. DeGale landed a right but his momentum was checked by a big right uppercut from Groves. However, it was the British champion who ended the fight on top, opening up against a tiring Groves and they slugged it out right until the final bell. The decision was contentious with Groves earning his 13th straight victory while DeGale, who disputed the decision, suffered his first defeat in 11 professional fights. Groves, who also beat his opponent as an amateur, was content to prove the doubters wrong and claimed he would be willing to fight DeGale again. "Everyone was raving about him. Only two favoured me in a boxing news poll, but I have self belief," he told BBC 5 Live. "It feels good. I knew I'd won. I knew I'd done enough." He added: "I will fight him again yeah if everything is all right and it's the right way. But now I have beaten him twice." Earlier, middleweight Billy Joe Saunders inflicted the first stoppage of veteran Kevin Hammond's career to win in two rounds. While Frankie Gavin won the vacant WBO Inter-Continental welterweight title on points after a relatively uninspiring performance against the negative Young Mutley.
Controlled Substances Act TITLE 21 - FOOD AND DRUGS CHAPTER 13 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL SUBCHAPTER I - CONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT Part A - Introductory Provisions Part B - Authority to Control; Standards and Schedules Part C - Registration of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dispensers of Controled Substances; Piperidine Reporting Part D - Offenses and Penalties Part E - Administrative and Enforcement Provisions Part F - Advisory Commission Part G - Conforming, Transitional and Effective Date, and General Provisions PART A - INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS § 801 Note Short Title This title may be cited as the 'Controlled Substances Act'. § 801. Congressional findings and declarations: controlled substances. The Congress makes the following findings and declarations: (1) Many of the drugs included within this subchapter have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people. (2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American people. (3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because - (A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are transported in interstate commerce, (B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been transported in interstate commerce immediately before their distribution, and (C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession. (4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances. (5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate.
Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate. (6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic. (7) The United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international conventions designed to establish effective control over international and domestic traffic in controlled substances. § 801a. Congressional findings and declarations: psychotropic substances. The Congress makes the following findings and declarations: (1) The Congress has long recognized the danger involved in the manufacture, distribution, and use of certain psychotropic substances for nonscientific and nonmedical purposes, and has provided strong and effective legislation to control illicit trafficking and to regulate legitimate uses of psychotropic substances in this country. Abuse of psychotropic substances has become a phenomenon common to many countries, however, and is not confined to national borders. It is, therefore, essential that the United States cooperate with other nations in establishing effective controls over international traffic in such substances. (2) The United States has joined with other countries in executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and use of certain psychotropic substances. The Convention is not self-executing, and the obligations of the United States thereunder may only be performed pursuant to appropriate legislation. It is the intent of the Congress that the amendments made by this Act, together with existing law, will enable the United States to meet all of its obligations under the Convention and that no further legislation will be necessary for that purpose.
(3) In implementing the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the Congress intends that, consistent with the obligations of the United States under the Convention, control of psychotropic substances in the United States should be accomplished within the framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of substances provided in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.). This will insure that (A) the availability of psychotropic substances to manufacturers, distributors, dispensers, and researchers for useful and legitimate medical and scientific purposes will not be unduly restricted; (B) nothing in the Convention will interfere with bona fide research activities; and (C) nothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this country as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American medical and scientific community. § 802.

Authority and criteria for classification of substances. (a) Rules and regulations of Attorney General; hearing The Attorney General shall apply the provisions of this subchapter to the controlled substances listed in the schedules established by section 812 of this title and to any other drug or other substance added to such schedules under this subchapter.
Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the Attorney General may by rule - (1) add to such a schedule or transfer between such schedules any drug or other substance if he - (A) finds that such drug or other substance has a potential for abuse, and (B) makes with respect to such drug or other substance the findings prescribed by subsection (b) of section 812 of this title for the schedule in which such drug is to be placed; or (2) remove any drug or other substance from the schedules if he finds that the drug or other substance does not meet the requirements for inclusion in any schedule. Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. Proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of such rules may be initiated by the Attorney General (1) on his own motion, (2) at the request of the Secretary, or (3) on the petition of any interested party. (b) Evaluation of drugs and other substances The Attorney General shall, before initiating proceedings under subsection (a) of this section to control a drug or other substance or to remove a drug or other substance entirely from the schedules, and after gathering the necessary data, request from the Secretary a scientific and medical evaluation, and his recommendations, as to whether such drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a controlled substance. In making such evaluation and recommendations, the Secretary shall consider the factors listed in paragraphs (2), (3), (6), (7), and (8) of subsection (c) of this section and any scientific or medical considerations involved in paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of such subsection. The recommendations of the Secretary shall include recommendations with respect to the appropriate schedule, if any, under which such drug or other substance should be listed.
The evaluation and the recommendations of the Secretary shall be made in writing and submitted to the Attorney General within a reasonable time. The recommendations of the Secretary to the Attorney General shall be binding on the Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or other substance. If the Attorney General determines that these facts and all other relevant data constitute substantial evidence of potential for abuse such as to warrant control or substantial evidence that the drug or other substance should be removed entirely from the schedules, he shall initiate proceedings for control or removal, as the case may be, under subsection (a) of this section. (c) Factors determinative of control or removal from schedules In making any finding under subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (b) of section 812 of this title, the Attorney General shall consider the following factors with respect to each drug or other substance proposed to be controlled or removed from the schedules: (1) Its actual or relative potential for abuse. (2) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known. (3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance. (4) Its history and current pattern of abuse. (5) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse. (6) What, if any, risk there is to the public health. (7) Its psychic or physiological dependence liability. (8) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this subchapter.
(d) International treaties, conventions, and protocols requiring control; procedures respecting changes in drug schedules of Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1) If control is required by United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations, without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of this section or section 812(b) of this title and without regard to the procedures prescribed by subsections (a) and (b) of this section. (2) (A) Whenever the Secretary of State receives notification from the Secretary-General of the United Nations that information has been transmitted by or to the World Health Organization, pursuant to article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which may justify adding a drug or other substance to one of the schedules of the Convention, transferring a drug or substance from one schedule to another, or deleting it from the schedules, the Secretary of State shall immediately transmit the notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services who shall publish it in the Federal Register and provide opportunity to interested persons to submit to him comments respecting the scientific and medical evaluations which he is to prepare respecting such drug or substance. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall prepare for transmission through the Secretary of State to the World Health Organization such medical and scientific evaluations as may be appropriate regarding the possible action that could be proposed by the World Health Organization respecting the drug or substance with respect to which a notice was transmitted under this subparagraph.
(B) Whenever the Secretary of State receives information that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations proposes to decide whether to add a drug or other substance to one of the schedules of the Convention, transfer a drug or substance from one schedule to another, or delete it from the schedules, the Secretary of State shall transmit timely notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services of such information who shall publish a summary of such information in the Federal Register and provide opportunity to interested persons to submit to him comments respecting the recommendation which he is to furnish, pursuant to this subparagraph, respecting such proposal. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal. (3) When the United States receives notification of a scheduling decision pursuant to article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances that a drug or other substance has been added or transferred to a schedule specified in the notification or receives notification (referred to in this subsection as a ''schedule notice'') that existing legal controls applicable under this subchapter to a drug or substance and the controls required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)
do not meet the requirements of the schedule of the Convention in which such drug or substance has been placed, the Secretary of Health and Human Services after consultation with the Attorney General, shall first determine whether existing legal controls under this subchapter applicable to the drug or substance and the controls required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, meet the requirements of the schedule specified in the notification or schedule notice and shall take the following action: (A) If such requirements are met by such existing controls but the Secretary of Health and Human Services nonetheless believes that more stringent controls should be applied to the drug or substance, the Secretary shall recommend to the Attorney General that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or substance, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, to apply to such controls. (B) If such requirements are not met by such existing controls and the Secretary of Health and Human Services concurs in the scheduling decision or schedule notice transmitted by the notification, the Secretary shall recommend to the Attorney General that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or substance under the appropriate schedule pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(C) If such requirements are not met by such existing controls and the Secretary of Health and Human Services does not concur in the scheduling decision or schedule notice transmitted by the notification, the Secretary shall - (i) if he deems that additional controls are necessary to protect the public health and safety, recommend to the Attorney General that he initiate proceedings for scheduling the drug or substance pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, to apply such additional controls; (ii) request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of qualified acceptance, within the period specified in the Convention, pursuant to paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations; (iii) request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of qualified acceptance as prescribed in clause (ii) and request the Secretary of State to ask for a review by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, in accordance with paragraph 8 of article 2 of the Convention, of the scheduling decision; or (iv) in the case of a schedule notice, request the Secretary of State to take appropriate action under the Convention to initiate proceedings to remove the drug or substance from the schedules under the Convention or to transfer the drug or substance to a schedule under the Convention different from the one specified in the schedule notice.
(4) (A) If the Attorney General determines, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that proceedings initiated under recommendations made under paragraph (FOOTNOTE 1) (B) or (C)(i) of paragraph (3) will not be completed within the time period required by paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention, the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary and after providing interested persons opportunity to submit comments respecting the requirements of the temporary order to be issued under this sentence, shall issue a temporary order controlling the drug or substance under schedule IV or V, whichever is most appropriate to carry out the minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. As a part of such order, the Attorney General shall, after consultation with the Secretary, except such drug or substance from the application of any provision of part C of this subchapter which he finds is not required to carry out the United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. In the case of proceedings initiated under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3), the Attorney General, concurrently with the issuance of such order, shall request the Secretary of State to transmit a notice of qualified acceptance to the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. A temporary order issued under this subparagraph controlling a drug or other substance subject to proceedings initiated under subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall expire upon the effective date of the application to the drug or substance of the controls resulting from such proceedings. (FOOTNOTE 1) So in original. Probably should be ''subparagraph''.
(B) After a notice of qualified acceptance of a scheduling decision with respect to a drug or other substance is transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in accordance with clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(C) or after a request has been made under clause (iv) of such paragraph with respect to a drug or substance described in a schedule notice, the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and after providing interested persons opportunity to submit comments respecting the requirements of the order to be issued under this sentence, shall issue an order controlling the drug or substance under schedule IV or V, whichever is most appropriate to carry out the minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention in the case of a drug or substance for which a notice of qualified acceptance was transmitted or whichever the Attorney General determines is appropriate in the case of a drug or substance described in a schedule notice. As a part of such order, the Attorney General shall, after consultation with the Secretary, except such drug or substance from the application of any provision of part C of this subchapter which he finds is not required to carry out the United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention. If, as a result of a review under paragraph 8 of article 2 of the Convention of the scheduling decision with respect to which a notice of qualified acceptance was transmitted in accordance with clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(C) - (i) the decision is reversed, and (ii) the drug or substance subject to such decision is not required to be controlled under schedule IV or V to carry out the minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention, the order issued under this subparagraph with respect to such drug or substance shall expire upon receipt by the United States of the review decision.
If, as a result of action taken pursuant to action initiated under a request transmitted under clause (iv) of paragraph (3)(C), the drug or substance with respect to which such action was taken is not required to be controlled under schedule IV or V, the order issued under this paragraph with respect to such drug or substance shall expire upon receipt by the United States of a notice of the action taken with respect to such drug or substance under the Convention. (C) An order issued under subparagraph (A) or (B) may be issued without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of this section or by section 812(b) of this title and without regard to the procedures prescribed by subsection (a) or (b) of this section. (5) Nothing in the amendments made by the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978 or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder shall be construed to preclude requests by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Attorney General through the Secretary of State, pursuant to article 2 or other applicable provisions of the Convention, for review of scheduling decisions under such Convention, based on new or additional information. (e) Immediate precursors The Attorney General may, without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of this section or section 812(b) of this title and without regard to the procedures prescribed by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, place an immediate precursor in the same schedule in which the controlled substance of which it is an immediate precursor is placed or in any other schedule with a higher numerical designation. If the Attorney General designates a substance as an immediate precursor and places it in a schedule, other substances shall not be placed in a schedule solely because they are its precursors.
(f) Abuse potential If, at the time a new-drug application is submitted to the Secretary for any drug having a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system, it appears that such drug has an abuse potential, such information shall be forwarded by the Secretary to the Attorney General. (g) Exclusion of non-narcotic substances sold over the counter without a prescription; dextromethorphan; exemption of substances lacking abuse potential (1) The Attorney General shall by regulation exclude any non-narcotic substance from a schedule if such substance may, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. ), be lawfully sold over the counter without a prescription. (2) Dextromethorphan shall not be deemed to be included in any schedule by reason of enactment of this subchapter unless controlled after October 27, 1970 pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section. (3) The Attorney General may, by regulation, exempt any compound, mixture, or preparation containing a controlled substance from the application of all or any part of this subchapter if he finds such compound, mixture, or preparation meets the requirements of one of the following categories: (A) A mixture, or preparation containing a nonnarcotic controlled substance, which mixture or preparation is approved for prescription use, and which contains one or more other active ingredients which are not listed in any schedule and which are included therein in such combinations, quantity, proportion, or concentration as to vitiate the potential for abuse. (B) A compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any controlled substance, which is not for administration to a human being or animal, and which is packaged in such form or concentration, or with adulterants or denaturants, so that as packaged it does not present any significant potential for abuse.
(h) Temporary scheduling to avoid imminent hazards to public safety (1) If the Attorney General finds that the scheduling of a substance in schedule I on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, he may, by order and without regard to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section relating to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, schedule such substance in schedule I if the substance is not listed in any other schedule in section 812 of this title or if no exemption or approval is in effect for the substance under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355). Such an order may not be issued before the expiration of thirty days from - (A) the date of the publication by the Attorney General of a notice in the Federal Register of the intention to issue such order and the grounds upon which such order is to be issued, and (B) the date the Attorney General has transmitted the notice required by paragraph (4). (2) The scheduling of a substance under this subsection shall expire at the end of one year from the date of the issuance of the order scheduling such substance, except that the Attorney General may, during the pendency of proceedings under subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to the substance, extend the temporary scheduling for up to six months. (3) When issuing an order under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall be required to consider, with respect to the finding of an imminent hazard to the public safety, only those factors set forth in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (c) of this section, including actual abuse, diversion from legitimate channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution. (4) The Attorney General shall transmit notice of an order proposed to be issued under paragraph (1) to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
In issuing an order under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall take into consideration any comments submitted by the Secretary in response to a notice transmitted pursuant to this paragraph. (5) An order issued under paragraph (1) with respect to a substance shall be vacated upon the conclusion of a subsequent rulemaking proceeding initiated under subsection (a) of this section with respect to such substance. (6) An order issued under paragraph (1) is not subject to judicial review. § 812. Schedules of controlled substances.

A controlled substance analogue shall, to the extent intended for human consumption, be treated, for the purposes of any Federal law as a controlled substance in schedule I. § 814. Removal of exemption of certain drugs. (a) Removal of exemption The Attorney General shall by regulation remove from exemption under section 802(39)(A)(iv) of this title a drug or group of drugs that the Attorney General finds is being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled substance.
(b) Factors to be considered In removing a drug or group of drugs from exemption under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall consider, with respect to a drug or group of drugs that is proposed to be removed from exemption - (1) the scope, duration, and significance of the diversion; (2) whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production of a controlled substance; and (3) whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the drug or group of drugs. (c) Specificity of designation The Attorney General shall limit the designation of a drug or a group of drugs removed from exemption under subsection (a) of this section to the most particularly identifiable type of drug or group of drugs for which evidence of diversion exists unless there is evidence, based on the pattern of diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be limited to that particular drug or group of drugs. (d) Reinstatement of exemption with respect to particular drug products (1) Reinstatement On application by a manufacturer of a particular drug product that has been removed from exemption under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall by regulation reinstate the exemption with respect to that particular drug product if the Attorney General determines that the particular drug product is manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents diversion.
(2) Factors to be considered In deciding whether to reinstate the exemption with respect to a particular drug product under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall consider - (A) the package sizes and manner of packaging of the drug product; (B) the manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product; (C) evidence of diversion of the drug product; (D) any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of the drug product; and (E) such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety, including the factors described in subsection (b) of this section as applied to the drug product. (3) Status pending application for reinstatement A transaction involving a particular drug product that is the subject of a bona fide pending application for reinstatement of exemption filed with the Attorney General not later than 60 days after a regulation removing the exemption is issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall not be considered to be a regulated transaction if the transaction occurs during the pendency of the application and, if the Attorney General denies the application, during the period of 60 days following the date on which the Attorney General denies the application, unless - (A) the Attorney General has evidence that, applying the factors described in subsection (b) of this section to the drug product, the drug product is being diverted; and (B) the Attorney General so notifies the applicant. (4) Amendment and modification A regulation reinstating an exemption under paragraph (1) may be modified or revoked with respect to a particular drug product upon a finding that - (A) applying the factors described in subsection (b) of this section to the drug product, the drug product is being diverted; or (B) there is a significant change in the data that led to the issuance of the regulation.

Denial, revocation, or suspension of registration.
(a) Grounds A registration pursuant to section 823 of this title to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance or a list I chemical may be suspended or revoked by the Attorney General upon a finding that the registrant - (1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; (2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance or a list I chemical; (3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or list I chemicals or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his registration recommended by competent State authority; (4) has committed such acts as would render his registration under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the public interest as determined under such section; or (5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to section 1320a-7(a) of title 42. A registration pursuant to section 823(g) of this title to dispense a narcotic drug for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment may be suspended or revoked by the Attorney General upon a finding that the registrant has failed to comply with any standard referred to in section 823(g) of this title. (b) Limits of revocation or suspension The Attorney General may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance or list I chemical with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.
(c) Service of show cause order; proceedings Before taking action pursuant to this section, or pursuant to a denial of registration under section 823 of this title, the Attorney General shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an order to show cause why registration should not be denied, revoked, or suspended. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of the basis thereof and shall call upon the applicant or registrant to appear before the Attorney General at a time and place stated in the order, but in no event less than thirty days after the date of receipt of the order. Proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend shall be conducted pursuant to this section in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. Such proceedings shall be independent of, and not in lieu of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings under this subchapter or any other law of the United States. (d) Suspension of registration in cases of imminent danger The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend any registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings under this section, in cases where he finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety. A failure to comply with a standard referred to in section 823(g) of this title may be treated under this subsection as grounds for immediate suspension of a registration granted under such section. A suspension under this subsection shall continue in effect until the conclusion of such proceedings, including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Attorney General or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. (e) Suspension and revocation of quotas The suspension or revocation of a registration under this section shall operate to suspend or revoke any quota applicable under section 826 of this title.
(f) Disposition of controlled substances or list I chemicals In the event the Attorney General suspends or revokes a registration granted under section 823 of this title, all controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or possessed by the registrant pursuant to such registration at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation order, as the case may be, may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be placed under seal. No disposition may be made of any controlled substances or list I chemicals under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded except that a court, upon application therefor, may at any time order the sale of perishable controlled substances or list I chemicals. Any such order shall require the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all such controlled substances or list I chemicals (or proceeds of sale deposited in court) shall be forfeited to the United States; and the Attorney General shall dispose of such controlled substances or list I chemicals in accordance with section 881(e) of this title. All right, title, and interest in such controlled substances or list I chemicals shall vest in the United States upon a revocation order becoming final. (g) Seizure or placement under seal of controlled substances or list I chemicals The Attorney General may, in his discretion, seize or place under seal any controlled substances or list I chemicals owned or possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who has ceased to practice or do business in the manner contemplated by his registration. Such controlled substances or list I chemicals shall be held for the benefit of the registrant, or his successor in interest. The Attorney General shall notify a registrant, or his successor in interest, who has any controlled substance or list I chemical seized or placed under seal of the procedures to be followed to secure the return of the controlled substance or list I chemical and the conditions under which it will be returned.
The Attorney General may not dispose of any controlled substance or list I chemical seized or placed under seal under this subsection until the expiration of one hundred and eighty days from the date such substance or chemical was seized or placed under seal. § 825. Labeling and packaging. (a) Symbol It shall be unlawful to distribute a controlled substance in a commercial container unless such container, when and as required by regulations of the Attorney General, bears a label (as defined in section 321(k) of this title) containing an identifying symbol for such substance in accordance with such regulations. A different symbol shall be required for each schedule of controlled substances. (b) Unlawful distribution without identifying symbol It shall be unlawful for the manufacturer of any controlled substance to distribute such substance unless the labeling (as defined in section 321(m) of this title) of such substance contains, when and as required by regulations of the Attorney General, the identifying symbol required under subsection (a) of this section. (c) Warning on label The Secretary shall prescribe regulations under section 353(b) of this title which shall provide that the label of a drug listed in schedule II, III, or IV shall, when dispensed to or for a patient, contain a clear, concise warning that it is a crime to transfer the drug to any person other than the patient. (d) Containers to be securely sealed It shall be unlawful to distribute controlled substances in schedule I or II, and narcotic drugs in schedule III or IV, unless the bottle or other container, stopper, covering, or wrapper thereof is securely sealed as required by regulations of the Attorney General. § 826. Production quotas for controlled substances.
(a) Establishment of total annual needs The Attorney General shall determine the total quantity and establish production quotas for each basic class of controlled substance in schedules I and II to be manufactured each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. Production quotas shall be established in terms of quantities of each basic class of controlled substance and not in terms of individual pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared from or containing such a controlled substance. (b) Individual production quotas; revised quotas The Attorney General shall limit or reduce individual production quotas to the extent necessary to prevent the aggregate of individual quotas from exceeding the amount determined necessary each year by the Attorney General under subsection (a) of this section. The quota of each registered manufacturer for each basic class of controlled substance in schedule I or II shall be revised in the same proportion as the limitation or reduction of the aggregate of the quotas. However, if any registrant, before the issuance of a limitation or reduction in quota, has manufactured in excess of his revised quota, the amount of the excess shall be subtracted from his quota for the following year. (c) Manufacturing quotas for registered manufacturers On or before October 1 of each year, upon application therefor by a registered manufacturer, the Attorney General shall fix a manufacturing quota for the basic classes of controlled substances in schedules I and II that the manufacturer seeks to produce. The quota shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
In fixing such quotas, the Attorney General shall determine the manufacturer's estimated disposal, inventory, and other requirements for the calendar year; and, in making his determination, the Attorney General shall consider the manufacturer's current rate of disposal, the trend of the national disposal rate during the preceding calendar year, the manufacturer's production cycle and inventory position, the economic availability of raw materials, yield and stability problems, emergencies such as strikes and fires, and other factors. (d) Quotas for registrants who have not manufactured controlled substance during one or more preceding years The Attorney General shall, upon application and subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, fix a quota for a basic class of controlled substance in schedule I or II for any registrant who has not manufactured that basic class of controlled substance during one or more preceding calendar years. In fixing such quota, the Attorney General shall take into account the registrant's reasonably anticipated requirements for the current year; and, in making his determination of such requirements, he shall consider such factors specified in subsection (c) of this section as may be relevant. (e) Quota increases At any time during the year any registrant who has applied for or received a manufacturing quota for a basic class of controlled substance in schedule I or II may apply for an increase in that quota to meet his estimated disposal, inventory, and other requirements during the remainder of that year. In passing upon the application the Attorney General shall take into consideration any occurrences since the filing of the registrant's initial quota application that may require an increased manufacturing rate by the registrant during the balance of the year. In passing upon the application the Attorney General may also take into account the amount, if any, by which the determination of the Attorney General under subsection (a) of this section exceeds the aggregate of the quotas of all registrants under this section.
(f) Incidental production exception Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no registration or quota may be required for the manufacture of such quantities of controlled substances in schedules I and II as incidentally and necessarily result from the manufacturing process used for the manufacture of a controlled substance with respect to which its manufacturer is duly registered under this subchapter. The Attorney General may, by regulation, prescribe restrictions on the retention and disposal of such incidentally produced substances. § 827. Records and reports of registrants. (a) Inventory Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section - (1) every registrant under this subchapter shall, on May 1, 1971, or as soon thereafter as such registrant first engages in the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances, and every second year thereafter, make a complete and accurate record of all stocks thereof on hand, except that the regulations prescribed under this section shall permit each such biennial inventory (following the initial inventory required by this paragraph) to be prepared on such registrant's regular general physical inventory date (if any) which is nearest to and does not vary by more than six months from the biennial date that would otherwise apply; (2) on the effective date of each regulation of the Attorney General controlling a substance that immediately prior to such date was not a controlled substance, each registrant under this subchapter manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing such substance shall make a complete and accurate record of all stocks thereof on hand; and (3) on and after May 1, 1971, every registrant under this subchapter manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a controlled substance or substances shall maintain, on a current basis, a complete and accurate record of each such substance manufactured, received, sold, delivered, or otherwise disposed of by him, except that this paragraph shall not require the maintenance of a perpetual inventory.
(b) Availability of records Every inventory or other record required under this section (1) shall be in accordance with, and contain such relevant information as may be required by, regulations of the Attorney General, (2) shall (A) be maintained separately from all other records of the registrant, or (B) alternatively, in the case of nonnarcotic controlled substances, be in such form that information required by the Attorney General is readily retrievable from the ordinary business records of the registrant, and (3) shall be kept and be available, for at least two years, for inspection and copying by officers or employees of the United States authorized by the Attorney General.
(c) Nonapplicability The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply - (1) (A) to the prescribing of controlled substances in schedule II, III, IV, or V by practitioners acting in the lawful course of their professional practice unless such substance is prescribed in the course of maintenance or detoxification treatment of an individual; or (B) to the administering of a controlled substance in schedule II, III, IV, or V unless the practitioner regularly engages in the dispensing or administering of controlled substances and charges his patients, either separately or together with charges for other professional services, for substances so dispensed or administered or unless such substance is administered in the course of maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment of an individual; (2) (A) to the use of controlled substances, at establishments registered under this subchapter which keep records with respect to such substances, in research conducted in conformity with an exemption granted under section 355(i) or 360b(j) of this title; (B) to the use of controlled substances, at establishments registered under this subchapter which keep records with respect to such substances, in preclinical research or in teaching; or (3) to the extent of any exemption granted to any person, with respect to all or part of such provisions, by the Attorney General by or pursuant to regulation on the basis of a finding that the application of such provisions (or part thereof) to such person is not necessary for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter. Nothing in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances shall be construed as superseding or otherwise affecting the provisions of paragraph (1)(B), (2), or (3) of this subsection.
(d) Periodic reports to Attorney General Every manufacturer registered under section 823 of this title shall, at such time or times and in such form as the Attorney General may require, make periodic reports to the Attorney General of every sale, delivery or other disposal by him of any controlled substance, and each distributor shall make such reports with respect to narcotic controlled substances, identifying by the registration number assigned under this subchapter the person or establishment (unless exempt from registration under section 822(d) of this title) to whom such sale, delivery, or other disposal was made. (e) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements of drug conventions In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under any other provision of this subchapter, each manufacturer registered under section 823 of this title shall, with respect to narcotic and nonnarcotic controlled substances manufactured by it, make such reports to the Attorney General, and maintain such records, as the Attorney General may require to enable the United States to meet its obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and article 16 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Attorney General shall administer the requirements of this subsection in such a manner as to avoid the unnecessary imposition of duplicative requirements under this subchapter on manufacturers subject to the requirements of this subsection. (f) Investigational uses of drugs; procedures Regulations under sections 355(i) and 360(j) of this title, relating to investigational use of drugs, shall include such procedures as the Secretary, after consultation with the Attorney General, determines are necessary to insure the security and accountability of controlled substances used in research to which such regulations apply. (g) Change of address Every registrant under this subchapter shall be required to report any change of professional or business address in such manner as the Attorney General shall by regulation require. § 828. Order forms.
(a) Unlawful distribution of controlled substances It shall be unlawful for any person to distribute a controlled substance in schedule I or II to another except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such substance is distributed, made on a form to be issued by the Attorney General in blank in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and regulations prescribed by him pursuant to this section. (b) Nonapplicability of provisions Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to - (1) the exportation of such substances from the United States in conformity with subchapter II of this chapter; (2) the delivery of such a substance to or by a common or contract carrier for carriage in the lawful and usual course of its business, or to or by a warehouseman for storage in the lawful and usual course of its business; but where such carriage or storage is in connection with the distribution by the owner of the substance to a third person, this paragraph shall not relieve the distributor from compliance with subsection (a) of this section. (c) Preservation and availability (1) Every person who in pursuance of an order required under subsection (a) of this section distributes a controlled substance shall preserve such order for a period of two years, and shall make such order available for inspection and copying by officers and employees of the United States duly authorized for that purpose by the Attorney General, and by officers or employees of States or their political subdivisions who are charged with the enforcement of State or local laws regulating the production, or regulating the distribution or dispensing, of controlled substances and who are authorized under such laws to inspect such orders.
(2) Every person who gives an order required under subsection (a) of this section shall, at or before the time of giving such order, make or cause to be made a duplicate thereof on a form to be issued by the Attorney General in blank in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and regulations prescribed by him pursuant to this section, and shall, if such order is accepted, preserve such duplicate for a period of two years and make it available for inspection and copying by the officers and employees mentioned in paragraph (1) of this subsection. (d) Issuance (1) The Attorney General shall issue forms pursuant to subsections (a) and (c)(2) of this section only to persons validly registered under section 823 of this title (or exempted from registration under section 822(d) of this title). Whenever any such form is issued to a person, the Attorney General shall, before delivery thereof, insert therein the name of such person, and it shall be unlawful for any other person (A) to use such form for the purpose of obtaining controlled substances or (B) to furnish such form to any person with intent thereby to procure the distribution of such substances. (2) The Attorney General may charge reasonable fees for the issuance of such forms in such amounts as he may prescribe for the purpose of covering the cost to the United States of issuing such forms, and other necessary activities in connection therewith. (e) Unlawful acts It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain by means of order forms issued under this section controlled substances for any purpose other than their use, distribution, dispensing, or administration in the conduct of a lawful business in such substances or in the course of his professional practice or research. § 829. Prescriptions.

(d) Non-prescription drugs with abuse potential Whenever it appears to the Attorney General that a drug not considered to be a prescription drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)
should be so considered because of its abuse potential, he shall so advise the Secretary and furnish to him all available data relevant thereto. § 830. Regulation of listed chemicals and certain machines. (a) Record of regulated transactions (1) Each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction involving a listed chemical, a tableting machine, or an encapsulating machine shall keep a record of the transaction - (A) for 4 years after the date of the transaction, if the listed chemical is a list I chemical or if the transaction involves a tableting machine or an encapsulating machine; and (B) for 2 years after the date of the transaction, if the listed chemical is a list II chemical.

(e) Death penalty (1) In addition to the other penalties set forth in this section - (A) any person engaging in or working in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise, or any person engaging in an offense punishable under section 841(b)(1)(A) of this title or section 960(b)(1) of this title who intentionally kills or counsels, commands, induces, procures, or causes the intentional killing of an individual and such killing results, shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment, which shall not be less than 20 years, and which may be up to life imprisonment, or may be sentenced to death; and (B) any person, during the commission of, in furtherance of, or while attempting to avoid apprehension, prosecution or service of a prison sentence for, a felony violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter who intentionally kills or counsels, commands, induces, procures, or causes the intentional killing of any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer engaged in, or on account of, the performance of such officer's official duties and such killing results, shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment, which shall not be less than 20 years, and which may be up to life imprisonment, or may be sentenced to death. (2) As used in paragraph (1)(b), (FOOTNOTE 1) the term ''law enforcement officer'' means a public servant authorized by law or by a Government agency or Congress to conduct or engage in the prevention, investigation, prosecution or adjudication of an offense, and includes those engaged in corrections, probation, or parole functions. (FOOTNOTE 1) So in original. Probably should be paragraph ''(1)(B),''. (g) (FOOTNOTE 2) Hearing required with respect to death penalty (FOOTNOTE 2) So in original.
Section does not contain a subsec. (f), see 1988 Amendment note below. (g) Hearing required with respect to the death penalty. A person shall be subjected to the penalty of death for any offense under this section only if a hearing is held in accordance with this section. (h) Notice by Government in death penalty cases (1) Whenever the Government intends to seek the death penalty for an offense under this section for which one of the sentences provided is death, the attorney for the Government, a reasonable time before trial or acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, shall sign and file with the court, and serve upon the defendant, a notice - (A) that the Government in the event of conviction will seek the sentence of death; and (B) setting forth the aggravating factors enumerated in subsection (n) of this section and any other aggravating factors which the Government will seek to prove as the basis for the death penalty. (2) The court may permit the attorney for the Government to amend this notice for good cause shown. (i) Hearing before court or jury (1) When the attorney for the Government has filed a notice as required under subsection (h) of this section and the defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense under subsection (e) of this section, the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the guilty plea was entered, or any other judge if the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the guilty plea was entered is unavailable, shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the punishment to be imposed.
The hearing shall be conducted - (A) before the jury which determined the defendant's guilt; (B) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing if - (i) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty; (ii) the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury; (iii) the jury which determined the defendant's guilt has been discharged for good cause; or (iv) after initial imposition of a sentence under this section, redetermination of the sentence under this section is necessary; or (C) before the court alone, upon the motion of the defendant and with the approval of the Government. (2) A jury impaneled under paragraph (1)(B) shall consist of 12 members, unless, at any time before the conclusion of the hearing, the parties stipulate with the approval of the court that it shall consist of any number less than 12. (j) Proof of aggravating and mitigating factors Notwithstanding rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, when a defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense under subsection (e) of this section, no presentence report shall be prepared. In the sentencing hearing, information may be presented as to matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating factors set forth in subsections (m) and (n) of this section, or any other mitigating factor or any other aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection (h)(1)(B) of this section. Where information is presented relating to any of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (n) of this section, information may be presented relating to any other aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection (h)(1)(B) of this section. Information presented may include the trial transcript and exhibits if the hearing is held before a jury or judge not present during the trial, or at the trial judge's discretion.
Any other information relevant to such mitigating or aggravating factors may be presented by either the Government or the defendant, regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials, except that information may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. The Government and the defendant shall be permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any of the aggravating or mitigating factors and as to appropriateness in that case of imposing a sentence of death. The Government shall open the argument. The defendant shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The burden of establishing the existence of any aggravating factor is on the Government, and is not satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of establishing the existence of any mitigating factor is on the defendant, and is not satisfied unless established by a preponderance of the evidence. (k) Return of findings The jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider all the information received during the hearing. It shall return special findings identifying any aggravating factors set forth in subsection (n) of this section, found to exist. If one of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (n)(1) of this section and another of the aggravating factors set forth in paragraphs (2) through (12) of subsection (n) of this section is found to exist, a special finding identifying any other aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection (h)(1)(B) of this section, may be returned.
A finding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by one or more of the members of the jury, and any member of the jury who finds the existence of a mitigating factor may consider such a factor established for purposes of this subsection, regardless of the number of jurors who concur that the factor has been established. A finding with respect to any aggravating factor must be unanimous. If an aggravating factor set forth in subsection (n)(1) of this section is not found to exist or an aggravating factor set forth in subsection (n)(1) of this section is found to exist but no other aggravating factor set forth in subsection (n) of this section is found to exist, the court shall impose a sentence, other than death, authorized by law. If an aggravating factor set forth in subsection (n)(1) of this section and one or more of the other aggravating factors set forth in subsection (n) of this section are found to exist, the jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall then consider whether the aggravating factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist, or in the absence of mitigating factors, whether the aggravating factors are themselves sufficient to justify a sentence of death. Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous vote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall recommend that a sentence of death shall be imposed rather than a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser sentence. The jury or the court, regardless of its findings with respect to aggravating and mitigating factors, is never required to impose a death sentence and the jury shall be so instructed. (l) Imposition of sentence Upon the recommendation that the sentence of death be imposed, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. Otherwise the court shall impose a sentence, other than death, authorized by law.
A sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is under 18 years of age at the time the crime was committed. A sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded. A sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who, as a result of mental disability - (1) cannot understand the nature of the pending proceedings, what such person was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the punishment; or (2) lacks the capacity to recognize or understand facts which would make the punishment unjust or unlawful, or lacks the ability to convey such information to counsel or to the court. (m) Mitigating factors In determining whether a sentence of death is to be imposed on a defendant, the finder of fact shall consider mitigating factors, including the following: (1) The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct or to conform conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired, regardless of whether the capacity was so impaired as to constitute a defense to the charge. (2) The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress, regardless of whether the duress was of such a degree as to constitute a defense to the charge. (3) The defendant is punishable as a principal (as defined in section 2 of title 18) in the offense, which was committed by another, but the defendant's participation was relatively minor, regardless of whether the participation was so minor as to constitute a defense to the charge. (4) The defendant could not reasonably have foreseen that the defendant's conduct in the course of the commission of murder, or other offense resulting in death for which the defendant was convicted, would cause, or would create a grave risk of causing, death to any person. (5) The defendant was youthful, although not under the age of 18. (6) The defendant did not have a significant prior criminal record.
(7) The defendant committed the offense under severe mental or emotional disturbance. (8) Another defendant or defendants, equally culpable in the crime, will not be punished by death. (9) The victim consented to the criminal conduct that resulted in the victim's death. (10) That other factors in the defendant's background or character mitigate against imposition of the death sentence. (n) Aggravating factors for homicide If the defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense under subsection (e) of this section, the following aggravating factors are the only aggravating factors that shall be considered, unless notice of additional aggravating factors is provided under subsection (h)(1)(B) of this section: (1) The defendant - (A) intentionally killed the victim; (B) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in the death of the victim; (C) intentionally engaged in conduct intending that the victim be killed or that lethal force be employed against the victim, which resulted in the death of the victim; (D) intentionally engaged in conduct which - (i) the defendant knew would create a grave risk of death to a person, other than one of the participants in the offense; and (ii) resulted in the death of the victim. (2) The defendant has been convicted of another Federal offense, or a State offense resulting in the death of a person, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or a sentence of death was authorized by statute. (3) The defendant has previously been convicted of two or more State or Federal offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, committed on different occasions, involving the infliction of, or attempted infliction of, serious bodily injury upon another person. (4) The defendant has previously been convicted of two or more State or Federal offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, committed on different occasions, involving the distribution of a controlled substance.
(5) In the commission of the offense or in escaping apprehension for a violation of subsection (e) of this section, the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to one or more persons in addition to the victims of the offense. (6) The defendant procured the commission of the offense by payment, or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value. (7) The defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in the expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value. (8) The defendant committed the offense after substantial planning and premeditation. (9) The victim was particularly vulnerable due to old age, youth, or infirmity. (10) The defendant had previously been convicted of violating this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter for which a sentence of five or more years may be imposed or had previously been convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. (11) The violation of this subchapter in relation to which the conduct described in subsection (e) of this section occurred was a violation of section 859 of this title. (12) The defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse to the victim. (o) Right of defendant to justice without discrimination (1) In any hearing held before a jury under this section, the court shall instruct the jury that in its consideration of whether the sentence of death is justified it shall not consider the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or the victim, and that the jury is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that it would recommend a sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant, or the victim, may be.
The jury shall return to the court a certificate signed by each juror that consideration of the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or the victim was not involved in reaching his or her individual decision, and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regarding a sentence for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant, or the victim, may be. (2) Not later than one year from November 18, 1988, the Comptroller General shall conduct a study of the various procedures used by the several States for determining whether or not to impose the death penalty in particular cases, and shall report to the Congress on whether or not any or all of the various procedures create a significant risk that the race of a defendant, or the race of a victim against whom a crime was committed, influence the likelihood that defendants in those States will be sentenced to death. In conducting the study required by this paragraph, the General Accounting Office shall - (A) use ordinary methods of statistical analysis, including methods comparable to those ruled admissible by the courts in race discrimination cases under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. ); (B) study only crimes occurring after January 1, 1976; and (C) determine what, if any, other factors, including any relation between any aggravating or mitigating factors and the race of the victim or the defendant, may account for any evidence that the race of the defendant, or the race of the victim, influences the likelihood that defendants will be sentenced to death. In addition, the General Accounting Office shall examine separately and include in the report, death penalty cases involving crimes similar to those covered under this section.
(p) Sentencing in capital cases in which death penalty is not sought or imposed If a person is convicted for an offense under subsection (e) of this section and the court does not impose the penalty of death, the court may impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. (q) Appeal in capital cases; counsel for financially unable defendants (1) In any case in which the sentence of death is imposed under this section, the sentence of death shall be subject to review by the court of appeals upon appeal by the defendant. Notice of appeal must be filed within the time prescribed for appeal of judgment in section 2107 of title 28. An appeal under this section may be consolidated with an appeal of the judgment of conviction. Such review shall have priority over all other cases. (2) On review of the sentence, the court of appeals shall consider the record, the evidence submitted during the trial, the information submitted during the sentencing hearing, the procedures employed in the sentencing hearing, and the special findings returned under this section. (3) The court shall affirm the sentence if it determines that - (A) the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and (B) the information supports the special finding of the existence of every aggravating factor upon which the sentence was based, together with, or the failure to find, any mitigating factors as set forth or allowed in this section. In all other cases the court shall remand the case for reconsideration under this section. The court of appeals shall state in writing the reasons for its disposition of the review of the sentence.
(4) (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in every criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime which may be punishable by death, a defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at any time either - (i) before judgment; or (ii) after the entry of a judgment imposing a sentence of death but before the execution of that judgment; shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with paragraphs (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9). (B) In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of title 28 seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with paragraphs (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9). (5) If the appointment is made before judgment, at least one attorney so appointed must have been admitted to practice in the court in which the prosecution is to be tried for not less than five years, and must have had not less than three years experience in the actual trial of felony prosecutions in that court. (6) If the appointment is made after judgment, at least one attorney so appointed must have been admitted to practice in the court of appeals for not less than five years, and must have had not less than three years experience in the handling of appeals in that court in felony cases.
(7) With respect to paragraphs (5) and (6), the court, for good cause, may appoint another attorney whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise enable him or her to properly represent the defendant, with due consideration to the seriousness of the possible penalty and to the unique and complex nature of the litigation. (8) Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney's own motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appointed shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures, and shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant. (9) Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings that investigative, expert or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, whether in connection with issues relating to guilt or sentence, the court shall authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services on behalf of the defendant and shall order the payment of fees and expenses therefore, under paragraph (10). Upon a finding that timely procurement of such services could not practicably await prior authorization, the court may authorize the provision of and payment for such services nunc pro tunc. (10) Notwithstanding the rates and maximum limits generally applicable to criminal cases and any other provision of law to the contrary, the court shall fix the compensation to be paid to attorneys appointed under this subsection and the fees and expenses to be paid for investigative, expert, and other reasonably necessary services authorized under paragraph (9), at such rates or amounts as the court determines to be reasonably necessary to carry out the requirements of paragraphs (4) through (9).
(r) Refusal to participate by State and Federal correctional employees No employee of any State department of corrections or the Federal Bureau of Prisons and no employee providing services to that department or bureau under contract shall be required, as a condition of that employment, or contractual obligation to be in attendance at or to participate in any execution carried out under this section if such participation is contrary to the moral or religious convictions of the employee. For purposes of this subsection, the term ''participation in executions'' includes personal preparation of the condemned individual and the apparatus used for execution and supervision of the activities of other personnel in carrying out such activities. § 849. Transportation safety offenses. (a) Definitions In this section - ''safety rest area'' means a roadside facility with parking facilities for the rest or other needs of motorists.

(b) First offense A person who violates section 841(a)(1) of this title or section 856 of this title by distributing or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance in or on, or within 1,000 feet of, a truck stop or safety rest area is (except as provided in subsection (b) (FOOTNOTE 1) of this section) subject to - (FOOTNOTE 1) So in original. Probably should be subsection ''(c)''. (1) twice the maximum punishment authorized by section 841(b) of this title; and (2) twice any term of supervised release authorized by section 841(b) of this title for a first offense.
(c) Subsequent offense A person who violates section 841(a)(1) of this title or section 856 of this title by distributing or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance in or on, or within 1,000 feet of, a truck stop or a safety rest area after a prior conviction or convictions under subsection (a) (FOOTNOTE 2) of this section have become final is subject to - (FOOTNOTE 2) So in original. Probably should be subsection ''(b)''. (1) 3 times the maximum punishment authorized by section 841(b) of this title; and (2) 3 times any term of supervised release authorized by section 841(b) of this title for a first offense. § 850. Information for sentencing. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter or section 242a(a) of title 42, no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter. § 851. Proceedings to establish prior convictions. (a) Information filed by United States Attorney (1) No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon. Upon a showing by the United States attorney that facts regarding prior convictions could not with due diligence be obtained prior to trial or before entry of a plea of guilty, the court may postpone the trial or the taking of the plea of guilty for a reasonable period for the purpose of obtaining such facts.
Clerical mistakes in the information may be amended at any time prior to the pronouncement of sentence. (2) An information may not be filed under this section if the increased punishment which may be imposed is imprisonment for a term in excess of three years unless the person either waived or was afforded prosecution by indictment for the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed. (b) Affirmation or denial of previous conviction If the United States attorney files an information under this section, the court shall after conviction but before pronouncement of sentence inquire of the person with respect to whom the information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information, and shall inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence. (c) Denial; written response; hearing (1) If the person denies any allegation of the information of prior conviction, or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid, he shall file a written response to the information. A copy of the response shall be served upon the United States attorney. The court shall hold a hearing to determine any issues raised by the response which would except the person from increased punishment. The failure of the United States attorney to include in the information the complete criminal record of the person or any facts in addition to the convictions to be relied upon shall not constitute grounds for invalidating the notice given in the information required by subsection (a)(1) of this section. The hearing shall be before the court without a jury and either party may introduce evidence. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States attorney shall have the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on any issue of fact. At the request of either party, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(2) A person claiming that a conviction alleged in the information was obtained in violation of the Constitution of the United States shall set forth his claim, and the factual basis therefor, with particularity in his response to the information. The person shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence on any issue of fact raised by the response. Any challenge to a prior conviction, not raised by response to the information before an increased sentence is imposed in reliance thereon, shall be waived unless good cause be shown for failure to make a timely challenge. (d) Imposition of sentence (1) If the person files no response to the information, or if the court determines, after hearing, that the person is subject to increased punishment by reason of prior convictions, the court shall proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part. (2) If the court determines that the person has not been convicted as alleged in the information, that a conviction alleged in the information is invalid, or that the person is otherwise not subject to an increased sentence as a matter of law, the court shall, at the request of the United States attorney, postpone sentence to allow an appeal from that determination. If no such request is made, the court shall impose sentence as provided by this part. The person may appeal from an order postponing sentence as if sentence had been pronounced and a final judgment of conviction entered. (e) Statute of limitations No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction. § 852. Application of treaties and other international agreements.
Nothing in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, or other treaties or international agreements shall be construed to limit the provision of treatment, education, or rehabilitation as alternatives to conviction or criminal penalty for offenses involving any drug or other substance subject to control under any such treaty or agreement. § 853. Criminal forfeitures. (a) Property subject to criminal forfeiture Any person convicted of a violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter punishable by imprisonment for more than one year shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law - (1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation; (2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation; and (3) in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of section 848 of this title, the person shall forfeit, in addition to any property described in paragraph (1) or (2), any of his interest in, claims against, and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over, the continuing criminal enterprise. The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, that the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this part, a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Meaning of term ''property'' Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes - (1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in land; and (2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims, and securities. (c) Third party transfers All right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) of this section vests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section. Any such property that is subsequently transferred to a person other than the defendant may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the United States, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to subsection (n) of this section that he is a bona fide purchaser for value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section. (d) Rebuttable presumption There is a rebuttable presumption at trial that any property of a person convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter is subject to forfeiture under this section if the United States establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that - (1) such property was acquired by such person during the period of the violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or within a reasonable time after such period; and (2) there was no likely source for such property other than the violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.
(e) Protective orders (1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a) of this section for forfeiture under this section - (A) upon the filing of an indictment or information charging a violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter for which criminal forfeiture may be ordered under this section and alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section; or (B) prior to the filing of such an indictment or information, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that - (i) there is a substantial probability that the United States will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and (ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered: Provided, however, That an order entered pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall be effective for not more than ninety days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown or unless an indictment or information described in subparagraph (A) has been filed. (2) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture.
Such a temporary order shall expire not more than ten days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order. (3) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. (f) Warrant of seizure The Government may request the issuance of a warrant authorizing the seizure of property subject to forfeiture under this section in the same manner as provided for a search warrant. If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the property to be seized would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture and that an order under subsection (e) of this section may not be sufficient to assure the availability of the property for forfeiture, the court shall issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of such property. (g) Execution Upon entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the court shall authorize the Attorney General to seize all property ordered forfeited upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem proper. Following entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the United States, enter such appropriate restraining orders or injunctions, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the United States in the property ordered forfeited.

Any property right or interest not exercisable by, or transferable for value to, the United States shall expire and shall not revert to the defendant, nor shall the defendant or any person acting in concert with him or on his behalf be eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the United States. Upon application of a person, other than the defendant or a person acting in concert with him or on his behalf, the court may restrain or stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture, if the applicant demonstrates that proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property will result in irreparable injury, harm, or loss to him. (i) Authority of the Attorney General With respect to property ordered forfeited under this section, the Attorney General is authorized to - (1) grant petitions for mitigation or remission of forfeiture, restore forfeited property to victims of a violation of this subchapter, or take any other action to protect the rights of innocent persons which is in the interest of justice and which is not inconsistent with the provisions of this section; (2) compromise claims arising under this section; (3) award compensation to persons providing information resulting in a forfeiture under this section; (4) direct the disposition by the United States, in accordance with the provisions of section 881(e) of this title, of all property ordered forfeited under this section by public sale or any other commercially feasible means, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons; and (5) take appropriate measures necessary to safeguard and maintain property ordered forfeited under this section pending its disposition.

(n) Third party interests (1) Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the United States shall publish notice of the order and of its intent to dispose of the property in such manner as the Attorney General may direct.
The Government may also, to the extent practicable, provide direct written notice to any person known to have alleged an interest in the property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture as a substitute for published notice as to those persons so notified. (2) Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the United States pursuant to this section may, within thirty days of the final publication of notice or his receipt of notice under paragraph (1), whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property. The hearing shall be held before the court alone, without a jury. (3) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury and shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner's right, title, or interest in the property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner's acquisition of the right, title, or interest in the property, any additional facts supporting the petitioner's claim, and the relief sought. (4) The hearing on the petition shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the interests of justice, be held within thirty days of the filing of the petition. The court may consolidate the hearing on the petition with a hearing on any other petition filed by a person other than the defendant under this subsection. (5) At the hearing, the petitioner may testify and present evidence and witnesses on his own behalf, and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. The United States may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of its claim to the property and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall consider the relevant portions of the record of the criminal case which resulted in the order of forfeiture.
(6) If, after the hearing, the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that - (A) the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and such right, title, or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or (B) the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section; the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination. (7) Following the court's disposition of all petitions filed under this subsection, or if no such petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in paragraph (2) for the filing of such petitions, the United States shall have clear title to property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture and may warrant good title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee.

The inventory shall be made in the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if they are present, or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the person making such inventory, and shall be verified by the person executing the warrant. The judge or magistrate judge, upon request, shall deliver a copy of the inventory to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken and the applicant for the warrant.

Return to top - THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937 Full Text of the Marihuana Tax Act as passed in 1937 Introduction (in italics) by David Solomon The popular and therapeutic uses of hemp preparations are not categorically prohibited by the provisions of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. The apparent purpose of the Act is to levy a token tax of approximately one dollar on all buyers, sellers, importers, growers, physicians, veterinarians, and any other persons who deal in marijuana commercially, prescribe it professionally, or possess it.
The deceptive nature of that apparent purpose begins to come into focus when the reader reaches the penalty provisions of the Act: five years' imprisonment, a $2,000 fine, or both seem rather excessive for evading a sum (provided for by the purchase of a Treasury Department tax stamp) that, even if collected, would produce only a minute amount of government revenue. (Fines and jail sentences were f urther increased to the point of the cruel and unusual in subsequent federal drug legislation that incorporated the Marijuana Tax Act. It is now possible under the later version of the Act to draw a life sentence for selling just one marihuana cigarette to a minor.) One might wonder, too, why a small clause, amounting to an open-ended catchall provision, was inserted into the Act, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to grant the Commissioner (then Harry Anslinger) and agents of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Narcotics absolute administrative regulatory, and police powers in the enforcement of the law. The message becomes entirely clear when, having finished the short text of the Act itself, one proceeds to the sixty-odd pages of administrative and enforcement procedures established by the infamous Regulations No. 1. That regulation, not fully reproduced here, calls for a maze of affidavits, depositions, sworn statements, and constant Treasury Department police inspection in every instance that marijuana is bought, sold, used, raised, distributed, given away, and so on. Physicians who wish to purchase the one-dollar tax stamp so that they might prescribe it for their patients are forced to report such use to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in sworn and attested detail, revealing the name and address of the patient, the nature of his ailment, the dates and amounts prescribed, and so on. If a physician for any reason fails to do so immediately, both he and his patient are liable to imprisonment-and a heavy fine.
Obviously, the details of that regulation make it far too risky for anyone to have anything to do with marijuana in any way whatsoever. Regulations No. 1 was more than an invasion of the traditional right of privacy between patient and physician; it was a hopelessly involved set of rules that were obviously designed not merely to discourage but to prohibit the medical and popular use of marijuana. In addition to the Marihuana Tax Act and Regulations No. 1, the Bureau of Narcotics prepared a standard bill for marihuana that more than forty state legislatures enacted. This bill made possession and use of marihuana illegal per se, and so reinforced the federal act. U. S.

REGULATIONS Introductory The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, imposes special (occupational) taxes upon persons engaging in activities involving articles or material within the definition of "marihuana" contained in the act, and also taxes the transfer of such articles or material. These regulations deal with details as to tax computation, procedure, the forms of records and returns, and similar matters.
These matters in some degree are controlled by certain sections of the United States Revised Statutes and other statutes of general application. Provisions of these statutes, as well as of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 are quoted, in whole or in part, as the immediate or general basis for the regulatory provisions set forth. The quoted provisions are from the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 unless otherwise indicated. Provisions of the statutes upon which the various articles of the regulations are based generally have not been repeated in the articles. Therefore, the statutory excerpts preceding the several articles should be examined to obtain complete information.

(Photo by Linda Davidson / The Washington Post) The Drug Enforcement Administration published a rule in the Federal Register Wednesday clarifying that certain marijuana extracts — notably cannabidiol, or CBD — are indeed Schedule 1 controlled substances and just as illegal under federal law as whole-plant marijuana itself. DEA spokesman Russell Baer says it is an administrative measure to help with record-keeping, but the rule drew attention for its use of the archaic spelling of “marihuana" -- with an “H” instead of a “J.” The rule is entitled “Establishment of a New Code for Marihuana Extract,” and uses the H spelling throughout. Some marijuana legalization advocates speculated that this spelling was used to be sneaky, “so the article wouldn't pop up under any searches for changes in marijuana policy.” Others asked “when the DEA will step into the 21st century and stop using the archaic version of the word 'marihuana. '” The spelling is freighted with historical significance. Traditionally, the plant and the drugs derived from it had been called “cannabis,” the scientific word for the genus of the plant itself. "'Cannabis' is the botanical term for the plant, and the term for the drug in most of the world,” explained drug policy expert Mark Kleiman of NYU in an email.
In the early 20th century “marijuana” or “marihuana” were primarily colloquial terms borrowed from Mexican Spanish, as the Brookings Institution's John Hudak explains in his book Marijuana: A Short History. “During and especially after the Spanish-American War,” Hudak writes, “American resentment toward Mexicans and Mexican immigrants exploded.” Authorities who wanted to prohibit use of the drug soon discovered that associating it with Mexican immigrants was an effective propaganda tool. The word marijuana — with both “H” and “J” variants — was “popularized in the United States during the 1930s by advocates of prohibition who sought to exploit prejudice against despised minority groups, especially Mexican immigrants,” explained journalist and medical marijuana advocate Martin Lee in his book Smoke Signals. NYU's Kleiman said that “if the drug could be made to sound Mexican it would seem more dangerous.” The “h” variant is what eventually made its way into the Marihuana Tax Act of the 1930s, the federal government's first crack at regulating the drug. That spelling was again used in the Controlled Substances Act, passed in 1970. Starting in the 1960s “marijuana” began to be adopted as the preferred spelling in popular usage. “Marihuana” declined precipitously in the 1970s shortly after the passage of the Controlled Substances Act. You can see the evolution of all three terms — “cannabis,” “marijuana” and “marihuana" -- in Google's corpus of English language books between the 1860s and early 2000s. In the late 19th and early 20th century, “cannabis” was the dominant term. Starting in the 1930s both “marijuana” and “marihuana” gained popularity.
The use of all terms exploded in the 1960s, particularly “marijuana.” Google Ngrams The cause for the switch between the “h” and the “j” isn't clear. Kleiman attributes it to “people learning how to pronounce Spanish words,” but stresses he doesn't know for certain. The 70s were a time of increasing marijuana use nationwide, and many of those new users appear to have adopted the spelling with the “j.” Today, “marihuana” is rarely used and “cannabis” is making a comeback. Many in the drug reform community advocate doing away with “marijuana” altogether due to the term's racial baggage. A number of researchers prefer using “cannabis” as well, as a simple matter of precision. As for the DEA, spokesman Russell Baer told me they use “marijuana” and “marihuana” interchangeably. He said “there's no clear dividing line” between the two. The spelling used in any given document usually comes down to the preference of whoever's writing it, he said. Indeed, a perusal of the DEA's federal register notices turns up numerous results for both “marijuana” and “marihuana.” Asked how the DEA would respond to advocates arguing for dumping the word “marijuana” completely, Baer declined to comment.
Julia Bartoli & Chantal Abergel; Information Génomique et Structurale, CNRS-AMU In what seems like a plot straight out of a low-budget science-fiction film, scientists have revived a giant virus that was buried in Siberian ice for 30,000 years — and it is still infectious. Its targets, fortunately, are amoebae, but the researchers suggest that as Earth's ice melts, this could trigger the return of other ancient viruses, with potential risks for human health. “This guy is 150 times less compacted than any bacteriophage. We don’t understand anything anymore!” The newly thawed virus is the biggest one ever found. At 1.5 micrometres long, it is comparable in size to a small bacterium. Evolutionary biologists Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel, the husband-and-wife team at Aix-Marseille University in France who led the work, named it Pithovirus sibericum, inspired by the Greek word 'pithos' for the large container used by the ancient Greeks to store wine and food. “We’re French, so we had to put wine in the story,” says Claverie. The results are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. Claverie and Abergel have helped to discover other so-called giant viruses — including the first, called Mimivirus, in 20032, and two others, known as Pandoraviruses, last year3 (see 'Giant viruses open Pandora's box'). “Once again, this group has opened our eyes to the enormous diversity that exists in giant viruses,” says Curtis Suttle, a virologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who was not involved in the work.
Two years ago, Claverie and Abergel's team learned that scientists in Russia had resurrected an ancient plant from fruits buried in 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost4. “If it was possible to revive a plant, I wondered if it was possible to revive a virus,” says Claverie. Using permafrost samples provided by the Russian team, they fished for giant viruses by using amoebae — the typical targets of these pathogens — as bait. The amoebae started dying, and the team found giant-virus particles inside them. Under a microscope, Pithovirus appears as a thick-walled oval with an opening at one end, much like the Pandoraviruses. But despite their similar shapes, Abergel notes that “they are totally different viruses”. Julia Bartoli & Chantal Abergel; Information Génomique et Structurale, CNRS-AMU Surprising properties Pithovirus has a ‘cork’ with a honeycomb structure capping its opening (see electron-microscope image). It copies itself by building replication ‘factories’ in its host’s cytoplasm, rather than by taking over the nucleus, as most viruses do. Only one-third of its proteins bear any similarity to those of other viruses. And, to the team’s surprise, its genome is much smaller than those of the Pandoraviruses, despite its larger size. “That huge particle is basically empty,” says Claverie. “We thought it was a property of viruses that they pack DNA extremely tightly into the smallest particle possible, but this guy is 150 times less compacted than any bacteriophage [viruses that infect bacteria].
We don’t understand anything anymore!” Although giant viruses almost always target amoebae, Christelle Desnues, a virologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Marseilles, last year discovered5 signs that another giant virus, Marseillevirus, had infected an 11-month-old boy. He had been hospitalized with inflamed lymph nodes, and Desnues's team discovered traces of Marseillevirus DNA in his blood, and the virus itself in the a node. “It is clear that giant viruses cannot be seen as stand-alone freaks of nature,” she says. “They constitute an integral part of the virosphere with implications in diversity, evolution and even human health.” Claverie and Abergel are concerned that rising global temperatures, along with mining and drilling operations in the Arctic, could thaw out many more ancient viruses that are still infectious and that could conceivably pose a threat to human health. But Suttle points out that people already inhale thousands of viruses every day, and swallow billions whenever they swim in the sea. The idea that melting ice would release harmful viruses, and that those viruses would circulate extensively enough to affect human health, “stretches scientific rationality to the breaking point”, he says. “I would be much more concerned about the hundreds of millions of people who will be displaced by rising sea levels.” Image copyright CNRS-AMU Image caption The virus was inactive for more than 30,000 years until it was revived in a laboratory in France An ancient virus has "come back to life" after lying dormant for at least 30,000 years, scientists say. It was found frozen in a deep layer of the Siberian permafrost, but after it thawed it became infectious once again.
The French scientists say the contagion poses no danger to humans or animals, but other viruses could be unleashed as the ground becomes exposed. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, from the National Centre of Scientific Research (CNRS) at the University of Aix-Marseille in France, said: "This is the first time we've seen a virus that's still infectious after this length of time." Biggest virus The ancient pathogen was discovered buried 30m (100ft) down in the frozen ground. Called Pithovirus sibericum, it belongs to a class of giant viruses that were discovered 10 years ago. Image copyright CNRS-AMU Image caption The virus infects amoebas but does not attack human or animal cells These are all so large that, unlike other viruses, they can be seen under a microscope. And this one, measuring 1.5 micrometres in length, is the biggest that has ever been found. The last time it infected anything was more than 30,000 years ago, but in the laboratory it has sprung to life once again. Tests show that it attacks amoebas, which are single-celled organisms, but does not infect humans or other animals. Co-author Dr Chantal Abergel, also from the CNRS, said: "It comes into the cell, multiplies and finally kills the cell. It is able to kill the amoeba - but it won't infect a human cell." However, the researchers believe that other more deadly pathogens could be locked in Siberia's permafrost. "We are addressing this issue by sequencing the DNA that is present in those layers," said Dr Abergel. "This would be the best way to work out what is dangerous in there." 'Recipe for disaster' The researchers say this region is under threat.
Since the 1970s, the permafrost has retreated and reduced in thickness, and climate change projections suggest it will decrease further. It has also become more accessible, and is being eyed for its natural resources. Prof Claverie warns that exposing the deep layers could expose new viral threats. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor Jean-Michel Claverie: Large viruses suggest that the Earth may have "multiple" origins of life He said: "It is a recipe for disaster. If you start having industrial explorations, people will start to move around the deep permafrost layers. Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from." He told BBC News that ancient strains of the smallpox virus, which was declared eradicated 30 years ago, could pose a risk. "If it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planet - only the surface," he said. "By going deeper we may reactivate the possibility that smallpox could become again a disease of humans in modern times." Finding a virus still capable of infecting its host after such a long time is still pretty astounding Prof Jonathan Ball, University of Nottingham However, it is not yet clear whether all viruses could become active again after being frozen for thousands or even millions of years. "That's the six million dollar question," said Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham, who was commenting on the research. "Finding a virus still capable of infecting its host after such a long time is still pretty astounding - but just how long other viruses could remain viable in permafrost is anyone's guess. It will depend a lot on the actual virus. I doubt they are all as robust as this one." He added: "We freeze viruses in the laboratory to preserve them for the future.
If they have a lipid envelope - like flu or HIV, for example - then they are a bit more fragile, but the viruses with an external protein shell - like foot and mouth and common cold viruses - survive better. "But it's the freezing-thawing that poses the problems, because as the ice forms then melts there's a physical damaging effect. If they do survive this, then they need to find a host to infect and they need to find them pretty fast."

(Photo: Julia Bartoli and Chantal Abergel/IGS and CNRS-AMU) Story Highlights Largest virus on Earth poses no danger to humans Virus discovered in long-frozen soil in the tundra of Siberia While this virus isn't harmful to people, permafrost may harbor other viruses that are The frozen soil deep below the Siberian tundra has yielded an astonishing discovery: giant viruses that are still infectious though they've spent the last 30,000 years or so on ice. The newfound virus, although invisible to the naked eye, is the biggest on Earth -- larger even than many bacteria and some regular cells -- and may be a new branch of a giant-virus family tree. It poses no danger to people, infecting only one-celled creatures called amoebas. But the scientists who identified the new super-virus say their work shows that humans who disturb permafrost, or frozen soil, may encounter viruses that aren't as benign. It's a growing possibility as climate change warms the far north.
The permafrost may harbor viruses harmful to humans or animals, and "at the moment, there's no reason to believe they (aren't) also resistant for a long time under the same conditions," says study author Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in France. Now that the loss of sea ice has made mineral-rich north Siberia more accessible, "there will be people where there were no people before, and those people are going to manipulate and disturb those (soil) layers that have not been disturbed for a million years." The unlikely source of the new microbe is a layer of permafrost 100 feet beneath the treeless tundra in northeastern Russia. The soil has been frozen for thousands of years, shielded from the oxygen and light that degrade living material. Hoping the permafrost might have made a safe haven for prehistoric viruses, the researchers added some excavated material to colonies of amoebas, tiny, blobby organisms that live in water and soil. Some of the amoebas burst and died, suggesting they'd been infected by a virus. That virus was a fat, elongated giant, according to the new study. The scientists christened it Pithovirus, from the Greek word "pithos," a large ceramic storage barrel used in ancient times, they say in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Pithovirus is bigger than any other giant virus and 10 to 20 times larger than ordinary viruses but still much smaller than a grain of sand. As for how giant viruses evolved, Claverie says, "frankly, at the moment, your guess is as good as ours." Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1c1VwlJ
(CNN) -- Oscar-winning director James Cameron has plunged to the deepest known point in the world's oceans, tweeting from his one-man submersible during the process. The filmmaker reached Challenger Deep, which is part of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, near Guam, at 7:52 a.m. Monday (5:52 p.m. ET Sunday), according to Ellen Stanley, a spokeswoman for the National Geographic Society that is working with Cameron on the project. "Just arrived at the ocean's deepest pt," Cameron wrote on Twitter. "Hitting bottom never felt so good." At more than 10,900 meters (about 35,800 feet), the Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. And it has had only two previous human visitors, as U.S. Navy Lt. Don Walsh and late Swiss explorer Jacques Piccard descended to that spot in 1960. Cameron is the first person to make the dive solo, a distinction that also had been sought by billionaire businessman and adventurer Richard Branson and Patrick Lahey, an experienced submarine pilot. The man behind the blockbuster hits "Titanic" and "Avatar" went down in a high-tech vessel, the Deepsea Challenger, which he and a team of scientists and engineers constructed in Australia over the past eight years. Outfitted with special cameras and robotic arms, Deepsea Challenger is able to dive vertically at speeds of 500 to 700 feet per minute and can withstand immense pressure -- up to 16,000 pounds per square inch. Engineers and scientists joined Cameron's team during Sunday's deep sea endeavor. Earlier, he'd said he plans to spend six hours at the bottom of the trench collecting samples for research that will allow scientists on board and around the world to learn about the habitat and life forms at that depth.
"It's so exciting -- every second you see something cool or you've got something to do or you're photographing or you see some amazing fish," Cameron told CNN earlier this month. Scientists hope that a fresh look at Challenger Deep will provide insight into many unfamiliar life forms in the depths of the ocean. It is estimated that more than 750,000 marine species have not been formally described in scientific literature over the centuries, triple the number of those that have been. The figures exclude microbes, of which a 2010 marine life census estimates there are up to one billion kinds. The nonprofit X-Prize Foundation has announced it will award a $10 million prize to the first person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Cameron told CNN he's not interested in competing for this prize, or any other, because his mission is purely about scientific research. "You know, there's so much we don't know," Cameron said. "I'm hopeful that we'll be able to study the ocean before we destroy it." CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A manufacturing defect blamed for the mid-air breakup of an F-15 Eagle fighter may cause the Air Force to ground a quarter of its fleet of those warplanes permanently, a top general said Thursday. The mid-air breakup of an F-15 fighter jet is being blamed on a a manufacturing defect. Gen. John Corley, the head of the U.S. Air Combat Command, said about 160 of the jets may never return to service after an investigation into the November 2 crash that left the plane's pilot seriously injured. The single-seat F-15C broke up in a 500-mph turn during a combat training mission over Missouri, with its fuselage breaking in half behind the cockpit, an Air Force probe of the crash determined. Investigators concluded that a critical piece of the jet's airframe broke during the flight because of a manufacturing defect. A defective longeron -- a metal strut that runs lengthwise down the fuselage -- was cut improperly by the manufacturer, Boeing, and led to a series of cracks over the plane's lifespan, Corley said. Watch a report on the plane and its problems » . "Some of these airplanes will never return to flight," Corley said. "The age, the fatigue on these airplanes has been manifest as we looked under the hood extensively over these last two months." The Air Force has been flying the twin-engine, supersonic F-15 since the early 1970s. The C model involved in November's crash is credited with 34 of the 37 "kills" credited to Air Force pilots in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, according to Thursday's report on the accident. The service has about 700 F-15s in its fleet, all of which were grounded after the November crash. Most were returned to service after being checked out, but about 40 percent of the Air Force's 442 F-15 models A through D remain grounded.
"I flew these airplanes 30 years ago," Corley told CNN "This is a fleet of airplanes that's 25-plus years old on average. That constant pulling and pushing and twisting has also caused fatigue." If the grounded planes are retired, the Air Force would still have about 240 of the older fighters and nearly 300 of the newer F-15E, a two-seat version used for ground-attack missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Investigators released the results of the Missouri crash at a news conference Thursday in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton, home of the Air National Guard wing involved in the accident. The pilot, 37-year-old Maj. Stephen Stillwell, told reporters that his plane broke up in a turn that produced about eight times the force of gravity. "I had no idea what was happening," he said. "I knew something bad was happening, but I didn't know what it was." Stillwell suffered a broken arm and still has problems with his shoulder. He credited his survival to the training he received. "You always prepare for the worst-case scenario," he said. "I think luck played a small part in it, but a large part of it was due to the training I received and my faith in God," said Stillwell, who is also a pilot for Northwest Airlines. Col. Bob Leeker, the wing's commander, said the first four of his F-15s took off Thursday after receiving clearance. Six other planes in the 131st Fighter Wing have not been released, but three are expected to be once additional examinations are completed, he said. The F-15 was first built by McDonnell-Douglas, and it's now manufactured by Boeing. The service is trying to determine whether Boeing would be liable for the defect after 30 years. The A through D models are used in the United States for air-defense missions.
After the initial grounding, the service had to move F-16s to cover for F-15 missions, and Canadians had to help cover missions over Alaska, according to Air Force officials. The defect was discovered as the Air Force continues to fight for more advanced F-22 Raptors, seen as the future of the service's fighter fleet. Congress allowed the purchase of only 183 of the almost 400 the Air Force wanted, but the service continues to ask for another 200. Corley said suggestions that the service is trying to use the problems with the F-15 as leverage to get more of the Lockheed-built F-22s "makes me just outraged, because it's just flat wrong." "I'm the one who looks into the eyes of the moms and dads, the sons and daughters, the husbands and wives that I put in that airplane," he said. "To think that I would put one of those individuals at risk, to almost kill one aviator and to risk other aviators, that is beyond my possible belief." E-mail to a friend .
Police Scotland said they had been "made aware" of the leak and were making inquiries. It has been reported witnesses' names and details of an alleged gun hit were posted on social media. Police Scotland said: "Police in Edinburgh have been made aware of communications posted to social media. "Inquiries are ongoing into the full circumstances surrounding this."
Regina Hungerford, 55, denied striking the 17-year-old when she lost her temper as he listened to music in her classroom at Merthyr Tydfil College. She previously had a common assault conviction quashed on appeal, saying the notebook was slammed on the desk. But on Friday, the Education Workforce Council ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and was unacceptable. It will decide whether to strike her off the register at a later date. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said: "There was a momentary lapse of control and in that moment Mrs Hungerford acted in breach of teaching principles. "It put at risk the public trust in the profession and her conduct fell far short of the standard expected of a registered teacher. "Pupil A's behaviour was difficult to manage but we have concluded she acted in an inappropriate way." During the hearing, Mrs Hungerford's lawyer Adam Ohringer said her "calm and patient" experience with challenging students meant she would not have struck the boy. "She readily accepts she lost her temper in response to his behaviour," he said. "She slammed the notebook down on the desk as a sign of her anger. "It is something she regrets but as far as she can say she didn't make contact with him and certainly didn't intend to make contact with him." Delivering the panel's ruling, Mr Roberts said, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or the hand. They found the case against her proven. He said the pupil's evidence was "far from satisfactory", adding: "But in general terms it was credible." He said statements from classroom assistants that she made contact with the pupil were also credible.
The research from the LSE and the universities of Manchester and York examines the coalition's tax and spending record. It says poverty will get worse over the next five years. In response the government said the richest have "lost the most" from changes to taxes and welfare. John Hills, director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion at London School of Economics and one of the lead authors of the report said despite coalition promises that the greatest burden of the cuts would fall on those who had more, and that the poor would be protected, that had not happened. "While people at the bottom were initially protected with the way benefits were adjusted for inflation, that has not been the case for the last two years," he said. The report says tax and benefit reforms have hit families with children under five harder than any other household type. Policies affecting families with young children include the abolition of baby tax credit which increased the payments for households with a child under one and extra support for pregnant women. Further changes have affected families on limited incomes, including the £26,000 cap on total benefits a household can receive and shifting tax credit thresholds. As well as changes to taxes and benefits, the report also highlights cuts to government spending affecting young children. Real spending per child on early education and childcare and Sure Start services fell by a quarter between 2009-10 and 2012-13 it says. "That it's families that are taking the biggest hit is really disappointing and short-sighted, said Kitty Stewart, author of the part of the report examining the impact on under fives. "We know that family income and services are important to children's development. All the research evidence tells us both of those matter and both of those have been hit." She estimates some families may have lost out on around £1200 in their baby's first year. A Treasury spokesperson said: "the richest have lost the most from the government's changes to taxes and welfare."
It said the LSE's research also failed to take into account "the effects of changes to the vital public services on which so many rely. That means that it can't consider the full range of ways the government provides support to the poorest and most vulnerable families across the country". The Treasury pointed to the freezing of fuel duty and council tax, the provision of free school meals and tax-free childcare, and the increase in the tax-free personal allowance as measures that would help many people, including lower income groups and families. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported last week that coalition changes to tax and benefits have cost the average UK household £489 a year with low-income working-age households hit hardest. The IFS said the poorest tenth of households lost around 4% of their incomes. John Hill from the LSE said it was true that the very rich, with incomes over £100,000 had lost out more than the average, but that when viewed as a proportion of their income, it was the poorest who had lost out most. He said strategic decisions on the part of the government to ring-fence the NHS and schools had meant even larger cuts for other areas of spending.
(CNN) -- A victim in the sexual abuse case against Jerry Sandusky has sued Penn State University, saying he couldn't reach a settlement with the university over claims that the longtime assistant football coach abused him. The man, known only as "Victim 9," is one of 10 victims who were part of the criminal trial, in which the Nittany Lions' former defensive coordinator was convicted on 45 counts of sexual abuse in June 2012. Since the trial, 26 men have settled claims with Penn State totaling $59.7 million in connection with the Sandusky scandal, the university announced last month. Sandusky, currently serving a 30- to 60-year sentence, has always maintained that he is innocent and wrongly convicted of abusing young boys he met through his charity, The Second Mile. Sandusky raises another appeal . Many of the victims were abused on Penn State's campus, and some even after two incidents allegedly were brought to the university's attention -- once in 1998 and again in 2001. Victim 9 was raped repeatedly starting in 2005 when he was 12 years old, and ending around the time that another victim's allegations finally started a police investigation into Sandusky's decades of abuse. "By the time this boy was introduced to Sandusky on the Penn State Campus, the top administrators at Penn State knew that Sandusky was a sexual predator," the man's attorney, Stephen E. Raynes, said in a press release. "It's now clear that Penn State enabled Sandusky to sexually abuse more than twenty other children before Sandusky preyed on this boy. Each of those tragic assaults provided Penn State with the opportunity to stop Sandusky, opportunities which Penn State squandered. We will learn through this lawsuit why that happened and what additional lessons Penn State should learn from this tragic episode in its history." Penn State paying $59.7 million to settle Sandusky cases .
Raynes said Victim 9 tried to negotiate a settlement with Penn State, but the university refused "to compensate him adequately for what he needs and deserves." Penn State's former president, vice president and athletic director are all awaiting trial on charges they lied to a grand jury, obstructed justice and failed to report allegations of abuse reported to them in 2001. The abuse scandal resulted in the dismissal, in November 2011, of legendary head coach Joe Paterno amid allegations that he failed to respond forcefully enough to reports of Sandusky's crimes. Paterno died just weeks later, on January 22, 2012, at age 85. Penn State has said a few other claims by Sandusky victims have not yet been settled. Investigators may take 2nd look at high school where Jerry Sandusky coached .
The actor interviewed Mexico's most wanted drug lord in October in northern Durango state, at a meeting organised by Mexican actress Kate del Castillo. The security forces came close to catching Guzman shortly afterwards. They finally arrested him on Friday in a raid in which five people died. Attorney General Arely Gomez said the security forces had been following Guzman's lawyer, who led them to Sean Penn and Mexican actress Kate del Castillo. Who is 'El Chapo' Guzman? - The crime lord had humble beginnings. Who is Kate del Castillo? - Actress was instrumental in arranging the interview Did Sean Penn break the law? - Unusual interview raises questions in the US and Mexico Penn's 'El Chapo' interview scorned - It has been called "grotesque" and "maddening" El Chapo extradition 'could take year' - American officials want Joaquin Guzman back in the US. Kate del Castillo had been contacted by Guzman's lawyers years earlier after she had addressed Guzman in an open letter asking him to stop trafficking in drugs and start "trafficking in love" instead. Ms Gomez said that following his escape from a maximum-security jail in July, Guzman again contacted del Castillo through his lawyers to ask her to produce a film about his life. Del Castillo has not commented but in an article for Rolling Stone magazine, Penn said the actress had put him in contact with the fugitive drug lord. They both then travelled to a remote mountain hideout where Penn proceeded to interview Guzman. Ms Gomez said that meeting had provided them with important intelligence and helped them track down the fugitive. "It was an essential element, because we were following [Guzman's] lawyer, and the lawyer took us to these people and to this meeting," she told local radio. Mexican newspaper El Universal published photographs on Monday which suggest Penn and del Castillo were under surveillance by the authorities at the time.
The Associated Press news agency asked Penn if he was worried about the images. He wrote back in an email, saying: "I've got nothin' to hide". Guzman's escape in July 2015 - his second from a maximum-security jail - was a major embarrassment for the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto. But on Monday, the authorities proudly showed journalists around the house Guzman had been hiding in in Los Mochis. It feels like a voyeuristic journalism package holiday. The marines flew us here and showed us around the house that the feared criminal escaped from. "Over there you can see how the cans burst from the force of the grenades," an official from the attorney general's office pointed out in the kitchen. "And over here, this was the spot where the second person died," he said pointing to a patch of blood measuring about two metres by two metres. In one room was a walk-in wardrobe with a floor-length mirror. You would never have guessed it was actually a door, but behind it was a narrow set of stairs leading to a tunnel. It was through this tunnel that Guzman managed to escape. But this time it was not for long, as the marines got wise to his signature escape route and hunted him down a few hours later on a nearby highway. President Enrique Pena Nieto praised the security forces for the arrest of "the world's most wanted criminal" in a brief televised speech on Monday. "With this action, 98 of the 122 most dangerous criminals no longer pose a risk to society," he said. "We're going after all of them!"
Sisters Amanda, left, and Sara Eldritch are featured in a 2016 Littleton Adventist Hospital publication. Their bodies were found Friday near the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. (Littleton Adventist Hospital / Courtesy Photo) Twin sisters who gained fame after becoming the first people in Colorado to receive a pioneering surgery for obsessive compulsive disorder were found dead with gunshot wounds in Cañon City, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday. Sisters Amanda and Sara Eldritch were found Friday in a vehicle parked near a rest area at the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. They were 33 years old. The sisters, who lived in Broomfield, were the first people in Colorado to receive deep brain stimulation — a surgery commonly used for patients with Parkinson's disease — to treat their often-debilitating symptoms of OCD. In a spring 2016 publication printed by Littleton Adventist Hospital, where they received the surgery, the twins said they began to feel at peace with their existence after receiving the treatment in spring 2015. One year after the treatment, Sara Eldritch told the hospital, "I feel like I can identify my anxiety. I can actually see where it's coming from. And I feel like I can deal with it." But before the surgery, the story said, "they felt at war with their own existence. And in a desperate cry for help as adolescents, they tried taking their own lives." Advertisement For the sisters, coping with the disorder meant living with compulsions, such as taking 10-hour showers, 20-minute hand-washings and using dozens of bottles of rubbing alcohol to disinfect everything they touched. For many patients with OCD, according to the hospital, unwanted thoughts become unavoidable, causing them to act on compulsions. The deep brain stimulation was intended to inhibit overactive parts of the brain, halting anxiety and making therapy more effective.
As part of the procedure, a surgeon, Dr. David VanSickle, placed electrodes on specific areas of their brains, with electrode wires under the skin of their heads, neck and shoulder. The wires were then connected to a battery pack inserted into their chests. In programming appointments, doctors ensured that their brains received enough stimulation. One year after the surgery, the spring 2016 publication said, the twins began finding "hope and joy in simple things like taking a morning walk — something they hadn't done in more than a decade." And one year after the publication was printed, the twins were featured on an episode of the TV show, "The Doctors," where they were taken for spa treatments separately from each other to "help them break through their codependency," the show's website said. The sisters also spent the night in two separate hotels as part of the show, where they found struggles but made it through the night, it said. "I did kind of like the contrast of, this is what it's like to be alone, and this is what it's like to be back with my sister and friends," Amanda Eldritch said at the time. "I like having two things to compare." The sheriff's office said in a news release that no other information is available at this time. Sara Knuth: 719-276-7644, knuths@canoncitydailyrecord.com Twin sisters - the first in Colorado to receive a pioneering surgery to treat their obsessive compulsive disorder - were found fatally shot Friday in a vehicle near Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office said. Sara and Amanda Eldritch, 33, of Broomfield, appear to have died in a suicide pact, said sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Megan Richards. They had received deep brain stimulation at Littleton Adventist Hospital in the spring of 2015, the Cañon City Daily Record reported.
In the procedure, typically used for patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor, electrodes are placed on areas of the brain, says an article in the hospital's spring 2016 magazine. "The electrode wires are placed under the skin of the head, neck, and shoulder, connecting with a battery pack (called a neurostimulator), which is implanted in the chest during a second procedure about a week later," the article says. "Then, routine programming appointments help ensure the brain gets the proper amount of stimulation." Before the surgery, the article says, the sisters "felt at war with their own existence. And in a desperate cry for help as adolescents, they tried taking their own lives." A year after the surgery, they were "finding hope and joy in simple things like taking a morning walk - something they hadn't done in more than a decade," the article says. The sisters were featured on an episode of "The Doctors," a CBS talk show. Friday, their bodies were found in a vehicle parked at a rest area near the Royal Gorge, the Sheriff's Office reported. A sheriff's news release Saturday said one body had been found. "After further investigation and results from the autopsy," a Monday release said, "this appears to be an isolated incident, and there is no threat to the public." - Contact Ellie Mulder: 636-0198 Twitter: @lemarie Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Máiría Cahill won a by-election to fill the seat left vacant after Jimmy Harte of the Labour party resigned. Labour candidate Ms Cahill won 122 of the 188 valid votes cast by serving senators and members of parliament. Last year, she told the BBC she had been raped by an IRA man when she was 16, with the organisation forcing her into silence to protect itself. The man she accused of raping her was prosecuted but later acquitted of all charges against him after two separate court cases in 2014. Earlier this year, Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service apologised to Ms Cahill after a report into how it handled her allegations found delays in her case had been "unacceptable". Ms Cahill is a member of one of the Irish republican movement's most prominent families. But on Thursday, ahead of the by-election, she told Irish state broadcaster RTÉ she no longer considers herself a republican. She said she was "deeply sorry" for her involvement in the dissident group Republican Network for Unity, adding that it coincided with a vulnerable point in her life. "I didn't think about it at the time and I've had a lot of reflection since" she said. After her election, Ms Cahill said she would invite sex abuse organisations to the senate to discuss support for victims. "I want to use my time [in the senate] to continue to work for victims of abuse," she said. "That is the issue that has brought me to where I am today and it is the issue that I will continue to campaign on during my time as a senator. "I also want to use my time to explore ways of engaging young jobseekers in this country and to help change their lives for the better." Ms Cahill had been the favourite to win the by-election.
The other candidates who stood were Fianna Fáil's Keith Swanick, who received 38 votes, Sinead Burke of Sinn Féin, who won 18 votes, and independent candidate Gerry Beades, who received 10.
Thomas has been replaced by The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright just days before Sunday's finale. He had been set to battle it out with Olympic gymnast Louis Smith, Paralympic medallist Kadeena Cox, and Emma Parker Bowles to be crowned champion of the winter sports competition. The 42-year-old is the fourth celebrity to withdraw from this year's series. Model Caprice suffered an illness, Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins broke his leg and Vogue Williams pulled out before an episode even aired.

Ever wonder who's more stupid: Justin Bieber's followers or Ashton Kutcher's? Well, wonder no more — there's a new app in town that will gauge Twitter idiocy for you. Tom Scott, of Tweleted fame, has come out with a new website called Stupid Fight that measures the mental capacity of someone's Twitter followers by sifting through the last 100 people to @ reply to the person in question. According to the site's FAQs: "It estimates based on several stupid indicators. Are they using twenty exclamation marks in a row? Do they endlessly use the abbreviation 'OMG'? Do they seem incapable of working out where their Shift key is? These indicators have a strong correlation with the message, and its sender, being stupid." Scott hypes the site as a way to determine how stupid the followers of celebs are, but it works just as well with your personal Twitter account. We pit Bieber and Kutcher against each other below as a test. Seeing as how "Justin Bieber" is an extremely popular trending topic, the results are actually quite worrisome.

New York (CNN) -- Two New York men accused of brutally beating an openly gay man have been indicted on hate crime charges, authorities said. The indictment filed Thursday morning charges defendants Daniel Aleman, 26, and Daniel Rodriguez, 21, both of College Point in Queens, New York, of 14-counts of assault and robbery as a hate crime, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. If convicted, both men face up to 25 years in prison. Police say the two men shouted "anti-gay remarks" while viciously beating victim Jack Price, 49, as he left a 24-hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens in October 2009. After the assault, the two men stole Price's wallet and other personal property from his pockets. Price was treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens for a broken jaw, several broken ribs, two collapsed lungs and a lacerated spleen. Aleman and Rodriguez are being held without bail. Their arraignment is scheduled for January 25. Ted Kasapis, attorney for Rodriguez, said he doesn't believe prosecutors will be able to prove "any hate crimes here." An attorney for Aleman could not be reached for comment.

One man was killed and 77 injured after police in Papua New Guinea opened fire on rioting asylum seekers in an Australian-run detention camp last night. Thirteen people suffered serious injuries, two of which has been flown to Australia for treatment, after the the second riot this week at a detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australian officials says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre, but refugee advocates insist it was sparked when local residents and police stormed the facility. Scroll down for video . Deadly uproar: One person was killed and 77 injured during a second night of rioting at an Australian immigration detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island . Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison described the violence as the latest in a series of protests at the camp, which houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria. 'This is a tragedy, but this was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk,' he told reporters. He said one man died from head injuries as he was taken to the hospital. He would not disclose the victim's nationality, or say how he had sustained the injuries. Another person was shot and was flown to the Papua New Guinea capital Port Moresby while one man was flown to Australia for treatment of a fractured skull, he said. In all, 77 people received medical treatment including 13 who were seriously injured, he said. Criticised: UN agencies and human rights organisations have called for the camps to be closed down due to the living conditions for the refugees .
Tension: The camp, pictured in July last year, houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria . Morrison initially said the injuries had occurred outside the camp but later said he was uncertain whether the fatal injuries had been inflicted within the camp or outside, adding that local authorities are investigating the matter. Mr Morrison said Papua New Guinea police opened fire after detainees pushed down the perimeter fence and spilled into the street around the camp. However, an Australian advocacy group said inmates claim to have been attacked by police and local residents. Defense: Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre . Gangs of police and locals — armed with machetes, pipes, sticks and stones — had roamed from compound to compound within the camp attacking asylum seekers, Refugee Action Coalition said. This was denied by Australian officials and security firm G4S, who operates the camp. The violence followed a less serious brawl at the same facility on Sunday night that led to the arrests of eight asylum seekers and another 19 being treated for injuries.

Tom Colicchio has changed the name of his hot Beekman Hotel restaurant Fowler & Wells to Temple Court after realizing the first moniker has a racially charged past. The chef said in a statement: “In the mid-1800s, the building where the Beekman . . . now stands housed the offices of Fowler & Wells, a pair of publishers and phrenologists.” Phrenology is the study of skull size and structure to determine mental abilities, and was often used as a justification for discrimination and slavery. After picking the name, Colicchio and his team “dove more deeply into the works of Fowler & Wells” and “discovered facts about their beliefs that go against everything we stand for.” Phrenology really was used to justify slavery, as portrayed in Django Unchained. But it was also used to justify abolition "Why don't they kill us?" asks Calvin Candie, the southern slave owner in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. He wants to know why the African slaves he brutalises do not rise up and take revenge. Before long, he has the skull of a recently deceased slave on the dinner table. "The science of phrenology," he announces, "is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species." He hacks away at the back of the skull with a saw, removing a section of the cranium and pointing to an allegedly enlarged area. In African slaves, Candie claims, this bump is found in the region of the brain associated with "submissiveness". For Candie, phrenology not only explained slavery, it justified it. Needless to say, phrenology has now been thoroughly debunked: the idea that the shape of the skull can be used to infer mental characteristics is just plain wrong.
But it was extremely popular all over the world during the 19th century, finding converts among reform-minded Bengalis in Kolkata, India, and colonial settlers in Australia. As part of my research into the global history of phrenology, I came across the real-life Calvin Candie. He was called Charles Caldwell, a doctor from Kentucky who revelled in both phrenology and slave ownership. As in the film, Caldwell was a Europhile, travelling to Paris in the 1820s where he picked up the latest medical craze. He later returned to France in the 1840s in order to hobnob with Pierre Marie Dumoutier, a phrenologist just back from a three-year round-the-world voyage. Slave owner and phrenologist Charles Caldwell. Photograph: Public domain At the time, Dumoutier's immense collection of skulls and casts could be found at the Musée de Phrénologie in Paris. There Caldwell could practise phrenology, feeling for bumps on the heads of Tahitians and Marquesas Islanders. No doubt he was considered very à la mode back in Kentucky. In fact, Caldwell even boasted of being one of the earliest experts in phrenology in the United States. Caldwell deployed phrenology in almost exactly the same manner as the fictional Candie. In 1837 he wrote to a friend claiming that "tameableness" explained the apparent ease with which Africans could be enslaved. This was a standard phrenological argument. Areas located towards the top and back of the skull, such as "Veneration" and "Cautiousness", were routinely claimed to be large in Africans. His correspondent concurred, writing: "They are slaves because they are tameable." Clearly enjoying himself, Caldwell replied: "Depend upon it my good friend, the Africans must have a master."
Areas for 'veneration' and 'Cautiousness' were said to be large in Africans. Photograph: Alamy It's worth emphasising that these words are not from a Tarantino script, crafted for Hollywood shock value. They were written by a slave owner desperate to preserve his brutal way of life. And, while the physical violence of slavery is masked in Caldwell's letters, they betray his warped sense of morality. In a letter written on Christmas Eve 1838, Caldwell made the outrageous claim: "My slaves live much more comfortably than I do." The fact that phrenology was used to justify slavery is perhaps unsurprising. What would one expect from such an overtly racist science? But it wasn't just the slavers. My research revealed that some of the most vocal anti-slavery campaigners of the 19th century were also advocates of phrenology, and used it to justify their stance. Lucretia Mott, a particularly uncompromising American abolitionist, sent her children to phrenological lectures and spoke of the "truth of phrenology" in letters to friends. When she visited Britain she stayed with the renowned Scottish phrenologist George Combe, himself an anti-slavery campaigner. Horace Mann, another major figure in abolitionist politics, was so keen on phrenology that he subscribed to the official journal. After becoming president of Antioch College in Ohio, he even boasted in the same sentence that the professors he employed were both "anti-slavery men" and "avowed phrenologists". Photograph: public domain These are not isolated examples. If anything, the majority of phrenologists were against slavery. How can this be?
George Combe, a man whose phrenological books sold more copies during the 19th century than Charles Darwin's Origin of Species, explained his reasoning: "The qualities which make them submit to slavery are a guarantee that, if emancipated and justly dealt with, they would not shed blood." For abolitionists, the apparent weakness and timidity of the Africans served two purposes. It countered fears that they would take revenge on their masters if set free. It also provided a moral argument: if Africans were innately weak, society should help them, not enslave them. In the 19th century, scientific racism and abolition were by no means mutually exclusive.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists his players have to step up in the absence of captain Steven Gerrard after a frustrating goalless draw at home to Sunderland. With a must-win match at home to Basle in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a trip to Old Trafford, the 34-year-old midfielder was left on the bench until 23 minutes from the end. He could not inspire his side to victory but Rodgers admits it should not always be up to him. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats .

His talent is world-class but that contribution has to come around the team,' he said. 'It can't be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. 'It is very hard to replace that quality but going forward that is something of course we will need. 'He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday.

The Italian enjoyed a good loan spell at Sunderland last season and almost joined them in the summer after Liverpool agreed a deal to sell him. 'That is a decision I make as a manager,' said Rodgers when asked about the forward's absence.

I am trying to concentrate on what we have got.' What they had was good enough to keep their hosts at bay, having been beaten 4-1 by Manchester City in midweek. 'First half we were much better with the ball than in the last three or four games,' Poyet added. 'We are just missing that cutting edge but in the rest of the game we were quite good.'
(CNN) -- Shain Gandee, one of the stars of the MTV reality show "Buckwild," has been found dead along with two other people in Kanawha County, West Virginia, authorities said Monday. "This is a very sad and tragic event," Kanawha County Commissioner Kent Carper said. "We live in a very small community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Gandee family." Gandee, 21, was found dead in a vehicle along with his uncle, David Dwight Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert Myers, 27, authorities said. 'Buckwild' producer talks about the show . "Earlier this day after releasing information Shain Gandee was missing, the Kanawha County Sheriff's Office received word of a disabled vehicle in a wooded area near Thaxton Hollow, Sissonville, Kanawha County WV," said a statement from the Sheriff's Office. "Deputies and members of the Sissonville Volunteer Fire Department used all terrain vehicles to access that vehicle, a 1984 Ford Bronco belonging to the Gandee family. The vehicle was in a muddy area along a worn path. Inside were the bodies of three people." In a subsequent release, the Sheriff's Office said the vehicle was partially submerged in mud. It was uneven but upright; its muffler was below the surface. Mud covered the lower part of the Bronco's passenger side door, but the driver's side, where the younger Gandee sat, was free, the Sheriff's Office said. Gandee was happy with life before death . He was one of the nine cast members of "Buckwild." The show follows a group of young adults trying to have fun in Sissonville, West Virginia, pulling stunts such as turning a dump truck into a swimming pool or just riding around the woods on their all-terrain vehicles.
Gandee was billed as a former high school prom king who had done "every job from coal mining to being a garbage man." MTV released a statement about Gandee: "We are shocked and saddened by the terrible news about Shain Gandee, and those involved in this tragic incident. We are waiting for more information but at this time, our main concern is for the Gandee family and their friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. Shain had a magnetic personality, with a passion for life that touched everyone he met and we will miss him dearly." Some of Gandee's castmates took to social media to express their feelings. "RIP Shain Gandee," cast member Ashley Whitt tweeted. "You were the most amazing person I've ever known. I know you will be watching over " "This is the emptiest I've ever felt," Cara Parrish tweeted. "Please pray for Dale and Loretta [Gandee's parents]." "Buckwild" has been compared to MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," and on Monday, one of that show's stars, Jenni "JWoww" Farley, tweeted, "That's awful that shain passed He was just a baby. Rip. #Buckwild." Officials said there were no signs of foul play. The causes of death are still under investigation. People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch, pictured, has become a recluse because of the 'horror' of contact with other people. The 26-year-old Austrian has given up her studies and no longer has driving lessons because she panics when she sees her instructor. She says she no longer wants children and rarely makes new friends – ending her Facebook presence and seldom using Twitter. Natascha Kampusch was kidnapped at the age of 10 and held captive for eight and a half years . Miss Kampusch was upbeat about her future after freeing herself from Wolfgang Priklopil in 2006 after being kept prisoner for more than eight years. But nerves have now destroyed her chances of an education. 'The regular contact with fellow students was really a horror scenario for me,' she said. The story of her ordeal was recently made into a film starring Irish actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes. Miss Kampusch has also put on weight significantly, in contrast with wafer-thin Campbell-Hughes who admitted she went on a massive diet in order to portray the kidnap victim in 3,096 Days.

Chingola, Zambia (CNN) -- It's 10 minutes after the final whistle has blown but still no one knows whether their efforts have been in vain. The Libyan national soccer team sit in the dressing room at the Nchanga Stadium -- in Chingola, a small copper mining town on the Zambia-Congo border -- quietly waiting for news amidst the fog of sweat and redolence of rubefacient muscle rub. The team has just drawn 0-0 with Zambia in their final qualification match for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, a qualification campaign that began with the country under the rule of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, continued through the civil war and ended before the death of the former notorious leader. Victory was needed to be sure of progression to next January's tournament in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. A draw meant that results elsewhere had to go their way. As their campaign for Africa's biennial continental championship progressed with war as the backdrop, some players declared the team was behind Gadhafi. Others left the team to go and fight on the front line with the rebels. In unison, somehow, they qualified; news that will shortly be relayed to the team when confirmation of results from other matches are circulated. Six days earlier coach Marcos Paqueta is in good spirits in the lobby of his hotel in Tunis. The security situation is such that the team could not train in Tripoli. The Brazilian coach once famously won the under 17s and under 20s World Cups in the same year for his homeland, but signed for Libya in June 2010 when the Libyan Football Federation was run by one of Gadhafi's sons, Mohamed. "When I was there the first time I contacted only the federation, then one time I have one meeting with Dr Mohamed," Paqueta explains of his dealings with the Gadhafi regime. "He was happy because of the project I made for the national team and Libyan football.
I focus only on sports. At that time you don't know about the country." In the past, the Gadhafi family's dealings with soccer and its players had been much more hands on. His son Saadi played for Al Ahly Tripoli and installed himself as captain of the national team. The team plummeted to 186th on FIFA's rankings. But they also used soccer as a political tool. In 2000 Saadi's Al Ahly Tripoli traveled to Al Ahly Benghazi for a league match. Benghazi had long been associated with Libya's opposition and the team's fans paraded a donkey wearing Saadi's shirt. "It is a bad story, not a funny story," says 29-year-old defensive midfielder Moataz Ben Amer, the current captain of Al Ahly Benghazi. "The first half, Tripoli are winning. But the referee is no good. So Ahly Benghazi goes to the airport [in protest]. Saadi Gadhafi turned up with his dogs and the police and said: 'If you don't play the second half, we will kick you'." Unsurprisingly, the players returned to play the second half, and lost 3-0. Colonel Gadhafi was so incensed that he ordered Al Ahly Benghazi's training ground to be destroyed. The club was also banned from domestic competition for five years. When Interpol released a "Red Notice" for Saadi Gadhafi in September, the allegations given were "misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the Libyan Football Federation." Paqueta's early results were encouraging. Libya beat Zambia, one of Africa's best teams, in Tripoli. But then in February civil war broke out, dividing the players. After Libya had beaten the Comoros Islands in March the team's former captain, 34-year-old Tariq Taib, declared that the players were 100 per cent behind Gadhafi.
He even labeled the rebels "rats and dogs." Walid el Kahatroushi disagreed. The 27-year-old midfielder scored in that game but when the team gathered again in June, he decided to leave the camp and fight for the rebels when he heard a friend had been injured in the violence. "Some people come to me and told me one of my dear friends was in the hospital and lost his arm in that moment I decided to leave the camp and join the front line in Jebel Nafousa," explains Kahatroushi. Life on the front line was hard. Friends would shield him from worst of the fighting until, in the end, he felt he had no choice . "When I was there I was just about forgetting about football because the most important thing then is how to secure your life and secure the life of your friends. If it was about me I would never come back, you would never find me here playing football. But my friends on the front line told me: 'This is your future, you must go there. This is also like a war for you'." Others left for the front line too, like goalkeeper Guma Mousa, but not all were so lucky. Ahmed Alsagir was shot in the shoulder and spent a month in hospital before returning to the front line. By the end of August Gadhafi had been toppled. A week later the team had to play their penultimate qualifier against Mozambique behind closed doors in Egypt. Aside from the trouble of getting the players out of the country, there were some more practical concerns. For one, Paqueta had to hold a clear the air meeting with the squad. The old pro-Gaddafi players were nowhere to be seen. A new kit had to be designed, with the rebel's flag stitched on to it. The Libyans fought out a 0-0 draw.
"The last game [against] Mozambique, it had a big impact on the people in Libya. Everyone was happy and everyone was talking about us," recalls Kahatroushi. "We will do everything to qualify, Inshallah, because this will help our country too much. At least to bring them some happiness after all the sadness they have been through." The journey south to Zambia took almost 24 hours, but the players are ready when they take to the pitch at the packed Nchanga Stadium. Libya's new captain, 39-year-old goalkeeper Samir Abod is the hero, making three world class saves. The match finishes 0-0. Some of the players collapse on the floor in tears. Others pray before returning to the dressing room. They wait. The quiet is broken when one of the coaches bursts in and breathlessly delivers the news. The blue-painted room erupts in celebration and song. The rebel national anthem is sung as the new flag is held aloft in the center of the melee. Ghana's victory and a last-minute equalizer for Guinea against Nigeria means that Libya has, against the odds, qualified for the Nations Cup. As a nation recovers thousands of miles away from the ravages of civil war under the new interim government, Walid Kahatroushi leads the celebrations and the chants. "The blood of the dead," they sing, "will not be spilt in vain."

The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit Café', where they met a group of 'The Few', surviving RAF airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, before viewing a flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon. As part of her duties, the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the opening and received a posy. In the 1980s, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page, a Hurricane pilot who was shot down during the Battle of Britain, realised that there was no national memorial to the men he had with flown with in 1940. His efforts to amend this led to the founding of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust and the unveiling of the National Memorial to the Few – a lone pilot looking out over the English Channel, in the village between Folkestone and Dover – by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Our dog, Sheba, doesn’t know what to do as Jasmine runs around, so excited about Josh’s return.' Laughter can be heard on the video as Josh battles to move away but Jasmine refuses to let him be. 'She doesn't know what to do', a voice is heard through laughter in the background. Showing the pet really is his best friend, Josh then walks the dog out of the garage and gets her to excitedly roll over with just the click of his fingers. Several people have posted the video across the internet. One viewer wrote: 'Aw that's so cute I am in awe on how loyal dogs are to their owners and are able to express so much happiness.' Other pets welcoming returning soldiers have made moving online videos.

London (CNN) -- One of England's biggest soccer stars went on trial Monday, accused of hurling racist abuse at another player during a match last year. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London got an earful of shockingly foul language as lawyers and witnesses detailed what Chelsea captain John Terry said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in the match. A lip reader watching a video of the incident told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as "black," but he denied engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport's governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a "racially aggravated public order offense" because of the comments during an October 23 match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand's breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a "c---," prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate's wife, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said.
Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been "hurt and disappointed" if he had heard Terry call him a "black c---" "When someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it's very hurtful," Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged "normal football verbals." He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 (about $3,900). That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England's Football Association. Terry was captain of England's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious Europe-wide Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say.
Loss: Shanice Clark, 21, was found unresponsive in her dorm in Pennsylvania early on Sunday morning . A college basketball star has been found dead in her dorm room after choking on gum in her sleep, preliminary investigations have found. Shanice Clark, from Toronto, Canada, was found unresponsive at 3.03am on Sunday in Vulcan Village at the California University of Pennsylvania, the Washington County coroner's office said. She was rushed to Monongahela Valley Hospital but she could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 4.10am. Police said a preliminary report from medical personnel indicates Clark accidentally choked on gum while she was sleeping, the Pennsylvania Observer-Reporter reported. The manner of death continues to remain under investigation. University officials said they were 'deeply saddened' by the death of the 6-foot senior forward, who had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season. Athletic director Karen Hjerpe called Clark 'a bright student and talented player' and said 'her smile and personality will be missed'. Clark, a communications major, had hoped to become a broadcaster and chose the school because of its good facilities after transferring from Santa Fe College in Florida. But friend Cleveland Clunis told the Toronto Star that she would often joke that she had gone to the university for a different reason. 'For Shanice, it was, "There's a good hairstylist",' said Clunis, the founder of a non-profit basketball program she had attended. 'When she shares that with you, you can't help but laugh.' He said that this sense of humor had made her popular among students and staff. 'She could start a conversation with you from morning and still have you laughing and interested till sundown,' he said.
Geraldine M. Jones, interim university president, said in a statement: 'Our thoughts today are with the family of Shanice Clark, a senior from Ontario, Canada, who passed away early this morning. 'On behalf of California University of Pennsylvania, I extend my deepest sympathy to all of Shanice's family and friends. She will be missed by her teammates and coaches, her classmates, and by the entire campus community.' Clark leaves behind her mother, Kashaeka Fearon, and a younger sister. Tragedy: Clark, who was from Toronto, was a communications major at the California University of Pennsylvania, pictured, and had dreamed of becoming a broadcaster, friends said .
The home that inspired one of the most famous paintings in American history could soon be in search of a tenant. If you're keen on living the quiet life in Eldon, Iowa (pop. 900) and have around just $250 per month, the house featured in Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic could be the home for you. The pitchfork, however, won't be included. Look familiar? The house that played backdrop to Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic is now without a tenant as of Monday . American favorite: The somehow equally stoic, comical and unsettling painting has become one of the most parodied works of art of all time . Isolated: The house is in Eldon, Iowa, a town of 900 . In fact, the State Historical Society of Iowa has yet to decide if they intend to again rent out the 700-square-foot 1882 home after tenant of four years Beth Howard moved out. 'There should be a statute of limitations for how long one can live in a tourist attraction,' she joked to the Des Moines Register Tuesday. Monday marked Beth Howard's last day in the house.. And who knows, you may gain artistic inspiration from the home, as Wood did and as Howard did thereafter. Wood was an Iowa painter who spotted the house while traveling through the area. He used it as the backdrop to his 1930 painting of a farmer holding a pitchfork next to his daughter. The man was actually Wood's dentist and the 'wife' the artist's sister Nan. And while not entirely non-fiction, the comically unsettling portrait is perhaps America's most parodied ever. So much so that the house that simply stands in its background has become a tourist attraction. At least initially, that didn't bother Howard. She liked the rent, kept artificially low to make up for the nuisance rubberneckers, and wanted a place to start anew after becoming a widow at age 48.
She was inspired and then some, becoming known as the 'Pie Lady' for the impressive pastries she churned out in the historic home's kitchen. She also started a popular pie blog. The tourist attraction is also a home: A woman named Beth Howard lived for fours years in the house, but moved out Monday . Just a regular home almost: Howard had to keep the windows covered nearly all the time to avoid peeping-tom tourists . Pie Lady: Howard cooked thousands of pies in the famous home's kitchen and made a name for herself, and even wrote a bestselling cookbook, while living there . Homey: Howard managed to make a name for herself as a pie maker, cookbook author and public speaker while she lived in the 1882 home . She also wrote a bestselling cookbook while in the home. But she's now gone off to greener pastures, a room with a view of cows in an equally rural part of the state, to write a book she says will be 'a memoir of the misadventures of living in a masterpiece painting with snakes in the basement.' Meanwhile, Jerome Thompson, the society's historic site administrator, said the group is weighing its options on what to do next. They may rent it out again or they may offer an artist-in-residence program. They may also allow the next-door visitors' center, which is run by the city and county, to use it. American Pie: Howard (with the pitchfork) moved into the home after becoming widowed at 48. She lived there four years and has now moved to a friend's farm, where she hopes to write a book about her time at the house .
(CNN) -- American Airlines has already called Alec Baldwin "extremely rude," and now the actor isn't making any friends at Greyhound either. Baldwin was booted off an American Airlines flight Tuesday because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said. The actor was apparently playing "Words With Friends," a Scrabble-like online game. In a column published by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, Baldwin said a crew member singled him out during the incident. He also raged against flight attendants who "have made flying a Greyhound bus experience." That didn't sit well with Greyhound. In an open letter to the actor issued Thursday, Greyhound President and CEO Dave Leach said he was disheartened to hear about the comments Baldwin made about the company. "I'm the first to admit that Greyhound has had some challenges in the past, so I understand that you probably were basing your comments on that alone. But we've made so many changes in recent years to significantly improve the travel experience," Leach writes. "My guess is you've never traveled with us, but I ask you to give us a try for a number of reasons and see for yourself that we're really a great way to travel." Leach then touts the hundreds of new buses the company has added to its fleet as well as the extra legroom, leather seats, power outlets and free Wi-Fi. "I think you especially would find the latter two amenities exciting, because we don't require our customers to turn off their electronic devices ever. You could therefore play 'Words With Friends' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it," Leach tells Baldwin in the letter. He also reminds the actor that Greyhound carries more than 17 million travelers a year and asks Baldwin to become one of them.
"I invite you to meet with me in New York and we'll take a trip to Boston so you can see first-hand what a great ride Greyhound can be," Leach writes. "We are not the same company we used to be. We are better, providing a safe, affordable and modern travel alternative to other forms of transportation. Greyhound is an American icon, a proud company that many people depend on to get them to their destinations, the same people who watch your films and TV show." No word on whether Baldwin plans to take Leach up on his offer. The actor deactivated his Twitter account after the American Airlines incident.
England’s Golden Generation could get another chance to win the World Cup, but they will have to do it in the blistering heat of Qatar in 2016. As a test run for the real thing six years later, Qatar is set to be chosen to host the inaugural Veterans World Cup in two years time and many of the players who played for England in 2002, 2006 and 2010 would be selectable as over-35s. Organisers of the 16-team tournament, World Sport Company, have yet to confirm Qatar as the venue but managing director Jawid Bunyadi told the Aspire Global Summit in Doha this week that the Middle East was the chosen location and Qatar appears to be the favourite within that zone.

By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . Foreign criminals have been rounded up from Britain’s ‘soft’ open jails and put back behind bars to stop them absconding. Over the past 48 hours, more than 20 offenders were moved back to closed conditions. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now imposed a ban on foreign convicts who are subject to deportation orders being placed in open jail. More than 20 offenders were moved from open jails and back to closed conditions to stop them absconding . They will also be barred from taking part in Release on Temporary Licence, whereby inmates can leave a jail in the daytime to find work or undergo rehabilitation because a string of prisoners have failed to return. The move will affect hundreds of foreign prisoners. There are some 800 awaiting deportation. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘We are working hard to return foreign national prisoners to their own countries to serve their sentences. While they remain with us, we must do all we can to make sure they stay safely under lock and key. ‘That’s why I am changing the rules to prevent those foreign nationals who are going to be deported from being transferred into open prisons or getting temporary release. ‘It’s clearly not right that foreign nationals who are going to be deported end up in open prisons where they might abscond and threaten public safety.’ Figures published last month showed a sharp rise in the number of inmates going missing from jail – in the past year there were 225, up almost 30 per cent over the past two years. This included 137 from open prisons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out. The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, who sparked a nationwide hunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) has imposed ban on foreign convicts subject to deportation orders . Officials say the number of foreign criminals who have walked out is around 10 over the past five years. It comes amid renewed controversy over the Government’s record. On Monday, the Mail revealed how the number of overseas inmates escaping deportation rocketed by 50 per cent last year. In total, only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts considered for removal were sent home. The offenders who were not thrown out last year included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists, 140 robbers and 20 people guilty of sex offences against children. The foreign convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in every three cases – a sharp increase on previous years.
(CNN) -- When Joanne Branham lost her husband, Frank, to a brain tumor, she was devastated. But it wasn't until she visited her old neighbors in McCullom Lake, Illinois, that she began to question the cause of his death. Back in the community where she and Frank had lived for almost 40 years, Branham learned two of her former neighbors also had brain tumors. "It was like a light bulb went off," Branham recalls. "How can that many have cancer living right next door to each other?" Since then, more brain cancer cases have turned up, 30 in all, among current and former residents of McCullom Lake, a community of about 1,000 residents in northern Illinois, not far from the Wisconsin state line. Branham and others in McCullom Lake are now pointing the finger at a chemical plant a mile up the road in Ringwood, Illinois. For decades, they say, the Rohm and Haas plant dumped, spilled and leaked thousands of pounds of vinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals, poisoning the water and air around McCullom Lake. "I don't think there's been a bigger brain cancer cluster outside the workplace -- ever," says Aaron Freiwald, attorney for 31 McCullom Lake Village plaintiffs now suing Rohm and Haas. In addition to the brain cancer cases, there is one plaintiff alleging her liver damage resulted from environmental pollution. The company denies making anyone sick. Branham's case is the first to go to trial, with jury selection set to begin Wednesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 'Frank didn't have a chance' Frank Branham died in June 2004, a month after learning that he had a deadly glioblastoma brain tumor. He was 63. "Frank didn't have a chance," Joanne Branham says. "What they did was very wrong. They played with people's lives. I lost a husband, who was my best friend. The kids lost their father.
The grandkids lost their grandfather," she added, barely able to get her words out through her tears. Rohm and Haas says even though the cancer cases are close together, they are random. "There is no cluster in McCullom Lake Village," says Kevin Van Wart, attorney for Rohm and Haas. "If you draw circles around selected cases, you can always draw the conclusion of something unusual." Brain and central nervous system cancers strike 7.6 per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. An estimated 22,020 men and women in the United States will get diagnosed with these cancers this year. A month after the lawsuit was filed in 2006, the McHenry County Health Department in Illinois concluded there was no cluster of cancer cases in McCullom Lake. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did its own analysis and agreed. Originally a dairy . The Rohm and Haas site produces polymers, adhesives, resins and sealants on a 120-acre site originally built as a dairy operation in 1916 and converted to chemical manufacturing in the early 1940s. The facility has disposed its waste off site since 1978, but vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, or TCE, and vinylidene chloride have all been found in nearby groundwater, according to the CDC. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calls vinyl chloride "a known carcinogen." Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride on the job increases workers' risk of cancers of the liver, brain, lung and blood, according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Breathing or drinking high levels of TCE can damage the central nervous system, liver and lungs and also cause an abnormal heartbeat, according to the agency. Breathing high levels of vinylidene chloride can affect the central nervous system, liver and kidneys, the agency says.
But Van Wart, the Rohm and Haas attorney, says the plume of contaminated groundwater is moving away from McCullom Lake and does not affect any homes or residential wells. "Nobody disputes that it exists. But that is not going anywhere near McCullom Lake Village," Van Wart says. "No agency has ever concluded any resident was exposed to dangerous chemicals." To put residents' fears at ease, Rohm and Haas has offered to pay up to $50,000 to test residents' wells. There are about 400 homes with private wells in the village. The company has also offered to pay $5,000 to monitor the air for vinyl chloride and $50,000 for an independent analysis of theories of possible vinyl chloride exposure. 'A beautiful place to live' When Joanne and Frank Branham moved to McCullom Lake in August 1960, they saw a picturesque community with other young families. "It was a beautiful place to live. We lived by a beach. We had such close neighbors. The whole subdivision was like a family," says Branham, who raised five children there. Frank Branham worked as general manager at a die cast plant in nearby Woodstock, Illinois. On Sundays, the husbands would go down to the beach to play baseball. The wives would pack picnic baskets and watch. Looking back, Joanne Branham says there were warning signs. In the summer, a terrible odor would sometimes force them to close their windows, she says. "We didn't put two and two together until we found there were so many other neighbors with cancers," Branham says. After her husband died, Joanne Branham's children bought her a plane ticket to return to Illinois, from Phoenix, Arizona, where she and her husband had retired. Visiting old friends, she learned former next-door neighbor Bryan Freund also has a brain tumor, an oligodendroglioma.
So does Kurt Weisenberger, who lives on the other side of the Freunds, two doors down from the Branhams' former home. Freund, 49, a truck driver and jewelry store owner, says he never gave the Rohm and Haas plant a second thought until Joanne Branham came back to town. "It was really just a place I drove past," says Freund, who now suffers from headaches, seizures and memory loss. "I had dreams and aspirations," he adds. "Now when I look to the future it's really sort of a blank. I can't really expect to have one. That's a daily struggle." Weisenberger, 69, a retired general contractor, says he hopes the lawsuit will bring out the truth of what happened to the people of McCullom Lake. "It was a cover-up from the get-go as far as I'm concerned," says Weisenberger, who also suffers from seizures. Joanne Branham says she hopes the lawsuit, which asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive compensation, will make companies think twice. "What they did was wrong, and if this will save one person's life and they won't do this again, it will be worth it," she says. The trial is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks.

(CNN) -- Protesters in parts of Egypt rallied Friday against the government and a vote on a constitution that would ban religious parties, leading to clashes with security forces or demonstrators' opponents in at least three cities, Egyptian media reported. The demonstrations are the latest by members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators began to march after Friday prayers and clashed with police in various parts of the city, Ahram Online said. Clashes also broke out in al-Sabah city in Suez province, where security forces fired tear gas at a pro-Morsy march, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency. The Muslim Brotherhood-led National Alliance to Support Legitimacy had called for protests, MENA said. The alliance has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution, which would not only ban religious parties but also put more power in the hands of the military. The alliance has called for a boycott of the referendum. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights.
The interim government blames the group for coordinated attacks on churches and government facilities, including a recent bombing of a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy is awaiting trial in several cases, including one in which he and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. That trial, delayed Wednesday, is expected to resume on February 1. Morsy, who says he still is Egypt's legitimate president, has refused to recognize the court's authority and has yet to accept legal representation for the proceeding. CNN's Jason Hanna, Sarah Sirgany, Saad Abedine and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.
Accidentally brought your marijuana to the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport? Don't worry. Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo plans to install amnesty boxes at the airport, possibly as soon as next week, for people traveling out of state. "We'll have signs around the airport saying that although marijuana is legal in this state, it may be illegal in your final destination," DiSalvo told CNN. "This is an opportunity to dispose of your marijuana with no legal consequences." But don't try to fly with that marijuana, not even departing from the pot-happy states of Colorado and Washington. Both states allow adults 21 and older to have up to an ounce of marijuana, but those policies are at odds with federal law. Leave the brownies at home, too -- even in states where it's legal, it's not yet clear how marijuana-laced food is evaluated under those limits. The Transportation Security Administration seized 36 ounces of marijuana-laced food in a passenger's checked luggage at the Aspen airport earlier this month, and the federal agency referred the case to the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office, DiSalvo confirmed. (The edibles' amount of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, was much less than the weight of the food. The sheriff's office declined to press charges.) The story was first reported in the Aspen Daily News. Colorado's recreational marijuana stores make history . In fact, the TSA has called the sheriff several times over the past six months to report passengers carrying marijuana and related products, DiSalvo said. His office offers to dispose of the product before passengers depart the state. "Most everybody heeds our warnings," he said. The larger conflict is between state and federal law. While Colorado and Washington allow some marijuana use, federal law hasn't changed. And it's probably not a good idea to test the TSA or other federal agencies at the nation's airports.
If they find a substance that violates federal law, they can refer possible violations to federal, state or local law enforcement in any state. Still, pot isn't exactly the TSA's top priority. Denver International Airport bans pot despite Colorado's new marijuana law . "TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers," TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in a statement. "TSA's screening procedures, which are governed by federal law, are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. As has always been the case, if during the security screening procedures an officer discovers an item that may violate the law, TSA refers the matter to law enforcement. Law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation." It can be hard to sort out the competing state and federal regulations, especially for the dazed and confused passenger. The Colorado Springs airport has already placed amnesty boxes for people to get rid of their marijuana before clearing security or getting on an airplane. The Denver International Airport decided not to play with pot, banning the substance entirely at the airport, a spokeswoman confirmed. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport doesn't ban legal amounts of marijuana at the airport. That's because Washington state law doesn't allow facilities to add any additional regulation, airport spokesperson Perry Cooper said. A word of caution to Super Bowl fans from Colorado and Washington: Don't try to take your marijuana to less pot-friendly states. We know your (possible) cannabis consumption won't get in the way of the game, but consider where the Super Bowl is being played. If your pot makes it to your destination, you could be dealing with the Port Authority of New York and police guarding Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York and Newark airport in New Jersey. How do you think will they react if your goods are discovered?
"If they're possessing contraband in New York or New Jersey," Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said, "the prevailing laws would apply." Recreational pot sales: Where the grass is much greener .
A teenage girl helped her big sister to give birth at a rest spot on the I-95 when the baby decided that she couldn't wait for them to get to the hospital. Kennedy Smith, 14, and her sister Kelsea Marcus, 21, were being driven to Christiana Hospital in Newark by their mom on Sunday. But they soon realized that the baby was not going to wait until they got to the hospital as they drove down the busy road near Delaware.

Kennedy said she was sitting in the back seat of the car supporting Marcus who was sitting in the front seat and calming their mother down as she drove them at top speed to the hospital. As Smith entered the northbound I-95 from Del. 896, Marcus told her that she was trying not to push, 'but had to.' Kennedy said: ‘Ten minutes after my sister's water broke, the baby came.’ Kennedy called 911 and her mother pulled over into the Delaware Welcome Center on I-95. By that time, the baby was fully delivered with Kennedy's help. The 911 operators instructed Kennedy how to tie off the baby's umbilical cord and wipe the baby's mouth area. Safe hands: Kennedy Smith, 14, is an honor student and helped to deliver the baby, she has plans to enter the medical field and will study at the University of Pennsylvania next summer . They also instructed her to go six inches down and tie off the umbilical cord.
She said that if she hadn't been wearing shoelaces she was prepared to use the string from her hooded sweatshirt instead. The beautiful baby girl was born weighing a healthy seven pounds, one ounce. She was welcomed into the world with kisses and cuddles from her aunt, mom, and great- grandmother. Soon, New Castle paramedics arrived on the scene and assessed both the baby and her mother. They were then transported to the hospital. The baby had been due on September 20 but was not born. Marcus was scheduled to be induced at 9 p.m. on Sunday. But the baby clearly had other plans. Meanwhile, Kennedy, an honor student, says she plans to become a doctor. This summer, she studied at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and is scheduled to study next summer at the University of Pennsylvania. She told Fox 29: 'I'm in a STEM program so I'm training to be a physician. And this gives me more experience I guess so I think I'd actually consider going into medical field and delivering babies.' Her proud mother added: ‘We don't know what we would have done if Kennedy wasn't in the car keeping us calm. It was scary.’

More than 600 prisoners were involved . in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry - . at the camp in the German Province of Lower Silesia, 100 miles southeast . of Berlin. Tom and Dick had to be abandoned with Harry becoming the focus of their escape route. Time for a change?

Only 200 of the higher ranking . captives, those who could speak German and had put a lot of work into . digging the tunnels, would have time to escape in the plan. But there was a series of problems on the night of the escape.
The main issue was that the Harry tunnel came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower. The plan: 250 officers spent 11 months building Harry, a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in Zagan, Poland . The site 100 miles south of Berlin was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during World War Two .

An RAF spokesperson said: 'There are 50 current serving RAF personnel currently walking towards Poznan, which is the final resting place for Sqn Ldr Roger Bushell, who was the mastermind for the Great Escape; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads, which are not closed to traffic, they are wearing hi-vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely.'

International investigators were more cautious, however, saying only there were "very strong" indications this was the case. The plane disappeared between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people on board - this is the first trace of it found. What are the chances this find will solve one of the biggest aviation mysteries ever? It appears to bolster the theory that the plane crashed into a patch of the Indian Ocean west of Australia after it diverted from its route. Australian authorities including Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that the search would continue in the 60,000-sq-km area near Perth. "It is heartening that the discovery of the flaperon is consistent with our search area and we will continue to search this area thoroughly in the expectation we will find the missing aircraft," said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the operation. Reunion is roughly 6,000km (3,700 miles) west of the search area. Australia's national science agency CSIRO has computer simulations of the debris path showing the pieces would have initially stayed at the latitude of the search site, before winds and currents - known as the Indian Ocean gyre - pushed them in a north-west arc. On where the debris could have ended up, CSIRO oceanographer David Griffin says: "Madagascar was probably the highest probability, and Reunion is not far from that in the scheme of things." Others have noted that a boat lost off the Western Australian coast last year was found nearly intact eight months later, west of Madagascar. Investigators have been examining the 2m-long (6ft) piece in Toulouse, France this week after it was found on a beach in Reunion on 29 July. They have based their belief that the plane part could very possibly be from MH370 on two sources. One is Boeing which has confirmed that the piece, called a flaperon, belongs to a 777 plane - the same model as MH370.
The other is Malaysia Airlines which has provided documentation on MH370's aircraft. But investigators have stopped short of providing full confirmation, saying they can only do this after further tests on the fragment. French prosecutor Serge Mackowiak, who has presented investigators' is exercising supreme legal caution, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris. It could also be months before they make any tentative deductions about how the plane may have come down. One key question is whether the plane part's serial number is intact, which French investigators have not mentioned. Aeroplane parts, including flaperons, usually come with details such as a serial number, its manufacturer, and safety certification. These can be traced back to the manufacturer, who in turn would check its database to see which plane the part was used in. Investigators say that Boeing identified the part based only on "technical characteristics" such as the colour and the structure of its joints. There is no shortage of aircraft debris floating in the oceans so French investigators need to be absolutely certain this flaperon is not from another plane. Several aeroplanes have crashed in the Indian Ocean or in the vicinity of Reunion in the past two decades, although none were Boeing 777s. Two crashes involved large aircraft which ended up in waters near the Comoros Islands. One is Yemenia Airways IY626 - an Airbus 310 - which crashed in 2009. The other is Ethopian Airlines ET961 - a Boeing 767 - that crashed in 1996. Greg Waldron, of Flightglobal, said what is really needed are the plane's flight recorders - one piece alone won't solve the mystery, he told the BBC. Others say it is difficult to use the piece to pinpoint the exact location of where the plane is. "You can't trace the flight path with enough certainty based on this," said David Griffin from CSIRO. Marine salvage expert David Mearns agreed with this assessment.
He told the BBC that even if the debris was from MH370, the "uncertainty is too great" to find the crash site given that the plane disappeared 16 months ago. "I have backtracked wreckage to locate shipwrecks but only over a drift period of one to three days," he said. Robin Beaman, a marine geologist with Australia's James Cook University, said the pictures showed substantial marine growth - gooseneck or stalked barnacles - on the debris. These are commonly found on flotsam in the Indian Ocean, he told the BBC, and only on objects floating on the surface. Mr Beaman said it was obvious from the barnacle growth that the part had been drifting for "quite a long time". But he said it was hard to say how long exactly - it could be years or months - and that it was also unclear how long the part had been onshore before it was found. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions by relatives. Sarah Bajc whose partner Philip Wood was on MH370, told the BBC: "Perhaps families will finally have the chance to grieve now, though this doesn't solve the mystery or hold anyone accountable. Both of those things still have to happen." She added that there was still "much outstanding mistrust" of the authorities. "It hurts to have to give up that last thread of hope, but there is also a sad relief," she said. Some say the finding does not necessarily mean the plane crashed into the sea. Lee Khim Fatt, whose wife Foong Wai Yueng was on MH370, told the BBC: "I'm not convinced by the finding. I want to see an item that I can recognise. Others have been angered by the difference in Malaysian authorities and French investigators' responses.
A 73-year-old Montreal drama teacher who appeared in some softcore budget films over 40 years ago - one called The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac - has been fired from her position at the elite private school after some students traced back her racy roles. Jacqueline Laurent-Auger says she briefly worked as a young erotic actress in Paris - appearing in titles like Swedish Sex Games and Nathalie: Escape From Hell, but nothing pornographic - in the 1970s before returning to her native Quebec. She continued a career in TV and film before settling as a teacher, having taught at the prestigious private school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf for the last 15 years, according to The National Post. However Laurent-Auger is now out of a job after some male students tracked down some of her work online, presumably by accessing her IMDB page. Scroll down for video . Fired: Drama teacher Jacqueline Laurent-Auger, 73, as fired from private boys school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf after some students tracked down a set of erotic films she appeared in between 1960 and the 1970s . Controversial: One of the racy titles Laurent-Auger appeared in was Campo de Perversion, which was released in English as Nathalie: Escape From Hell and was set inside a Nazi war camp . Tasteful: In Nathalie: Escape From Hell, Laurent-Auger plays a 'sadistic female SS officer' who tortures an American doctor imprisoned at a Nazi concentration camp . Finale: In this scene, Laurent-Auger's character is shot and killed by the Americans . Sex cinema: Le journal intime d’une nymphomane (The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac) and Lorna The Exorcist are some of the titles Laurent-Auger appeared in as a young woman .
The school deemed the material - some of which included nude scenes - as unacceptable behavior of a teacher, regardless of when it was filmed. 'The fact these films were made 40 years ago does not change their risqué, suggestive — explicit even — nature,' the school told The National Post. 'Thanks to the Internet, it appears these types of films from the 1970s have come back in fashion. 'As educators, we had to ask what message is transmitted to all our students, boys and girls, from the first year of high school to the fifth, by the fact that the teacher of their drama workshops could now be seen on the Internet in the most suggestive of scenes.' Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best school in Quebec. However Laurent-Auger thinks the move is outrageous. She believes, as an elderly woman, the decisions she made in her twenties should not have any great leaning on her life. 'It’s completely absurd,' she told Radio-Canada. 'I’m 73 years old. Elite: Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best boys school in Quebec . 'When I made those films I must have been 28 or 29. 'It was to make a living so that after(wards) I could work with great teachers and actors, in Paris and in Quebec. Come on.' 'It is too bad (the principal) said something so stupid, that I was distracting (the students). 'They should have been made to understand what was the cinema of that period.' Laurent-Auger said the films reflect what was happening in cinema at the time and are not considered pornographic but just 'open-minded'. An online petition has been start in order to get Laurent-Auger her job back. There were reports late Wednesday Laurent-Auger had been talking with the school about a new outcome.
By . Jennifer Newton . An unknown man who captured his own image in a photobooth 445 times over 30 years is proving to be a mystery. Starting in the 1930s, he took black and white selfies in a photobooth over three decades until the 1960s, charting his passage through time. Most of the pictures show the mystery man grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes. For three decades this unknown man took over 445 selfies in photobooths from the 1930s to the 1960s. They now form a new exhibition at Rutgers University . It is thought the man may have been a photobooth technician and took the pictures as a way of testing the equipment . Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 years, especially as taking self portraits were a lot harder back then. In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit. The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'. Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 year period . The exhibit is being shown at the Rutgers' Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick and they say they are taking these early selfies and showing them as art. The images on display of the unknown man were taken during a time when photobooths were hugely popular in the United States. The 445 prints are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the pictures two years ago at a New York City antiques show. The pictures are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the images at an antiques show in New York City in 2012 .
He originally only came across a handful of the photographs but the dealer told him there were hundreds more images of the man and he decided to buy them all. Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, "Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?"' 'Thereâ€™s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.' It is thought the mystery man in the pictures could be from the Midwest and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on his identity . Mr Lokuta also added that based on conversations with another historian, it could be likely that the mystery man was a photobooth technician, who was taking the pictures to test out the equipment. It is also likely that he hailed from the U.S. Midwest, and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on who the man is. It is thought the photos originated previously from an auction in Michigan.

Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial . Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence . Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and . prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt . Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video .
New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too . Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times . Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.'
Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on . him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a . charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating . most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial . Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach . The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys . 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's .
lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by . overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that . accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest . last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa 'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola . said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes . of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive . new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys.
'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here . Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .

Most seem to agree that Michael Middleton, father of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and granddad to Prince George of Cambridge, should leave royal photography to the professionals. "They are lovely snaps for a grandfather to have taken. But in terms of the quality, they are not really what you want for such a historic picture" is the verdict of Eddie Mulholland, vice chairman of the British Press Photographers Association and a photographer for the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail describes Catherine and Prince William's decision to use "one of proud grandpa Mike's happy family snaps" as "a startling break with tradition." Most criticism zeroed in on the focus and the lighting -- always a challenge for amateur photographers not equipped with fancy flashes or reflectors. Prince William and Catherine, the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket, are posed on the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire with the sun behind them, a difficult shot to pull off. "I guess the reason Kate's father chose backlight was to avoid bright sun on little George," speculates the Mirror's royal photographer, Kent Gavin. He's happy to share some advice though. "Back-lighting is always a little tricky for the non-professionals but it does give a nice result. Photographing against the sun needs a fill-in flash. Another option would be to use an area in shade away from harsh light." His other tip? "My professional view would be to see more of baby George."
'Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles' The inclusion of the family pets -- the Cambridges' cocker spaniel Lupo and the Middletons' golden retriever Tilly -- in some of the snaps also gets a mixed reception. A reporter for The Times of London remarked that the official photographs came "in a choice of formats: with or without dogs." Mulholland, of the Telegraph, was more scathing. "The photograph with the dogs is the worst. One of the dogs in the corner looks like a furry rug," he wrote. But the pictures got a more favorable write-up from some CNN readers who commented on the story. "Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles and the world needs more smiles!" said Earlypro. "Its nice to see a family snap and not a professional one. Its a special time with a new baby I hope the press backs off and let them enjoy it," wrote Ann. The public also weighed in on Twitter. "Who cares? The photos are beautiful and show a new family! I think it's great that 'Grandad' got to take the photos," tweeted MammaMia, a mother of two from the English West Midlands. "I'm no royal watcher, but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby George grampa. Can u blame them?" posted @MemoryMan Studios, a portrait studio in Dublin, Ireland. No 'feeling of grandeur' However, John Keatley, an editorial and celebrity photographer in Seattle, told CNN that taking such informal pictures jars the royal "brand." "The amateur image that these photos put across certainly doesn't create the most grand or royal image in the viewer's mind," he said. "They're decent photos. They're not terrible.
But at the same time, they certainly don't have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos." He acknowledged that the family may have been trying to project a casual, informal image. But, he added, "You can still make it casual. But this is just casual and poor quality. They didn't have to make a bad quality product to put that idea across." Christopher Barr, a professional photographer in Arizona, agrees. "It's obvious that a professional didn't take these. It hasn't been color-corrected. Even somebody with a modicum of Photoshop knowledge could improve these pictures immeasurably," he said. "It's not a very good effort. It's a particularly poor effort given that he's taking pictures of such an important thing at such an important time." But Lana Marks, a friend of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, told CNN's "AC360" show that she thinks William's mother would have been delighted by his approach. "One of the things she told me is that she so much wanted William to have a normal life with his family in the future, with whoever he wed and had children with," she said. "All of her dreams have come true and her legacy's coming true, and all the influences she's had on William, the normalcy, is showing through so greatly now. She would be immensely happy."

As businessman Geoffrey Edelsten is chased for millions by the Australian Tax Office and US creditors, it's now been revealed more than $30 million has been 'inexplicably' removed from his private trust account ledgers. The Australian Taxation Office is pursuing the former doctor for $14,130,000 in taxes and penalties and a motion was filed in the US Bankruptcy Court on Friday regarding a secret settlement last month between Mr Edelsten and his creditors, namely Florida's Mawardi family, reported the Daily Telegraph. The ATO says the US trustee liquidating Mr Edelsten's assets showed that it 'disproportionately favours (the) trust' and may have been unaware of $30.9 million in his Norman South Trust as of June, because that amount of money may not have been disclosed before the agreement.

It said the settlement, which seeks to distribute funds from assets such as apartment complexes in the US, an airplane and homes and cars in Australia, was unreasonable. The reason being because it did not consider a 'sizeable loan Edelsten extended to the trust that was removed inexplicably from later financial statements. He filed for bankruptcy in the US earlier this year and was described by a US judge as being 'self servingly ambiguous' about his assets. Mr Edelsten declined to comment saying it was 'against the law'.

Jay Brenton Liptrot, 43, owned the property in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, where five people died in October 2012. Lee-Ann Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their son Charlie, 15 months, Ms Shiers' nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, died in the fire. Mr Liptrot, of Prestatyn, did not enter a plea when he appeared at the town's magistrates' court on Friday. Melanie Smith has already been jailed for at least 30 years for five counts of murder after starting the fire in a row over a shared hallway. Mr Liptrot will appear at Mold Crown Court in May.
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the government's decision to end the scheme on a visit to a housing association in Glasgow. Margaret Thatcher's Tory government introduced the scheme in 1980. The Scottish government has already scrapped "right to buy" for new tenants and it will be abolished altogether in 2017. Since the opportunity to buy was introduced, 455,000 Scottish properties have been sold. The Scottish government said that had reduced the number of homes available for cheap rent and increased the waiting lists for properties of this type. Ms Sturgeon, during a visit to Queens Cross Housing Association, said the move would "safeguard social housing stock for future generations". She added: "It is absolutely vital that people can access social housing when they need it most. Social housing is under significant pressure and so too are the budgets that support it. "The Scottish government is doing everything possible to maximise our investment in housing and deliver on our target of 30,000 new, affordable homes over the lifetime of this parliament. "But, given the pressure on both the housing stock and budgets - and with 400,000 people on waiting lists for social housing - we can no longer afford to see badly needed homes lost to the social sector." By Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland news "Two thirds of residential properties in Scotland are now owned by their occupiers. But there is a big shortage of homes for rent, particularly social housing. It is mainly for that reason that the Scottish government has restricted the 'right to buy'. In March 2011, it was scrapped for new tenants and new social housing. From 2017, it will be abolished altogether. This is in marked contrast to policy in England. In this year's budget, the UK government increased the discount available to tenants in London. The Chancellor also promised to reduce the qualifying period from five to three years to widen access. Devolution continues to increase the policy differences between Scotland and other parts of the UK."
In November last year, a Scottish government consultation revealed that a majority of Scottish councils wanted the right to buy policy scrapped. The report also showed that many tenants and social landlords wanted it to end. An opponent of the move is former Scottish Conservative Party leader Annabel Goldie. She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the policy was "arguably" one of the most "socially liberating" policies to be introduced in Scotland and across the UK. Miss Goldie added: "I can still remember the days when people lived in monolithic council house schemes - that is what they were called - and they were afflicted by a postcode prejudice. "They were apprehensive about disclosing their address because they felt it would negate their chance of getting a job or even being accepted for an interview. "By offering a tenant the right to buy, you did two things - you first of all introduced a freedom to the individual to make a choice about how they wanted to live, and secondly you stopped them being trapped in that environment - because that is exactly what they were." She went on: "Right to buy freed people from the environmental prison they were in." The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations welcomed the Scottish government's announcement. Its membership manager said: "Right to buy has had its day and has no place in 21st century Scotland. "It has been beneficial to a relatively small number of individuals, but clearly a loss to the greater public good. Half a million social rented homes have been lost in the 30 years of this policy in Scotland, very often the better stock in the more popular areas." Although the right to buy policy will come to an end in Scotland in 2017, it continues to exist elsewhere in the UK.
By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:00 EST, 17 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:46 EST, 17 January 2013 . MPs who demanded pay rises of up to 32 per cent were today branded ‘potty’ by Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister said it ‘beggars belief’ that MPs surveyed by the Commons expenses watchdog had said they should be earning tens of thousands of pounds more. A survey last week revealed that 69 per cent believe they are ‘underpaid’ following the introduction of a new expenses regime that forces them to provide receipts for all claims. Nick Clegg said MPs were wrong to demand vast pay rises when public sector workers were seeing salaries increase by just one per cent . The studies were commissioned by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is reviewing whether MPs’ pay should be changed from its current level of £65,738. On average, Tories said their salary should be £96,740, while Lib Dems thought the right amount was £78,361 and Labour £77,322. Mr Clegg said: ‘It just beggars belief apparently that some MPs have anonymously said they deserve a pay increase.’ Challenged over MPs pay on his weekly radio phone-in, he added: ‘They are living on a different planet to think that you can say to teachers and nurses and doctors “you’re only going to get a one per cent increase in your pay for the next several years but we deserve a [32 per cent] increase”. ‘I think it’s potty and it’s not going to happen, certainly if I’ve got anything to do with it.’ YouGov conducted online interviews with 100 MPs on Ipsa's behalf, and weighted the results slightly to represent the Commons by party, gender, year elected, and geography.
Conservatives were the most likely to believe they were underpaid, with 47 per cent saying that was the case. Some 39 per cent of Labour members and 9 per cent of Lib Dems held the same view. One MP said they should be paid £40,000 or less. Some 5 per cent said £60-65,000 was fair, and 17% went for £65-£70,000. It was Mr Clegg's second week as a talk show host, appearing alongside LBC presenter Nick Ferrari to answer questions from callers on LBC 97.3 . Mr Clegg said he hoped Ipsa would do ‘the sensible thing’ and restrain pay, . Taking aim at the MPs who used anonymity to demand bigger salaries, he added: ‘I flatly and totally disagree with it. I don’t know who put their names to this. ‘Whoever did needs to think again and also needs to think about what signal it sends out to the constituents of MPs who are being asked to have real restraint and limits on how fast their own pay increases.’ For more from Nick's weekly show on LBC click here .
By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:10 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:55 EST, 27 June 2012 . Cait Reilly, pictured, yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government¿s back-to-work programme unlawful . A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland yesterday claimed the scheme amounted to ‘forced labour’ which breached her human rights. Cait Reilly yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government’s back-to-work programme unlawful after she was required to work in the budget store or risk losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance. The 23-year-old said she had to give up a voluntary post in a museum to take the placement but was promised a job interview if she completed two weeks training at Poundland. However, she says, that never materialised. The Government is fighting her claim . and strongly denies that its flagship work programme, which has placed . thousands of jobseekers on unpaid placements since its launch last year, . is equivalent to ‘slave labour’. Unemployed . mechanic Jamieson Wilson, 41, is also challenging the legality of . another Government work scheme that compels the jobless to take unpaid . work. Lawyers for the pair . are seeking a judicial review into the Department for Work and Pensions . programme, saying it violates Article 4 of the European Convention on . Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery. The . schemes, championed by Employment Minister Chris Grayling, aim to help . 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid . experience in the public, private and charity sectors. Placement-providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and . Asda.
Miss Reilly, who graduated in geology . from Birmingham University in 2010, was placed on the scheme after . attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in October last year at the . suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser. Legal challenge: Cait Reilly, pictured, was 'forced' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at Poundland or risk losing her benefits . Only after attending was she told she had to undertake a period of training or risk losing her benefits. Nathalie Lieven, QC, appearing for . Miss Reilly, said her placement at Poundland, near her home in Kings . Heath, Birmingham, involved carrying out ‘menial’ tasks, adding: ‘Such . work did not contribute to (Miss Reilly’s) search for work to any . extent.’ Miss Reilly had undertaken the work under ‘menace of penalty’ in breach of her human rights, she added. Unhappy: Cait Reilly is shown outside the Poundland store in Birmingham where she claims she was forced to work . The court was told Poundland is a successful firm with a net turnover of £500million, and her placement did not contribute to the public interest. Miss Lieven told Mr Justice Foskett the way in which the back-to-work programme was administered was ‘blatantly unlawful’, and had put thousands at risk of unfairly losing their benefits. She also accused the Government of ‘seemingly sub-delegating to private sector providers’ how the schemes were run, including whether those who refused unpaid work should lose benefits. Miss Lieven added: ‘These claimants have an entitlement to subsistence-level benefits.
'Taking away these subsistence-level benefits for up to six months is in many ways just as fundamental as being detained as an immigrant in prison.’ The court heard that Mr Wilson, also from the Midlands, had been unemployed since 2008. He was told last November he would be required to undertake up to six months of unpaid work cleaning furniture. After refusing, he had his benefits cut, and now faces the loss of his jobseeker’s allowance for six months. Paul Nicholls, QC, appearing for the DWP, argued that both legal challenges were ‘wrong in law’. He said the purpose of the schemes was to assist the long-term jobless to better equip themselves for work, and thousands of people in different situations had benefited. The case continues. Prestigious: Cait Reilly, 22, is a geology graduate from Birmingham University .

Federal authorities are asking for the public to be on the lookout for an armed suspect who may be hiding on eastern Long Island after allegedly holding up banks in three states. Luis Alomar is wanted on a federal arrest warrant for allegedly robbing banks in Delaware, New York and New Jersey, according to the FBI. He speaks Spanish and has ties to the Mastic-Shirley area. “Alomar is alleged to have made verbal threats to bank tellers, telling them he would shoot them if they said anything,” the agency said in a statement. In most cases, he allegedly handed a demand note to the teller indicating he was carrying a weapon. In some cases, a weapon was displayed. He normally demands large bills. Alomar also has ties to southern Florida, specifically Palm Beach County, Kissimmee and Osceola County. He should be considered armed and dangerous. The 37-year-old suspect is described as 5-feet, 4-inches tall, 145 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He has a large mole on his right forehead, as well as tattoos on right arm and right leg. He also uses the aliases Arturo Alomar, Luis Arturo, David Diaz, David Gonzalez, Louis Alomar and Luis Castillo. Anyone with information is asked to call the New York FBI at 212-384-1000. Tipsters may remain anonymous.

Agents and New York police arrested Luis Alomar, 37, around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, the agency said in a statement.
It didn't provide details of where he was arrested in the Long Island community or how he was located. The FBI had sought the public's help Monday in finding Alomar, who is suspected of robbing 20 banks in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Alomar allegedly flashed a gun at tellers in some of the robberies, sometimes threatening to shoot them if they said anything, the FBI said. Luis Alomar, 37, is wanted by the FBI in a series of bank robberies along the Eastern Seaboard. Photo Credit: FBI A suspect in a series of bank robberies along the Eastern Seaboard was arrested in Medford early Tuesday, the FBI said. Fugitive Luis Alomar, 37, was taken into custody at about 2:30 a.m., the FBI's New York field office said in a news release. He is currently being held on state parole violations at the Suffolk County Jail, said Christios Sinos, a supervisory special agent at the FBI. An arraignment had not yet been scheduled, he said. The release said that police from Suffolk County, Westchester, Yonkers and Greenwich, Conn., assisted in the arrest, as did the New York State Division of Parole. The release did not provide details of the arrest or Alomar's arraignment information, and the agency did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information. The FBI had issued a news release on Monday, warning that Alomar -- who has ties to the Mastic and Shirley areas -- was wanted and could be armed and dangerous. A federal arrest warrant had been issued for Alomar in Delaware for bank robbery, and he is a suspect in several more, including ones in New York and New Jersey, the FBI said Monday. The FBI did not specify the locations of the robberies.
In addition to ties to Long Island, Alomar also has ties to southern Florida, specifically Palm Beach County, as well as Kissimmee in Osceola County. He has used aliases, including Arturo Alomar, Luis Arturo, David Diaz, David Gonzalez, Louis Alomar and Luis Castillo, the release said.
Mr Kennedy, who led the party between 1999 and 2006, died at his home in Fort William on Monday aged 55. Following a post-mortem examination, his family issued a statement saying his unexpected death was "a consequence of his battle with alcoholism". "Ultimately this was an illness Charles could not conquer despite all the efforts he and others made," they said. Details of Mr Kennedy's funeral arrangements will be released in due course. Mr Kennedy fought a long battle with alcoholism, which he first publicly revealed in 2006 when he stood down from the leadership of his party, just eight months after leading it to its best-ever performance at an election. After his death was announced on Tuesday, the police said they did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. Charles Kennedy: 1959-2015 Nick Robinson on Kennedy's legacy John Pienaar's memories The Charles Kennedy story Charles Kennedy's life in pictures Charles Kennedy in his own words In their statement the family said the Procurator Fiscal's post-mortem report "makes clear his (death) was a consequence of his battle with alcoholism". "We are grateful to the many friends and also medical experts who sought to help down the years but ultimately this was an illness Charles could not conquer despite all the efforts he and others made," they said said. The family said they had been "touched beyond measure by the outpouring of warmth" from all parts of the country and all sides of politics following Mr Kennedy's death. "The pain we feel has been at least eased somewhat by the reaction of so many people across Scotland, the UK and beyond, and by the affection expressed by politicians across the spectrum. "It has become all too apparent to us how much Charles meant to so many people and how many lives he touched."
Mr Kennedy's 10-year old son Donald and his ex-wife Sarah were in Parliament on Wednesday to listen to 90 minutes of tributes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Harriet Harman. Many of the MPs who spoke addressed their comments to Donald, who was born during the 2005 general election, saying he could be rightly proud of how his father had conducted himself in his 32-year political career and the difference he had made. What are the long-term effects of alcoholism? By Philippa Roxby, BBC News health reporter The effects of long-term alcohol addiction do not just affect the liver. Drinking large amounts over many years will take its toll on other parts of the body, including the heart, pancreas, brain and nervous system. Heavy drinking can increase blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, which are both major risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. It can also weaken the immune system, increase the risk of a range of cancers and make people more prone to depression, dementia and infertility. Drinkers at high risk of damaging their health are those drinking more than eight units of alcohol a day or 50 units a week, for men, and more than six units a day or 35 units a week, if you're a woman. That's equivalent to several pints of strong lager or a bottle of wine every night. With no alcohol-free days to let the body recover between drinking, health problems will automatically begin to pile up. But NHS Choices warns that alcohol can start to have a health impact at even lower levels - when drinking more than the recommended weekly amount of 21 units for men and 14 units for women. Giving up alcohol when it has become a habit is not easy. Recognising there is a problem is often the first important step - but it is just the start.
NHS Choices recommends going to see a GP and being honest about how much you drink, before trying to cut down gradually. Its website has more information on which organisations to contact for help. The family's statement adds: "The words and images of that day, and of so many other tributes, will be there for us to look back on with pride in Charles, and Donald will always know what a special father he had." Tony Blair's former communications director Alastair Campbell, who was a friend of Mr Kennedy's despite the two being on opposite sides over the Iraq War, said he hoped it would make politicians take alcoholism more seriously as an illness. "None of us are surprised that alcoholism played a part in his tragic death but what has been great about the tributes is that they have focused on so much more than this. "I hope that remains the case as people continue to remember him as we move towards the funeral and then subsequent memorials. "I also hope that politicians of all parties develop a better understanding of alcoholism, take it more seriously and devise policies to treat it as a disease on a par with the other major diseases." And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he hoped the days when people felt "a little bit embarrassed" to talk about such a personal issue in public were over. "We need to remember Charles for all his achievements, not just how he died," he told the BBC News Channel. "I hope we can also use this tragic moment to understand a little bit more about what alcoholism is and what it does to people. "We need not to be ashamed of the illness, just like we would not be ashamed of any other illness, so that it allows people to be open and seek the help they need to deal with what is a terrible illness."
Paramedics treated about 12,000 people who were so drunk it was noted on Scottish Ambulance Service systems in the six months to the end of September. The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives under freedom of information laws. The ambulance service said alcohol had a significant impact on its operations. It comes after a recent internal Scottish Ambulance Service survey showed alcohol was a factor in more than half of all call-outs ambulance staff dealt with at weekends. The latest figures showed Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, had the highest number of alcohol-related 999 call-outs in the six month period at 3,849. It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how "deep-rooted and complex" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society. He said: "Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable. "Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift. "But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from." A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol. He added: "They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated. "Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults. "Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff."
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse. She added: "However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe."
The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, set up in 2012 by the now First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, is set to run £490m over its budget. The motion, proposed by former DUP councillor Ruth Patterson, was passed by 23 votes in favour to 12 against. The UK government has already rejected an Alliance call for a public inquiry. The Treasury has refused to cover the RHI overspend and it will have to be paid from the block grant that Northern Ireland receives from Westminster. Mrs Patterson, who was expelled from the DUP in 2015, asked her fellow councillors to note the "serious public concern amongst our constituents in relation to financial squander" over the RHI scheme. Now an independent councillor, she proposed that Belfast City Council writes to Secretary of State James Brokenshire to request a public inquiry. "The secretary of state has a public responsibility to initiate an inquiry regarding this," Mrs Patterson said. "I certainly think he will listen to Belfast City Council - we are elected by the people and we certainly need to have our say in this. We are the closest, on the ground, to the people of Northern Ireland, right across the province, and everyone is talking about the same issue." A government spokesman said it is up to the Northern Ireland Executive to decide on what form of investigation is carried out. Mrs Patterson's motion also called on her former party leader Mrs Foster to "step aside" during the inquiry. DUP councillor Lee Reynolds said the outcome of the vote was "predictable" and accused other parties of playing political "games". "They're not interested in solving the problems with RHI, which we should be trying to move forward," Mr Reynolds told BBC News NI. "They're not interested in getting towards an independent investigation, they're just trying to find ways of having a go at the DUP and trying to undermine the First Minister Arlene Foster." Eighteen councillors abstained from taking part in the vote.
Sinn Féin attempted to amend Mrs Patterson's motion, this time calling not for a full public inquiry, but for an independent investigation led by a judicial figure from outside Northern Ireland, but their amendment did not attract enough support. "We think the public want the truth, but they also want the truth as quickly as possible," said Sinn Féin councillor Jim McVeigh. "They don't want to wait a year, or two years, like some of these public inquiries can take, so we think the best way to do this is a robust, transparent investigation that will get to the truth quickly." The Ulster Unionist Party also proposed an amendment that called on Mrs Foster to resign, but it too failed. Earlier on Tuesday, it was reported that the UK government has already rejected a request from Alliance Party leader Naomi Long to hold a public inquiry into the RHI scandal. Mrs Long had written to both Mr Brokenshire and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke to ask for their intervention. A government spokesman said: "The operation of the RHI scheme is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. So it is right for the executive and the assembly to decide the form of any investigation or inquiry." Mrs Foster has resisted calls for a public inquiry and for her to temporarily step aside while the matter is investigated. The matter has caused a rift at the heart of the Stormont administration, with Sinn Féin threatening to call a fresh election if the first minister does not stand aside for an investigation.
(CNN) -- As warring sides prepared to hold their first face-to-face talks to end weeks of ethnic fighting in the world's newest country, clashes flared around a key town Sunday. Nhial Majak Nhial, the mayor of Bor, told CNN that rebel troops had been driven away from his town, which has exchanged hands several times during three weeks of violence that has killed hundreds and forced about 200,000 people from their homes. Defense Minister Kuol Manyang said government forces tried to take back the disputed town but were forced to retreat to a military base eight miles away after rebels ambushed them. Brig. Gen. Abraham Jongroor was killed and several officers were wounded when rebels attacked, the defense minister said. Helicopters airlifted dozens of injured government troops to a military hospital in Juba, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away. Bor, capital of the oil-rich Jonglei state, has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the violence, as military forces have battled the rebel fighters. "Their technique of fighting is numbers -- they are using numbers against capable and well-trained government troops," Nhial said. "Many of their men, some even children, have died." President Salva Kiir and the rebels' leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, have sent delegations to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for talks on a possible ceasefire. Face-to-face negotiations were scheduled to begin on Sunday but now are expected to start Monday morning, said Mahboub Maalim, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional group mediating the talks. Mediators meet both sides . While neither Kiir nor Machar are in Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, group representatives have gathered and are talking amongst themselves on the sidelines, Maalim said.
"A lot of discussing and discussions going on for sure we are ready to start face-to-face anytime, but we have to wait on the groups to be ready," he said. The talks will focus on the cessation of hostilities and negative propaganda, the granting of access to monitors and to humanitarian aid workers, and the question of detainees, Maalim said on Saturday. The proxy talks have been attended by special envoys to IGAD; the heads of negotiating teams of the two South Sudanese parties; Maalim; and the ministers of foreign affairs of Ethiopia and Kenya. No breakthrough has come yet despite pressure on Kiir and Machar from African and Western powers to end the conflict. So far, the mediators met with representatives of both delegations to try to pin down the issues and set out a framework for the talks. Speaking during a visit to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the negotiations needed to be "serious." "They cannot be a delay gimmick in order to continue the fighting and try to find advantage on the ground at the expense of the people of South Sudan," he said. "We will work to apply international pressure to any elements that attempt to use force to seize power. That is not acceptable." Ethnic tensions . But as the two sides' teams negotiate, fighting has continued in their country. So far the violence has claimed more than 1,000 lives and displaced about 200,000 others. Humanitarian agencies have warned that the estimated 200,000 who have fled to makeshift camps are facing dire conditions, with many lacking clean water and sanitation in makeshift camps. The fighting began in Juba on December 15 but quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings soon emerging. Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup.
The two have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Although the conflict began as a political power struggle, it has taken on an ethnic dimension and includes evidence of ethnically targeted killings, according to the U.N. mission in South Sudan. Some observers have said both sides may want to gain the upper hand militarily before beginning to discuss a possible cease-fire. South Sudan is the world's youngest nation, having seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.

The writers of Toy Story are reportedly in talks to pen a movie based on FarmVille, the popular Facebook game. Alec Sokolow and Joel Cohen said in an interview with IGN that they're working with Zynga on a movie based on one of the company's most popular games, adding "Can't really say too much on that front yet, but 'Old MacDonald' didn't have a factory, if you get our drift." We get it: Making a movie is super risky. Unlike launching new apps and websites, movies are a huge upfront investment in the vague hope of a hit. Hence the tendency to just remake something that's already popular. Or the flurry of movies based on popular websites, apps and tech personalties. The Facebook movie. The Steve Jobs movie (possibly). The Angry Birds movie. Why take a chance on something new when you can buy the rights to something with tens of millions of fans already? What does a FarmVille movie look like anyway? No doubt it'll be a computer-animated feature (in 3D, of course!) incorporating the graphics and themes of the Facebook game. But FarmVille is a game in which you tend crops. Is that going to be a bit boring? And while to tens of millions of people, FarmVille is an addictive pastime, for the friends of those people (ie. us!) it's actually kind of a nuisance. Would a FarmVille movie be met with glowing reviews or - more likely - an audible sigh from those of us who grudgingly tolerate the addiction of our FarmVille-playing friends and relatives? And could the critics be anything but, well, critical of this cynical attempt at turning a successful gaming franchise into an equally popular film? Ah, but plenty can happen at these early stages — one of a hundred issues may prevent the movie from entering production.
Not to mention that FarmVille is no longer the most popular Facebook game, reducing the potential audience for the movie. Or perhaps I'll be proven sorely wrong. After all, a certain movie based on the Facebook story took home 3 Oscars this year. PS. For those movie studios thinking of following suit, Zynga was kind enough to list its top-performing games - plus some intriguing stats - in its IPO filing earlier this year: In an interview about their work on upcoming game Skylanders Spyro's Adventures, Toy Story writers Alec Sokolow and Joel Cohen have revealed that they're currently in talks to pen a film based on Farmville. Speaking with IGN, the pair said the following when asked about projects they're currently working on: "So, yes, we will continue writing movies. We are also working on several new and very exciting opportunities. We're in conversations with Zynga to do something with one of their brands. Can't really say too much on that front yet, but 'Old MacDonald' didn't have a factory, if you get our drift." Previous rumors have led to speculation about Zynga working on a Mafia Wars film , but a Farmville movie has never been revealed.The project has not been formally announced. When contacted, Zynga refused to comment.For our full interview with Sokolow and Cohen, be sure to check IGN tomorrow.
In the last few years, the beard has had a renaissance. No longer just the preserve of tramps and lumberjacks, it is now seen on lawyers, bar staff and artists across the western world who have wanted to add a bit of edge to their look. The move has not gone unnoticed by the fairer sex, many of whom are delighted at the new facial hair trend. So it can only be good news that a new dating website has emerged, specifically linking up beard lovers with men who have beards. Scroll down for video . New dating website Bristlr matches beard lovers to men with beards. The site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users . John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago and already tens of thousands of people have signed up. He started the project as a bit of a joke after suggesting the idea on Facebook and seeing a positive response from his friends. The (bearded) 28-year-old software developer said: 'When I posted the question on my Facebook page, my friends said they thought it was a really good idea. 'So I made this fake landing site where people could sign up to this app that didn't really exist, just because I was curious to see how far people would go with it.' In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site . He continued: 'I wanted to see who was willing to go through the hassle of signing up, giving their email address, etc. 'After 100 people signed up in four days, I thought there must be some scope, so I made a proper website and launched it four weeks ago. 'It has kind of got a little bit out of hand at this moment, so I'm just kind of going with it, which is great fun.' John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago .
In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site and when the IOS and Android apps are launched in a couple of weeks, those numbers are likely to grow even faster. John admits he can't believe how successful it has been so far, especially as it started out as a bit of a joke. He said: 'We are comfortably in the five figures now. It does surprise me because I'm very cynical and I think it is such a stupid idea that no one is going to want to do it. 'But it turns out that actually, people think it's kind of cool. I've started to talk to the people using it, and some say that it is the best dating site they've ever used. 'I think it's the fact that instead of it being this serious business like “Hey, if you click this button we're going to do this serious thing,” it's more like “Hey, I like your beard.” 'It’s light-hearted - you can't take it too seriously, which I think is really appealing to people. I did build a block button just in case though, because inevitably there are going to be creepy dudes. 'I’m sure there will also be guys who go on there without beards to try and pick up women, but they're not going to have much luck.' The site uses a minimal amount of information from users, so as not to be too invasive. But it does keep a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50. John said: 'I've been quite surprised by the ratio of beards to people looking for beards.' The site keeps a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50 .
'We don't track whether people are male or female, just whether or not they have a beard or they are looking for someone with a beard - we track the import stuff. 'It's just under half of people who have beards on Bristlr. 'I think I was expecting it to be 90 per cent people with beards.' That isn't the only surprise, John is also amazed by the different countries around the world where the site has already become a hit. He said: 'It's only international by chance - because I was too lazy to limit it when I was building the site.' The site is already in the UK, Holland, Canada and the US . He continued: ''It's really big in Holland and I had someone from Montreal today tell me it is now getting quite big over there, which is ridiculous. 'San Francisco was one of the first cities to embrace it. 'It's catching on slowly in New York, but I feel like they're slightly more cynical about it.' John admits that it may just be a craze while the beard trend lasts, but he is enjoying it while it does. He said: 'I know beards are definitely in, people have realised they are kind of lovely. Keep it neat. Invest in some nice beard oil, get a good pair of trimmers and just experiment. If you feel good in your beard then that comes across as confidence. A good beard doesn’t replace your personality but it does compliment it. 'I get that it is personal preference, just like some people like short hair and some like it long. 'I know some people who are repulsed by beards and some people just love them. 'You can tell a lot about a man by his beard, not that they just have one, because they may have just forgotten to shave. 'But just like seeing someone with a really nice suit or haircut, a nice well-kept beard shows some pride in appearance.'
Cryptoy was created by three industrial placement students and tells the story of four historical cyphers, including the German Enigma code, cracked at Bletchley Park during World War Two. The free app for Android tablet devices also encrypts messages using the codes. GCHQ says it is hoping it will help to encourage teenagers to be the next generation of cyber security experts. Cryptoy also showcases the substitution and vigenere cyphers, and the shift, which dates back to Roman times. A spokeswoman for Cheltenham-based GCHQ said the app is intended as a "fun teaching aid" to help 14-16 year olds studying at the Key Stage 4 level learn something about code making and code breaking. She said it aims to encourage them to become interested in associated disciplines such as mathematics, as well as problem solving and the necessary programming skills to create such an app. "All of this is extremely relevant to today's world where information security is increasingly important and where we need young people to study the subjects necessary," she added. The app was initially produced by the industrial placement students for the Cheltenham Festival cultural event last year. The GCHQ spokeswoman said the agency was keen where possible to be open about some aspects of its work. The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said the public should have no qualms about downloading the app. Cryptoy will be available to download directly from Google Play or through the GCHQ website. It is understood that a version for Apple iPads will not be available until next year.
By . Anna Edwards . Imomotimi Wilson treated his alleged victim 'like a piece of meat' A man on trial for rape for allegedly refusing to wear a condom on the third time he had sex with a woman in a one-night stand has told the jury it was 100 per cent consensual. Imomotimi Wilson, 30, met his alleged victim in a pub and she agreed to go back to his house but told him she would only have sex if he used protection. They had consensual sex twice but on the third occasion claims that Wilson failed to use a condom. The woman, a 40-year-old, said Wilson treated her 'like a piece of meat' as the alleged attack took place. She said he held her hands over her head and told her 'if you love me you'll do it' before raping her for 15-20 seconds. But giving evidence at his trial at Cambridge Crown Court Wilson said 'she said stop and that's when I stopped'. He said: 'She said I feel like having sex again and I said "Yes, I feel like having sex with you as well again but there is no condom". 'She was romancing me, touching and kissing, and I said no, I do not want to do that because there is no condom. 'She started kissing me again and then I penetrated her. I believed 100 per cent it was consensual. 'Then she said stop and that's when I stopped. There were three seconds of penetration.' The court heard how the pair met at The Regal pub in Cambridge on June 9 last year . The court heard how she phoned police later that afternoon and Wilson was arrested . The court heard how the pair met at The Regal pub in Cambridge on June 9 last year and took a taxi back to Wilson's shared house in the city at 2am. She then spent most of the evening in bed with the defendant before leaving the property at around 6am.
The court heard how she phoned police later that afternoon and Wilson was arrested. Caroline Allison, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution say that she had made it perfectly clear in plain straight-forward language that the situation was no condom, no sex and that nothing had happened in the intervening period that would invite a reasonable belief that she was indeed consenting to unprotected sex.' Wilson, of Cambridge, has pleaded not guilty to rape after claiming he stopped on the third time the woman said no. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 05:04 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 6 June 2013 . The world's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a Neanderthal who lived around 130,000 years ago. Scientists at the University of Kansas took X-rays of the inch-long rib fragments - first found in the Krapina rock shelters of Croatia - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing. Following CT scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft-tissue tumour known in modern-day patients as fibrous dysplasia. Scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This condition is called fibrous dysplasia . Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or . swelling of the bone. Although it can occur in any part of the . skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper . arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. The disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood. Males and females of any race are equally affected. The bones studied by Kansas university anthropologist David Frayer and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in Croatia. The site, known as the Krapina rock shelter, in the north of the country held more than 900 Neanderthal bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago. Frayer wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died.
Many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in Croatia had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks. This scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in Pennsylvania has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had 'eaten away' the bone . The detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been 'eaten away' These marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals. Researchers . from the University of Pennsylvania took X-rays of the bones during the . 1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs. One of the inch-long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were 'burned out' in the X-ray images. 'Burned out' sections of X-rays suggest over exposure, and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment. Frayer used these images as a guide to take new, higher-resolution X-rays of the specimens. His team also scanned the bones using high-resolution microCT scanners that doctors currently use on modern-day patients. The microCT scan found that the 'spongy bone' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This type of tumour is seen in modern-day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton, it is most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. Frayer reported the findings in the journal PLOS ONE. He told LiveScience: 'People .
of that time didn't live as long as they did today; plus, there weren't . very many of them compared to the Egyptians and people today. 'Finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers, is - . I don't know if I want to say "lucky" - but there isn't a lot of . evidence for it.' It was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up, but now experts believe the rocky African landscape played a far more significant role . Describing the type of tumour that was found, Frayer added: 'They range all the way from being totally benign, where you wouldn’t . recognize them, to being extremely painful. 'The size . of this one, and the bulging of it, probably caused the individual . pain.' Previously the earliest known tumours were found in Egyptian mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly. A study released earlier this month discovered that Neanderthals lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt. The . results showed that . modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and Neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated. Neanderthals had larger eyes than Homo sapiens but did not develop brain power in the same way. This meant that Homo sapiens were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive Neanderthals who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs . Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research. Chemical . analysis of a neanderthal child's tooth reveal it was reared on . mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same . period coupled with solid food. The . change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by . looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar .
compound to calcium - in teeth enamel. This . enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of . Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 . year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago. The . brains of Neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but . more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger . bodies. Researchers from the University of York additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change. The study found that our upright gait may . have its origins in the rugged landscape of East and South Africa which . was shaped during the Pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic . plates. Hominins, human's early ancestors, would . have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because . it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey. But it also required . more upright scrambling and climbing gaits, prompting the emergence of . bipedalism.
(CNN) -- There's a whole world of people out there, and boy, are they pissed off. The anonymity of the Internet encourages online ranting, from election-season tirades to mockery of celebrities. On political blogs, the invective flies. Posters respond to the latest celebrity gossip with mockery or worse. Sports fans set up Web sites with names that begin with "fire," hoping coaches, athletic directors and sportscasters lose their jobs. And though there are any number of bloggers and commenters who attempt to keep their postings and responses on a civil level, all too often interactive Web sites descend into ad hominem attacks, insults and plain old name-calling. Indeed, there are even whole sites devoted to venting, such as justrage.com (one screed there was titled, "I don't give a flying f***, so f*** you") and mybiggestcomplaint.com. This is not a world Emily Post would want to be caught in after dark. "The Internet can be a great tool," said Sara Black, a professor of health studies at St. Joseph's University who takes a particular interest in online bullying. "Like any tool, it can also be misused." See examples of Internet anger » . One reason for the vitriol that emerges on the Web, experts say, is the anonymity the Internet provides. Commenters seldom use their real names, and even if they do, the chance for retaliation is slim. "In the [pre-Internet era], you had to take ownership [of your remarks]. Now there's a perception of anonymity," said Lesley Withers, a professor of communication at Central Michigan University. "People think what they say won't have repercussions, and they don't think they have to soften their comments."
Contrast that with a face-to-face conversation, or even a phone conversation, where you can judge people's moods from facial movements or vocal inflections, observes University of Texas psychology professor Art Markman. iReport.com: Second Life avatars grapple with reduced nonverbal communication . "It's hard to be aggressive when you're face to face," he said. Moreover, he points out, aggression often carries a subtext of power. "A lot of times, real anger is an attempt to get control over a situation where the person doesn't usually have it," he said. In that respect, comments to blog posts are attempts to strike back. Those power games are innately grasped by children and teens, with schools serving as a perennial social laboratory. Cheryl Dellasega, a Penn State women's studies professor, ticks off hypothetical examples that could have come straight from the scripts to "Mean Girls" or "Heathers." "Girls who are getting teased come home and let their [aggressors] have it by putting something on their blog and starting a rumor campaign," she said. And instead of rumors simply making the rounds among peer groups -- which can be bad enough -- "they go out to a much bigger group, a worldwide group. The impact is devastating, and it's as easy as clicking a button." "Kids don't realize that one post can destroy somebody's life forever," she added. Indeed, such incidents have made headlines. In 2006, 13-year-old Megan Meier committed suicide after becoming attracted to a boy on MySpace who then turned on her. The boy turned out to be a hoax created by a neighbor family that included a former friend of Meier's.
In August, The New York Times Magazine did a story about trolls, some barely out of their teens, who antagonize others for the sake of "lulz": "Lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2,000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh," one ex-troll told the publication. Adults aren't immune by any means. A Japanese woman, angry at her online "husband," killed his avatar after he divorced her. A South Korean actress committed suicide after being harassed by online rumors following a divorce. Celebrity gossip sites are full of snarky comments about stars; reaction from readers is often brutal, turning the story into the online equivalent of a pile-on. Markman is quick to observe that he doesn't believe there's more anger out there. But, he said, "there are more ways of expressing it on the Internet." "We've all had interactions with unpleasant people, but we don't confront them. We take it out elsewhere," he said. "What the Internet has created is groups of people where there are no repercussions with being too aggressive." Indeed, though electronically transmitted anger has parallels throughout human history -- the bitter letter, the village gossip -- the speed at which it travels, and the number of people who may come in contact with it, is something new, says St. Joseph's Black. "[Electronic] media can increase potential for violence in a number of ways," she said in an e-mail interview. "First, it introduces ideas (good and bad) that people may not have come up with on their own. Second, it is easier to depersonalize the victim, facilitating perpetration. Third, aggressive behaviors may be reinforced with points, attention or status, especially in games." Withers has seen that first hand.
She teaches a course on the "dark side of communication" at Central Michigan, involving "the mean or evil things we do on a day-to-day basis," as she describes it: cheating, for example, or lying. As part of the course, several of her students work on a collaborative project with students at other schools, and they come together in Second Life, the virtual reality environment. If someone isn't pulling his or her weight, says Withers, others can be harsh in their judgments -- harsher than in real life, because the anger is expressed at the person's avatar. Sidebar: Dealing with anger in Second Life . Which led at least one of Withers' students to forget that the avatar was attached to a real person. "One student went off on another student and she was sitting in the classroom a few rows behind him," she said. "He knew she was there, but didn't -- there was that distancing." iReport.com: Residents of virtual worlds deal with drama, stress . Is there a way to restore civility to the Internet? Among children and teenagers, say Dellasega and Black, it's up to parents to exercise control. "I think parents need to take responsibility," Dellasega said. "They give kids computers and leave them alone. When a child is 8 or 9, the computer should be in a public place. Kids should understand that using a computer is a privilege, not a right." Schools can also play a role, she says. Black adds that parents should set clear rules on behavior and build empathy in their kids by having them reach out to those who are different. As for adults, human nature dictates that people will always lash out at others, whether it's over a perceived insult or simply because of a power differential. Web sites may ban the worst offenders, but they'll almost always pop up elsewhere, using a different name, e-mail address or even computer.
"Some people are just bitter and angry," said psychiatrist Dr. Terry Eagan, medical director of the Moonview Sanctuary in Santa Monica, California. "Sometimes, they're against everyone, other times against a specific group. That person can get really stimulated and can say all sorts of horrible things. But I don't think it's not like they didn't exist before." Whether the problem will get control of us, or we will get control of the problem, is in the way we face up to it, he says. Anger, he says, is rolled up with anxiety and fear, and nothing creates more fear like a lack of understanding. "I tell patients that I'd rather know everything about people; information is powerful," he said. "When the climate of the world is more fear-based, it permeates everything."
By . Damien Gayle . Edging slowly out of her dry dock at Barrow-in-Furness, this is the third of the Astute class submarines that will take the Royal Navy's fighting capabilities into the 21st Century. The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion but, along with its sisters, sets a new standard in weapons load and stealth. Armed with both Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War focus on anti-submarine warfare to a concept of 'Maritime Contributions to Joint Operations'. Scroll down for video . Artful, the third highly-complex Astute class submarine designed and built by BAE Systems for the Royal Navy, appears outside her construction hall for the first time . Facts and stats: Armed with Spearfish torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War anti-submarine warfare . The Tomahawk cruise missiles she will carry are claimed to have an accuracy of just a few metres over a range of within 1,240 miles, giving Artful the ability to support ground forces anywhere in the world. More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel's sonar signature, meaning she slips through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin. Yet her sonar is said to be so powerful it can detect ships leaving harbour in New York City from a listening point below the waters of the English Channel, 3,000 nautical miles away. Artful got her toes wet for the first time yesterday, more than 24 hours after she first emerged from the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
She was officially named last September by Amanda, Lady Zambellas, wife of the Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas. Stealth: More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask Artful's sonar signature, meaning she will slip through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin . Hunter: Yet her sonar is so powerful it can detect ships from 3,000 nautical miles away - equivalent to the distance between the English Channel and New York . Expensive: The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion . Stuart Godden, Astute Programme Director for BAE Systems, said: 'The launch of Artful is another significant step forward in the Astute programme. 'Building on past experiences we’ve been able to launch her in the most advanced state of construction of any submarine to be built in Barrow. This allows us to now fully concentrate on the test and commissioning activities required to get her to sea. 'Moving a submarine of this size from its build hall to the water is very challenging. It’s testament to the experience and careful planning of the team involved that Artful is now ready for the next phase in her programme. 'Witnessing a submarine move out of the hall and be readied for launch is truly inspiring and a source of great pride to the thousands who have played a part in getting Artful to this stage.' Artful will now undergo a series of . complex tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs BAE Systems’ site for sea trials. Natural habitat: Artful got her toes wet for the first time yesterday, 24 hours emerging from the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria .
Final checks: Artful will now undergo a series of tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs BAE Systems' site for sea trials . The Ministry of Defence’s Director Submarines, Rear Admiral Mike Wareham, said: 'The Astute programme is making real progress and the sight of the third submarine afloat in the water is a reflection of the hard work of both the MOD and industry. 'The launch of this submarine brings it a step closer to entering into service where it will provide a key capability for the Royal Navy and an essential component of the Submarine Service into the future.' BAE Systems, the prime contractor in the Astute programme, is the UK's only designer and builder of nuclear powered submarines - one of the most complex engineering programmes in the world today. The first two submarines in the Astute class – HMS Astute and HMS Ambush – have now been handed over to the UK Royal Navy, while the remaining five are in various stages of construction.
Cleaning House Pope Francis named Boston’s Cardinal O’Malley, a psychotherapist, and four women—one of them raped by a priest—to deal with child abuse in the Catholic Church. Some things are worth the wait. At least that is the hope when it comes to Pope Francis’s surprisingly well-rounded new commission appointed to deal with the ongoing priest sex abuse problem in the global Catholic Church. The commission, announced Saturday by the Holy See press office, is made up of four women, one of whom is a victim of sex abuse by a priest, and four men – only three of whom are clerics. The highest-ranking church official on the commission is Cardinal Sean O’Malley who was a front-runner in the papal conclave that finally elected Pope Francis a year ago. The other clerics are an Argentine priest Pope Francis shepherded through the Jesuit ranks in his home country and a German priest who is also a licensed psychotherapist. According to Vatican spokesperson Father Thomas Rosica, the Argentine, Humberto Miguel Yáñez, is a professor of moral theology who spearheaded the Symposium on the Sex Abuse of Minors two years ago. German Hans Zollner leads the Centre for Child Protection at the Institute of Psychology of the Pontifical Gregorian University. The more surprising members of the group are the female members. Marie Collins is a married Irish woman who was raped at the age of 13 by a priest. She is an activist for child safety within the Catholic Church and has been vocal about how she was snubbed by her local parish and told to “protect the priest’s good name” when she accused him. Francis also appointed noted French psychologist Catherine Bonnet, who has written extensively about child sex abuse, and Baroness Sheila Hollins from the United Kingdom who is an expert in mental health.
In what is seen as a nod to the late Pope John Paul II, Francis also named the Polish ambassador to the Holy See, Hanna Suchocka, who is a constitutional law professor and former prime minister of Poland and the winner of several awards for her work on human rights. The group’s final member is Italian canon law professor Claudio Papale, who specializes in crimes against morality. The Vatican was quick to point out that Papale, Collins and Hollins are all married. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that the announcement of the new commission, coming after Friday’s highly publicized prayer vigil against organized crime and before the beginning of Easter celebrations was by design. “Pope Francis has made clear that the Church must hold the protection of minors amongst her highest priorities,” Lombardi said in a statement. “This initial group is now called to work expeditiously to assist in several tasks, including: participating in the deliberations concerning the Commission’s final structure; describing the scope of its responsibilities; and developing the names of additional candidates, especially from other continents and countries, who can offer service to the Commission.” The announcement follows stark criticism of Pope Francis for dragging his heels on this extremely controversial issue. Writing in the Boston Globe, Vatican expert John Allen points out an interview Francis gave to an Italian newspaper in which he actually defended the church’s record on abuse, saying the Catholic Church “is perhaps the lone public institution to have moved with transparency and responsibility . . . yet the church is the only one to have been attacked.” The comment prompted an angry response from victims and a document dump by the group Bishop Accountability, which tracks errant bishops who shuffle predator priests from parish to parish for their protection. The group cited Francis’s record in five alleged abuse cases when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.
According to the database, “he released no documents, no names of accused priests, no tallies of accused priests, no policy for handling abuse, not even an apology to victims.” Cardinal Sean O'Malley was among eight people, including four women, named by the pope to a panel to guide the Vatican’s anti-abuse inquiries. Pope Francis on Saturday named Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley of Boston and seven other figures with reputations as reformers to guide a new Vatican antiabuse commission, a move intended to demonstrate resolve about confronting the child sexual abuse scandals that have rocked Catholicism. O’Malley, already the lone American on the pope’s “G8” council of cardinal advisers, is also the lone American among the commission members announced Saturday. O’Malley’s new responsibility is not a full-time position, meaning he will not move to Rome and will continue to serve as the archbishop of Boston. Advertisement The lineup for the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors also includes Irish laywoman Marie Collins, who has said she was raped at the age of 13 by a hospital chaplain. When she tried to report the abuse years later, she said, she was told by church officials that “protecting the good name” of the priest was more important than remedying a “historical” wrong. Collins has acquired an international reputation as a campaigner for the rights of abuse victims. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The panel’s members come from eight countries, with seven from Europe or the United States.
Though early reaction suggests some critics of the church’s response to the abuse scandals see the announcement as a public relations exercise, a Vatican spokesman said it reflects the late Pope John Paul II’s statement that “there is no place in the priesthood or religious life for those who would harm the young.” In a sign of personal interest, Pope Francis also named a fellow Argentine and Jesuit priest, the Rev. Humberto Miguel Yáñez, who was received by the future pope into the Jesuit order in 1975 and who studied under him at an Argentine Jesuit college. He is seen as having direct access to the pontiff. Advertisement The other members announced Saturday are: ■ The Rev. Hans Zollner, a German Jesuit and the academic vice rector of the Gregorian University in Rome and head of its Institute of Psychology. Zollner coordinated a major antiabuse conference in Rome in 2012 called “Toward Healing and Renewal.” ■ Hanna Suchocka, a former prime minister of Poland and Poland’s former ambassador to the Vatican. ■ Claudio Papale, an Italian lay expert on church law who teaches at Rome’s Pontifical Urbaniana University. ■ Catherine Bonnet, a French child psychologist who has written widely on the effects of sexual abuse and exploitation on children. ■ Baroness Sheila Hollins, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and current president of the British Medical Association who has frequently consulted on child development issues in the United Kingdom. People not authorized to speak on the record told the Globe that Francis chose not to issue a legal document providing a structure and mandate for the new commission, preferring to allow the people he has put in charge to work out those details.
The initial group will also make recommendations to the pope for additional members “from various geographical regions of the world.” While plans originally called for the antiabuse body to be housed within the Vatican’s powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Saturday’s announcement suggests it will have a more independent profile reporting directly to the pope. The announcement comes at a time when Francis had been facing mounting criticism for a perceived blind spot on the abuse scandals. In early March, the pontiff gave an interview to an Italian newspaper in which he seemed defensive about criticism of the church’s record, saying it “is perhaps the lone public institution to have moved with transparency and responsibility . . . yet the church is the only one to have been attacked.” Just days later, the American advocacy group BishopAccountability.org released records purporting to show that the future pope had failed to act aggressively on five cases involving priests accused of abuse in Argentina, though only one of those priests was actually ever under his direct authority. People who were not authorized to speak on the record said Francis took a personal interest in the makeup of the antiabuse commission, phoning subordinates in the Vatican in order to work out the timing of the announcement. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, the main American advocacy group for victims, released a statement Saturday welcoming the choice of Collins but voicing suspicion that the commission “will be more about public relations than real change.” “Catholic officials have concealed child sex crimes for centuries and still are concealing child sex crimes,” the statement said.
“They do not need yet another ‘Study Commission.’ The pope must take strong steps right now to protect kids, expose predators, discipline enablers, and uncover cover-ups.” In part, Francis’ choice of O’Malley may reflect that he is the American cardinal closest to the pope, being the only one to have stayed in Francis’ residence in Buenos Aires before his election. In part, however, it also probably reflects that the Boston prelate has one of the most complete résumés of any senior church official in dealing with the abuse crisis. His experience began in the Fall River, Mass., diocese in 1992, where he took over amid a scandal centering on the Rev. James Porter, who was convicted of molesting 28 children and confessed to abusing at least 100 over a 30-year period. In 2002, O’Malley moved to Palm Beach, Fla., where he followed two different bishops who resigned after acknowledging offenses against minors. One year later, O’Malley succeeded the controversial Cardinal Bernard Law in Boston, eventually settling more than 100 abuse claims against the archdiocese and touting a “zero-tolerance” policy. He has led penitential liturgies apologizing to abuse victims around the world and called for new procedures to hold bishops accountable if they fail to respond aggressively to abuse claims. While SNAP calls O’Malley’s record, including his refusal to issue a complete list of names of accused Boston priests, “deeply flawed,” the archdiocese on his watch has gone from the global epicenter of the abuse crisis to a venue seen in many Catholic circles as an example of essentially successful recovery. O’Malley declined a Globe request to speak about his role on the commission beyond what was in the Vatican announcement.
In an early February interview with the Globe, however, O’Malley discussed the commission and Francis’ broader approach to the abuse crisis. “He’s certainly aware of how serious this issue is,” O’Malley said of the new pope at that time. “I don’t think he has a plan yet for how to deal with it.” O’Malley suggested that one important function of the new commission might be working with national-level conferences of bishops around the world to ensure that they have all implemented antiabuse guidelines. The aim of that effort, he said, is “to have some clarity about what the expectations are throughout the world.” O’Malley also suggested that the commission might be able to make progress on what many critics charge is the most serious piece of unfinished business from the crisis, which is holding bishops accountable if they fail to apply the church’s official “zero-tolerance” policy. Critics point, for instance, to Bishop Robert Finn of Kansas City, Mo., who was found guilty in September 2012 of a misdemeanor charge of failure to report a priest accused of abuse and yet remains in office. Finn was acquitted of a second charge. “I hope this commission will help the church develop protocols, so there will be a very clear path to follow” in such cases, O’Malley said. He added that it would likely not be the commission’s job to investigate individual cases, but rather to help develop procedures the pope can apply when charges arise that a bishop has failed to respond appropriately. The new commission is expected to meet two or three times a year, with members staying in touch by phone and e-mail in the meantime.
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis named the initial members of a commission to advise him on sex abuse policy Saturday, signaling an openness to reach beyond church officials to plot the commission's course and priorities: Half of the members are women, and one was assaulted by a priest as a child. The eight members were announced after Francis came under fire from victims' groups for a perceived lack of attention to the abuse scandal, which has seriously damaged the Catholic Church's reputation around the world and cost dioceses and religious orders billions of dollars in legal fees and settlements. The Vatican in December announced that Francis would create the commission to advise the church on best policies to protect children, train church personnel and keep abusers out of the clergy. But no details had been released until Saturday and it remains unknown if the commission will deal with the critical issue of disciplining bishops who cover up for abusers. In a statement, the Vatican hinted that it might, saying the commission would look into both "civil and canonical duties and responsibilities" for church personnel. Canon law does provide for sanctions if a bishop is negligent in carrying out his duties, but such punishments have never been imposed on a bishop for failing to report a pedophile priest to police. The eight inaugural members include Marie Collins, who was assaulted as a 13-year-old by a hospital chaplain in her native Ireland and has gone on to become a prominent campaigner for accountability in the church. Also named was Cardinal Sean O'Malley, one of Francis' key advisers and the archbishop of Boston, where the U.S. scandal erupted in 2002. Two other members are professors at Rome's Jesuit Pontifical Gregorian University, which in 2012 hosted a seminar for bishops from around the world to educate them on best practices to protect children. Several participants from that conference are now founding members of Francis' commission, including Baroness Sheila Hollins, a British psychiatrist.
During that 2012 conference, Collins told the bishops of her own ordeal, of the hospitalizations, anxiety and depression she endured after Irish church authorities didn't believe her when she reported her attacker, and then blamed her for the assault. "I was treated as someone with an agenda against the church, the police investigation was obstructed and the laity misled. I was distraught," Collins said at the time, calling for bishops to be held accountable when they don't report abusers to law enforcement. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the institution of the commission was evidence that Francis believed "the church must hold the protection of minors among her highest priorities." But in a March 5 interview with Corriere della Sera, Francis appeared defensive about the issue, complaining that the church had been unfairly attacked. He acknowledged the "profound" wounds abuse leaves and credited Pope Benedict XVI with turning the church around. Benedict in 2001 took over handling abuse cases because bishops were moving pedophiles around rather than punishing them. In his final two years as pope he defrocked nearly 400 abusive priests. But Francis then added: "The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. No one has done more. And yet the church is the only one that has been attacked." Collins' appointment to the panel was hailed by Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who has clashed both with the Vatican and his fellow bishops in demanding greater accountability and honesty about abuse. SNAP, the main U.S. victim's group also praised her inclusion but said the pope doesn't need another study panel, he just needs to oust complicit bishops. "He's had more than a year to defrock, demote, discipline or denounce even one of them," said SNAP's outreach director Barbara Dorris in a statement. "But, just like his predecessors, he refuses to take this simple but crucial step toward justice, healing and prevention."
The initial group named Saturday will define the scope, statutes and priorities of the commission and propose other members to better reflect the church's geographic diversity. Other members include: —Catherine Bonnet, a French consultant in child and adolescent psychiatry. —Claudio Papale, an Italian canon lawyer and official of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which handles sex abuse cases. —Poland's recently departed longtime ambassador to the Vatican, Hanna Suchocka, a constitutional lawyer. —The Rev. Humberto Miguel Yanez, an Argentine Jesuit who studied with Francis as a seminarian and currently is head of moral theology at the Gregorian. —The Rev. Hans Zollner, the vice-rector of the Gregorian, a Jesuit psychologist and psychotherapist who organized the Gregorian seminar and also serves on the German government's roundtable on child abuse. ___ Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield
The video shows the bird briefly lifting the child in a Montreal park before dropping him unharmed. Nearly 17 million people have watched the video on YouTube in three days. But a digital training centre in Montreal later told the BBC that the clip was made by its students as part of a degree course. Suzanne Guevremont, director of the Centre NAD, said the clip had been produced by four students who "had an idea of making something believable". The students - who were doing a degree in 3D animation and digital design - had come up with the idea after a brainstorming session, completing the project in seven weeks, she said. "It's a challenge they wanted to test their skills," Ms Guevremont said. She added that the bird and the child seen being snatched were all computer generated imagery (CGI), and the only real things in the video were the park, the boy (after being dropped on the ground) and his father comforting him. The CGI was dropped into real footage to create the effect. Some YouTube and Twitter users expressed doubts about the authenticity of the clip soon after it was posted online on 18 December.

Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a ‘sugar daddy’ lover he met when he was just 17. The Strictly Come Dancing judge said the 43-year-old man paid for his dance lessons and helped kick-start his television career in return for ‘doing the dirty’. Revel Horwood, known for his acerbic comments on the BBC1 show, said the nature of the relationship meant he had previously been described by some as a ‘rent boy’. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover he met when he was just 17. Right, the dancer at 18 years old . The dancer made the revelations last night at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he also disclosed he is to undergo hip surgery in two weeks’ time. In a wide-ranging interview, he also discussed how celebrities found it uncomfortable to be ‘flung about by dancers’ on the popular show. Discussing his relationship with the older man, Revel Horwood, 48, said he was approached while he was living in his native Australia as a teenager. Describing him as ‘Mr X’ for legal reasons, Revel Horwood said: ‘It was this man who was 43 and I was 17. ‘He said I will pay for your classes but you come away with me and we do the dirty.
‘I suppose that could be compared to a lady getting engaged and getting a great big sparkling Tiffany ring – and then breaking off the engagement but keeping the ring.’ At the time, Revel Horwood had left school and was training as a chef, but said he ‘hated’ it, adding that Mr X ‘saved me from that’. Revel Horwood has become known for his acerbic comments on BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing . However, Revel Horwood did not divulge any further details of the relationship and quickly moved on to other subjects. Talking about his imminent hip surgery, Revel Horwood said it would clash with filming for the current series. He said: ‘I’m going in at six o’clock in the morning on Sunday after filming Saturday night live. ‘I will be watching myself on the telly . on Sunday night [the results show screened on Sunday is filmed on . Saturday night] with my old hip and I’ll have a new one in.’ He added: . ‘I will be made of titanium and I can’t wait, darling.’ Asked whether he would be fit to return to the show the following week, he said he might have to face the cameras and the audience in a wheelchair, adding: ‘A fabulous glittery one I hope.’ He also revealed how celebrities found it difficult being ‘manhandled’. ‘Sometimes you throw a girl up and she will fart and come back down,’ he joked. In his latest book, Tales From the Dance Floor, Revel Horwood wrote about how fellow Strictly judge Darcey Bussell breaks wind on set.
Last night he said he had not warned her before the book was published – and the first thing she said to him when she saw him after reading it was, ‘Fart?’ But he added she had taken it well and spent the entire night’s filming leaning to one side and pretending to break wind. ‘We were in stitches,’ he said.
There can't be many days in the year when pedestrians, cyclists - and skateboarders - reign supreme on some of Israel's busiest roads. In a scene which could have come straight from a movie, there isn't a car in sight as families, teenagers and Rabbis freely roam the empty streets. On any other day, you might expect the highways in and around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to be teeming with traffic, choking fumes rising above the cityscape. Deserted: These youngsters on a bike and a skateboard take advantage of the empty streets of Jerusalem during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur . Pedestrians crossing: An Israeli family takes a stroll on a deserted highway in Tel Aviv . Nice day for it: Two Orthodox Jewish men walk down a road surrounded by cyclists . But thanks to the holiest Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur the streets are empty and the air is clear, allowing many to enjoy a rare car-free day. Yom Kippur - or Day of Atonement - is the holiest of Jewish holidays, when observant Jews atone for sins of the last year. Israel came to a standstill for 24 hours during the holiday, in which Jews fast and Israelis are prohibited from driving their cars. As these incredible pictures show, youths on skateboards and bikes, joggers - and even Orthodox Jewish men - take to the tarmac making some of Israel's busiest cities look like ghost towns. Ghost town: There can't be many days in the year when boys on BMX bikes rule the roads .

Police and Jewish Israeli officials were not available for comment during the Yom Kippur fast day and a local Muslim community leader in Jaffa quoted in the article did not reply when contacted. Jaffa is the ancient part of Tel Aviv which has a mixed Arab and Jewish population. On Monday, a mosque in a Bedouin village in northern Israel was set on fire and graffiti sprayed on its walls in an attack authorities have blamed on hard-line Jewish settlers. The torching drew broad condemnation from top Israeli leaders and President Shimon Peres and the country's chief rabbis also visited the scene to calm tensions. In 2005 a Jewish couple was charged for throwing a pig's head into a Tel Aviv mosque in an attempt to derail Israel's then pullout from the Gaza Strip which went ahead in August of that year. In 2008 riots erupted in the coastal city of Acre in northern Israel when Jews accosted an Arab man who drove his car into a predominantly Jewish neighborhood during Yom Kippur when all traffic halts and the country shuts down for 24 hours.

The 26-year-old collided with Black Cats midfielder Wahbi Khazri. "It is dislocated so he is out for several weeks," said United boss Louis van Gaal after Saturday's game. Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Ashley Young, Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones and Guillermo Varela are out - leaving Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Donald Love as the club's only fit full-backs. Love, 21, who was on loan at Wigan earlier this season, came off the bench during the Premier League game to make his first-team debut. Saturday was also the first time he had featured in United's first-team squad. Borthwick-Jackson, 19, made his first-team debut in November. "We don't have any more full-backs in this club," added Van Gaal. "I have to line up a 13-year-old guy or someone like that." Darmian joined United from Italian side Torino last summer and started at right-back against Sunderland.
Fulham had the better of the first half with Aboubakar Kamara's going close and Ibrahima Cisse striking the base of the post with a drive from 25 yards. David Button saved one-on-one from Chris Wood before Leeds' Felix Wiedwald made a similar stop from Sone Aluko. Kalvin Phillips and Wood missed late chances for Leeds as the sides played out a fifth successive league draw. Leeds and Fulham had drawn their previous four league games by a 1-1 scoreline, but Wood and Aluko both spurned great chances for their sides in a stalemate. The visitors dominated the opening stages, but could not beat Rob Green's replacement Wiedwald in goal as Stefan Johansen, Kamara and Cisse were all off target. Leeds responded after the break but Phillips fired wide and Wood could not get on the end of a late Stuart Dallas cross, as Thomas Christiansen's side drew a blank for the second time in four days. Leeds boss Thomas Christiansen: "It's another clean sheet and I believe the team played a very good game. "We have to recognise that we played against one of the best teams in this league. They started very well and we were not fast enough. "At the end of the first half we controlled the game a bit more and in the second we deserved more. "We need to be a bit more dangerous up front but at the end I'm satisfied with that result." Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: "We showed different faces. "We opened the game very well and created chances but they pressed us better at the start of the second half and the result was fair at the end. "It's positive that we haven't lost any games but it's a bad thing we haven't won any games in the start of the season." Match ends, Leeds United 0, Fulham 0.

Veteran TV star Cilla Black joined the euthanasia debate last night, admitting she still thinks 75 is ‘a good age to go’. ‘I still think that way,’ the 71-year-old Blind Date presenter told the Daily Mirror. ‘If things are starting to drop off – like the hearing – and I’ve got twinges in the morning, I do think that.’ Her own mother suffered from the progressive bone disease osteoporosis and endured a slow and painful end. ‘She said to me once, “I’m trying to die but I can’t”, oh God it was heart breaking. The brain was great but the body wasn’t,’ she said. ‘Eventually when she did die she was 84, it wasn’t a good experience. I think that’s what has made me feel like this. ‘My biggest fear is going like that when I can’t control my body.’ However, the mother-of-three, who also has two grandsons, said that although she agreed with clinics like Dignitas in Switzerland, where people can end their own lives, she didn’t plan to take matters into her own hands. She added: ‘I agree with Dignitas, but I couldn’t be the one to administer the poison that kills me. I know I couldn’t commit suicide. I’m too much of a coward, I couldn’t do it. I’d rather somebody make that decision for me.’ Best known for presenting Blind Date from 1985 to 2003, Miss Black has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances.
She had been due to star in a BBC sitcom with chat show host Paul O’Grady but the project was axed amid concerns she would be unable to stand the long filming hours. Miss Black began her career more than 50 years ago as a singer, and had a string of top ten hits in the Sixties and Seventies. Miss Black, pictured here making her last appearance on Blind Date in 2003. She has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances . After a brief time as a comedy actress, she became a TV presenter in the 1980s. Her husband Bobby Willis, who died in 1999 from cancer, was her manager for much of her career. On Sunday she will collect a TV BAFTA special award in recognition of her outstanding contribution to entertainment. She will receive the prize at the event - officially called the Arqiva British Academy Television Awards - on May 18 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London and it will also be broadcast by BBC1. It coincides with a new biopic of her life, starring actress Sheridan Smith. The ITV drama from Jeff Pope will ‘capture the essence of 1960s Liverpool’. It will also focus on how Black’s friendship with Ringo Starr brought her to the attention of Beatles' manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin.
(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund moved a big step closer to a first German Bundesliga title in nine years on Saturday with a historic 3-1 victory over defending champions Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. Jurgen Klopp's team moved 13 points clear of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who visit Werder Bremen on Sunday, and 16 ahead of Bayern -- who lost at home to Dortmund for the first time in 20 years. Louis van Gaal's team dropped to fourth after the home defeat, occupying Germany's final Champions League position for next season with 10 rounds to play. Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios opened the scoring in the ninth minute with his 11th goal of the season after Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger lost posesssion to Kevin Grosskreutz, who threaded a perfect pass into the penalty area. Welcome win for struggling Wolfsburg . Brazilian defender Luis Gustavo equalized seven minutes later with his first goal for Bayern since arriving from Hoffenheim in January, sidefooting in a volley from Franck Ribery's corner. Dortmund immediately went back in front through a wonderful effort from Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin, who curled a 20-yard left-foot shot past goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. Bundesliga top scorer Mario Gomez thought he had leveled again in the 20th minute, but the striker was ruled to be offside. Former Bayern defender Mats Hummels sealed the Westphalian team's victory with a header from Mario Gotze's corner on the hour mark. With 15 minutes left, Dortmund's 22-year-old Australian keeper Mitchell Langerak capped a solid Bundesliga debut when he denied Germany international Gomez from close range. Hanover claimed third place after central defender Christian Schulz's last-gasp header was enough to see off St. Pauli.
The 27-year-old converted from Portuguese winger Sergio Pinto's 87th-minute corner to put Mirko Slomka's team two points ahead of Bayern,. Mainz remained in fifth place after also needing a late goal to snatch all three points away to Hoffenheim. Former Austria midfielder Andreas Ivanschitz put the visitors in front before his compatriot David Alaba looked to have rescued a draw for ninth-placed Hoffenheim in the 84th minute. But with just four minutes left, 30-year-old Colombian midfielder Elkin Soto secured victory for Thomas Tuchel's Mainz with his second league goal of the season. Germany international Lukas Podolski scored an 88th-minute winner to help Cologne beat SC Freiburg and climb into 11th position, eight points behind their opponents. Sixth-placed Hamburg could only manage a 1-1 draw away to relegation-threatened Kaiserslautern. Marco Kurz's Kaiserslautern drew first blood through Adam Hlousek's first-half goal, but Marcell Jansen's leveler for Armin Veh's Hamburg left the home team in 15th position and above the relegation play-off place on goal difference. Schalke's disappointing Bundesliga season continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Nuremberg. Nuremberg, currently eighth in the table, took the lead through Jens Hegeler, only for former Real Madrid and Spain striker Raul to equalize after 52 minutes.
KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Lawmakers in Nepal will vote Saturday to pick the country's first president since it became a republic. Nepal became a republic after the deposal of King Gyanendra Shah earlier this year. The country's newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished a 239-year monarchy following elections in April. But with no one party winning a majority of the seats, it is unclear who may become president. The position is largely ceremonial. But a president will swear in whoever is picked as the new prime minister. The three main political parties continued to negotiate over whom to name president. The Nepali Congress wants outgoing prime minister and party president Girija Prasad Koirala for the position. The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) wants its leader. But the Maoists -- which won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority -- do not favor either of the two men. They want a non-political figure as president.

A two-year-old boy never woke from his routine afternoon nap after being struck down by a mysterious virus, an inquest heard. Fit and healthy Elliot Kerslake is thought to have had a seizure from swelling of his brain as he suffered from an everyday cold. Hours earlier, Elliot had been showing off a dance routine for his sister's friends and cheering on his big brother Oliver, 12, at a football match. Elliot Kerslake, two, from Leeds, died in his sleep from a swelling to his brain caused by a mystery virus. Doctors have said there is 'nothing that could have saved him' His parents John and Andrea Kerslake wept as a coroner heard their written evidence about his sudden death on March 3, 2013. Mrs Kerslake, 45, said Elliot had been put down for his post-lunch nap at 2pm, and his sister found him dead three hours later. She told the coroner: 'I read him a Fireman Sam story as I put him down for an afternoon nap at 2pm just after his lunch. 'I told him I loved him and closed the curtains. Around that time John came home. I had left the door open and thirty minutes later I went back to check on him. 'He was lying on his tummy and making a little sobbing noise. I didn't think much of it as my two other children used to do the same when they were younger. 'I went in and said to him 'do you want to come down, sweetheart? ', but he didn't answer.' Mrs Kerslake said she was gardening as her husband watched football on TV when their daughter Emily, now 14, screamed. They found Elliot lying 'blue and floppy' and called an ambulance to their home in Shadwell, Leeds. An operator told John how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Mr Kerslake said: 'I continued fighting for him shouting "come on Elliot, you can do it", although I started to feel in my mind that he was gone.' Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain. Encephalitis usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, a headache and joint pain. More serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days, including: . Flu-like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency. In these circumstances, dial 999 immediately and request an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The parents accompanied their son in the ambulance but he was pronounced dead at Leeds General Infirmary. Leeds Coroners Court heard how the energetic youngster had been playing in the garden and entertaining his sister's friends who had been on a sleepover hours before his death. Mrs Kerslake said: 'Because of the other children staying, Elliot was in our bed the night before. 'We had read bedtime stories and in the morning we had a big hug. 'We chatted about what we would do that day and I dressed him in his blue dungarees with patterned socks, so I could grab hold of him if he ran off. 'He was so excited that morning and did a little dance for his sister's friends. 'We went to Starbucks to get a coffee and he ate normally. Then later we went to see his older brother Oliver play in a football match. 'I had to wipe his runny nose quite a bit that day, but didn't think much of it. 'My husband met us at the football field at lunchtime and I remember Elliot shouting "that's my daddy" and ran over to him to give him a cuddle.' She added that they left to go home for lunch, where Elliot was put down for the nap from which he never woke up.
Dr Richard Newton, a specialist in child neurology at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the cause of Elliot's death was most likely encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - caused by a virus which triggered a seizure as he slept. He said: 'This was a well little boy with a cold, essentially. He went down in the afternoon for a nap which is a routine almost every family in Britain bears witness to. 'I would suggest the cause of Elliot's death to be a seizure during his nap related to encephalitis, caused by an indeterminable virus. 'There are thousands, if not millions of types of virus and it would be impossible to determine which kind.' Hours before his death, Elliot had been in a good mood. He woke up to a hug with mother Andrea, 45 (right), performed a dance for his sister Emily (left) Dr Newton added there was 'nothing that could have saved Elliot'. He said: 'The events that afternoon were common events in every household. 'He ate his lunch, had his nap and must have died within that time. 'It's part of nature's rare unkindness.' Coroner David Hinchliff said the cause of death was, on the balance of probabilities, 'inflammation of the brain caused by an indeterminable viral infection'. He recorded a verdict of natural causes. Speaking before the hearing, Mr Kerslake said: 'Elliot loved life, he relished every new experience. He gave so much love to us, his brother and sister and all that knew him. 'It's comforting to know that his short life will impact positively on others during the months and years to come.'
It happened on Hearthcote Road in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, just before 02:00 BST. The Range Rover ended up embedded in the property. Derbyshire Police said no one was hurt but two people had to leave their home and have not been able to return due to fears over structural damage. An investigation has begun and police have appealed for witnesses. BBc reporter Martyn Williams, at the crash scene, said: "Part of the front wall has been completely demolished with bits of brick and wall everywhere. "One part of the wall has moved at least four or five metres from where it originally was." The road was closed for about an hour and no arrests were made. Police said one driver suffered minor injuries but did not need to go to hospital.
It follows the discovery of a suspicious object in the Millreagh housing development earlier on Wednesday night. Police are also at the scene of the alert.
(CNN) -- A deathbed photo of Gary Coleman appeared Wednesday on the cover of Globe Magazine, showing the actor's ex-wife staring into the camera next to the former child actor. The man named executor in Coleman's will accused Shannon Price of profiting from her ex-husband's death by selling the image to the tabloid, and suggested she is destined for the "life of a social and professional outcast." Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage in a Provo, Utah, hospital. Globe parent company American Media confirmed it bought the photo, but spokeswoman Samantha Trenk would not disclose how much was paid or who sold the image. A Utah judge appointed Dion Mial, Coleman's longtime friend and former manager, as special administrator of the estate while the will goes through the probate process. A will signed in 1999 named Mial as executor. Mial threatened to have Price, 24, arrested unless she returned property he said had been taken from Coleman's home since his death. She must also stay away from the Santaquin home where they lived together, Mial said. While Coleman was not believed wealthy when he died, his personal possessions may be valuable to collectors. "These items include, but are not limited to, numerous televisions and video game systems, a black 2005 Dodge pick-up truck (registered to Coleman), cargo trailer (registered to Coleman), model train sets, computers, telephones, musical instruments, and furnishings," Mial said. "It is our hope that Miss Price should immediately and respectfully comply with the court's order, so as to avoid the filing of criminal charges against her," Mial said.
Mial was unable to stop the Globe from publishing the death images, which he accused Price of peddling to tabloids in an "ongoing desperate attempt" to profit from his death. "These actions simply illuminate and magnify the truth that our gift of free will may, ultimately, relegate us to a long life of bondage and imprisonment that the life of a social and professional outcast, indeed, will bring," Mial said Wednesday. "May God bless Miss Price and her 'free will.'" A statement released by Price's publicist Monday did not deny Mial's accusation, but did say she needed money because she had helped Mial pay for a lawyer. "Dion, who claims to be a good friend of Gary, would know that Gary's only wishes were to make sure that Shannon would be OK after he was gone," the statement said. "So if Dion was a good friend he would be assisting Shannon, not taking all her money, to pay for his attorney and then use it to take everything from her."
A spa manager received third-degree burns when a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean an elderly woman's nails. Julia McKeown, who works at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was badly burned on her hands, arms, chest and stomach and had to spend three months in hospital having skin grafts after the accident. Today Blackpool Magistrate's Court heard Mrs McKeown, 38, also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The customer, 96-year-old Mary Heyworth, was unharmed. Julia McKeown (pictured, left) was burned on her hands, arms and chest after a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean a customer's fingernails . The accident happened when Mrs McKeown spilled the chemical on herself and the candle. Staff rushed to help her but she suffered third-degree burns and had to have skin grafts . The accident happened in January last year when Mrs McKeown spilled acetone on herself during a spa treatment in the pool area of the hotel. Mrs McKeown was engulfed in flames after the liquid also spilled on to a scented tea light candle which was being used in a decorative lantern. Staff rushed to help her and managed to put out the flames, but Mrs McKeown was already very badly burned. Michael Hayton QC, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Mc Keown the salon manager was using a pad soaked in acetone from a two and a half litre bottle. 'The bottle spilled and splashed on the beautician’s arms and body and the table.She and her clothing ignited from the naked flame of a tealight type of candle which was lit and placed in a open topped lantern. 'Staff went to her aid but she had to undergo extensive skin grafts some of them full depth.
'The local council investigated and found a a the hotel company failed in its duty to protect its employees.There was no training and no supervision when it came to using what is known to be a significantly hazardous product. 'The investigation showed there had been previous spillages of acetone and the company had been previously warned about health and safety issues.' The accident happened in January last year at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire . Fining Dalmeny Hotel Ltd £16,000 and ordering the company to pay £9,075 in costs, District Judge Joanne Hirst said: 'The woman suffered significant and horrific burns to her body. 'She has suffered a loss of self esteem as a result and her marriage has been affected, as has her social life. 'The hotel failed to heed earlier warnings about health and safety. There had been previous problems with the use of acetone and a systematic failure in safety and risk to staff.' Charles Lavery, defending, said: 'The directors of the hotel deeply regret what happened. They believe the size of the bottle their member of staff purchased was unsuitable to use to take off nail varnish. 'After the incident, caused by failings which conspired together, the company brought in health and safety consultants and has totally addressed any problems.' Mrs McKeown, who has worked at the spa since 2006, is now back at work but has launched a compensation claim against her employers.
By . Will Stewart In Moscow . Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev shovelled snow in a remote Russian village last week as part of his sentence for punching a fellow oligarch during a TV debate. The former KGB spy, owner of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, was ordered to clear snow at a nursery school in Maxim Gorky, close to a potato farm he owns 180 miles south of Moscow. He said he was 'enjoying' the work, which will amount to 150 hours of service. Hard at work: Owner of The Independent Alexander Lebedev cleared snow in front of a school . Punishment: The snow-shovelling follows a shift of digging and lifting to repair a playground in Maxim Gorky . Convenience: Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment close to his potato farm . The 53-year-old was spared jail despite a . conviction in July for dramatically striking billionaire Sergei . Polonsky during the 2011 television chat show. The trial was considered to be a political ‘show trial’ and linked to Lebedev’s ownership of a Russian investigative newspaper which spotlights corruption in Vladimir Putin’s government and entourage. Dressed in a designer jacket and gloves, . Lebedev, 53, cleared the first big snow of winter to allow children to . attend the school. Sentenced: Lebedev was sentenced to 150 hours of service for punching a fellow oligarch on TV . So far, the banker has learned to handle a chainsaw and fretsaw to mend playground apparatus - despite criticising his conviction and the penal system for failing to exploit his expertise. He said: ‘I object to the conviction in a legal sense so how can this be a meaningful punishment?
Still, the law is the law and I show by doing what I am doing that I respect the law.’ He added: ‘It is a pity that such public works don’t use the most of what a person can do. ‘I would be glad to give some lectures, but no way, instead I must improve the environment and do something very simple that does not require even minimum qualifications.’ The penal authorities yesterday sought to . detain him in the tiny village for the duration of his sentence, but he . has demanded a move closer to Moscow, where his Siberian-born wife, . model Elena Perminova, lives with their two young children. The tycoon’s 83-year-old mother Maria, a teacher, came to check he was working properly in his exile. ‘She never praises. It was good she did not criticise me,’ he jokingly said. Mr Lebedev’s snow-clearing came as others convicted under by controversial court decisions in Russia are in limbo about their fate. Russia appeared last week to dash hopes that 26 foreigners - among 30 people seized during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - would be allowed to travel home for Christmas. Verdict: Lebedev, centre left with his son and co-publisher Evgeny, at the trial in Moscow earlier this year . The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is objecting allowing them exit visas to fly home pending trials for “hooliganism” in protesting at a Gazprom oil rig in the Arctic. Jailed Pussy Riot singers Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, and Maria Alyokhina, 25, are forced to wait to see if they qualify release under a state amnesty or whether their two year sentences will be quashed after the Russian supreme court, which last week ordered a view of their punishments.
Mr Lebedev called for both the Greenpeace campaigners and the Pussy Riot singers to be amnestied.
A car-lover's classic Morris Minor is still going strong after clocking up 300,000 miles in its 49 years on the road. Pensioner John Davies' two-door car's odometer has gone around the clock three times since it was registered on November 1, 1965. But Mr Davies, 84, from Aberystwyth, west Wales, can still rely on the Morris Minor 100 for his shopping trips, and wouldn't dream of swapping the motor for a newer model.

Widower Mr Davies gets the car serviced every year and also takes it to a specialist garage in Bristol for repairs.
He attributes the cars longevity to doing everything by the book and has no plans to ever sell it. The great-grandfather said: 'Last year I did 1,153 miles in it and I spend about £15 a fortnight on petrol. 'Insurance for this year cost me £166.85, which isn't too bad.

Swathes of the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) have been partially submerged in floods. Torrential rain lashed heavily populated areas as the remnants of Cyclone Debbie moved down the nation's east coast. As floods continued to rise in some towns, photographers captured locals surveying damage to their communities. Several rivers broke their banks, prompting emergency warnings. Residents in Billinudgel, NSW, used surfboards to paddle down the street. Queensland's capital Brisbane was not spared, and an evacuation order was issued for the town of Beaudesert. Businesses were inundated in South Murwillumbah, one of the towns hardest hit. The severe weather washed away roads and brought down trees. Insurers say it is too early to estimate a damage bill. Authorities said tens of thousands of people lost power in the downpour. Even a bull shark turned up in the floods, prompting a warning. Fortunately for New South Wales and Queensland, the storm system has now moved out to sea.
Workers have been accused of wasting money after choosing to widen a footpath rather than cut back an overgrown hedge so people could get past. The path, which links a main road to pensioner bungalows in Bradford, West Yorkshire, had become blocked due to a hedge running alongside it becoming overgrown. But it is claimed that workmen decided to widen the path so more people had space to pass the rampant overgrown hedge, rather than just prune back its leaves and branches. Scroll down for video . Leslie Howard, next to the path extension laid by workers, rather than them pruning back the nearby overgrown hedge . Leslie Howard, who lives nearby and uses the path often said he was shocked to see workers lay down the tarmac instead of cutting the hedge. The 74-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw that instead of cutting the bush back they'd put more tarmac down. 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour. 'How long does it take to dig out the grass, put hard core down and lay a path?' Mr Howard also added that the new tarmac extension did not even solve the problem because workmen had only dealt with part of the path. Mr Howard, left, said: 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour . He explained: 'They should come back and cut the hedge back all the way up the path or remove it.' Mr Howard keeps fit by walking to nearby Eastburn, using the path, which runs up a hill towards four bungalows for the elderly. Several years ago Bradford Council replaced the steps on the incline with a ramp to provide wheelchair access to the bungalows. He said he had first reported the overgrown hedge a few years ago and that time workmen had cut it back.
However, a spokesman for the council said they weren't responsible for the new path, adding it was nothing to do with them . He added: 'The path was very wide, but this bush started growing and growing until it went over most of the path. 'You have to walk on the grass verge to get round. I'm fairly fit but I have to step on the grass. 'I've seen kids on their bikes come straight down from the path to the grass then back to the path, which is dangerous if they slip.' A council spokesman said the incident was nothing to do with the council.
Washington (CNN)Legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is headed back to Congress after President Barack Obama vetoed the bill Tuesday. Obama's veto of the bill comes after a yearslong debate on the controversial pipeline which ultimately handed a legislative victory to proponents of the pipeline after Republicans took control of the Senate in January. The House and Senate may have come together to send a single piece of legislation to Obama, but don't expect that agreement to lead to construction permits for the pipeline project that would ship crude oil from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. Republicans may have enough Democratic support to clear a filibuster, but they'll be hard-pressed to find the 67 votes to override a veto. So what's the big fuss? Why is this one pipeline such a contentious issue and is it really worth the fight for opponents and advocates of Keystone XL? Let's break it down: . How long would the Keystone XL pipeline be? TransCanada's full-fledged Keystone Pipeline system is waiting for U.S. approval to finish construction on 1,200 miles of pipeline known as Keystone XL -- the final piece of a 3,800-mile pipeline network. Wait. There's already a Keystone pipeline? That's right. Keystone XL represents just under a third of the entire Keystone project, and every other piece of pipe has been built and laid out. In fact, TransCanada's pipeline system is already shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Canadian oil sands across the U.S. border -- and into Illinois. The current Keystone XL proposal would run the pipeline through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas . Oil sands that sounds familiar.
That's because oil sands are one of environmentalists' biggest gripes over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline since extracting crude oil from the oil sands (oil + sand = oil sands) pumps about 17% more greenhouse gases into the air than standard crude oil extraction, according to a State Department review of the project. And either way, the State Department concluded the oil sands will be developed regardless of whether the pipeline goes through. But that's not all that's prompted environmentalists to protest Keystone XL and deploy an inflatable pipeline on Sen. Mary Landrieu's front yard last November when she was leading the charge to pass the bill. Environmentalists, local residents and indigenous tribes are also protesting the pipeline's planned route, which would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the world's largest. Aqui-what? Aquifer is just a fancy term for an underground layer of porous rock trapping large deposits of water that can often be accessed through wells -- there are about 2,500 within a mile of the would-be Keystone XL route. Aquifers are a key source of fresh water, and environmentalists are concerned the pipeline could pollute those reserves. But the State Department concluded in January -- amid continued objections from environmentalists -- that the impact on water quality "would be limited." You said indigenous tribes were also protesting the project? Yes. Native Americans are concerned about the societal impact of camps with thousands of construction workers living near their communities, which face a high rate of sexual assaults from non-indigenous men, representatives of the activist Wica Agli group said in an interview earlier this week. Angus King a 'no' on Keystone XL vote . And the pipeline would also run through the sovereign lands of some tribes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe even declared that the House bill to approve Keystone XL last week amounted to a declaration of war. War? Sounds serious. If it comes to that, will the economic benefits be worth it at least?
Depends what you consider to be "worth it." The State Department concluded in January the project would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction phase (indirect: think commercial benefits for restaurants, shops, etc.). That total includes 3,900 construction jobs to actually build the pipeline. Fact checking Keystone jobs claims . All in all, the pipeline would inject $2 billion in total economic benefits, according to the State Department review. But once the construction -- which would last no more than two years -- wraps up, Keystone XL will have created just 50 permanent jobs -- the number needed to maintain the pipeline. Either way, the State Department's conclusions seriously undercut TransCanada's claims in 2011 that the project would create about 140,000 direct and indirect jobs. So if this pipeline goes through, what are the risks of an oil spill? Not too high. The State Department concluded the Keystone XL proposal "would include processes, procedures, and systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate potential oil spills." And will the pipeline help lower gas prices in the U.S.? Not really. The State Department said Keystone XL would have "little impact" on domestic gas prices. Alright, so the State Department released its findings on Keystone XL's impact in January. What's the hold up? The State Department concluded its review of the pipeline's impact in January, but was waiting on a Nebraska Supreme Court case over the pipeline's route to determine whether the pipeline project is in the U.S. national interest. That supreme court approved the pipeline's route through the state earlier this month, and the State Department has been reviewing that decision as it makes its final determinations. The State Department said the pipeline was not in the U.S. national interest in 2011, but TransCanada renewed its application in May 2012 after making changes to the proposed route. The State Department concluded in January 2014 that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a negligible impact on the environment .
The White House has insisted it will let the State Department's process play it before Obama makes a final decision on whether or not to approve the pipeline. The State Department is expected to conclude its final review soon, once it finishes reviewing comments from various federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, which urged the State Department in a February letter to reconsider the negative environmental impact the pipeline would have. Obama has said his top concern in making a decision will be "does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change." For now at least, Obama will veto the Congressional legislation and Keystone XL is facing a dim future. Why Keystone XL matters .
Eden Hazard is on the verge of is signing a new contract with Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week. Talks with the Chelsea forward’s lawyer are at an advanced stage and the club are hoping to conclude negotiations with the Belgian international within the next few weeks. Hazard’s extended deal, which will be worth around £10million to the forward over the next five seasons, will also be a bitter blow to long-term suitors Paris St Germain. Eden Hazard (left) is close to signing a new five-year deal at Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week . The Chelsea winger has scored 31 goals in 114 appearances since signing for £32million from Lille in 2012 . Jose Mourinho confirmed on Tuesday: 'It's true Chelsea is trying to have an agreement for a new contract (for Hazard). 'It will be a question of time. It will end with a new contract. 'He wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future.' Hazard is now one of Chelsea’s most influential players and he will be rewarded with a deal that reflects his growing status at the club. The Chelsea forward, who was named the club’s player of the year at the end of last season, was given the No 10 shirt vacated by Juan Mata at the start of the new campaign. Hazard only joined the club two years ago from Lille in a deal worth £32m and has settled in to life in London after some initial difficulties. His partnership with new signing Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa continues to flourish and he is now considered to be one of the club’s biggest assets. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho criticised Hazard's (pictured) work ethic towards the end of last season . Chelsea, who are top of the Barclays Premier League after a stunning start to the season, are busy tying up their best young players on new long term deals.
They announced last week that Thibaut Courtois, who has replaced Petr Cech as the club’s first choice keeper, has signed a new five year contact. Chelsea want to protect their interests by committing the best young talent to long-term contracts, but they are also being rewarded with huge rises. Hazard’s deal with Chelsea was worth around £100,000 when he arrived from Lille two years ago, but he will double that when he signs his new contract with the club. Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho continues to influence the key decisions at the club and he has built a new team at Chelsea after a year of transition following his return from Real Madrid. After their Champions League group game with Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, they will turn their attentions to a reunion with referee Mike Dean at the Etihad on Sunday. Dean hasn’t refereed a Chelsea fixture since his unbeaten home record came to an end following the defeat against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge last season. Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interesting in Hazard during the summer but he is committed to Chelsea . At the time, Mourinho sarcastically said: ‘Congratulations to Mike Dean because he made a fantastic performance and congratulations to Mike Riley, because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going. ‘Congratulations to all of them and I have nothing more to say.’ Mourinho was later fined £10,000 by the Football Association, but insists he has no issue with Dean, or referees’ chief Mike Riley.
In his fighting days during the 1980s and 1990s, Ghanaian boxing legend Azumah Nelson's thudding jabs and powerful overhands earned him the moniker "The Professor," named for the lessons he'd teach opponents inside the ring. A former three-time world champion, Nelson is often described as the best boxer to come out of the African continent. His daring feats inside the four corners of the ring made him a national hero in the West African country, while in 2004 "The Professor" became the first African to be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Today, Nelson's nickname has taken on new meaning as the former champion now spends his time teaching the secrets of boxing to a new generation of athletes. Watch: Training the next champions . "The Professor" has established the Azumah Nelson Foundation, a not-for-profit organization working to help Ghana's deprived youth realize their potential through education and sport. "We opened the foundation to help the needy children," says Nelson. "We look at you, see your talent and put you there -- the school is there the most important [thing]." Born in 1958, Nelson made his professional debut in 1979. He quickly became a household name in Ghana and went on to win the British Commonwealth's Featherweight title.

But despite his early success, Nelson was still unknown outside his country -- that changed, however, in June 1982 when he was given the chance to fight world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez at New York's Madison Square Garden. Read also: From war child to U.S. Olympics star . Although Nelson lost the fight in the 15th round, his impressive performance against a formidable opponent such as Sanchez established him as a top talent in the international boxing scene. He made history in 1984 when he beat Wilfredo Gomez to be crowned the World Boxing Council Featherweight champion.
Four years later he cemented his reputation as boxing royalty when he won the world Super Featherweight/Junior Lightweight title. Read also: Why Klitschko sold Olympic medal for $1m . Nelson's illustrious career went on for years until he decided to hang up his gloves with a record of 39 wins, 5 losses and 2 draws, with 28 knockout victories. Nowadays, Nelson is trying to preserve the legacy of boxing in Ghana, working with young talent to help create the country's next crop of champions. He says the sport can help children escape poverty and hardship. "I'm a servant -- God brought me to serve the people, especially the needy children," he says. "I want to see everybody smile."

This picture of a banged-up Ferrari Enzo is enough to make any car lover shed a tear. The rare million-dollar vehicle was involved in a crash in Stamford, Connecticut on Monday when a mechanic took the sports car out for a ride and spun out of control. The car's owner, 71-year-old mattress company mogul Michael Fux, had placed the prized car in the care of Greenwich dealership Miller Motorcars. Abused: A rare Ferrari Enzo was badly damaged in a Monday morning crash in Stamford, Connecticut. A technician was driving the vehicle at the time . Crashed: Ferrari technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was driving the rare car owned by 71-year-old mattress mogul Michael Fux. Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, was also in the vehicle at the time of the crash . The man driving the Ferrari has been identified as technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was was accompanied by Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, for the ride. Garcia lost control of the 650-horsepower car while traveling up the northbound entrance of Interstate 95 around 8:45am, causing the car to fishtail. The car spun across three lanes before hitting a bridge wall and smashing into the center divider, heavily damaging the right side of the car. Private investigator John Michael Hoda was driving southbound when he saw the accident, and told MailOnline he was the first to respond to the scene. He says he pulled both Garcia and Palchik out of the 'totalled' vehicle to safety and that neither were wearing seat belts. Private investigator John Hoda was driving on the other side of the road and was the first to respond to the crash. He took this image, which shows a man sitting on the side of the road and wearing a Miller Motorcars shirt . Garcia suffered a minor cut while Palchik was unhurt .
Neither the dealership or owner have commented on the crash, but Fux is no doubt mourning the loss of the car. He told Bed Times Magazine, a trade publication serving the sleep products industry, that he is a 'car freak' and dreamed of owning rare vehicles since he was a little boy growing up poor in Cuba. When he struck his fortune founding mattress company Sleep Innovations, Fux started collecting like mad and last year owned 129 vehicles including 25 Ferraris, 12 Porches, 11 Aston Martins and six Rolls-Royces. The Ferrario Enzo is a special edition sports car named after the Italian motor company's founder, and only 400 were made. But it's not Fux's most valuable car. He also owns a Ferrari FXX, one of only 30 in the world, as well as the first-ever bespoke Rolls-Royce Ghost . He houses the collection in a 30,000-square foot garage at his Milford, NJ home named 'Horse Power Farm'. Fux hopes to build a museum to house the collection, with admission benefiting the Miami Children's Hospital. Prized: The Ferrari Enzo was named after the Italian motor company's founder and only 400 were made. They now range in price from $600,000 to more than a million.

A police bomb squad detonated 17 homemade explosive devices found in an apartment yesterday after a routine traffic stop revealed a potentially dangerous liquid in a man's car, authorities said. Robert Wilson, 29, was taken into custody and booked on felony possession of a destructive device, police Sgt Rudy Lopez said. Authorities believe the man was acting alone, and said there were no apparent links to terrorism. Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad gather at the apartment where police arrested a man after discovering 17 homemade explosive devices . 'This appears to be an individual who was just very curious with explosive devices and then manufactured them,' police spokesman Sgt. Frank Preciado said. The bomb squad went to an apartment complex in the Palms neighborhood of west Los Angeles after officers stopped Wilson for improper vehicle registration on Tuesday night and spotted a clear liquid that was concerning, Lopez said. Officers also found a gun and narcotics. That discovery prompted the search of the man's apartment. The complex and three surrounding buildings were evacuated and several blocks were sealed off. Officers took the explosive devices to a closed off street and disarmed them, fire Capt. Jaime Moore said. The complex and three surrounding buildings were evacuated and several blocks were sealed off while the bomb squad carried out controlled explosions . 'They've created a bunker in order to shelter any shrapnel or debris that may fly with the detonation,' Moore said. Residents were directed to a nearby shelter during the evacuation. Marion Firnhaber said she'd grabbed a book and a banana early that morning and was out the door of her apartment. 'I came outside and there were so many policemen, I thought, "Nobody's going to get away with anything"', she said.
Douglas Westcott, 55, is charged with possession of child pornography . Police in Florida found the bodies of some 50 dead cats — frozen in four separate freezers — inside the home of a man they were arresting for alleged child pornography on Wednesday. Douglas Westcott, 55, was charged in Palm Beach County with three counts of possession of child porn. There were several pictures of naked juveniles inside his Lake Worth home, according to WBPF. Deputies went to his house to haul him to jail when they found as many as 35 cats living in absolute squalor inside the filthy home, said Capt. David Walesky of the Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, the Palm Beach Post reported. Another 50 dead bodies were kept in frozen bags. 'The bodies are spread among 4 separate freezers, which of course is the most unusual aspect of this,' Walesky told USA Today. Litter boxes overflowed with feces and urine. Officers had to wear masks to avoid the stench. Some of the cats were healthy but many suffered from respiratory and skin problems, according to the Palm Beach Post. 'The living conditions were not acceptable for the animals,' Walesky told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

Graffiti mocking Hillary Clinton has been plastered across the streets surrounding a restaurant where she is hosting a fundraiser for Democratic Congressional candidates on Monday. The Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, LA, is now covered in evil winged monkeys from the Wizard Of Oz. Instead of carrying the Wicked Witch Of The West, they are holding a sign that reads: 'Hillary 2016'. Sting: Republican street artist Sabo hung evil winged monkeys with Hillary 2016 signs along the streets surrounding the Tavern Restaurant where the former First Lady will be hosting a fundraiser on Monday . Mocking: The monkeys are fictional characters that carry the Wicked Witch Of The West in The Wizard Of Oz . It is the latest strike by the anti-Obama artist known as Sabo, who earlier this year covered Gwyneth Paltrow's Hollywood home in posters featuring her face and the words 'Obama drone' ahead of a fundraiser for the president. Clinton's $32,400-a-head fundraiser is set to lure influential Hollywood figures including Steven Spielberg and Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn. But with just three days to go, the event has been marred by Sabo's mocking posters. He has also created a fake website for the Tavern which describes its clientele as 'big money, Hollywood Fat Cats', and other Hillary 2016 memorabilia including t-shirts and stickers. Anonymous: The artist has spent 15 years creating anti-Democrat graffiti to act as 'the other voice' in LA . Large-scale project: He revealed on his website that he has also made stickers and t-shirts to mock Hillary . Hillary Clinton has not yet confirmed she plans to bid for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2016. She has lambasted claims that her vocal presence on the mid-terms campaign trail is simply a 'warm-up', insisting she wants the focus to be on next month's candidates. However, Sabo has taken aim at the former First Lady in an overnight sting.
This morning, he gleefully tweeted from the account @unsavoryagents: 'SNEAK PEEK - ABOUT LAST NIGHT' with an early morning photograph of one of the monkeys hanging from a lamp post. He told The Hollywood Reporter in an email: 'All these leftists, I'm tired of their s***'. The website describes Clinton as 'a tired old hag who can't stop wishing she was President'. On the campaign trail: Clinton has lambasted claims her vocal presence in the mid-terms is her own warm-up . For the last 15 years, LA-based Sabo has been creating right-leaning street art to be 'the other voice' in contrast with liberal graffiti artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster. According to the Unsavory Agents Facebook page, the company’s mission is not only to 'let the art world know that the left-wing will no longer hold art hostage' but to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts.' 'Our art is politically minded, right-wing centric, brutal, street level, and hard edge,' the page reads. 'Our means are achieved by any creative means necessary.' Previous targets have included Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin.
Solving the mystery of how 900-year-old African coins ended up in remote Australia could not only recast the history of foreign contact Down Under, but shed light on Aboriginal rock art. How the ancient Kilwa coins, believed to date from about 1100, came to be discovered on the Wessels Islands off the Northern Territory in 1944 has long posed questions about foreign visits to far off Australian shores. Australian Ian McIntosh, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University-Purdue University in the United States, said rock art found on the islands -- which includes one image which appears to show a type of European sailing vessel -- could hold some clues. The Kilwa coins were discovered lying in the sand by Royal Australian Air Force radar operator Maurie Isenberg during World War II . Isenberg initially tried to sell the coins but was unsuccessful. He put them away for decades and it wasn't until 1979 that he sent them to a museum for identification . 'A big part of the next stage will be documenting, dating and interpreting (the art), together with indigenous peoples,' McIntosh told AFP from his home in Indiana. The Kilwa coins were discovered lying in the sand by Royal Australian Air Force radar operator Maurie Isenberg during World War II when he was stationed on the island as the Pacific conflict raged. He found nine coins in all, five African copper pieces and four Dutch coins of European origin which are not nearly as old. Isenberg initially tried to sell the coins but was unsuccessful. He put them away for decades and it wasn't until 1979 that he sent them to a museum for identification, along with a map showing where he had found them. McIntosh said there were several theories on the coins, including that they were washed ashore after a shipwreck. The coins - believed to have originated in the medieval sultanate of Kilwa- have led to speculation that parts of northern Australia were visited by other mariners from as far away as the Middle East and Africa .
One explanation could be that a known Indonesian, a shipwreck survivor who lived his life on the Wessels Islands, could have brought the coins to the area . European sailors are known to have sailed the coast of Australia in the 1600s, but it wasn't until captain James Cook landed in Sydney's Botany Bay in 1770 that the British laid claim to the country. The coins -- believed to have originated in the medieval sultanate of Kilwa, an area which is now in Tanzania -- have led to speculation that parts of northern Australia were visited by other mariners from as far away as the Middle East and Africa. As McIntosh wrote in a recent paper for the journal 'Australian Folklore', in terms of the chain of events in the discovery, 'the argument for the involvement of Kilwa traders and also the Portuguese is quite compelling'. He notes the sea route from Kilwa in east Africa to Oman and then onto India, Malaysia and Australia's close neighbour Indonesia was well established by the 1500s and probably for many hundreds of years before that. The coins were found on a beach on the Wessel Islands. The islands, pictured here at marker A, are off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. They were a key strategic position during the Second World War . Aboriginal Australians are thought to have first arrived on the Australian mainland by boat from the Malay Archipelago between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. However, the first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606. Other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century, and dubbed the continent 'New Holland.' In 1770, British explorer Captain James Cook explored the east coast of Australia. The British penal colony was then first established at Botany Bay in January 1788. During the following century, the British established other colonies on the continent.
This reduced the number of indigenous Australians because of conflict with the colonists and new diseases bought over from Europe. Australia fought with the British during both world wars. McIntosh said a number of his team felt the coins had simply been washed ashore but admitted 'we're still toying with a whole bunch of ideas here'. The academic said one explanation could be that a known Indonesian, a shipwreck survivor who lived his life on the Wessels Islands, could have brought the coins to the area. The coins, he speculates, may have represented this man's 'worldly wealth'. McIntosh said an expedition he led in July to the site where the coins were discovered, which involved an intensive search in the harsh terrain, had not uncovered any further coins. 'Over the past couple of years, we've developed a whole series of hypotheses to explain how those coins might have got from East Africa to northern Australia,' he said. 'The whole point of this initial site survey was to try and get enough evidence to push us in particular directions.' What the researchers did uncover was the Aboriginal rock art and some potential evidence of shipwrecks -- a not unlikely proposition given the dangerous reefs off the islands -- in the form of a six-foot piece of timber from a boat. McIntosh said the scientists would work with indigenous people to look at the art and see whether it matches any known ship types, adding that there were multiple stories of interaction in the past with 'different people -- black and white from somewhere else, not Aboriginal.' For now the mystery remains. 'These coins probably remained in circulation for a couple of hundred years but only in the vicinity of East Africa, beyond that they didn't have value,' McIntosh said, adding that other coins of this type had only been found in Zimbabwe and Oman. 'Nowhere else in the world have they been found, except for northern Australia," said McIntosh. "Very unusual. That's had everybody puzzled.'
Australian scientist and professor at Indiana University, Ian McIntosh, points to the location where the copper coins were found .
Stoke Field on 16 June 1487 saw the final attempt by the House of York to seize the crown after decades of war. Despite involving more soldiers and having higher casualties, it is overshadowed by Bosworth, which saw the death of Richard III two years earlier. But a weekend of events at Stoke Hall, near Newark in Nottinghamshire, will help mark its 530th anniversary. While Bosworth witnessed the death of the last Plantagenet king, those supporting the Yorkist cause had found a new figurehead. A man claiming to be Edward, Earl of Warwick, one of the Princes in the Tower, had prompted a handful of nobles to rally to his cause. He was, in fact, a commoner called Lambert Simnel and it was likely that the rebel commander, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, had his own eyes on the crown. Henry VII's army of about 15,000 was twice the size of his enemy and, despite some initial resistance, Simnel's force was routed. In an unusual display of medieval mercy Simnel was pardoned and employed in the royal kitchens as a servant. Re-enactment expert Allan Harley of the Beaufort Companye said: "The battle is largely forgotten because the Tudor dynasty wanted it that way. "They did not want anyone to think a pretender to the throne could raise an army and mount a challenge. "But it should be remembered because it was the last swansong of the House of York. "The Battle of Bosworth put the Tudors in charge but this battle was really the start of the Tudor dynasty." The weekend of events will give visitors a rare opportunity to walk around the battlefield, which is in private hands, as well as see re-enactments and hear talks about events of the time.

Becoming a little turned around after a pub crawl could now be a thing of the past for barflies in Leeds, as a dedicated drinker has designed a London Tube-style map that charts bars, restaurants and pubs all over the city. The 'Leeds Oderaround' was created by Steve Lovell, and features a massive 563 locations across the northern city, replacing tube stations with drinking, eating, and lodging establishments. Mr Lovell, 39, spent over a year of his spare time designing the drinker's guide, using both virtual and physical mapping methods to complete the project. The 'Leeds Orderaround' map, drawing from the iconic London Underground design, the map details the locations of 563 pubs and bars in Leeds . Steve Lovell, a former graphic design student, took over a year to create the map, walking dozens of miles in his efforts . The former Leeds University graphic design student clocked up dozens of miles walking the city, and taking virtual street tours. Most of his mapping efforts were to make sure that the pubs he was listing on his map were still open and operational, as many might have been closed or renamed. Mr Lovell said: 'Having always admired the design of the London Underground map and going out in Leeds, I decided to do this project to combine the two. the map could easily be used to chart the routes of a pub crawl, or just more easily locate a pub in the city that you've always wanted to try . Steve Lovell plans to sell the maps on his website for £10 each . 'It's been over a year in development on and off in my spare time. 'It's been deceptively long and hard work, but I'm very happy with the finished result.
'I've had lots of kind comments about it already and it does make me feel quite proud. 'Friends and neighbours have said that they are really impressed with it and when I had my photograph taken complete strangers came up to me and said they really wanted one.' Because the project took over a year to complete, Mr Lovell found that many of the sites he had listed at the start had become obsolete, and so his map required constant updating. Lovell both walked dozens of miles, and used virtual mapping techniques to make make sure that every pub, restaurant and bar was actually open and operational, and that they hadn't changed their name, so that his map was completely correct . He said: 'Since starting the project I've had to remove a lot of pubs that have closed down and even been demolished and that's always sad. 'About a quarter-of-a-mile from my house there was a pub that had been demolished before it had been printed. 'It is quite sad to see so many close and come off the map in the 12 months I have created it. 'But it is also nice to see that some new places are also opening up, but mostly in the city centre. 'When I was putting it together there were lots of places that I wouldn't know about and places that I never even knew existed. 'I can't say I've been to all of the places on the map and probably never will, but I've been to lots of places I didn't know about before as a result of researching and designing this.' Lovell's maps cost £10 and are available from www.albanydesign.co.uk. Rugby player Danny Cipriani after being released from hospital after his accident being hit by a bus on a Leeds pub crawl . A pub crawl, the act of going from one bar to another, drinking more and more drinks on a per-determined route, is a popular British pastime.
But the hobby can be dangerous. Groups of people drinking strong drinks, with the peer pressure culture of 'downing' drinks meaning that people are stumbling out of bars and into streets to head to the next place, where they are at risk of being hit by cars. This danger was shown in Leeds last year when the former boyfriend of Kelly Brook, Rugby ace Danny Cipriani, drunkenly tumbled into the road while on a pub crawl, and was hit by a bus. Cipriani was treated in Leeds General Hospital, and was pictured days later hobbling out on crutches with various cuts and bruises from his accident. According to eyewitnesses, him and friends had been taking on the Leeds 'Otley pub crawl', featuring 14 different drinking locations. One landlord said Cipriani and friends had been 'necking' drinks, with one landlord noting that they had spent £200 in 15 minutes on beer and shots. Later, he collided with the bus, and with an eyewitness commenting: 'Every bit of the bus front window was smashed to pieces, imagine what the guy looks like.'
By . Louise Boyle . and Lydia Warren . Missing: Avonte Oquendo, 14, ran away on October 4 and his remains could have been found . Authorities investigating whether remains found washed up on a New York beach belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo have also found a skull, according to reports. A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker . were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said . the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went . missing in October. Authorities told DNAinfo that searchers also found a head on Sunday and have now found most of the body. Ten teeth are missing, which could make it hard to identify the body through dental records. But Avonte's family said they fear foul play if the body is his - because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear. The family's lawyer, David Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand. 'If it is him, what that indicates to me is that something happened,' Perecman said. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?' The . remains were taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively . identified, and authorities are now awaiting the results of a DNA test. They could have an answer by Wednesday. A police source confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared on October 4 from the Riverview School in Long Island City. Search: An arm, torso and legs were discovered along the Queens shoreline on Thursday and authorities said the clothes found were similar to those worn by Avonte when he vanished three months ago . Hunt: An NYPD canine unit continues the search for human remains on Friday.
Authorities said a DNA test this week will determine whether or not the remains belong to the missing teenager . Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo . Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing. The Oquendo family were notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information. The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen. For months, the boy's family has . organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing . posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward. In . particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated . with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even . played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy. The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. There have been a few sightings of . teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - . but he remains missing. Fears: But David Perecman, the family's attorney, pictured, said the underwear found on the remains does not match the type that Avonte wore - leading his family to fear foul play .

The members say they'll continue as a four-piece after Zayn Malik announced he was leaving the group last week to "live like a normal 22-year-old". His departure was followed by rumours on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that One Direction was about to break up. But Liam Payne thanked fans for sticking with the band and for "not thinking it's finished". He tweeted: "I can see a lot of people thanking us for staying but your the real Heros here thanks for not thinking it's finished."

Rage (written as Getting It On; the title was changed before publication) is a psychological thriller novel by American writer Stephen King, the first he published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It was first published in 1977 and then was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus The Bachman Books. The novel describes a school shooting, and has been associated with actual high school shooting incidents in the 1980s and 1990s. In response King allowed the novel to fall out of print, and in 2013 he published a non-fiction, anti-firearms violence essay titled "Guns". Plot summary [ edit ] Charlie Decker, a Maine high school senior, is called to a meeting with his principal about a previous incident in which he struck his chemistry teacher with a pipe wrench, leading to the teacher's hospitalization and Charlie's suspension. For unknown reasons, Charlie subjects the principal to a series of insulting remarks, resulting in his expulsion. Charlie storms out of the office and retrieves a pistol from his locker, then sets the contents of his locker on fire. He then returns to his classroom and fatally shoots his algebra teacher, Miss Jean Underwood. The fire triggers an alarm, but Charlie forces his classmates to stay in the room, killing a history teacher, Mr Peter Vance, when he attempts to enter. As the other students and teachers evacuate the school, the police and media arrive at the scene. Over the following four hours, Charlie toys with various authority figures who attempt to negotiate with him, including the principal, the school psychologist, and the local police chief. Charlie gives them certain commands, threatening to kill students if they do not comply. Charlie also admits to his hostages that he does not know what has compelled him to commit his deeds, believing he will regret them when the situation is over.
As his fellow students start identifying with Charlie, he unwittingly turns his class into a sort of psychotherapy group, causing his schoolmates to semi-voluntarily tell embarrassing secrets regarding themselves and each other. Interspersed throughout are narrative flashbacks to Charlie's troubled childhood, particularly his tumultuous relationship with his abusive father Carl. Several notable incidents include a violent disagreement between two female students and a police sniper's attempt to shoot Charlie through the heart. However, Charlie survives due to the bullet's striking his locker's combination lock, which he had earlier placed in the breast pocket of his shirt. Charlie finally comes to the realization that only one student is really being held against his will: a seeming "Big Man On Campus" named Ted Jones, who is harboring his own secrets. Ted realizes this and attempts to escape the classroom, but the other students brutally assault him, driving him into a battered catatonic state. At 1:00 p.m., Charlie releases the students, but Ted is unable to move under his own power and remains. When the police chief enters the classroom, the now-unarmed Charlie moves as if to shoot him, attempting suicide by cop. The chief shoots Charlie, but he survives and is found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a psychiatric hospital in Augusta, Maine until he can answer for his actions. The final chapters contain an inter-office memo concerning Ted's treatment and prognosis at the hospital where he is now a patient, and a letter from one of Charlie's friends describing assorted developments in the students' lives during the months following this incident. The story ends with Charlie addressing the reader: "That's the end. I have to turn off the light now. Good night."
Connections to actual school shootings [ edit ] The novel's plot vaguely resembles actual events that have transpired since the book's publication, to such a degree that the author is no longer comfortable with the book's being in print for fear that it may inspire similar occurrences ("[Rage is] now out of print. "[1]) as it had already been associated with incidents of high school shootings and hostage takings: Jeffrey Lyne Cox, a senior at San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California, took a semi-automatic rifle to school on April 26, 1988, and held a humanities class of about 60 students hostage for over 30 minutes. Cox held the gun to one student when the teacher doubted Cox would cause harm and stated that he would prove it to her. At that time three students escaped out a rear door and were fired upon. Cox was later tackled and disarmed by another student. A friend of Cox's told the press that Cox had been inspired by the Kuwait Airways Flight 422 hijacking and by the novel Rage , [2] which Cox had read over and over again and with which he strongly identified.

Pierce, a senior at Jackson County High School in McKee, Kentucky, armed himself with a shotgun and two handguns and took a history classroom hostage in a nine-hour standoff with police on September 18, 1989, that ended without injury. Police found a copy of Rage among the possessions in Pierce's bedroom, leading to speculation that he had been inspired to carry out the plot of the novel.

On January 18, 1993, Scott Pennington, a student at East Carter High School in Grayson, Kentucky, took a .38-caliber revolver that was owned by his father and fatally shot his English teacher Deanna McDavid in the head, during her seventh period class. He subsequently shot and killed the school's custodian, Marvin Hicks, and held the class hostage for 20 minutes before releasing them.

Barry Loukaitis, a student at Frontier Middle School in Moses Lake, Washington, walked from his house to the school on February 2, 1996, and entered his algebra classroom during fifth period. He opened fire at students, killing two and wounding another. He then fatally shot his algebra teacher, Leona Caires, in the chest. As his classmates began to panic, Loukaitis reportedly said, "This sure beats algebra, doesn't it? "—a line erroneously believed to be taken from Rage . (No such line appears in King’s story. The closest is when Charlie Decker quips, "This sure beats panty raids.") Hearing the gunshots, gym coach Jon Lane entered the classroom. Loukaitis was holding his classmates hostage and planned to use one hostage so he could safely exit the school. Lane volunteered to be the hostage, and Loukaitis kept Lane at gunpoint with his rifle. Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis, wrestled him to the ground, then assisted the evacuation of students. [7] . (No such line appears in King’s story.

Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis, wrestled him to the ground, then assisted the evacuation of students. In December 1997, Michael Carneal shot eight fellow students at a prayer meeting in West Paducah, Kentucky. He had a copy of Rage within the Richard Bachman omnibus in his locker. This was the incident that moved King to allow the book to go out of print. [8] End of publication [ edit ] When King decided to let Rage fall out of print in the United States, it remained available only as part of The Bachman Books. In contrast, the other novels that appeared in that compilation - The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man - are available separately in the USA. Rage remained available in the United Kingdom and other countries in The Bachman Books for a time, but later appeared to become unavailable. [9] New editions of The Bachman Books do not include Rage. In a footnote to the preface of the novel Blaze, dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of Rage: "Now out of print, and a good thing." King said, in his keynote address at the VEMA Annual Meeting on May 26, 1999: "The Carneal incident was enough for me. I asked my publisher to take the damned thing out of print. They concurred.
"[8] King went on to describe his view on this subject, which acknowledged the role that cultural or artistic products such as Rage play in influencing individuals, particularly troubled youths, while also declaring that artists and writers should not be denied the aesthetic opportunity to draw upon their own culture—which is suffused with violence, according to King—in their work. [8] King went on to describe his inspiration for stories such as Rage, which drew heavily upon his own frustrations and pains as a high school student. [8] In an article on the ominous writings of Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho for Entertainment Weekly, King said: "Certainly in this sensitized day and age, my own college writing—including a short story called 'Cain Rose Up' and the novel Rage—would have raised red flags, and I'm certain someone would have tabbed me as mentally ill because of them "[10] After the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, he elaborated in a non-fiction essay, titled "Guns" (2013),[11] on why he let Rage go out of print. King's website states: "All profits from 'Guns' will benefit the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "[12] This is such a visceral, divisive issue in America that even the most rational arguments will fail to sway the other side. King admits he is coming from the left on this one. He knows he is tilting against windmills yet lays out an emotional and cogent case that gun rights are out of control. He provides no new ideas but agrees that certain types of firearms should be restricted, background checks made more rigid, etc. Much of his impetus for writing this essay comes from the influence of one of his books so good on him for taking responsibility. Responsibility is something lawmakers and the American public need to take or the country will continue to see 80 gun deaths each and every day.
Topics: amazon, Books, Gun Violence, Guns, kindle single, Second Amendment, Entertainment News Stephen King has published a Kindle Single (more than a book, less than an essay, proprietary to Amazon platforms) on gun violence, in which he describes his decision to pull his pseudonymous novel “Rage” from shelves after possible copycat crimes. “Rage,” which King first wrote in high school (“I suppose if it had been written today, and some high school English teacher had seen it, he would have rushed the manuscript to the guidance counselor and I would have found myself in therapy posthaste”), depicts a hostage situation in a high school when a student brings a weapon to school. After a series of similar situations in high schools (including one where, as in the book, a math teacher was killed), King made the costly decision to pull the book from stores. Though “I never did and never would” apologize for the book, he says, the depiction of violence in the book is “a possible accelerant” for troubled young men with access to guns. Stephen King has published a 99-cent Kindle Single called “Guns,” a short essay about gun violence in America that “constructs his argument for what can and should be done.” In the essay, King wrote frankly about Rage, a novel he released under the pen name Richard Bachman about a boy who takes a high school classroom hostage with a gun. Four different teenagers cited the book after attacks on their schools and King decided to remove the book from publication. He explained in his new Kindle Single:
A presenter on Radio Flaixbak contacted Mr Rajoy's office, pretending to work for Carles Puigdemont. He was then transferred to the PM, when a Puigdemont impersonator took over. Asked if the two could meet, Mr Rajoy agreed keenly and told the fake Catalan leader he had a "very free schedule". Mr Rajoy's Popular Party won the most seats in recent elections but fell short of a majority, leaving Spain in political limbo. Mr Rajoy and Mr Puigdemont are at odds over the future of Catalonia, with the prime minster pledging to fight for national unity and the Catalan leader wanting to secede within 18 months. The radio presenter intervened soon after Mr Rajoy told the impersonator he would call back on Monday "and we could meet 24 or 48 hours after". Learning he had been hoaxed, a disappointed-sounding Mr Rajoy said "this is not very serious". The pair thanked him for taking the joke well. The Spanish leader is not the only high-profile figure to fall for a prank phone call. In 1998, the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair took a call from an impressionist pretending to be opposition leader William Hague. Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 2004 was enraged by a call from a Miami DJ pretending to be the then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

A university student was shot during a party at his frat house this weekend after the shooter was barred from going inside and tried to rob some of the members. The 22-year-old student, who has not been named, was shot during a fight which broke out in the early hours of Saturday close to Temple University in Philadelphia. The man suffered a gunshot wound to the left thigh and was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital where he was treated and released. Scroll down for video . The 22-year-old student, who has not been named, was shot during a fight which broke out in the early hours of Saturday at a fraternity house (pictured) close to Temple University in Philadelphia . The suspect approached a group outside the fraternity house and demanded to go inside but was told he couldn't because he wasn't a student. He then threatened to rob them and brandished a handgun that he had tucked in the waistband of his pants. The victim tried to restrain the suspect and was shot, police said. One student who ran to help the victim told NBC: 'I applied the pressure on his wound. I put both my hands right on his hip. 'Also some kid who was an EMT took out a sweatshirt and covered him up and then the officer showed up and carried him out.' Police were still hunting for the gunman today. He was described as African-American, 5'8'-5'9', slim and around 35-40 years old. He was wearing blue jeans, a red hoodie, and red beanie hat and had no facial hair. MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Temple University on Monday.

The Australian said he can "feel" the "long-seated rivalry" towards England as they prepare to face Ireland at Twickenham on Saturday (16:50 GMT). It is Jones' first home match after away wins over Scotland and Italy. "Maybe Clive Woodward summed it up best when he said everyone hates England - that's true," Jones said. "I'm not going to use it, but within the side they can use it. As I said when I took over, I'm not English, I'm Australian, but I will be absolutely committed to them." Jones revealed he sees Leicester centre Manu Tuilagi's future for England in the 12 shirt - once he is fully back to match fitness as he continues his return for Tigers after long-term injury. "I think inside centre is his best position. He's not a 13. That's what I know he's not. He's definitely a 12. He can carry the ball across the gain line," Jones said. "He threw a beautiful left to right pass on Friday night. And then he threw a terrible right to left, so maybe he's left handed! "He's got all the attributes to be an outstanding 12." England are level with France at the top of the Six Nations table, ahead on points difference with both sides on six points after two games. Jones continued to insist his side was a "work in progress", but praised his players for "commitment", "taking initiative" and "being independent". And he is preparing England for an aerial bombardment from two-time defending champions Ireland, adding: "They kick 70% of their ball away. If they want to do that, good luck to them. "It has worked for them. It is not the way I think you should play rugby but it has been successful for them, so good luck."
Kenneth Harper, 33, was convicted of the sex crimes last year, along with further charges of assault and reckless behaviour, after a high court trial. Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh quashed his convictions for the two rape charges after defence arguments about mutual corroboration. He was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences. Solicitor advocate John Keenan challenged the rape convictions, which were based on mutual corroboration. That meant the evidence of one allegation was being used to support the other. Mr Keenan said there were only two alleged offences and there was a substantial time gap between them of almost eight years. He said the circumstances in which they were said to have occurred were different and there was an absence of "extraordinary features". He argued that there must be something compelling to link events separated by many years, but here there was nothing. The Crown claimed that there were compelling similarities as both offences involved vulnerable women who were significantly younger than Harper, the first was aged 15 and the second 22. It also argued that evidence from a third woman, who was assaulted, could be used to support the convictions. Lord Brodie, who heard the appeal with Lord Bracadale and Lady Cosgrove, said: "Long lapse of time does not preclude the finding of sufficient similarity between two incidents to infer a course of conduct, but it is relevant. "Where the interval is a long one it is necessary to consider whether there are any extraordinary features in the evidence that nonetheless make the similarities compelling. "The time interval, at a little short of eight years, was long. Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case." Harper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.

China’s first budget airline is poised to lobby industry regulators for permission to install standing-only ‘seats’ on its planes so it can cram more people on board. Shanghai-based Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat, according to China National Radio. It’s not the first time the idea has been floated – Dublin-based Ryanair famously proposed selling standing-only tickets in 2009 to increase passenger traffic and cut costs. China's Spring Airlines wants to install 'vertical seats' on its planes so it can cram more passengers on board . Spring Airlines chairman Wang Zhenghua confirmed to China National Radio that he wants standing-only cabins on his planes and is seeking government approval. The 70-year-old billionaire told the broadcaster that he began exploring the idea in 2008 after a chaotic Chinese New Year travel rush. Customers told China National Radio that they would be hesitant to buy a ticket for a vertical seat out of safety concerns. One told the broadcaster that she fears passengers would be injured when the plane flies through bad weather or is rocked by turbulence. Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat . Spring Airlines plans to work with manufacturers on a design that would include a safety belt. The low-cost carrier, founded in 2004, offers flights as cheap as £1 ($1.50) and flies to destinations in China, Japan, Thailand and other Asian countries. Even though designs have been proposed and no-frills airlines have expressed interest, the vertical seat concept has not taken off because it hasn’t received approval from authorities. Ryanair abandoned its proposal in 2012 after it was thwarted by an unnamed regulator. The Irish carrier planned to install ten rows of vertical seats on its planes – increasing capacity by about 40 passengers – and charge less than £5 to travellers who were willing to stand.
Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use . Italian firm Aviointeriors designed the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys . Last year, Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use. The design, intended for short-haul flights, would increase capacity for airlines and leave passengers with even less space. In 2010, Italian firm Aviointeriors unveiled its design for the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys. In that seat passengers would sit at an angle with just 23in of legroom between them and the seat in front of them – about seven inches less than the average seat pitch on most planes.
The Glasgow-based company, which makes valves and pumps for the energy and mining industries, said oil and gas orders fell 23% in the first quarter. Weir expects the decline to continue in the second quarter. It plans to cut 125 jobs, mostly in its North American oil and gas business. It will also consolidate its service centres in the region in a bid to deliver cost savings of ? ?10m. In a trading statement, Weir said oil and gas markets had been hit by much lower oil prices, which had led to significant reductions in activity levels. There was better news from the company's minerals division, which saw orders rise year-on-year by 5% between January and April, in line with expectations. However, Weir warned that mining end markets continued to be challenging, with iron ore prices falling further in the first quarter. Chief executive Keith Cochrane said: "While mining markets remained subdued, the performance of the minerals division once again demonstrated its resilience. "Trading conditions in oil and gas markets were challenging through the quarter with a steeper decline in the North American rig count than the market had anticipated. "Oil and gas activity levels are still falling and we expect a further decline in divisional revenues in the second quarter. "In response the group is taking further actions to support profitability, including additional workforce reductions and service centre consolidations." After early volatile trading, Weir's share price was nearly 5% higher by mid-morning.
America Staffers Walk Out Of Congress In Protest Over Brown And Garner Cases i itoggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images Dozens of congressional staff members walked out of the Capitol at 3:30 p.m. ET Thursday, in a show of support for protesters angered by recent grand jury decisions not to indict police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Wearing suits, ties and overcoats, the staffers stood several rows deep on the steps of Capitol Hill before making the hands-up gesture that has come to symbolize frustration with the deaths of the two unarmed black men at the hands of police. They stood silently with their arms raised for a moment before disbanding and walking down the steps. While the event was spearheaded by the Congressional Black Associates, it also drew other staff members, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association, according to CNN. A few members of Congress came out to the steps, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas. The short event included a prayer from U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black. The protest comes a week after Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said she was "deeply disappointed" by a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to level charges in the Garner case. Noting that the decision was similar to another jury's findings in Ferguson, Mo., Fudge wrote: "In the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear: there will be no accountability for taking Black lives. As an American, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all."

The planned walkout comes after days of protests across the country, including in Washington, D.C., where demonstrators have marched through downtown, blocking roads and bridges on an almost nightly basis since last Wednesday's decision by a grand jury in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Garner. "We're proud to have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the thousands of peaceful protesters around the country who are telling this country that black lives matter," said one staffer who was helping to plan the event. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association joined black staffers and the Congressional Black Associates in planning the event, which is set to take place at 3:30 p.m., and is expected to draw at least 50 people. A staffer who planned to attend the protest said it was important to show support across racial lines. "I believe it's important, because what affects one community really affects the entire country," the staffer told CNN. "It's not just one group of minorities that's affected. How one group is treated affects Asians, Hispanics, women. It's important that we show our solidarity and come together and really speak out about the injustices that are being done." The group will gather in front of the Capitol and plan to take a photo at 345 p.m. U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black is expected to pray for the grieving families and to pray for peace.
The US Capitol dome is cocooned in scaffolding on October 28, 2014 in Washington, DC as it undergoes its first comprehensive repairs in more than half a century a century. The two-year, USD 60 million project is aimed at repairing nearly 1,300 cracks that have emerged in the nine-million-pound (4.1-million-kilogram) cast iron dome, according to the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) office. Construction on the dome began in 1855. Work symbolically continued through the US Civil War and the structure was eventually completed in 1866. AFP Photo/Paul J. Richards (Photo credit should read ) "We're not trying to cause any type of controversy," one staffer told CNN. "We're just trying to highlight this issue, to show solidarity with people who have been affected." Chaplain Black has drawn attention before for his topical prayers. Last year during the budget battle that shut down the government for 16 days, he opened each session with a prayer appealing the lawmakers to end the impasse. "Obviously, there are probably some people who feel that my prayers should not have been as pointed as they were," Black told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the shutdown had ended. "My prayers simply reflect the reality of the environment that I am in." Black could not be reached immediately reached for comment ahead of the event. Over a hundred black congressional staffers and several black lawmakers staged a walkout at the Capitol this afternoon, leading a silent protest on the steps of the Capitol over the recent police killing involving Ferguson and Eric Garner. Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Marc Veasey, D-Texas, were among the lawmakers participating in the walkout.
Senate Chaplain Barry Black led the group in prayer, saying they were working as a “voice for the voiceless.” “Today as people throughout the nation protest for justice in our lands, forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who couldn't speak or breathe for themselves,” Black said. “May we not forget that in our national history injustice has often been maintained because good people failed to promptly act. Forgive oh God, our culpability in contributing to our national pathology as you keep us aware of our own capacity to be instruments of injustice.” Alex Wong/Getty Images After the prayer, the group stood on the steps of the Capitol, raising their hands in a gesture that has become symbolic of the Ferguson refrain –- hands up, don’t shoot.
A prankster was branded a 'reptile' today after he admitted recording himself doing a vile NekNomination stunt by swallowing - a live frog and lizard. Sheldon Jeans, 23, stripped to the waist and dressed in a 'Scouser' black curly wig and moustache before introducing the stunt to the camera. During the 90-second-long clip, Jeans downed a glass of water filled with crickets, before putting a frog in the same vessel and knocking it back whole. Scroll down for video . Sheldon Jeans swallowed a live frog and a lizard during the Neknomination stunt which he posted on Facebook . Jeans pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the creatures under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act . Jeans, pictured, apologised to the three-inch long lizard before covering it in water and swallowing it whole . Jeans, of Cowplain, Hampshire even apologises to the three inch long lizard before covering it with water and swallowing it whole. Despite claiming he regurgitated the animals afterwards, Jeans became the first person to be successfully prosecuted for causing cruelty to any creature other than a fish, while taking part in the web craze. He was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the animals, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Portsmouth Magistrates' Court also ordered him to pay £1,200 in costs after changing his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial. RSPCA inspector Alan Browning said: 'Unfortunately this isn't the first case we've had involving NekNomination, but it is the first to come to court that involved animals other than fish. 'The two small animals would have suffered considerably during this incident, going through the distress of being swallowed and coming into contact with stomach acids. 'We hope this sick game is now on the decline as it is just not acceptable to subject animals to this sort of ordeal.'
In the video, he said: 'Hello this is Sheldon Jeans with a NekNomination. 'As you can see on the table in front of me, I've got a glass full of crickets. I had to get little ones because the geezer thought I was buying these for myself. 'I've got myself a lizard and I've got myself a frog. I'm going to call this the "I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here Nek Challenge." First up, for the crickets.' Jeans zoomed the video camera onto to the frog so viewers could see that the amphibian was real . He also showed viewers that he had put the lizard, pictured, into the bottom of his glass before drinking . He also drank a glass full of crickets although these were not covered by animal protection legislation . He then called the frog a 'little fellow', before swallowing it whole and declaring it 'f***ing lovely.' He said to the lizard: 'Sorry mate, but you are next. In with the lizard, we'll have some of that. Add a little bit of water. Don't worry son, it's your turn.' Jeans then posted the footage on Facebook, which led to people complaining to the RSPCA. The only reason he was not prosecuted for killing the crickets during the 3 February stunt was because they are not covered under the Act. Jeans was fined £1,200 and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid community service following his stunt . Last month, Will Williams, of Caernarfon, north Wales, was criticised after drinking 70cl of the 40 per cent whiskey ahead of what he called a 'weekend on the beer'. Health experts say the reckless stunt - in which Mr Williams consumed at least 28 units of alcohol - could easily have killed him.
The video, which has gained nearly 400,000 views on YouTube, shows Mr Williams biting the seal from the bottle of liquor while his friends laugh in the background. He then inserts a straw into the bottle to help the spirits go down quickly and knocks it back in less than 10 seconds. After spitting on the floor, he then tells his friends 'Neknominate that', a reference to the recent internet craze that saw some killed after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Many of the video's viewers went online to criticise Mr Williams for completing the stunt, which they pointed out could easily have been fatal. In an earlier court case, bin man Paul Wooding of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire was handed an 18-month conditional discharge after he swallowed live fish during a Neknomination stunt from February. Still from a video of Paul Wooding preparing and drinking a cocktail containing alcohol and four live minnows. (RSPCA) In the video, Wooding announces 'this is my Neknominate' before downing a pint glass of wine, gin, vodka, rum and lemonade - together with the fish. The footage came to the RSPCA's attention after it was seen on Wooding's Facebook page. In it, after downing the cocktail, he nominates four other people to join the drinking game. The Neknominate phenomenon is understood to have emerged in Australia, with Wooding's believed to be the fifth such case to come to court in connection with the craze. After being interviewed about the video, Wooding later posted on Facebook: 'Some people's lives must be that sad and boring, to get any excitement they have to report me to the RSPCA for my Neknominate,' Wooding was also ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
Three claimants had challenged the new measures which set earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor the UK visas of spouses coming from abroad. A judge said the court would not "strike down" the rules, but urged the home secretary to adjust them. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the ruling proved they were "disproportionate". The Home Office introduced the rules in July 2012 to ease the financial burden of migration on the state. Under the new family migration policy only British citizens, or those with refugee status, who earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each extra child. The policy had been challenged on the basis that the rules were discriminatory and interfered with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life. The court concluded that the measures were not unlawful on the basis of discrimination, or due to a conflict with the statutory duty to regard the best interests of children while making visa decisions. Mr Justice Blake, sitting in London, said it would not be appropriate to "strike down" the financial requirements set out in the rules - which were laid before Parliament in June 2012. However, he said that the earnings threshold was disproportionate if combined with one of the four other requirements in the rules - for example, an inability to supplement a shortfall in income with savings, unless the savings were over £16,000. He said that while there may be sound reasons in favour of some of the individual requirements "taken in isolation", the combination of more than one of the five requirements of the rules was "so onerous in effect as to be an unjustified and disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal relationship". The judge also suggested that a more "proportionate financial requirement" might be to reduce the minimum income required of the sponsor alone to about £13,000.
In a written ruling, the judge said it would be "for the secretary of state, if she sees fit, to make such adjustments to the rules as will meet the observations of this judgement". The BBC's legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman says it is now for Mrs May to decide whether any amendments should be made to the rules to satisfy the requirements of proportionality. The home secretary has been given permission to appeal. Responding to the ruling, a Home Office spokesperson said: "Our family changes were brought in to make sure that spouses coming to live in the UK would not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support and would be able to integrate effectively. We're pleased that this judgment supports the basis of our approach. "We are looking closely at the judgment and its likely impact on the minimum income threshold before we decide how to respond. "In the meantime, where an applicant does not meet the minimum income threshold and there is no other reason to refuse it, the application will be put on hold." JCWI's legal and policy director, Saira Grant, said that while she was disappointed the financial requirement rule had not been overturned, her organisation was "very pleased that the judiciary has given a clear message that £18,600 is a disproportionately high requirement". She said the judge's comments represented a "clear message to (Home Secretary) Theresa May and she needs to sit up and listen". Ms Grant added that the judge's suggestion of a financial requirement of about £13,000 was a "reasonable, workable figure", but that people would still lose out. Meanwhile, a group of MPs and Lords known as the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration has called for an independent review of the minimum income requirement. In a review published last month, it looked at more than 175 cases from families affected by the rules.
Baroness Hamwee, chairwoman of the review and Liberal Democrat home affairs lead in the House of Lords, said the parliamentary group had been "struck by the evidence showing just how many British people have been kept apart from partners, children and elderly relatives". "These rules are causing anguish for families and, counter to their original objectives, may actually be costing the public purse," she said. The group said thousands of Britons had been unable to bring non-EU spouses to the UK since the minimum earnings requirements were introduced.

Jhon Jairo Velasquez, nicknamed Popeye, was the top hit man of late Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar. He confessed to killing 300 people and also claimed a hand in up to 3,000 killings in the 1980s and 1990s. But he also gave evidence against an ex-justice minister convicted of ordering the killing of a rival. Velasquez, 52, walked free from the Combita high-security prison on Tuesday to start a probation period of four years. He left under heavy police escort, a sign of the risks he believes he will face outside jail. The BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota says Colombia is divided over his early release. Several victims insist he still hasn't paid for all his crimes, while others say that after two decades in jail it is time to give him a second chance, our correspondent says. Velasquez was convicted for his part in the murder of presidential hopeful Luis Carlos Galan in 1989. But he later turned state's witness against former Justice Minister Alberto Santofimio, a rival candidate in the 1990 presidential election, who was convicted of ordering Mr Galan's killing. Mr Galan had taken a hard line against powerful drug cartels and was favourite to win the election, but he was was shot dead in a town outside Bogota as he prepared to give a speech. Santofimio, now serving a 24-year sentence, was a close associate of Escobar - the founder of the Medellin cartel which was engaged in a war against the Colombian state.
The Grand Tour presenter was admitted to hospital on Friday after falling ill while on a family holiday in Majorca. The 57-year-old posted a message on social media saying: "To keep you up to date, I'll be out of action for quite some time apparently." He said it was "really annoying" as he had never had a day off work. Clarkson also thanked fans for "all the good wishes". On Sunday, it was confirmed the former Top Gear host was being treated in a hospital on the Spanish island. Clarkson shared a photograph of tubes in his arm and his hospital identity tags around his wrist, writing: "Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday." He had been due to return to filming his new Amazon Prime series next week. End of Instagram post by jeremyclarkson1 Clarkson is the second Grand Tour host to be admitted to hospital this year. In June, Hammond, 47, was flown to hospital in Switzerland after crashing an electric super car in Switzerland. The car, which was being filmed for the latest series of The Grand Tour, burst into flames after Hammond escaped the wreckage. The presenter said he thought he was going to die during the incident, during which he became airborne and crashed after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland. End of Instagram post 2 by jeremyclarkson1 Clarkson made light of the situation on social media, saying the show's third co-presenter, James May, was now the only "functioning member" of the Grand Tour team, adding: "God help us." Clarkson was sacked from the BBC's Top Gear in 2015 after punching producer Oisin Tymon in an expletive-laden exchange. Co-presenters Hammond and James May also left the show and followed Clarkson to Amazon Prime. Clarkson apologised to Mr Tymon for the "unprovoked physical and verbal attack".

Authorities in Russia warned the FBI ‘multiple times’ about Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, though the ethnic Chechen could have slipped through the cracks because he was not linked to al Qaeda, it was revealed Tuesday by U.S. Senators who were briefed on the terrorist attacks. The federal agency looked into the eldest brother in 2011 after the Russian government contacted them, warning that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have deveoped radical Islamic ties following a prolonged trip to Russia, including Muslim-predominant Dagestan. However, after its initial search and interviews with him and his family members, the FBI closed the case, and has come under intense scrutiny for doing so. Scroll down for video . Conflicting: Tamerlan Tsarnaev turned from an 'arrogant' sportsman to an increasingly radical Muslim. Studying the Koran alone in Dagestan; Russian authorities tried to alert the FBI over the 'bomber' multiple times, according to lawmakers . Speaking with the Boston Herald, a senator sitting in on Tuesday’s confidential meetings on Capitol Hill said that the FBI could have missed Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s radicalization as he didn’t share links to the terror network al Qaeda. That senator spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Tuesday’s briefings were classified. Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told the Herald that the Russian government also had very different priorities. ‘Their concern was Chechen radicals. Our higher concern was al-Qaeda,’ he told the paper, explaining that the militant Islamist group was more dangerous to the U.S. in light of the 9/11 attacks. Lawmakers . again asked whether a failure to share intelligence contributed to the . deadly, after senior officials briefed them on the investigation into . last week's bombings, the Boston Globe reports. However, members of Congress have not . gone insofar as to say that better or more thorough intelligence could .

'There still seem to be serious . problems with sharing information, including critical investigative . information not only among agencies but also within the same agency . in one case,' Sen.

Now, she is finally on the road to recovery - and has been able to start living like any other student at a healthy 8st 9lbs. Ms Millar, from Berkshire, said: ‘I was obsessed with being the best in everything I did whether it was in sports events or school, I had to be the most successful or I wasn’t happy. ‘When I started puberty I couldn’t deal with all the changes happening to my body that I couldn’t control. ‘I had always competed in running and when younger talent started emerging and I wasn’t the best anymore I couldn’t handle it. ‘My weight was something I could control completely and so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else in my life.
Ms Millar, who now weighs a healthy 8st 9lbs, says that she started to skip meals and over-exercise when she began to feel that she was losing control of her life . Ms Millar (pictured since her recovery) said: 'My weight was something I could control so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else' ‘When I started at university I became even worse because there was no one there to realise what I was doing or to make sure I didn’t skip meals.’ Ms Millar first began to obsess about her weight when, aged 15, training started to become more of a chore than a hobby and she could feel herself losing grasp of the perfect life she had crafted for herself. Despite being a slim size eight, she felt this was not the best she could be and started skipping meals and heading to the gym as much as she possibly could. Ms Millar (pictured when she was ill) says that her weight loss increased when she started university as there was no one there to ensure that she was not skipping meals . Ms Millar (pictured, left, when she was ill and, right, since she has recovered) says that her health problems began when she struggled to cope with the fact that she was no longer the best runner in competitions . She said: ‘Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard. ‘I wanted to regain control of something and so I started to cut meals out and added in more and more gym workouts.’ Aged 18, Ms Millar was a healthy size eight and weighed about eight-and-a-half stone – healthy for her 5ft 6ins frame. But within a year, she had lost more than a third of her body weight, dropping to five stone.
Ms Millar (pictured taking part in an athletics competition) said: 'Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard' Despite her friends and family mentioning their worries, she was determined to keep losing weight and keep control of that part of her life. Ms Millar said: ‘I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. ‘He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym as people had been commenting on how worried they were about my weight. Ms Millar said: 'I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym' ‘I was furious to know that people had been talking about me behind my back but shocked that they were worried enough to make a comment. ‘I walked away from the gym feeling so embarrassed that I knew something had to change then and there. ‘I trawled the internet for somewhere that could help me and came across the Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team. ‘They tailor-made a less terrifying diet plan based on my current food and exercise regimes which gradually built up over time.’ Ms Millar says that being banned from the gym came as a shock to her because she had not realised that she was so thin. As soon as this happened, she started to look for help . Ms Millar has now returned to full health and is able to enjoy university weighing a healthy 8st 9lbs.
Her mother said: 'I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side' Ms Millar’s mother, Alison, said: ‘When Caitlin started becoming obsessed with her weight we knew that this was a battle that she had to face. ‘The more we tried to stop her from doing it the more we pushed her into doing it more. ‘We just had to hope that she got things under control herself. ‘Watching her so poorly was awful but all I could do was support her and try to look after her as much as I could. ‘I’m so happy she is better now though and back to her normal self. ‘I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side a much better and happier person.’

Waiting lists for designer handbags, clothes or even the latest must-have children's toy have become the norm. And now beauty companies have joined their ranks by garnering huge waiting lists before their products have even hit the shops. Lancome's DreamTone serum promising 'ground-breaking results' is the latest product to be in such high demand that it has accumulated a waiting list of 1,400 people before it is even released next week. In high demand: Lancome's Dreamtone serum has a waiting list of more than 1,400 people before it is even released next week . The cream is said to 'revolutionise' skin tone by reducing dark age spots by 66 per cent in just four weeks. The £69 serum isn't officially released until August 15, but stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Naomi Campbell are believed to already have a bottle of the coveted beauty product, The Times reports. The product is the result of seven years of research into the causes of hyperpigmentation. The Forever Light Creator anti-aging serum by Yves Saint Laurent accumulated a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month . It is not the first time that a beauty product has become a success before its even been released. The £125 anti-ageing cream Cult 51, which is said to contain the most expensive ingredients ever, had more than 5,000 people on the waiting list when it was released last month. Model Kelly Brook and singer Myleene Klass are believed to be fans of the night cream made by British chemist Richard Mears after being given pre-release samples. In trials so far, Cult 51 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks.
It is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days. It increases the skin’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks. Mr Mears said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘3D effects’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin. He said: 'Most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things, so consumers end up buying several products, such as those aimed at day time use, nights, the eyes and skin brightening, to get the full benefits. 'Brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales. However, there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it, preventing it from functioning naturally.' Yves Saint Laurent's Forever Light Creator range also totted up a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month. A record-breaking 15,000 free sample vouchers for the £61 serum were also downloaded before it even hit the shops. The company even set up a dedicated hotline for customers wanting to order the product as makers YSL attempted to keep up with demand. Shoppers wanting to buy Max Factor's Lashfinity 72-hour mascara were subject to a three-week waiting list earlier this year.

Newcastle ended their 20-game losing run in the Premiership with an enthralling 29-24 victory over Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park. Both sides scored three tries each and had their chances to score a four-try bonus win in an end-to-end second half but, after Noah Cato's 69th-minute score, the Falcons had the edge. Fittingly, Falcons' man of the match Ally Hogg ended 10 minutes of almost unbearable tension for the home crowd - after Tom Catterick crossed over for a try - when he booted the ball into the stand from a scrum right on the Newcastle line to end that losing run. Newcastle Falcons celebrate emphatically at the final whistle with victory over Exeter Chiefs . Newcastle Falcons players celebrate with the Kingston Park faithful in the South Stand on Sunday . It was a cracking game from the start with the Falcons making a mess of the kick-off as the ball rebounded back on the Exeter side and eventually a penalty into the corner saw Thomas Waldrom driven over from the line-out. It was Newcastle who reacted strongest and they launched several penetrating attacks with Hogg, Mark Wilson, Dom Barrow and Alex Tait feeding off Ruki Tipuna's darting runs. Two penalties resulted from the boot of Juan Pablo Socino in the 10th and 12th minutes. But Tipuna then paid the price for trying to run the ball out of defence as he threw a wild pass which saw flanker Ben White snap it up and break through for Exeter's second try. Almost immediately Socino released Hogg down the right and big number eight slipped the ball to Sinoti Sinoti, the winger scoring in the corner to make it 11-10 and then soon afterwards Socino landed a 50-metre penalty to increase the score to 14-10. Falcons back-rower Ally Hogg put in a man of the match performance against the Exeter Chiefs .

It was end-to-end stuff and when Newcastle made a mess of a line-out drive and turned the ball over, Exeter should have scored when they broke away. But Henry Slade kicked ahead when keeping the ball in hand would have really stretched the Falcons, who were vastly relieved to see the ball run into touch. The centre made up for his mistake when he scrambled over in the corner right on the stroke of half-time after some heavy-duty work by the Chiefs forwards and Gareth Steenson's conversion hit the bar to send Exeter take a narrow 15-14 lead into the break. Sinoti's typically aggressive run at the start of the second half led to a penalty which Socino banged into the Exeter 22 where the Chiefs infringed at the line-out maul and Socino slotted the ball home. Gareth Steenson (left) of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Adam Powell of Newcastle Falcons . But then three penalties from Steenson in the space of 13 minutes swung then game in Exeter's favour. A careless offside from Tipuna's box kick allowed Steenson to kick in the 52nd minute and then the Exeter fly half kicked another five minutes later for handling in the ruck, followed by a third for a scrummage offence in the 65th. But then Newcastle scored twice in three minutes to stand the game on its head. Adam Powell and Gonzalo Tiesi combined to send in Catterick under the posts before Socino converted to level the scores at 24-24. Newcastle swept back through Rob Hawkins' superb offload to Tait down the left and Cato scored in the corner to make it 29-24 leaving Newcastle in the driving seat as the clock counted down.
The £15m striker, 25, has yet to play this season after tearing ankle ligaments on the Hammers' pre-season tour of New Zealand. Carroll has started only 12 Premier League matches during an injury-hit 16-month spell at Upton Park. "It's been a long, hard road again for Andy and one he's been too familiar with recently, sadly," Allardyce said. "Hopefully he'll have a major impact when he comes back again." The striker has returned to training and Allardyce expects the England forward to feature in Under-18 and Under-21 games before a possible return to first-team action in mid-November. "It'll be another two to three weeks, if he has no niggles or problems, before we talk about playing him in the team at any level," he said. "We'll try to get him through three or four behind-closed-doors games and if that goes all right then we would hope to have him back." Allardyce says that the former Newcastle and Liverpool forward returned too soon from the foot injury that kept him sidelined for the first five months of last season. "Last time we got him back he did his ankle but carried on playing, so this time round we don't want to rush him," he said. Summer signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have impressed up front in Carroll's absence, and, with West Ham lying fourth in the Premier League table, Allardyce says the club can afford to take extra care over his return. "We're hopefully going to get him back as quick as we can but we're not going to rush him back because, touch wood, there's no desperate need at the moment." he said.
(CNN) -- A dry and mild spring led Don Villwock, like all of Indiana's corn and soybean farmers, to plant two weeks early this year. He was hopeful for a bountiful Labor Day harvest. But the rain didn't fall and June brought blistering heat. Now, as punishing drought grips the Midwest, Villwock, 61, walks his hard-hit 4,000 acres in southwest Indiana in utter dismay. Where there should have been tall, dark green, leafy plants, there now stand corn stalks that are waist high or, at best, chest high. They are pale in color and spindly. Fragile. Tired. Pull back an ear's husk and you find no kernels, he says. With temperatures rising above 95 degrees, the pollen starts to die. "It's emotionally draining," he said. "The crop got out of the ground very well. We were so optimistic. But maybe a few of us were counting our eggs before they were hatched." The costs of America's worst drought in 24 years is obvious to Villwock, who has been farming for four decades. They are not so apparent to American consumers -- at least, not yet. But down the line, people are certain to be paying more for food this year. Authorities have declared more than 1,000 counties in 26 states as natural disaster areas. A county is generally qualified as a natural disaster area if it has suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks. Farmers are then eligible for low-interest emergency loans from the Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency. Is the drought hitting your area? Let us know how you're coping on CNN iReport. As of Tuesday, 61% of land in the lower 48 states was experiencing drought conditions -- stretching from Nevada to South Carolina -- the highest percentage in the 12-year record of the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The parched conditions come after some areas of the United States suffered record-setting heat waves, killer storms and blazing wildfires. In America's Corn Belt, the prognosis for farmers is grim as fields and pastures become drier by the day. Villwock says the drought is already larger in scope than in 1988, and he fears it will intensify to become worse. Many areas in the southern Midwest are reporting the poorest conditions for June since 1988. Corn prices pop after lower production forecast . "In the hottest areas last week, which were generally dry, crop conditions deteriorated quickly," writes Rich Tinker, author of the Drought Monitor. He says 30% of the corn crop in the 18 primary corn-growing states is now in poor or very poor condition, up from 22% the previous week. Half of America's pastures and ranges are in poor or very poor condition, up from 28% in mid-June, he says. Think it's hot? Imagine living here . The sizzling conditions have also led to a dramatic increase in wildfire activity since mid-June, shortly after the High Park Fire ignited near Fort Collins, Colorado. During the past three weeks, acres scorched by wildfires went up from 1.1 million to 3.1 million. The past 12 months have been the warmest the United States has experienced since the dawn of record-keeping in 1895, the National Climatic Data Center said earlier this week. In Indiana, with water reservoirs at low levels, a mandatory water ban began Friday at noon in Indianapolis in hopes of saving an additional 25 million gallons a day. The ban mainly affects lawn watering. At Bilskie's Market in Indianapolis, owner Jim Bilskie says he has offered customers local produce for 40 years. This year, he's paying more for fruits and vegetables and says he has to pass on the costs. "The cost is high now," Bilskie told CNN affiliate WTHR.
"The wholesaler isn't making money. The cost is going up. We're not making money. It's outrageous." Mother nature's kill list . Iowa farmer Dave Miller, 60, has not seen rain in 21 days. His corn looked good until about two weeks ago when the soaring temperatures turned killer. "I'm about 50 percent short of needed moisture," he said. "In parts of southern Indiana, southern Illinois, they have been much drier for a longer period. We looked good, compared to them." At this stage, Miller needs 2 inches of rain right away to carry his corn crop as well as his soybeans, which will start aborting pods without adequate moisture. It will be challenging for many farmers, who often pay $800 to $1,000 per acre to plant a crop. Consumers will be hurting as well down the line when they feel the drought in their pocketbooks, says Miller, who is also the director of research and commodity services at the Iowa Farm Bureau. Corn prices have climbed 45% already, Miller says; soybeans, 22%. "In the short run, that doesn't show up in the grocery store," he said, since most of this corn is used as livestock feed. In fact, he said, meat prices could fall at first if farmers slaughter more animals to decrease the cost of buying feed. But eventually, Americans will pay more at the checkout counter. "It's likely that in three to six months from now, you will start seeing an increase in prices in the meat case," Miller said. "There will be a quicker impact on eggs and poultry because the production cycle is shorter." And even milk could see 4% to 6% price hikes if there are reductions in dairy herds. Villwock, the Indiana farmer, says he must wait now until the fall of 2013 before he can hope for a full harvest. Harsh weather affects everyone, but farmers are especially at the whim of Mother Nature, he says.
Meanwhile in Iowa, the forecast Friday included a 30% chance of rain, filling many hearts with hope. But last time Miller checked his radar, not one drop had fallen on his 350 acres. Extreme weather: Get ready to see more of it, scientists say .

Picture this: you've taken the week off work and booked a holiday on a remote tropical beach. You land, drop of your things and walk down to the shore Only to find a formidable mountain of thongs, plastic bottles and false teeth. Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach, a remote and tropical area in far northern Queensland . A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five days clearing the seven-kilometre shoreline . A turtle hatchling scrambles for the surf on Mapoon beach. It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion . Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach in northern Queensland. A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the charity Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five gruelling days cleaning the seven-kilometre shoreline. Amongst the expanse of waste they found fishing nets, false teeth, bags full of plastic bottles (some filled with urine) and an enormous army of toy soldiers. Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company got word of the waste from a local team of rangers. ‘We work closely with the local waste rangers. They said they had seen a lot of waste washing up in the direction of Mapoon beach, which is a hotspot for Marine debris. ‘It’s a very desolate area without many communities, so the rangers were naturally overwhelmed by the project and they called on us to come and help out.’ Mapoon is on the Gulf of Carpentaria, which gets a large amount of stray waste from the Arufuru Sea in Asia. The current then moves on towards the Northern Territory, harming all marine life in it's path. Taylor said the labels on much of the waste showed it had come from foreign shores.
‘The labels suggest the waste was predominantly from south-east Asia, which is consistent with our prior experience.’ Taylor said that since much of the waste was plastic, it can stick around in the ocean until a big tide comes and washes it ashore. 'The fact that most of the waste is coming from international waters certainly makes it more difficult to tackle as an issue. Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company works closely with the local waste rangers (pictured above) who advise her when there is significant waste buildup . A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the Tangaroa Blue Foundation sorts through 6000 thongs that washed up on the beach .

A ranger's four wheel drive transports ecotourist volunteers along Mapoon beach looking for turtle nests . 'It's a serious problem. It's impacting the marine life across the whole of the Cape York.' It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion. Amongst the masses of junk on the beach, the remains of local turtles were found. 'We need to work at this from a federal level using government agencies. It's the only way we can really have an impact on the waste disposal from our neighbouring countries. 'Some of this waste is coming from third world countries where there is barely no recycling institutions. The only way to impact this is through government co-operation.' Taylor says the issue is only going to get worse. 'The bottom-line is that our population is increasing. And more people means more waste. 'Tackling pollution needs to be a two pronged approach.
We need to continue to build teams to clean up the areas that are badly effected, but we also need to look at the data and put pressure on the companies that are producing the most waste and ask them to take more responsibility.' Tangaroa, the name for the god of the ocean in Polynesian mythology, has been operating in Australia since 2004. The foundation has reportedly removed 3 million pieces of marine debris from the Australian coastline. For more information check their official site here.
These unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old. Displayed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), they are the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation. According to the team that collected the designs, the structures reveal how mathematics can describe the world around us, even in its most complex forms. The unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old . The Clebsch Diagonal Surface is one of the most famous surfaces in mathematics. It was described by Alfred Clebsch in 1871. It is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface. The surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base. The 27 lines, etched in black, extend toward infinity. There are exactly 10 points on the structure’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet. These points are called Eckardt points, and the Clebsch diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them. Joshua Batson in Wired reports that the structures were created by Göttingen-based mathematician Felix Klein and displayed in Chicago in 1893. MIT, the University of Arizona, Harvard, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ordered a large collection of his models which are now on display. ‘Digitally controlled 3D printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago,’ Professor George Francis from the University of Illinois told MailOnline.

(CNN) -- A 48-year-old man faces several charges stemming from a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Portland, Oregon, authorities said. Donald Robert Welty is suspected of attempted assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct and harassment, according to Ansley Bernatz of Multnomah County Detention Center in Oregon. He is out on bail after his arrest Thursday. The Portland man faced federal charges of interference with flight crew and assault of a federal official, but the U.S. Marshals Service dropped a hold on Welty's detainment, Bernatz said. Details about the incident onboard were not immediately available. Representatives for the U.S. Marshals did not immediately return calls for comment. Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta, told CNN the airline "cooperated with the air marshals while in flight and provided assistance once it was on the ground in Portland." Delta did not provide any further information. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.
By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nicola Benedetti, whose album Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy has entered the top 20 of the UK Official Album chart . She became BBC Young Musician of the Year when she was 16, was named one of Britain’s most powerful young women earlier this year and already has an MBE and eight honorary degrees. But Nicola Benedetti has added yet another string to her bow. Yesterday she became the first solo British violinist since the 1990s to enter the Top 20 of the official UK albums chart with her record Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy. She is also the first ever Scottish classical artist to enter the Top 20. It’s at number 19 and expected to rise. The last British violinist to score a Top 20 album as a solo performer was Vanessa Mae in 1995. Nigel Kennedy achieved the same feat in 1989. Miss Benedetti, who is due to perform at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have reached the Top 20, not something a classical artist ever expects. This is a deeply personal recording inspired by Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy. 'The project took me deep into the heart of Scottish culture. I hope the music, in all its diversity, is providing some uplift and pleasure.’ Earlier this year the 26-year-old lashed out at critics who claim glamorous classical musicians succeed because of their sexy image rather than their artistic ability. She said it amounted to sexism when talented female artists were judged on their looks, adding: ‘Classical music can be prouder of its integrity than many industries. People are basically chosen for their ability.’ Miss Benedetti’s latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work.
She was named in Britain’s Top 30: The Young Female Power List, published in the Times in February, alongside the likes of Adele, Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge. Miss Benedetti's latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work . Her rendition of Scottish Fantasy, a piece of classical music written in 1880 by the German romantic composer Max Bruch, now sits in the mainstream chart alongside pop acts such as Will.i.am – a judge on BBC talent show The Voice. The number one spot was claimed by the rapper and producer. His new single has gone straight in at the top of the charts to give him his 10th UK number one. It’s My Birthday, featuring 17-year-old American singer Cody Wise, tops the pile 11 years after The Voice judge’s first number one, 2003’s Black Eyed Peas hit Where Is The Love, . He knocked reigning chart queens Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea down to two with Problem, while Ella Henderson also slides one to number three with Ghost, according to the Official Chart Company. The pop star now has five solo number one singles in Britain, the same as he has with the Black Eyed Peas.

San Diego (CNN) -- Introducing a new word: "cultuphobia." It means the fear that another person's culture is taking over your own. The word may be new, but the concept is ancient. America is a land of immigrants that has, in truth, never liked immigrants -- no matter where they came from and whether they came with the proper documents or a letter of reference from the Queen of England. Part of the reason that we don't like immigrants is because they frighten us. And one way in which they frighten us is because we worry that -- with the changes they bring -- they'll wind up marginalizing us and making us less important and less relevant. There is a name for that fear: cultuphobia. For an example, look at what happened this week to mark the launch of the new English-language, Latino-targeted television network Fusion, founded by ABC and Univision. The parent companies came up with what they thought was the cute idea of swapping anchors on their top-rated morning shows. The Spanish-language show, "Despierta America," which is based in Miami, sent hosts Raul Gonzalez and Karla Martinez to New York for some early morning chitchat with George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts, the hosts of "Good Morning America." Meanwhile, GMA sent Lara Spencer and Sam Champion to Miami to visit with the "Despierta America" crew. Come to think of it, this was a pretty good idea. And no one seemed to enjoy it more than the hosts who switched places. In New York, Gonzalez and Martinez were on the "Good Morning America" set on the same day as Enrique Iglesias, who sang a new song. Everyone seemed comfortable with one another, and there was a lot of laughing and dancing.
In Miami, Spencer told The Huffington Post that she "had no idea how much fun it was" to be on Spanish-language television and implored producers to "please have me back." Champion proclaimed that he loved the experience and didn't want to go back to New York. "I'm staying," he told the website. More laughing and dancing, this time to mariachi music. It is no wonder that it all went so well, proclaimed Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez, who was also a guest on "Despierta America" that day. His hit movie "Instructions Not Included" is in limited release in the United States. After all, these days, the language barrier is just a puddle jump and, he said, among Latinos in the U.S., "everyone speaks both English and Spanish." Here is where the story gets interesting. Judging from the reaction on the "Good Morning America" page on Facebook and the comment section following news stories about the switch, many regular viewers of "Good Morning America" did not appreciate the gimmick. In fact, many of them were furious. Some said they changed the channel. Others vowed to never watch the show again if there is a repeat performance. "This had better be a one-time thing," wrote one disgruntled viewer. One woman complained that, when she tunes in to her favorite morning news show, she expects to get what she always gets -- the news of the day "in ENGLISH." There's the giveaway. For many of those angry "Good Morning America" viewers, it might just have been a case of them preferring to stick with what they like. But for others, it was a case of cultuphobia. These viewers aren't just protecting their favorite show, but -- as they probably see it -- their language, culture and civilization. This is the other side to cultural marketing, and it's ugly.
A corporation -- or in this case, a media company such as ABC -- might vie for a larger market share by going after a new set of viewers and alienate its core audience members, who feel slighted, ignored or insulted. When that happens, the core isn't quiet. The core speaks up. Maybe next time, the company decides it isn't worth it. I hope that doesn't happen here. I hope ABC will stand its ground and continue down this road of trying to reach Latino viewers. Still, I'm not sure how Fusion will perform in the long run. I have concerns, and I'm not alone. While the new network is marketed to younger viewers who speak English, it doesn't seem that they've thought deeply about how to reach their viewers. That's not an easy demographic group to tap into, for either marketers or media. Plus, Fusion would be better off not becoming simply an English-language, hipper version of Univision, where -- as I would put it -- the anchors are white and the politics are blue. The liberal Spanish-language network is all about advocacy journalism and protecting what it sees as the interests of Latino immigrants -- especially the undocumented. Yet, on most of its telenovelas, which are produced in Mexico, the lead actress is European-looking with light skin. So, at Univision, they seem to believe that dark-skinned immigrants should have the full pallet of rights -- except, apparently, the right to appear in a starring role on Spanish-language television. That's evidence of a different kind of phobia, and a depressing reminder that -- in either language, and either of side of the border -- people are the same, and prejudice is alive and well.

Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story JERUSALEM — Food costs at the Israeli prime minister’s residence more than doubled after Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 2009, reaching nearly $120,000 in 2012, a third of it in takeout meals. The state paid about $2,000 a month to clean the Netanyahus’ private home in the seaside town of Caesarea, though the family spent most of its time in Jerusalem. A report published Tuesday by Israel’s state comptroller said these and other expenses — including $68,000 over two years in makeup, hairstyling and “presentation” for Mr. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara — “strayed from the cornerstone principles of financial management and the principles of proportionality, reasonableness, saving and efficiency.” Noting that Mrs. Netanyahu had reimbursed state coffers $1,035 after she was found to have pocketed the deposit money from recycled beverage bottles, the comptroller, Joseph Haim Shapira, said he had handed his investigative material over to the attorney general because it raised “suspicion of a criminal act.” “This is public money, and the law for a penny is the law for 100,” Mr. Shapira said in the introduction to the 36-page report. “Public trust in government institutions is the foundation stone of every democratic regime.” The much-anticipated report came a month before Israel’s elections on March 17, and Mr. Netanyahu’s challengers seized on it to buttress their assertion that he is out of touch with Israelis struggling to buy apartments and pay grocery bills.
The prime minister’s Likud Party called the surrounding media storm a slanderous campaign to topple him “through a focus on irrelevant minutiae” that “distract from the real issues at hand.” A statement by the Likud said, “There is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public’s integrity, and certainly no indication of any criminal transgression,” blaming an “embittered” former employee now suing for damages for the high expenses. Spending fell after that employee left, the statement noted, adding that many of the comptroller’s recommendations had already been adopted and that Mr. Netanyahu had “issued a directive to implement the remaining recommendations in the best and most effective manner possible.” The report’s publication came after weeks of critical news stories and commentaries about the first couple’s spending habits and treatment of employees, a recurrent theme of Mr. Netanyahu’s public life. Mrs. Netanyahu, a psychologist, has long been criticized as a mercurial boss who holds interminable grudges. The Netanyahus have survived previous spending scandals — in 2013 alone, there was the $127,000 installation of a rest chamber in the airplane that took the couple to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral, and the $2,700 annual budget for ice cream. (Pistachio for the prime minister; his wife prefers French vanilla.) The bottle-deposit affair, and the surreptitious transfer of new garden furniture from the official Jerusalem residence to Caesarea, threatened to take things up a notch.

Immediately afterward, we couldn’t really track any decline in the popularity of the Likud or Netanyahu himself, and, in fact, it maybe worked for his benefit.” Anticipating that the comptroller’s report would depict a life of luxury, Mr. Netanyahu posted a video on Facebook in which his wife toured the residence with a celebrity interior decorator, showing it more shabby than chic. The 15-minute video, highlighting frayed rugs, decayed doorjambs, cracked light fixtures, stained curtains and broken kitchen cabinets — viewed half a million times over two days — prompted a new cascade of criticism, including claims that it constituted both a severe security breach and an illegal campaign donation by the designer. Ben Caspit, a columnist who frequently criticizes the prime minister, called it a visit to “the royal cuckoo’s nest,” in which the couple showed “to what gutter level” they are “capable of lowering themselves and the country.” The vitriol rose after the release of the comptroller’s report. Zehava Gal-On of the leftist Meretz faction spoke of Mr. Netanyahu’s “hedonism” and “corrupt behavioral norms of a banana republic.” Others invoked Marie Antoinette. Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party asked: “What on earth were they eating there? Cornflakes with dolphin’s milk?
Dinosaur-egg omelets? Rhinoceros steaks?” The centrist Yesh Atid party said the report revealed a prime minister “who is totally disconnected and for whom the real problems of the people of Israel are the last thing on his mind.” Besides what it called “exaggerated” spending, the comptroller’s report said the Netanyahus had bypassed regulations to hire a private electrician connected to the Likud to do repairs in Caesarea on weekends and even on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, which could also lead to criminal charges. It also said public employees “paid out of their own pocket for items purchased” for the Netanyahus and were never reimbursed. Mitchell Barak, a Jerusalem political consultant who worked for Mr. Netanyahu in the 1990s but who now often criticizes him, said the prime minister had “successfully made himself look almost like a victim” over allegations that pale compared with those made against a predecessor, Ehud Olmert, who is facing a prison sentence after being convicted of taking bribes. “The average person who lives in Tel Aviv, who leans to the left, is flabbergasted and offended by it, but they were never going to vote for him,” Mr. Barak said. “For his voter base, which is going to be right of center, more religious, poorer population, they will concentrate on the fact that someone is trying to bring him down rather than what exactly is the content of what seems to be petty criminal activity.” In a scathing report with potential political and criminal repercussions, Israel's state comptroller sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday for excessive spending of public funds in his official and private residences.
The highly anticipated report, which came just four weeks before Israeli elections, faulted Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, for using public funds to spend lavishly on a variety of personal goods and services, including cleaning, clothing, water and grooming, between 2009 and 2012. The spending dropped after that.

(Abir Sultan / European Pressphoto Agency) Netanyahu defended his behavior, but political opponents seized on the report. Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog said he found the findings infuriating. “But it is not because of how you conduct yourself in your homes that the public wants to replace you, but because you have destroyed our home,” Herzog wrote on Facebook. “We will replace you because on your shift, Hamas grows stronger … young couples cannot buy a house … because you eat a $5000 breakfast when every third child in Israel goes to bed hungry.” The Netanyahus live and work in the official prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem and keep a private home in Caesarea, one of the country’s priciest spots. According to the report by Comptroller Joseph Shapira, spending on both often far exceeded necessity, formal budgets and good taste. In addition, the report pointed to improprieties in management of finances, human resources and external contractors. When Netanyahu took office in 2009, expenses at both residences totaled roughly a half-million dollars a year. By 2011, that had roughly doubled before dropping to about $600,000 in 2013.
Food and hosting expenses alone started out at about $55,000 and more than doubled to about $125,000 in 2011. After a modest cut in expenses the following year, expenses for 2013 dropped to near the 2009 level. One would expect an elected public official to demonstrate extra sensitivity and serve as an exemplary model of saving public funds. - Israeli State Comptroller Joseph Shapira Cleaning both residences came with a particularly high price tag: an monthly average of about $20,000 between 2009 and 2013, including more than $2,000 a month for the Caesarea house, which was usually empty. Shapira found this spending “significantly exaggerated.” About $20,000 a year was spent to order meal deliveries, despite employing an in-house cook. These and other expenses, Shapira wrote, were “not compatible with the basic principles of proportionality, reasonability, economy and efficiency.” Personal grooming expenses for the prime minister and his wife totaled well over $100 a day, which Sharpira found to be more than double the budgeted amount. Some of the findings could lead to criminal proceedings. According to the report, Sara Netanyahu finagled employing an electrician who was barred by protocol because he was a personal friend and a member of the prime minister’s political party, Likud. Justice authorities will have to decide how to address other breaches, including money kept temporarily from recycling bottles from the official residence several years ago and a set of patio furniture bought for the official residence but transferred to the private one. While these were noted in the report, they were not officially investigated.
“Public trust in government institutions is a cornerstone of every democracy,” Shapira wrote, adding that such institutions must gain this trust by adhering to both law and “moral norms.” While he welcomed the apparent cost-cutting after 2012, the comptroller said “one would expect an elected public official to demonstrate extra sensitivity and serve as an exemplary model of saving public funds.” Netanyahu was well-prepared for the report, as his attorneys and aides responded swiftly with a press conference, stressing there were no grounds for criminal concerns. The prime minister, said his spokesman, Nir Hefetz, respects the report and has instructed his staff to act on its recommendations. A statement from Netanyahu's Likud party accused the news media of pushing the issue for weeks in a “clear effort to remove the prime minister from office … through a focus on irrelevant minutia." The statement added that the uproar was distracting from "the real issue at hand,” which is “who will defend Israel in the face of the real security threats and pressure from the international community”—Netanyahu or rivals Herzog and Tzipi Livni. But for others, money matters are a real issue, and the prime minister's spending has struck a nerve with some voters who are concerned about the high cost of living and are demanding what they consider a more just distribution of resources. Housing prices have soared since Netanyahu took office, and with 1.6 million people below the poverty line, Israel has the third highest poverty rate in the 34-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Sobelman is a special correspondent A damning official report into spending by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at his official residence in Jerusalem and private seaside home has accused him of excessive and improper use of public funds, including spending huge amounts on takeaway food, hairdressing and cleaning..
Prepared by Israel’s state comptroller, Yosef Shapira – and passed to the country’s attorney general to consider whether any laws have been broken – the report is potentially highly damaging to Netanyahu, coming only a month before Israel’s elections. The government auditor’s report appears to confirm allegations that have been rumbling for several years of excessive spending by Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, and a lack of proper management of the costs in the prime minister’s official home. It has come on top of lurid allegations, detailed in a civil court case, of the high-handed and abusive treatment of staff in the official residence by Sara – claims strongly denied by the Netanyahus. What has made the issue potentially politically toxic in the middle of an election campaign – where Netanyahu is running neck and neck with his main rivals – is the sharp contrast it has afforded to Israelis suffering under a high cost of living. The claims of potential illegal conduct centre on two issues: the so called “bottle-gate affair”, which saw Sara Netanyahu pocket deposits on bottles of drinks paid for by the state, later reimbursed; and claims that garden furniture bought for the official residence was sent to their private home. Among spending items criticised in the report is a bill to the Israeli state for more than $18,000 (£11,700) for takeaway meals in a single year, despite the fact that the Netanyahus are provided with a cook and staff at the government’s expense. Another expenditure highlighted was the cost of cleaning for Netanyahu’s private home in the upmarket beach resort of Caesarea. It cost the Israeli state $2,120 a month – more than the monthly income of many Israelis – despite the fact that the Netanyahus spend the majority of their time at the official residence in Jerusalem.
Netanyahu was also criticised for excessive spending on a raft of other items including hairdressing, clothes, water consumption and electrical repairs made at the taxpayer’s expense at his private home. The official examination of the expenses – incurred between 2009-13 – showed that cleaning costs claimed at the Netanyahus’ two residences doubled without explanation from an already hefty $138,000 in 2009 at the official residence alone. Perhaps most damaging of all is the revelation that employees of the prime minister’s office were obliged to pay for some of Netanyahu’s personal expenses out of their own pockets – often small sums and not reimbursed. “The meaning of a failure to pay back these invoices from petty cash is that employees absorb the cost of private expenditures of the prime minister or his family,” the comptroller wrote in his report. “When an employee is forced to pay from his own pocket for an expenditure by the prime minister, this is improper administration and it makes no difference whether the sum is large or small.” In a scathing assessment, Shapira concluded: “The way in which the budget of the prime minister’s residence was managed during the years 2009 until 2012 does not comply with the basic principles of money management, saving and efficiency and is likely to result in a waste of public funds.” One of the murkier episodes detailed in the report relates to the employment of an electrician who was a member of Netanyahu’s own Likud party, and who, because of that, was not authorised to do state-funded work at their private home. The report noted that nobody examined the need for the work – which continued for three months – and there was no examination of whether the work was actually performed, as everything was coordinated between Sara Netanyahu or one of her staff.
Replying to the report’s findings, Netanyahu’s party issued a statement saying that while Netanyahu respected “the findings … in relation to all the matters which were investigated … there is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public’s integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions.” The statement added: “A large portion of the recommendations in the report were implemented even prior to its release. The prime minister has issued a directive to implement the remaining recommendations in the best and most effective manner possible.” Discussion of the lifestyle enjoyed by the Netanyahus has become one of the longest-running soap operas in Israeli media and politics, both taking a star turn in the court cases brought by former staff – who have complained of Sara Netanyahu’s alleged abusive behaviour and tantrums. Condemned as “evil gossip” by the couple, the saga has prompted thinly veiled comparisons over the last year between Sara and Marie Antoinette and arch digs at the imperial pretensions of Bibi, as the prime minister is nicknamed. The controversy has been exacerbated by the Netanyahus’ own efforts in recent days to pre-empt the report. Those efforts saw them invite television celebrity interior designer Moshik Galamin (a friend of the couple) to inspect their official residence on the eve of the report’s publication, with Galamin videoed as he was shown round by Sara. The tour was then posted on the prime minister’s Facebook page. The video purports to depict run-down furnishings, peeling paint and a grotty kitchen, which Galamin declares looks “like the kitchen of a Romanian orphanage from 1954”.
“The moment you come here at night, you’ll catch the prime minister on this chair snacking on all sorts of forbidden things, like a sandwich or yellow cheese,” Sara tells the designer, in what appears to be an attempt to reinforce an image of him as an ordinary guy. “The dish we like best is schnitzel and mashed potatoes and pasta!” The problem – as the reports in Israel’s media have extensively charged – is that the video appears to have been disingenuous at the very least. The kitchen featured in Galamin’s video, say critics, is the general kitchen of the residence where employees take their meals, apparently infrequently used by the prime minister. The Netanyahus’ own kitchen – not shown in the video but later displayed on Israeli television – is reportedly a newly renovated affair located on another floor. The Labour MP Shelly Yachimovich, who has in the past called on Israel’s media to leave off Sara Netanyahu, was scathing ahead of publication. Describing the video as “pathetic” and “ridiculous”, she accused Netanyahu of “cowardice” for putting his wife forward to deflect the heat. “He passed responsibility to his wife He put her in centre-stage saying: ‘I’m off to work, Sara will show you the house, that’s her kingdom.’ Beyond the chauvinistic aspect, this was done with the next day’s state comptroller’s report in mind, to create the alibi of ‘it’s not me, it’s her’.” “Ultimately,” she added, “we look [to] our leaders, we want them to lead their people, not live like emperors, disconnected completely from the lives of ordinary people.”
By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 21:25 EST, 25 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 26 September 2012 . If the drudgery of the daily commute has lost its charm, businessman Jeremy Paxton may have the high-octane antidote. He's started doing his treks to the office on an amazing water-powered jet pack that appears to owe more to the technology of James Bond and Buzz Lightyear than the Clapham omnibus. Instead of getting the car out of the garage or heading to the bus stop, he straps on the device, which uses water pressure to lift him up to 30ft in the air and propel him along horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph. Scroll down for demo! To infinity and be-Bond! Jeremy Paxton shows off his 007-style jet pack which he uses to commute to work . Water way to travel: The jet pack can lift Mr Paxton up to 30ft in the air and propel him horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph . He says the 40-mile journey from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds is possible because the River Thames and waterways run direct between the two. Though he does have to walk the last three minutes to his office. Mr Paxton, 51, has also been asked to be the UK's 'test pilot' and to compile a 'Pilot User Guide' for other would-be customers. But the fun comes at a price. The jet pack, which is imported from Germany where it is made under license from American company JetLev, will set you back a cool £115,000 – enough to buy an Aston Martin V8 Vantage for 007 and still have change for a few gadgets.
Who needs the car: The 51-year-old uses the device to travel from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds . A practical plaything: Depending on the pilot's weight, a JetLev Flyer can top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling, with a range of around 80 miles . The jet pack is not a rocket. Instead it operates on the same principle as a giant pump by generating huge amounts of water pressure to provide a thrust similar to that of a fireman’s hose. Mr Paxton, whose business interests include the Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire, an upmarket 600-acre waterside community of eco-friendly luxury second-homes in the Cotswolds, said: 'I’m the first person in Britain to buy one. I just like alternative means of transport. 'It’s a different way to commute. It’s better than sitting in a traffic jam or being stuck on a crowded train. It’s environmentally-friendly. 'It’s fantastic fun and it’s not complicated to operate. I often commute to London by train and sometimes take my boat to the station. I have a pilot’s licence and fly planes and helicopters. Why not this?’ 00-heaven: The jet pack, designed by Chinese-born Canadian Raymond Li, was inspired by the one used by James Bond in the opening scenes of the 1965 film Thunderball (right) A Toy Story: The jet pack is not too dissimilar to the backpack used by Buzz Lightyear (right) The jet pack comprises a number of key parts. First, there is the pack itself which resembles the one used by James Bond in Thunderball or by Buzz Lightyear in the movie Toy Story.
This is connected to a 33ft hose which in turn is connected to a boat-like flotation device, inside which is a 250cc four-stroke petrol motor. The 'boat' is the pump generator and sits in the water sucking up vast quantities of water which are then forced through the hose and into the jet nozzles on a special lightweight carbon-fibre frame weighing 30lbs strapped to the pilot’s back. The sheer force of this jet lifts the pilot off the ground or out of the water. He or she then controls the speed by a motor-cycle-style twist-grip on one of the handles. Direction is just like flying and depends on the pilot shifting his or her weight. The maximum altitude is limited by the length of the tube, which also limits the distance from water a pilot can travel. A digital fly-by-wire system is used to . control the throttle which the makers say make flight controls simple, . light and intuitive. Mr Paxton added: 'It’s entirely buoyant so it won’t sink. You can go 30ft high or hover over the water – even walk on the water. 'If . you want to go right you put down your right hand you can do tight . turns. After a few goes, you get the hang of it It’s like riding a . bicycle. You have a "kill switch" around your wrist to cut the power.' Inspired by the jet pack used in the . opening scenes of Thunderball, the Jetlev is the brainchild of Raymond . Li, a Chinese-born Canadian who first . sketched out his concept on a yellow Post-it Note in 2000 and spent the . next 10 years developing it.
The makers say that, depending on pilot weight, a standard JetLev Flyer could top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling with a range of around 80 miles. It can accommodate pilots of 1.5metres to 2metres in height and between 40kg and 150kg in weight. Mr Paxton is himself a keen flyer who has his own aeroplane and helicopter. Earlier this month, he abseiled down London’s new Shard skyscraper with the Duke of York in aid of charity. The makers say basic skills can be mastered in just 15 minutes though intermediate skills will take between one and 10 hours.

By . Beth Stebner and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:51 EST, 13 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 13 June 2012 . An NYPD cop charged with gunning down an unarmed teenager in the Bronx pleaded not guilty in court today, eliciting cheers from his brethren in blue, but tears from the teen’s parents. New York Police Department Officer Richard Haste, 31, surrendered Wednesday morning and pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in a courtroom filled with other officers, relatives of 18-year-old victim Ramarley Graham, and their supporters. Graham was killed during a February 2 narcotics raid in the Wakefield neighbourhood of the Bronx. Haste thought Graham had a gun, and shot him in front of his grandmother and little brother as he tried to flush marijuana down the toilet, officials said. Applause: Richard Haste is applauded as he leaves the court in New York on Wednesday . Supporters try to block photographers from taking pictures as New York City Police Dept. officer Richard Haste, center, gets in a car after posting bail in New York . Anguish: Constance Malcolm, left, and Frank Graham, right, parents of 18-year-old Ramarley Graham cry as they attend the arraignment of NYPD officer Richard Haste . Moment of grief: Haste pleaded not guilty to charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter for the February shooting in the death of 18-year-old Graham . Not guilty: NYPD officer Richard Haste (centre, left) flanked by his lawyers Stuart London, (left) and Michael Martinez, (centre, right) plead not guilty . The scene at Bronx Criminal Court was a dramatic one, as Haste, wearing a dark grey suit and tie and on crutches, uttered only two words: ‘Not guilty,’ according to the New York Daily News.
'Ramarley was only 18,' his mother, Constance Malcolm, said outside court. 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has to stop. Something has to come out of this.' She then pleaded: 'Help me get justice for my son.' As Haste left the courtroom after posting $50,000 bail, dozens of officers applauded him. He was on crutches because of an unrelated accident and walked slowly to a car, while a small group of protesters chanted anti-police slogans behind him. The February shooting stemmed from an NYPD investigation of a persistent drug trade in the Bronx neighbourhood where Graham lived. At the time, police said investigators identified Graham as a potential suspect and radioed to other officers that he appeared to be armed with a pistol. Day in court: Haste, left, was on crutches from an unrelated incident; right, Judge Martin Marcus, who is presiding over the case, set bail at $50,000 . A witness told police that around the same time, two officers wearing NYPD jackets pulled up and yelled at a man - apparently Graham - 'Police! Don't move!' After the man ducked into Graham's three-family home, the officers found a back entrance, climbed some stairs and broke down the door to a second-floor apartment where Graham lived with his grandmother and other relatives, police said. An officer positioned behind Haste reported seeing Graham run toward a bathroom. He also heard Haste yell, 'Show me your hands!' and 'Gun! Gun!' before a shot rang out, police said. Crammed together in the tiny bathroom, Haste yelled for Graham to hold up his hands, and when the teen reached for his waistband, the officer fired, according to his lawyer, Stuart London.
'I thought he was going to shoot me, so I shot him,' Haste said in a court statement read by Mr London. Haste fired one shot at close range from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, police said. Graham was struck in the upper chest and collapsed in the bathroom. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Unarmed: Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot and killed at his Bronx home in February by an NYPD officer . Officials said Graham was trying to flush a small amount of marijuana down the toilet as Haste approached . A search of the apartment didn't turn up any weapons. Police said they found marijuana in the toilet.Officers are allowed to use deadly force when they have a reasonable belief that they are facing an imminent threat of serious injury or death. But in the small Bronx bathroom, it was obvious there was no gun, and Haste should not have fired, District Attorney Robert Johnson said. 'We have too much of this going on and it . has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has . to stop. Something has to come out of this.' -Constance Malcolm . 'He had to know that he did not see a gun,' he said. However, Mr London said that Haste, who graduated from Lehman High School, had never before fired his gun in the line of duty in four years of service, according to the New York Post. ‘When he woke up that morning, he had no intention of firing his weapon,’ Mr London told the Post.The family has said Graham was shot as his grandmother and his 6-year-old brother looked on. Outside court Wednesday, a large group of supporters said they are holding vigils every Thursday in the Bronx for 18 weeks to celebrate the teen's life. His father, Frank Malcolm, broke down weeping when he said the boy wouldn't be home for Father's Day this weekend.
Plea for peace: Outside of court, Constance Malcolm pleaded 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We can't keep killing our kids' Pause: The teen's father Frank takes a moment to close his eyes as Ramarley's mother looks out over the press . 'Haste is going home to his family. When we leave here we're going to the cemetery,' he said. 'I keep asking why. Why did he kill our son? Why, why, did he kill our son? 18 years old. 18. He did nothing to deserve this.' Police Commissioner Ray Kelly ordered a review of whether training and tactics were sufficient in the street narcotics division, where Haste worked. The division differs from full-time narcotics police, who are more specialized. Haste had been on the force for four years and in the unit just weeks before the shooting. He had never before fired his weapon in the line of duty. Kelly said some adjustments were made to the unit after the review. An order was put out codifying requirements officers needed to meet before going into the unit, but he didn't specify what the changes were. Support: The Rev. Al Sharpton, left of centre, puts an arm on the back of Constance Malcolm after the arraignment as she wipes away tears . Outside the courthouse Wednesday, police union president Patrick Lynch said he respected the Graham family's grief but called it a tragedy resulting from a difficult situation. 'Today, we're here to show support for a New York City police officer who was put in a terrible position doing a difficult job,' Lynch said as the protesters chanted, 'NYPD. KKK. How many kids will you kill today?' Supporters of Graham's family said they worry officers were expecting trouble simply because Graham was black. They also say Haste, who is white, used excessive force. 'We're not looking for revenge. We're looking for justice,' the Rev.
Al Sharpton, a family supporter, said afterward.
A disciplined Blackburn frustrated Liverpool as the Championship side held their Premier League opponents to a scoreless draw and forced an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Gary Bowyer's side kept the Reds plethora of superstars at bay and will host them again at Ewood Road, with his towering striker Rudy Gestede proving tough to contain for Brendan Rodgers' men, especially after the departure on a stretcher by Martin Skrtel following an ugly fall early on. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Anfield. Blackburn Rovers' Rudy Gestede proved a handful for Liverpool's defence in their FA Cup draw . LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1) SIMON MIGNOLET - 6.5 . Looked shaky under his first high ball, but settled and produced a fantastic save to keep out a goal-bound header from Baptiste. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet makes a reflex save after Blackburn's Alex John-Baptiste heads on target . GLEN JOHNSON - 6 . Almost turned a cross into his own goal in the first half but got forward well as Liverpool seized the upper hand. MARTIN SKRTEL - 6 . Knocked out inside two minutes after falling awkwardly when challenging Gestede and carried off on a stretcher. Martin Skrtel gives fans a double thumbs up as he left the pitch on a stretcher after a nasty fall . DEJAN LOVREN - 6 . Had his hands full with Gestede after Skrtel’s exit and struggled with the big Blackburn striker at times. Reds defender Kolo Toure hits this close-range chance into the back of the net but was judged offside . LAZAR MARKOVIC - 6.5 . Lively down the Liverpool right but faded and replaced by Balotelli just before the hour mark. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6.5 .
Another reassured display from the Liverpool skipper. Unlucky not to break the deadlock with a late effort. Lazar Markovic (centre) was lively for the Reds down the right side but was replaced by Mario Balotelli . EMRE CAN - 6 . Played in midfield again and looked solid enough without producing anything spectacular. RAHEEM STERLING - 5.5 . Didn’t make as much of an impression as he can and struggled to get into the game. Headed late chance wide. Raheem Sterling turns inside Rovers' Adam Henley during their FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5.5 . The little Brazilian has scored some memorable goals recently but didn’t have his shooting boots on, twice firing well off target . ADAM LALLANA - 5 . Guilty of poor distribution in the first half and did not have a big enough impact on the game for a player of his calibre. Adam Lallana appeals for a penalty but he was legally dispossed by Blackburn's Matthew Kilgallon . DANIEL STURRIDGE - 6.5 . Became more of a threat as the game wore on, and had one great effort on goal end of first half, but will be disappointed not to trouble Blackburn more. Subs: Ward, Toure (for Skrtel 11, 6) Lambert, Moreno, Sakho, Balotelli (for Markovic 59, 6), Williams. Booked: Can . Manager: Brendan Rodgers – 5 . Brendan Rodgers (right) issues directions to Raheem Sterling during the frustrating draw . BLACKBURN (4-2-3-1) SIMON EASTWOOD - 7 . Had less to do than he might have expected early on but produced great reflex saves to deny Sturridge and Henderson. ADAM HENLEY - 6.5 .
Battled well throughout but fortunate to avoid a booking for a late challenge on Can. Adam Henley gets tight on Sterling during a committed performance from the battling Blackburn defender . MATTHEW KILGALLON - 7.5 . Made some great challenges, including one interception on Lallana in the first half, but rode his luck by holding back Sturridge in the box. ALEX BAPTISTE - 7 . Declared fit after hamstring problem and so nearly emerged as Blackburn’s hero but his header was saved by Mignolet. Defender Alex Baptiste (right) makes a lunging tackle on Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Baptiste heads Blackburn's best chance of the match only for it to be denied by Mignolet . MARTIN OLSSON - 6.5 . Kept on his toes by Markovic but coped well on the whole to make sure Liverpool were limited to hopeful balls into the box. LEE WILLIAMSON - 7.5 . Worked tirelessly in front of his defence to ensure that Liverpool did not have the time and space to pick off their Championship opponents. Lee Williamson (right) worked tirelessly against the Reds' star-studded attack, including Philippe Coutinho . CORRY EVANS - 6.5 . Hasn’t been the best weekend for the Evans family, but he’ll be more than satisfied with a solid performance here . CRAIG CONWAY - 6 . Had Blackburn’s best chance of the first half but blazed high and wide with only Mignolet to beat from just inside the box. TOM CAIRNEY - 6.5 . Impressed in a central role behind Gestede, particularly in the first half when Blackburn were more not pinned back in their own half. Booked for high challenge on Balotelli.
Blackburn's Tom Cairney (right) impressed for his side in behind Gestede . BEN MARSHALL - 6 . Replaced by Taylor midway through the second half after putting in a decent shift on the left side of Blackburn’s midfield . RUDY GESTEDE - 8 . Posed a real problem for the Liverpool defence from the moment Skrtel was injured. Won almost every high ball and provided a vital outlet for his team. Blackburn's Rudy Gestede endures close attention from Emre Can as the Rovers held the Reds to 0-0 . Subs: Spurr, Brown, Rhodes, Taylor (for Marshall 68, 6), Henry, Lenihan, Steele. Booked: Cairney . Manager: Gary Bowyer – 7 . Rovers manager Gary Bowyer gets caught up in the moment as his side kept Liverpool at bay . Referee: Andre Marriner 6.5 . Star man: Rudy Gestede .
(CNN) -- Former England cricket captain Michael Atherton has called him "ruthless," but for Lalit Modi, the man behind cricket's revolutionary Indian Premier League and vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), this is less of a criticism and more a statement of fact. Bringing glitz to the game, Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian revolution. "I am ruthless, without doubt," he told CNN's Talk Asia in Mumbai. "Otherwise we wouldn't get where we were." Many believe that Modi, 44, has taken cricket into a new era, turning a sport that can be baffling to watch and take five days to play, into a brightly-colored instant hit of action taking just a few hours. With cheerleaders, the best players in the world and even Bollywood stars as part owners of some of the teams, Modi has concocted a recipe fit for prime-time TV consumption, in a country renown for its passion for the game. Modi's came up with the idea of a new Indian cricket league came 14 years ago, but resisted the involvement of the BBCI at that time, citing too many vested interested within India's main cricketing body that would have spoiled his ideas. While ruthless he is also astute to the financial potential of cricket in India and the IPL. After graduating from Duke University in the U.S. in sports management he returned to India to launch ESPN and 10 Sports. Coming from a family that controls Modi Enterprise, an industrial conglomerate worth $1.5 billion, Modi admits his family were concerned that he was moving away from business and spending so much time with cricket while setting up the IPL. "They didn't think that I'll be spending so much time with cricket, and cricket has taken up so much time of my time, but the job has made it so demanding.
Either I do it well, and if I do it well then I need to give the time for it," he told CNN. It's been time well spent, both professionally and personally: Modi has his own private jet, gets mobbed in the streets by fans and can hang out with Bollywood stars. Yet he hasn't made a fortune from the IPL: "I have an honorary position and BCCI is a charity and a trust. It's a nonprofit-making organization and we do this for development of the game and I'm passionate about the game." However as vice-president of the BCCI he has been instrumental in boosting its revenues, brokering television deals and sponsorship associations that could see it top the $1 billion mark in the next five years. It's no surprise that such an iconoclastic figure in a game rooted in tradition has his personal critics and those that are skeptical about the direction he is taking the game. Modi was not without controversy himself, as he was accused of drug dealing and abduction while at university, claims that were never proven. The 20-over version of the game played in the IPL has worried some that the finer points of the game may be sacrificed for the instant, mass-market appeal. But for Modi, it's quite simple: "We've hit records in viewership, record numbers in sponsorships sales, record number in team franchise sales, the owner themselves have done so well, the stadiums are full. We got Bollywood involved, I mean it's a script that I couldn't have written better myself."

An analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients. 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it,' said John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist. Scroll down for video . This powered rock that shows there may once have been life on Mars: Analysis of a rock sample collected by the curiosity rover found key chemical ingredients for life, Nasa said today . Curiosity made the assessment after . studying a powdered sample drilled from a fine-grained rock at its . exploration site in Gale Crater, a deep impact bowl on Mars' equator. The rock was analysed in two of the rovers onboard chemistry labs: Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and . Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. 'A fundamental question for this mission . is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment,' said . Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the . agency's headquarters in Washington. 'From what we know now, the answer . is yes.' The groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes. Scientists identified sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in Gale Crater on the Red Planet last month. Clues to this habitable environment come from data returned by the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments.
The data indicated the Yellowknife Bay area the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbes. The rock is made up of a fine-grained mudstone containing clay minerals, sulfate minerals and other chemicals. This ancient wet environment, unlike some others on Mars, was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty. The patch of bedrock where Curiosity drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of Gale Crater. The bedrock also is fine-grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions, including nodules and veins. a self-portrait of Curiosity at the drilling site where the discovery was made . This set of images shows the different types of rocks seen by NASA's Opportunity rover and Curiosity rover at two different parts of Mars. On the left is 'Wopmay' rock, in Endurance Crater, Meridiani Planum, as studied by the Opportunity rover. On the right are the rocks of the 'Sheepbed' unit in Yellowknife Bay, in Gale Crater, as seen by Curiosity. Curiosity's drill collected the sample at a site just a few hundred yards away from where the rover earlier found an ancient streambed in September 2012. 'Clay minerals make up at least 20 percent of the composition of this sample,' said David Blake, principal investigator for the CheMin instrument at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. These clay minerals are a product of the reaction of relatively fresh water with igneous minerals, such as olivine, also present in the sediment, Nasa said. The reaction could have taken place within the sedimentary deposit, during transport of the sediment, or in the source region of the sediment. The presence of calcium sulfate along with the clay suggests the soil is neutral or mildly alkaline.
Scientists were surprised to find a mixture of oxidized, less-oxidized, and even non-oxidized chemicals, providing an energy gradient of the sort many microbes on Earth exploit to live. This partial oxidation was first hinted at when the drill cuttings were revealed to be gray rather than red. This side-by-side comparison shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of two different samples collected from the Martian surface by NASA's Curiosity rover. The Rocknest reading (left) suggests a dry, aeolian (wind-shaped) environment with low water activity. The John Klein pattern (right) suggests a lacustrine (lakebed) environment with high water activity. This full-resolution image from NASA's Curiosity shows the turret of tools at the end of the rover's extended robotic arm on Aug. 20, 2012 . 'The range of chemical ingredients we have identified in the sample is impressive, and it suggests pairings such as sulfates and sulfides that indicate a possible chemical energy source for micro-organisms,' said Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator of the SAM suite of instruments at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An additional drilled sample will be used to help confirm these results for several of the trace gases analyzed by the SAM instrument. 'We have characterized a very ancient, but strangely new 'gray Mars' where conditions once were favorable for life,' said John Grotzinger, Mars Science Laboratory project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. This false-color map shows the area within Gale Crater on Mars, where NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Aug. 5, and the location where Curiosity collected its first drilled sample at the 'John Klein' rock . 'Curiosity is on a mission of discovery and exploration, and as a team we feel there are many more exciting discoveries ahead of us in the months and years to come.'
Scientists now plan to work with Curiosity in the 'Yellowknife Bay' area for many more weeks before beginning a long drive to Gale Crater's central mound, Mount Sharp. Investigating the stack of layers exposed on Mount Sharp, where clay minerals and sulfate minerals have been identified from orbit, may add information about the duration and diversity of habitable conditions.
An online register would include a list of organisations which spend large amounts of cash employing people to influence MSPs. In 2013, the Scottish government announced plans to legislate on lobbying, but no bill has yet emerged. Ministers said they remained committed to taking the issue forward. The cross-party standards committee recommended the register should cover "significant" lobbying activity, which would also take in organisations which have sustained contact with politicians. They would need to provide information on meetings with MSPs, events and hospitality involving MSPs and details of what the lobbying aimed to achieve. Healthy democracy Committee convener Stewart Stevenson, an SNP MSP, said: "Lobbying is a legitimate, valuable and necessary part of a healthy democracy. "But a parliament founded on openness must seek to make clear who is lobbying, on what issues, and why." Plans for a register of lobbyists - originally suggested by Labour MSP Neil Findlay - were put forward in the wake of events at Westminster, after three peers were accused of agreeing to carry out parliamentary work for payment. The Scottish Parliament has remained free of any serious lobbying scandal, apart from an incident in 1999 when the Observer newspaper reported that public relations firm Beattie Media touted for business by offering privileged access to Scottish ministers. A Scottish government spokesman welcomed the committee's report, adding: "We have repeatedly said that the standards committee's inquiry into lobbying is central to determining the best way forward and we will now take the time to carefully consider its findings. "The Scottish government remains committed to take forward the development of a Lobbying Transparency Bill."

These shocking images show a group of horses in agony after they were found on a housing estate trapped in barbed wire. The RSPCA has launched an urgent investigation after tearful residents discovered the frail animals tethered on a plot of urban land. Five horses and a pony were found on a small patch of grass on a council estate in Low Simonside, near Jarrow, South Tyneside. Wounded and neglected: Local residents were reduced to tears at the sight of a frail group of horses tethered behind gates. They were found on a housing estate trapped in barbed wire . One of the animals required urgent help after it was found dragging barbed wire from its leg and mane. But despite the state of the animals the council has so far been powerless to remove the horses and appeals to the owner have been ignored. Both the RSPCA and South Tyneside Council are trying to resolve the issue but the owner has so far refused a notice demanding he remove his horses from the public land. Alan Bartlett, 66, whose home overlooks the site, said: 'Itâ€™s absolutely disgusting and a disgrace that horses should be left like that.' Trapped in barbed wire: One of the horses required urgent help after it was found dragging barbed wire from its leg and mane. The RSPCA has launched an urgent investigation . Looking for scraps: The horses have been left on a muddy patch of grass with no food or water. Residents have been horrified at the sight of the neglected horses . Councillor Arthur Meeks of South Tyneside Council said: 'I was horrified when I saw one of the poor animals with the wire wrapped around its tail and leg.
'It was very distressing and I believe a couple of local ladies were reduced to tears. We understand the horses have been tethered there illegally since before Christmas.' Although the site was illegally padlocked, a council officer was able to access the field and unwrap the barbed wire. RSPCA officials were informed about the site and notices have been served on the horsesâ€™ owner to remove the animals. Locked up: The five horses and a pony have been locked up illegally on a small patch of grass on a council estate in Low Simonside, near Jarrow. The owner has refused to move them despite an order from the council . Shocking sight: Alan Bartlett, 66, whose home overlooks the site, said: 'It's absolutely disgusting and a disgrace that a horse should be left like that' A South Tyneside Council spokesman, said a number of its departments are working collectively to swiftly resolve the situation. 'The council has served a notice to the animalsâ€™ owner asking them to remove the horses from the site. 'Despite assurances that they would be removed at the start of this week, they remain on the land. 'The council is concerned both at the unauthorised occupation of the land, and the environment in which the animals are being left. The RSPCA have also attended the site with a view to assessing the condition of the animals. 'Should the owner not comply with our requests, there may be no other option but to bring in the services of an enforcement company to take control of the animals. 'Tethering horses on council land is not permitted, as this action can cause danger to the public and can adversely affect the welfare of the horses themselves, as well as cause damage to the land. 'The council will not tolerate this, and will continue to take necessary action against irresponsible horse owners.'
In a throwback to the Cold War, a Russian spy ship caused a stir after unexpectedly docking in Havana on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba. There was nothing stealthy about the arrival of the Viktor Leonov CCB-175, which was moored to a pier in Old Havana where cruise ships often dock. But the visit was not officially announced by Cuban authorities. The timing also raised eyebrows as it came on Tuesday, the eve of historic U.S-Cuba talks aimed at normalising diplomatic relations. U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary. 'It's not unprecedented. It's not unusual. It's not alarming,' a defense official told AFP news agency. Scroll down for video . Arriving unnanounced: The Viktor Leonov CCB-175, a Russian Navy intelligence warship, is seen docked to a pier in Old Havana after sailing into the harbour on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba . The Vishnya or Meridian-class intelligence ship, which has a crew of around 200, went into service in the Black Sea in 1988 before it was transferred seven years later to the northern fleet, according to Russian media. The vessel previously docked in Havana in February and March last year, staying there for a few days. Those visits were also unannounced. The Russians said the visit was scheduled a long time ago and was yesterday opened up for the children of Russian diplomats. For Cubans, who became increasingly dependent on Russia after the 1959 revolution, the ship's latest visit has taken them down memory lane. Raphael Hernandez told ABC News: 'We have normal relations with Russia. 'One day, when we have normal relations with U.S., we could have an American ship visiting.'
The highest-level U.S. delegation in 35 years will conclude two-day talks in Havana today with both sides cautioning an immediate breakthrough was unlikely. Senior U.S. officials say they hope Cuba will agree to reopen embassies and appoint ambassadors in each other's capitals in coming months. Nothing to see here: U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary . The United States also wants travel curbs on its diplomats lifted and unimpeded shipments to its mission in Havana. During talks on Wednesday, the Americans vowed to continue granting safe haven to Cubans with special protections denied to other nationalities. Cuba complained the U.S. law promotes dangerous illegal immigration and protested against a separate U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors to defect, calling it a 'reprehensible brain drain practice.' As her deputy sparred with the Cuban officials over immigration policy, the lead U.S. negotiator in the diplomatic talks, Roberta Jacobson, arrived in Havana aboard a commercial charter from Miami. She became the first U.S. assistant secretary of state to travel to the communist-led island in 38 years and the highest-ranking visitor in 35 years. Cuban and U.S. delegations take part in negotiations to restore diplomatic ties in Havana on Wednesday . Her Cuban counterpart will be Josefina Vidal, director of the foreign ministry's U.S. affairs, who also participated in the immigration talks. The meetings are the first since U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Dec. 17 they would work to restore diplomatic ties snapped by Washington in 1961. Despite resistance from some in Congress, Obama has set the United States on a path toward removing economic sanctions and a 53-year-old trade embargo against Cuba.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday he looked forward to formally opening a U.S. embassy in Cuba. Kerry also said he was prepared, when the time was right, to meet his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, with whom he has only talked by telephone. 'And when it is timely, when it is appropriate, I look forward to traveling to Cuba in order to formally open an embassy and begin to move forward,' Kerry told reporters in Washington. In his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Obama urged Congress to start work on ending the embargo. But critics say Obama first needs to win concessions on Cuban political prisoners and democratic rights, the claims of U.S. citizens whose property was nationalised after Cuba's 1959 revolution, and U.S. fugitives who have received asylum in Cuba. The former Soviet Union was Cuba's main patron during the Cold War.
(EW.com) -- When "Breaking Bad" left off last summer, tenacious DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) was hot on the trail — and, er, toilet — of meth maker Walter White (Bryan Cranston). And when the revered drama returns with the second half of season 5 (beginning Aug. 11 on AMC), what should we brace for? Among other things, maybe a bit of self-reflection from the cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who transformed himself into a lethal drug kingpin with the help of high school dropout/partner Jesse (Aaron Paul). "We often said in the writers' room that if Walt had a superpower, it would be not his chemistry knowledge or his ability to cook crystal meth but his ability to lie," series creator/executive producer Vince Gilligan tells EW. "Walt has been the world's greatest liar, and I think the person he lies most capably to is himself. So in these final eight episodes, perhaps the lies will cease to find traction and the scales will start to fall away from Walt's eyes. And when that happens, will Walt really begin to realize who he is? That's a question that we asked ourselves a lot in the writers' room this year." Of course, Walt won't have too much time for navel-gazing, as he'll need to keep his eyes on his brother-in-law Hank — in addition to other adversaries. "There will be antagonistic relationships aplenty," promises Gilligan, adding: "Walt's got plenty of fight left in him. And he's got plenty of forces to fight. You met some of them. Others you haven't." Should viewers brace for a high body count? "As the movie title goes, there will be blood," answers Gilligan. "To my mind, that's not the most interesting thing. It's the emotional moments and the character moments.
We've got some stuff that I think is going to be truly satisfying and truly shocking and jarring. It does not always center on moments of violence." And these moments will come flying at you at "breakneck speed," he warns: "I have surprised myself at how much story there was left to tell and how quickly we tell it. You need to really settle down on the couch and pay close attention because it's going to come at you fast and furious in the final eight episodes." Gilligan is both cautious and upbeat when it comes to discussing that highly anticipated finale. "We worked long and hard to ensure that these final eight — and, in fact, the very last episode — would satisfy an audience," he says. "I am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that. And furthermore, trying to be as coy as possible, trying to give away as little as possible, I feel like this ending represents on some level, however small, something of a victory for Walter White. Read into that what you will. And try to be as open-minded as possible when you watch this episode, because it may not indeed feel like a victory. Or maybe it will. I feel good about where it all ended up, and I can't wait for people to see it." Asked for one last cryptic hint about the homestretch of episodes, Gilligan says: "Sometimes you see meth labs in the darndest places." See the original story at EW.com.

The safety poster proclaims "Be Cool, Follow The Rules" but depicts a scene with more black children being what the poster calls "not cool" while more white children appear to be behaving sensibly or "cool". John Sawyer, from Salida, Colorado, tweeted a picture of the poster taken by his wife, saying: "Hey, Red Cross, send a new pool poster to @SalidaRec because the current one they have with your name on it is super racist." The American Red Cross quickly responded: The American Red Cross released a statement saying: "The American Red Cross appreciates and is sensitive to the concerns raised regarding one of the water safety posters we produced. "We deeply apologize for any misunderstanding, as it was absolutely not our intent to offend anyone. "As one of the nation's oldest and largest humanitarian organizations, we are committed to diversity and inclusion in all that we do, every day." The poster has now been removed from their website and they say will no longer be printed. The Salida Pool and Recreation Department also responded to John Sawyer's tweet: But that hasn't stemmed the reaction online.
U.S. authorities are watching warily but have made no new plans to protect travelers during the busy Thanksgiving week despite threats from Islamic State to strike targets in New York and Washington, two law enforcement officials said Friday. The deadly rampage in Paris and the bombing of a Russian passenger jet in the last three weeks have put U.S. law enforcement and aviation security on heightened alert for another possible terrorist attack. But U.S. intelligence officials have seen no indications of credible plots in the works beyond the bellicose videos and other rhetoric posted online by Islamic State militants. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal assessments. "The threat level continues to be the same as it was last month," said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who worked on terrorism cases and now runs a security consulting firm in New York. After a bomb brought down a Russian Metrojet flight over the Sinai Peninsula on Oct. 31, killing 224 people, the Transportation Security Administration rolled out stricter screening requirements in overseas airports that are the last point of departure for U.S.-bound flights. "As the investigation and our own review of the crash proceeds, we will continually assess our aviation security enhancements, and consider whether additional changes are appropriate," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the time. Russian officials confirmed this week that the jetliner had been blown apart by a homemade bomb with the explosive power of two pounds of TNT smuggled on board. In a video released Thursday, Islamic State operatives threatened to launch an attack on New York City and showed images of Herald Square and Times Square. In response, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there is no specific and credible threat, and the city "would not be intimidated." The New York Police Department this week deployed the first 100 officers of a long-planned force of about 500 anti-terrorism officers called the Critical Response Command.
The new force is headquartered on Randalls Island on the East River in order to have quick access to three of the city's five boroughs. A separate video released by Islamic State militants in Iraq after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris warned of attacks in Washington. But security already is tight in the nation's capital. Al Qaeda, which was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, has sought to launch an attack on American soil since the 1990s. It's most lethal offshoot, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, has repeatedly sought to bring down U.S. airliners. Islamic State, which now has eclipsed Al Qaeda, recently shifted its attention from seizing and controlling territory in Syria and Iraq, its self-declared caliphate, to actively plotting attacks against its foreign enemies, especially France, Russia and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Counter-terrorism officials warn that the United States could be next on the list. "Do they have the intention? Yes. Problem is, do they have the capability?" Soufan said. The current intelligence assessments are in contrast to security alerts issued shortly before the Fourth of July weekend. At the time, U.S. security agencies picked up intelligence suggesting possible attacks and urged local police to be vigilant during parades, concerts and fireworks displays. An estimated 25.3 million Americans will board an airplane in the 12 days around Thanksgiving, according to Airlines for America, an airline trade association. That's 3% more than last year's holiday season and the highest number of passengers since 2007. Each year, the holiday season stretches the capacity of airport screeners at the TSA. They face the challenge of preventing weapons and explosives from being taken on jets without delaying passengers. During the 2010 Thanksgiving travel crush, passengers faced intrusive pat-downs and body scans following a foiled attempt by Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen to hide makeshift bombs inside printer cartridges carried in the hold of passenger jets bound for Chicago.
The pat-downs have since been scaled back in favor of new aviation security systems, including additional database checks of travel histories, more robust screening of cargo and baggage overseas, and other measures. brian.bennett@latimes.com Follow me @ByBrianBennett on Twitter ALSO Up to 27 killed in Mali hotel attack including one American Mayor apologizes for citing WWII internment of Japanese Americans in Syrian refugee memo Boston-bound flight carrying Chris Christie delayed because of photo-snapping passenger Brace yourself, holiday travelers. Airports and train stations across the U.S. are expected to implement additional layers of security for this year’s Thanksgiving travel. With the highest number of passengers expected to hitch a ride on U.S. airlines on Thanksgiving since 2008, security officials are on heightened alert to protect our nation’s skies and railways. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey tells ABC News it is on heightened alert in light of the deadly attacks in Paris. The Port Authority will be increasing patrols and inspections in New York City-area airports, bridges, tunnels, railways and the World Trade Center. Travelers, as usual, are being asked to report any suspicious activities to police. Railway passengers nationwide will also see a significant increase in security. Amtrak says it is working with local, state and federal law enforcement to gather intelligence and establish robust security measures not just at the stations, but on trains and along the tracks. An Amtrak spokesperson tells ABC News additional K9, uniform personnel and long guns have been deployed at various points of Amtrak’s service and employees have been debriefed with guidance regarding active shooter incidents. The Transportation Security Administration is not divulging specifics beyond the ordinary, but says it has measures in place, both seen and unseen, to protect the millions of Americans traveling nationwide. Passengers at busy airports such as LaGuardia and JFK in New York can expect longer waits, even with additional staffing at checkpoints.
According to TSA officials, the security administration screens nearly 2 million passengers daily and on the days leading up to Thanksgiving that number is expected to increase nearly 40 percent nationwide. That influx would spell the busiest travel season in its history. Significant additional layers of security are routine during the American holiday season, but the recent events in France are sure to contribute. ABC News' Erin Dooley contributed to this report.
New York (CNN) -- As weekend temperatures soared over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, New York City saw a sudden increase in shootings, with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally. "When we have hot temperatures, we see that the crime rate seems to go up," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday. But Bloomberg emphasized that for the year, shootings are down in the city -- 127 since January 1, which is 40 less than the same period in 2012. "One shooting is one too many, but last week we had the fewest shootings in a decade, including this weekend's shootings," Bloomberg noted. A professor says the heat index and the crime rate can connect. "Lifestyle differences exist between cold weather and warm weather," says James Alan Fox, a professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University in Boston. Fox has conducted research on the possible connection between temperature and crime. His findings illustrate how these lifestyle differences can contribute to varying levels of violent crime. "In cold weather, particularly in blizzards, people stay indoors, and the violent crime rate is lower. When the weather is warm, people are interacting more with others, be they friends, family, or strangers, so there are increased opportunities for conflict," Fox says. Fox says this trend continues except when it gets incredibly hot, so unbearable that even criminals become lethargic. "When it gets to be in the high 90s, especially over 100 degrees, people just go indoors and look for air conditioning," Fox said. However, drawing any conclusions about this past weekend may be premature, says Professor Jon M. Shane, assistant professor in the Department of Law, Police Science, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay Criminal College. "I would not put too much emphasis on a single spike in weather and the uptick shootings," Shane said.
"The reality is that you do not have enough information from this single episode to conclude that hot weather is related to increases in crime--specifically shootings, in this case." In November 2012, New York City logged a record-breaking "murder-free Monday" when there was not a single reported slaying, stabbing, shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs, according to the New York Police Department. "It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day," said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne, who said it was the "first time in memory" that the city had such a lull in violent crime. At the close of 2012, Bloomberg hailed New York City the "safest big city in America," giving the NYPD credit. "The fact that the safest big city in America is safer than ever is a testament to the hard work and determination of the men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day -- and it also reflects our commitment to doing everything possible to stop gun violence," Bloomberg said. CNN's Chris Boyette and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.

Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations. Townsend is currently a consultant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Program. Frances Townsend says the priority for the White House must be protecting the American people. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Washington Post recently reported that Gen. Jim Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, is reviewing plans to reorganize the White House National Security and Homeland Security councils. Some, if not all, of the functions of the Homeland Security Council may be folded into an expanded National Security Council. There is no more solemn responsibility that the president bears than to protect American lives. During my 4½ years at the White House, I came to believe that, for this reason, organization must be dictated by effectiveness. How best to maximize effectiveness will inevitably change over time as we as a country continue to weaken al Qaeda and other enemies, as the Department of Homeland Security gains strength, and as our government better integrates the capabilities that have been built since the tragedy of September 11. As the Obama administration considers the most effective means of organizing the White House structure, I respectfully submit that any structure should be judged against three fundamental criteria. First, there must be a single person both responsible and accountable to the president who monitors threat information and who has the authority to marshal all instruments of national power (military, intelligence, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic and public diplomacy) to defeat the threat. This individual cannot wait until threats arrive on our shores, but must have the responsibility and the means to identify those threats where they originate and to ensure a coordinated response to them.
The president's homeland security adviser must not be constrained by geographic boundaries that our enemies do not respect. Second, the homeland security adviser must have direct and immediate access to the president. Ultimately, if terrorists successfully strike the United States, it is the president, and not his staff, who will be accountable to the American people for the failure. The homeland security adviser must be able to get to the president quickly without clearance from his or her colleagues on the White House staff. Unfortunately, there will be times when American lives are at stake and the president will need to be advised and operational decisions taken and communicated to the relevant Cabinet secretary in real time. These sorts of crises do not lend themselves to the normal bureaucratic process. Third, the homeland security issues faced by our government are diverse and many. They range from preparedness and response to natural disasters (ice, flooding, fires and wind) to pandemic planning and biological and nuclear threats. These issues are often distinct from the more traditional foreign policy issues faced by the National Security Council and require experienced staff with significant expertise. The staff must understand state and local emergency management policy issues and concerns. They must be organized, not simply to facilitate the homeland security policy process, but also to anticipate and respond to state and local political leaders in a time of crisis. The homeland security adviser requires adequate staffing to deal with the counterterrorism and homeland security issues. We remain a nation at war with a very determined enemy. We have troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the national security adviser has many important responsibilities in addition to those two theaters. For example, he must contend with the Middle East peace process and counter proliferation around the world, but most especially in Iran and North Korea. I worry that increasing the span of control of the national security adviser could dilute the homeland security mission and make it just one more item on a list already overburdened. That said, I wish to be clear.
We should judge any reorganization by the substance and criteria that I have suggested above. We must be careful not to assume that a merger means the president cares less about homeland security. We must resist this easy organizational chart test and look to the substance of how responsibilities are allocated and how we are being protected. Let me suggest three questions the administration should ask before deciding on a new White House structure: (1) Is there one person responsible and accountable to the president who looks around the world at threats and advises the president? (2) Does this one person have direct and immediate access to the president? and (3) Does this person have adequate staff to fulfill his or her responsibilities? These are the questions that we should be asking and the criteria against which we should judge the effort. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frances Townsend.
Scores of people were killed and at least 123 others were wounded Wednesday in shootings and explosions across Iraq, senior Interior Ministry officials said. Five bombings in the Iraqi capital were responsible for dozens of the casualties, Baghdad police officials said. Three of the Baghdad bombings happened in the morning, killing at least 25 people near checkpoints for entry into the city's International Zone, a heavily fortified area that houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. and British embassies. In the deadliest blast, a suicide bomber targeted a security checkpoint near the International Zone, Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim said. Police officials said the bomber struck a restaurant that is frequented by Iraqis going into the International Zone, which is also called the Green Zone. The second blast occurred near the entrance to Iraq's Foreign Ministry building. Police and residents said a car bomb exploded in a parking lot opposite the building, and the Interior Ministry said it was a suicide bombing. The third explosion took place in the Al-Sanak area of Baghdad, one of the capital's main commercial areas. Police officials did not give a breakdown of how many people were killed and injured in each blast. Conflicting accounts have emerged, with initial reports from security sources indicating all three of the morning blasts were car bombings. In the evening, two car bombs exploded near a busy commercial area in southeastern Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring 24 others, police said. And a roadside bomb and a car bomb exploded at a coffee shop and a restaurant in al-Dora in southern Baghdad. It killed four people and wounded 16 others, police officials told CNN. In southwestern Mosul, in northern Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside the Turkish consulate, wounding five Iraqi security forces at a checkpoint outside the consulate, two senior Interior Ministry officials said. In western Mosul, gunmen targeted Um al-Rabiein police station, the officials said.
The attack started when a suicide bomber drove a bomb-rigged vehicle to the main checkpoint of the police station and exploded. That was followed by rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire, they said. At least five people were killed, four of them police officers, and 23 were wounded, 14 of them police. Also in western Mosul, a car bomb exploded at an Iraqi army convoy, killing three soldiers and wounding eight people, four of them soldiers, the officials said. The United Nations' special representative in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the violence. "Those who orchestrate such attacks should be condemned by all political, religious and civic leaders in this country," he said in a prepared statement. "Iraq political leaders should show national unity in dealing with such threats and unite against terrorism." Iraq's Foreign Ministry has been targeted in the past. The worst attack was in August 2009, when it was hit by a suicide truck bomb and dozens of staff were killed and injured. Another government building, the Transport Ministry, was attacked by gunmen last week. The militants seized part of the building and took civil servants hostage before security forces drove them out. Also Wednesday, a car bombing in the northern city of Mosul killed two bodyguards of a member of Iraq's Parliament, police said. The blast happened outside the eastern Mosul house of Wisal Salim, a Sunni Muslim lawmaker. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. The figures remained grim in January. According to the U.N. mission in Iraq, 618 civilians and 115 members of the country's security forces were killed. The U.N. tally does not include those killed in a fresh wave of violence in Iraq's Anbar province, west of Baghdad, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been fighting since the end of last year.
The ongoing violence in Anbar, Salaheddin and Nineveh Sunni provinces has raised concerns among some observers that parliamentary elections scheduled for April 30 will be delayed. At least 1,000 killed in Iraq this month, official says . 6 gunmen killed as police retake Iraq ministry, security sources say . Three sons, two bombs, one family's hell .
On Wednesday, a court in Thane, a Mumbai suburb, had convicted Girish Pote, 35, for the 2013 murder. The prosecutors told the court that Pote killed his wife Madhuvanti Pathak and chopped her body into pieces. The crime came to light after he telephoned relatives to confess to the crime and they informed the police. In India, a life term generally ends in 14 years, but the Thane district court judge Mridula Bhatia said he would remain in jail for as long as he lived because of the "gruesome" nature of his crime. Pathak held a French passport since her mother was from France. The couple married on 20 June 2006 and lived in Mumbai's Bhayander area. They had a two-year-old son, who was with Pote's parents at the time of the crime. Police said Pote had attacked his wife with a knife. They said the couple had been fighting over money and also because Pathak wanted to return to France.

By . Hamish Mackay for MailOnline . Follow @@H_Mackay . Sam Allardyce has been through an incredible 18 strikers during his time at West Ham, that equates to one every 9.3 weeks. The remarkable statistic, discovered by Iron Views, comes in stark contrast to Sam Allardyce's consistent claims that the club are short on strikers. Despite the fact that the Hammers spent £12million on Enner Valencia, it was Carlton Cole who started against Spurs in their opening Premier League game. VIDEO Scroll down for Enner Valencia tries some tricks and flicks at the Olympic Stadium . Signing: Enner Valencia joined West Ham for £12m after impressing for Ecuador at the World Cup . Allardyce's side averaged just 1.05 goals per game in the Premier League last season - worse than a number of sides that finished below them. West Ham signed Andy Carroll for £15m last summer but the former Liverpool man missed 27 league games through injury. Hammers co-owner David Sullivan even admitted he had regretted buying him, saying: 'Had we known he would be out for this long, we would not have signed him.'

Media playback is not supported on this device Bangladesh need just 33 runs to seal their first Test win against England but have only two wickets left. "It has been a fantastic game to play in," said Broad, who took 2-26 as Bangladesh chased a victory target of 286 in their second innings. "Bangladesh have shown a huge amount of skill to get to needing 30," he added. "We have shown character to stay in this game and will come out fighting." Broad began the day with bat in hand, but was run out in the second over and England were soon bowled out for 240. The hosts replied with 253-8, with debutant Sabbir Rahman unbeaten on 59, before the umpires ended play for the day due to bad light. "I am not sure many players will get much sleep tonight," Broad told BBC Test Match Special. "Although the wicket has turned more than we expected from day one, it has been a very exciting game and both teams have played it very skilfully." The opening Test of the two-match series has already become notable for a world record number of decisions being reviewed, with 24 the current total. "It has been a really interesting Test on the review front," Broad said. "That added to the tension on the field. It has been two countries going hell for leather at each other with a lot of passion - that is what Test cricket is about. "When you get that bit of reverse as a seamer, it takes the pitch out of it. The seamers had a chat at tea and felt we could dry up the runs from one end while the spinners attack from the other. "Hopefully, tomorrow morning we will get a bit of reverse. The spinners have tended to take wickets in the morning so it is a big decision for Cooky [England captain Alastair Cook] on who will open. "It probably works in our favour.
We will get some rest and come back fresher tomorrow. And a lot of wickets have fallen in the first hour of play. We are happy to take it into tomorrow." England's tour of Bangladesh concludes with the second Test, starting in Mirpur on Friday. The team then travel to India in November for a five-Test series, plus three one-day and three Twenty20 internationals.
(CNN) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame has won re-election with 93 percent of the vote, with all districts counted, the Rwandan National Electoral Commission said Wednesday. Turnout was registered at just over 95 percent, it said. Electoral observers had expected the outcome, and Kagame claimed victory after early results gave him a huge lead in the nation's second presidential race since the 1994 genocide. Observers said the voting was peaceful and "largely accurate." Kagame welcomed the early results at a massive party Tuesday at the national stadium in the capital of Kigali. Thousands of supporters got free drinks and danced to live music. "This is your victory, this is a victory for all Rwandans," Kagame said during the celebration speech, in vernacular Kinyarwanda. "Our development depends on you." Human rights groups had expressed concern over violence and repression leading up to the vote, but Salim Ahmed Salim, chairman of the Commonwealth Observation Group, lauded the polling as transparent. "Elections in Rwanda were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere," Salim said. "The count in the polling stations was transparent and conducted fairly." But while the vote was highly organized and efficient -- thousands of people had lined up before dawn at polling stations across the country -- observers said Rwanda's democracy faces challenges that include issues of political inclusion and press freedoms. "There was a lack of critical opposition voices," Salim said. "Each case appears to be different, but the overall impact is a concern." Of three aspiring candidates, two are under arrest and another has fled to Europe. Three other candidates cleared by Rwanda's electoral commission ran on platforms similar to Kagame's and praised him throughout their campaigns. The only representatives at many polling stations were members of the ruling party, observers said. "That, frankly, disappointed us," said Salim, though he placed responsibility on the opposition parties. "This right is a key transparency issue."
The vote comes 16 years after Rwanda's genocide left at least 800,000 people dead. Militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide in 100 days of violence. The killing ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. In the aftermath, Kagame transformed his country, turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in Africa and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development. Kagame's administration has mixed patriotic rhetoric with strict rules in an attempt to recreate society, and recently changed the official language for schools to English, rather than French. "Liberation is a process," said Tito Rutaremara, the chairman of Kagame's party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and also the country's ombudsman. "We want to create the nation."
The visitors led when John Stones' sloppy pass allowed Nathan Redmond to round Claudio Bravo and slot in. City improved after being booed off by some home fans at the break, equalising when half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho prodded in Leroy Sane's low cross. Pep Guardiola's side controlled the second half as they searched for a winner, but Saints keeper Fraser Forster produced splendid saves to deny Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva. City's inability to grab a second goal means ex-Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola has failed to win in five successive matches for only the second time in his managerial career. However, the point was still enough to lift the Blues back above Arsenal and Liverpool to the Premier League summit. Southampton stay eighth after extending their unbeaten league run to a fifth game. City's recent struggles are barely believable after the swaggering start they made to the season, when they won all of Guardiola's opening 10 matches. The former Spain international had been forced to defend his tactics following Wednesday's 4-0 Champions League defeat at his former club Barcelona, which came after their first loss of the season at Tottenham and the subsequent home draw against Everton. But there were signs of the home support becoming frustrated with his team's build-from-the-back approach, not least when many could be heard jeering their team off at the break after Stones' error. City lacked aggression and tempo in the opening 45 minutes, allowing an organised Southampton side to contain them and then burst forward on the break. Guardiola had to act - and he did that decisively at the break. Off came Kevin de Bruyne - City's stand-out performer this season - with young striker Iheanacho introduced in his place.
As a result, City had much more purpose and drive, typified by the desire showed by Iheanacho to beat Saints defender Virgil van Dijk to Sane's cross and prod in the equaliser. Stones is the only player to feature in every match of Guardiola's reign following his £47.5m summer move from Everton, impressing his new manager with his composure and ability to play out comfortably from the back. But critics have argued the England international is guilty of over-playing, leaving himself open to making mistakes. They were proved right on both counts when he gifted Southampton the lead. After receiving the ball just outside his own area, Stones tried to pass inside to returning skipper Vincent Kompany - instead playing it behind his captain and straight to Redmond. The 22-year-old thought he had redeemed himself five minutes later, guiding in De Bruyne's curling free-kick with a far-post volley - but it was ruled out for offside and instead his impact on this game will be remembered for the wrong reasons. Stones has now made four errors leading to goals since the start of last season - more than any other outfield Premier League player. Southampton arrived at a sunny Etihad Stadium with the intention of ending a miserable record of six successive defeats at the ground. Arguably this was their greatest opportunity in recent seasons, having showed they were starting to click under new manager Claude Puel while City had been toiling. The Frenchman saw his side earn just two points in his first four games after replacing Ronald Koeman, but any doubts about his appointment appear to have been curtailed by a rich vein of form. Saints were compact and organised defensively, while not afraid to use the pace of Redmond and Dusan Tadic on the break.
True, their goal was gifted to them and they also managed just one other shot on target - but despite not creating many chances, they did threaten to stretch City on a number of occasions and deserved a point for their work-rate and commitment alone. City manager Pep Guardiola: "The second half was much better. The first half wasn't really good. Of course our mistake was bad. The way I want to play is not to pass to the striker. On the second-half recovery: "They did it for themselves in the second half. They changed the game, I didn't change the game. We did think we were going to win it, but Southampton didn't make it easy. They have good defenders and are good at everything. On the displays in the winless last five games: "We have to analyse what is the situation. In the period, apart from at White Hart Lane against Tottenham [losing 2-0] it's been good. Against Everton and Barcelona - when it was 11 v 11 - the displays were as good as those in the first 10 games." Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton boss Claude Puel: "We can be satisfied with this point, we played against a good team and it was important to keep a good structure. We took our chances to score and after we defended well. "My players played just two days ago in the Europa League, they were tired, but showed good spirit and organisation. "Against fantastic players it was good to take a point and not disappointing. It was hard to defend at the end of the game but I am very satisfied."

Smiling and looking relaxed in each other’s company, Tony Blair and the autocratic ruler of Kazakhstan met yesterday for the first time since an £8million consultancy deal was revealed. The former prime minister held discussions with Nursultan Nazarbayev at the president’s Akorda Palace. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that Mr Blair had secured a deal to act as consultant to the former Communist Party apparatchik, who has been widely criticised in the West for human rights abuses and election malpractice. Plenty to discuss: Tony Blair and Nursultan Nazarbayev during their meeting at the Kazakh president's palace yesterday . Mr Blair now runs an advisory firm and the project in the oil and gas-rich central Asian state is believed to include some of his former Downing Street aides. The former Labour leader’s office has disputed that the year-long deal is worth £8million, and stated that he is ‘not personally making a profit’ from the arrangement. His team is providing advice on improving Kazakhstan’s chequered international reputation and forging business links across Europe. Officials said that during their meeting yesterday Mr Blair and 71-year-old Nazarbayev ‘discussed working out a large-scale programme to modernise the economy of Kazakhstan, as well as a wide range of international issues, in particular, the situation in the European Union and the Middle East’. It was Mr Blair’s third visit to the Kazakh capital, Astana, in nine months. His wife Cherie has also visited Kazakhstan, in May. Critics claim Mr Blair’s role gives a mask of respectability to a regime condemned in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables for ‘pervasive corruption’ and using torture.
The 30-year-old signed for the Giants in 2016 and joins Mark Garside in committing his future to the franchise. Garside, 28, will stay at the club for an eighth year in a row after spending four years with the Edinburgh Capitals. "I am really happy to be back and excited to spend another season in Belfast chasing trophies," said Martinelli. Head Coach Adam Keefe said Martinelli was "a great guy to have around the locker room" and is "excited" about Garside's extending his stay also. "Mark has won two league titles in Belfast, as well as the recent World Championship gold and he will play a key part in our chase for silverware." Garside was a member of the Giants squad who helped the club win league championships in 2011-12 and 2013-14, while he was part of the GB national side which clinched gold in the recent World Championship hosted in Belfast.
(CNN) -- Poached for use in traditional Chinese medicine or sold as exotic pets. Sometimes slaughtered in a vicious, drawn-out war. We're all familiar with the themes dominating headlines about Africa's declining wildlife. Lions, elephants and tigers, one might think, will exist only in sad tales told to children in a decade or two. Yet amid the disturbing news, one African wildlife success story stands out like the sun rising over the Serengeti -- and it's great news for travelers. With sustainable wildlife tourism as the long-term goal, the southern African nation of Namibia has been making ambitious commitments to habitat conservation since its independence in 1990. Almost half of country protected . The nation of 2.2 million people was the first African country to write environmental protection into its constitution. More than 40% of Namibia is now under some form of conservation management. Officially inaugurated in March 2012, the KAZA (Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area) initiative established a 100,000-square-mile, five-nation conservation zone -- the world's largest. Encompassing the entire Caprivi Panhandle in Namibia, KAZA's "conservation beyond borders" approach protects wildlife corridors shared by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Central to the effort are the communal conservancies -- rural communities that share the proceeds of wildlife ventures equitably between members -- that now cover one-fifth of the country and affect 250,000 rural Namibians. Human-wildlife conflict reversed . In many cases, poachers have become protectors, as Namibians have come to appreciate the long-term benefits of living with wildlife. Generations of human-wildlife conflict are being reversed, while communities are made stakeholders. Much of Namibia's wildlife is now flourishing. This is also good news for travelers.
With more than 30 conservancy lodges dotting the Caprivi Panhandle and north-central regions -- Namibia's wildlife hotbeds -- visitors are privy to some of the most unforgettable wildlife encounters in Africa. Five top Namibian wildlife lodges . Susuwe Island Lodge . This remote island lodge in Namibia's eastern Caprivi is a gateway to wildlife spotting along the Kwando River and perennial wetlands. Game drives deliver superb sightings of elephant herds, lion, leopard, hippo, zebra, impala and scores of bird species. Susuwe Island Lodge; +264 64 40 3523; rates from N$2,408 ($230) per person/day based on double occupancy (meals, activities extra) Camp Chobe . Boat safaris from this tent camp near the Botswana border spot elephant families in the river, along with buffalo, hippo and large Nile crocodiles. Camp Chobe; +264 81 800 0762; rates from N$600 ($57) per person/day based on double occupancy (meals, activities extra) Chobe Safari Lodge . This substantial lodge actually located in Kasane, Botswana, is a plush base to explore the wetlands of Chobe National Park. Land safaris into the park include sightings of elephant, giraffe, buffalo, hippo and lion. Chobe Safari Lodge; +267 652 0 336; rates from N$1,333 ($132) per room (meals, activities extra) Ongava Lodge .

(CNN) -- The paint is peeling, puddles litter the inside of the building, putrid water lies in what was supposed to be a swimming pool and even the statue of the man who had the vision to build the sports complex is cracked -- a sad and inglorious tribute to Marc-Vivien Foe 10 years to the day after the Cameroonian's tragic death. Once earmarked as a state-of-the-art $10 million sports academy, the only inhabitants today are not the next generation of Indomitable Lions but a handful of squatters and policemen -- with Foe's father funding the latter because of the high risk of theft in this corner of Yaounde. Those are not Martin Foe's only financial concerns because his bitter row with Marc-Vivien's widow Marie-Louise over the distribution of the estate of the two-time African champion, double French league winner and former Premier League star lies at the heart of the complex's decline. With Martin claiming that Marc-Vivien's properties should be returned to his side of the family and the star's wife -- neither relative would speak directly to CNN -- believing she should be the recipient, the duo are at such loggerheads that a resolution seems incredibly remote. It's a dispute made all the more tragic given the former international's body lies in the all-but-abandoned complex. Shortly after the midfielder died of cardiac arrest during a Confederations Cup semi-final on 26 June 2003, Cameroon's government pledged funds to ensure completion of a project started by a man who was posthumously decorated as a Commander of the National Order of Valor. The country's then prime minister laid the medal on top of Foe's coffin as some 3,000 mourners - including further government dignitaries, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Cameroon's football squad -- gathered at the four-hectare site.
But because of the intense familial row -- while a government promise of funds also failed to materialize -- the real legacy of Foe's death is not to be found in a suburb of Cameroon's capital but in the world's international football stadiums instead. "Foe's death really shook FIFA and what changed was the attitude of the Executive Committee and other decision-makers towards medicine and the health of the players," Professor Jiri Dvorak, FIFA's chief medical officer, told CNN from Brazil. "There were already medical courses in place and we were aware of the issue of cardiac arrest, but that was the extent of what we were doing. But once we experienced it live, in front of rolling TV cameras, we realized the reality of the situation and understood we had to do more. "It made me certain that prevention was the way to go and so many, many new regulations have been implemented since then to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death on the pitch." Medical screening . Football's world governing has acted steadily over the years to try to ensure that there are as few repeats as possible of the awful scenes that were broadcast to millions around the world from Lyon a decade ago. The French city was, ironically, the very one where Foe's registration was kept although English side Manchester City had been keen to sign the tall Cameroonian -- who had been with them on loan the preceding year -- on a permanent basis. They would never get the chance as the then 28-year-old collapsed in the 72nd minute of the semifinal against Colombia with no-one around him. An opponent was the first to notice the seriousness of the situation and unlike the swift treatment given to Bolton Wanderers' Fabrice Muamba at Tottenham Hotspur last year, medical assistance was slow to arrive.
Despite attempts to resuscitate him for 45 minutes and the fact that he was still alive when taken to the ground's medical center, Foe died because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition that involves an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. Those who are prone to the problem are up to five times more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest when exercising intensively than they would be when leading a sedentary lifestyle. As the tributes flooded in for a talented player with terrific stamina and, according to those who knew him, a permanent smile on his face, FIFA reacted by making it mandatory to equip all stadiums hosting international matches with automated external defibrillators. In addition, the organization introduced medical screenings of all players ahead of any FIFA competition -- a policy which was of clear benefit to all the recipients, but especially those from Foe's continent. At the African Under-17 Championship in Algeria, FIFA -- in conjunction with the continental body CAF and the local FA -- medically assessed all 160 players and unwittingly discovered that nearly 70% of the teenagers had never seen a doctor before in their lives. Late last month, FIFA issued all of its 209 member associations a Medical Emergency Bag, one which the global body says is similar to those in use by the American and South African military and which, more importantly, boasts a defibrillator among its contents. However, Dvorak readily concedes that the bag will be largely worthless unless the training of teams' medical personnel is up to scratch. "It is important that the doctors and paramedics are adequately educated to be able to use it in case of emergency, but we can never guarantee that the right training is being done all around the world," said the Czech. "Definitely at those competitions where we are responsible, like the Confederations Cup here in Brazil, we check that the relevant people are able to understand what they have in their hands -- and how important it is that they know."
All the more so since the first symptom of those suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can sometimes be death itself, while footballers to have died of cardiac issues in recent years form a depressingly long list -- with the cases of Antonio Puerta (Sevilla), Daniel Jarque (Espanyol) and Phil O'Donnell (Motherwell) prominent among them. While the medical measures undertaken by FIFA form part of Foe's legacy, a final chapter continues to play out wherever Cameroon's Indomitable Lions roam. Irreplaceable midfielder . The first team from Africa to reach the World Cup quarterfinals (in 1990), Cameroon were feared at the time of Foe's death -- with the team having added the 2002 Nations Cup to their 2000 title as they became the first to win back-to-back crowns in nearly four decades. Since the death of a central midfielder who has simply proved irreplaceable in the middle -- a box-to-box player with aerial presence and a calming, disciplined demeanor -- Cameroon's footballing fortunes have steadily declined. They have not won a match at the World Cup since Foe's death (missing out on Germany 2006 altogether) nor another African title -- and political rows and team squabbling have meant the four-time continental champions have failed to qualify for the last two Nations Cups. The last month has been indicative of the country's recent woes, with World Cup qualification having hung by a thread until opponents Togo -- who beat Cameroon earlier this month -- were found to have fielded an ineligible player during the qualifier, meaning the Lions may be awarded some fortuitous points instead. At the same time, the football federation chose to re-elect Iya Mohamed as president -- despite the fact he was being detained by local police at the time after being accused of transgressions connected to his role as director-general of the state-owned Cotton Development Company.
A once proud game is, in short, something of a mess -- and perhaps the crumbling complex where the patriotic Marc-Vivien Foe lies is a fitting, if sad, reflection of the lamentable state of Cameroonian football today.
It is a problem parents face every year - how to get the kids to bed early on New Year's Eve. Many have tried changing clocks, throwing fake parties and even tuning in to TV stations on the other side of the world. However, Netflix now has a hi-tech solution- an on demand New Year's Eve show for kids that can be played at any time. Scroll down for video . Revellers wave during the New Year's Eve celebrations in Hong Kong's Times Square: Now parents can celebrate with their kids at any time thanks to an on demand show. Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries . Offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies . User spend 1 billion hours a month on service . Planning 20 original series in 2015 . Founded in 1997 as DVD service . More than a third of U.S. parents (34%) admitted to starting the party early to fool their kids into thinking it’s midnight, citing their kid’s or their own bedtime as the reason, a recent survey from Wakefield Research on behalf of Netflix. 22% would go as far as to stage a countdown of their own, the team found. To make the problem easier, Netflix commissioned a special show starring King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien. The animated lemur will host his very own kid-sized countdown “special” on Netflix that families can use to ring in 2015 whenever they choose to celebrate. The three minutes of high-energy, music-filled fun that lets kids celebrate the New Year no matter the time of day. The countdown will be available in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, UK, Ireland, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France beginning on Dec. 29th at Netflix.com/KingJulien.
Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries, and offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series. Earlier this month, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies. The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York. He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’. This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO. Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’ King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien, who will host the special show on Netflix . Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’. The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows. The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices. The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers. And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation. The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix. Microsoft, Amazon, Hulu and Wuaki are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections.
Federal MP Clive Palmer has revealed his wife will run as a candidate in his party but insists she'll be judged on her own merits. Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election. But the Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said on Friday that she won't be favoured over other candidates and he won't have any say in his wife's political future. Scroll down for video . Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election . 'There's an independent committee of three people, of which I'm not a member, who'll decide who the candidate will be,' Mr Palmer told AAP. 'We've got two other candidates who are pretty good - she may be selected or she may not be.' But Mr Palmer could not immediately say who the other contenders were. He said he wouldn't have discussions with the other two candidates, because 'it would be a conflict of interest, as you could appreciate'. Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer says his wife will run as candidate in his party . But he said his wife vying for preselection wasn't a conflict of interest. 'She's entitled to do what she wants to,' he said. He also hit back at Dr Douglas' cronyism claims, saying the Queensland MP's own wife, Susie Douglas, ran for the party as a federal candidate in the seat of McPherson last year. 'Everyone that's a member of my family, who works for our company or is a member of the party is entitled individually to stand for what they want to,' he said. Mr Palmer said his wife decided to nominate for preselection because she had an interest in politics and was keen to see the party regain Gaven at the 2015 poll.
The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said she won't be favoured over other candidates and he won't have any say in his wife's political future . He said he was yet to decide whether PUP would run a candidate in Yeerongpilly against now-independent Carl Judge, who also quit the PUP earlier this month, leaving the party without a presence in state parliament. Mr Palmer said the party would run candidates in most Queensland seats. He said he'd already endorsed Ted Shepherd in Mudgeeraba, Steve Anderson in Maryborough and Jeremy Davies in Kawana. Dr Douglas said on Thursday that he doubted PUP would run any candidates at all. 'I think the opportunity to do so has come and gone,' he said. It is currently held by former PUP state leader Alex Douglas, who quit in August to become an independent, alleging a culture of 'jobs for the boys' within the party.
By . Shari Miller . PUBLISHED: . 04:22 EST, 10 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:31 EST, 10 August 2012 . A football referee made history last night by becoming the first woman to officiate an NFL game. Shannon Eastin served as the line judge for the San Diego Chargers' 21-13 preseason victory over the Green Bay Packers, making her the first female referee in the NFL's 97-year history. All went well on the night for Eastin, who was only selected because an ongoing dispute with regular referees meant the NFL had to draft in replacements. Wearing Number 27 on the back of her black-and-white striped uniform and with her hair tucked under her cap, Eastin seemed dwarfed by the players, but remained calm as she made history within the San Diego stadium. Run to it: Shannon Eastin takes her place on the field during an NFL preseason football game between the San Diego Chargers and the Green Bay Packers . The 42-year-old, who is from Arizona, also seemed to get the thumbs up from the coaches for her performance on the night. 'She was confident and in control,' said Chargers coach Norv Turner. Packers coach Mike McCarthy added: 'I thought she did a good job of . communicating. I was focused on the . Packers, but there was communication before the game.' Though she wasn't involved in many calls until late, Eastin appeared to stay steady among the giants and worked well alongside her seven-man crew. The trailblazer got her shot at making history as a replacement official following a dispute between the NFL and the regular referees, who are now locked out. The disagreement marks the first time in 11 years that the NFL has had to draft in replacements, who are scheduled to work 16 games over the weekend.
Hearing of the decision to use Eastin for last night's game, the locked out NFL Referees Association said that she should be barred, because she once took part in a World Series of Poker tournament. The NFL has strict rules on its employees taking part in gambling. History in the making: Line judge Shannon Eastin has become the first woman in the NFL's 97-year history to officiate a game .

Minute by minute: Eastin checks her watch during the game . Regrouping: The trailblazing referee waits for the ball . However, the league vetted and accepted Eastin for the game and it seems she does have all the credentials to take her place on the NFL field. She has 16 years' of experience and works as a referee in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I's Football Championship Subdivision. Eastin joins a small group of women to crack the officiating ranks at the highest levels of sports. Violet Palmer, one of Eastin's inspirations, began officiating NBA games in 1997 and is still in the league. Bernice Gera became the first woman to . work in baseball's minor leagues, serving as an umpire in a New . York-Penn League game in 1972. Pam Postema umpired major league . spring training games in 1989 and, thanks to a push by commissioner A Bartlett Giamatti, made it up to Triple-A for six seasons. But she was fired . a few months after Giamatti's death. She filed a sex discrimination suit . against the baseball organisation and settled out of court. A multiple national judo champion as a child, Eastin also owns a company called SE Sports Officiating, which trains officials in football and basketball.
Just before the game, Eastin seemed to fit right in and appeared relax as she chatted with the other officials, members of the chain crew and players. Chargers tackle Jeromey Clary and . linebacker Antwan Barnes sought her out, shaking her . hand and saying a few words before she ran down the sideline for the . first time. She spent most of the first half . straddling the line markers and keeping track of the time, without much . action on her side of the field. But things picked up in the second . half, when she had to break up a small skirmish between players and . whipped her flag to the middle of the field for a holding call late in . the third quarter . Eastin heard a few boos early in the . fourth quarter from the hometown fans for a pass interference call on . San Diego's Corey Lynch -- a call she appeared to get right -- and later . signaled touchdown when Green Bay's Marc Tyler dived in from one yard . out. She also gave a . touchdown signal on a one-yard run by San Diego's Curtis Brinkley and . was on the spot for a fumble recovery by the Chargers near Green Bay's . bench in the closing seconds, although she did not have to climb into . the pile to make the call. Charges . coach Turner said afterwards: 'I think it's exciting for her. It's the . first female official ever in the NFL. I got my picture taken with her . before the game because it's history and it's reality.' Her cap will now take it's place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Ohio.

Chicago-based United Airlines fired 13 flight attendants who refused to fly on a plane after "someone had written threatening words and drawn menacing images" on the aircraft near its tail, according to a complaint filed this week with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The words "BYE BYE" were written in 6-inch letters in oil residue on the jumbo jet's tail cone above two faces, one smiling and another "with a more troubling expression that could be described as frowning or devilish," according to the complaint. United Flight Attendants Fight To Get Jobs Back After Pointing Out Graffiti On Plane United Flight Attendants Fight To Get Jobs Back After Pointing Out Graffiti On Plane United Flight Attendants Fight To Get Jobs Back After Pointing Out Graffiti On Plane See more videos The 13 flight attendants from the July 14 San Francisco flight on a 747-400 aircraft bound for Hong Kong refused to fly, fearing a security threat. They claim they were fired improperly. United spokeswoman Christen David said the airline will defend the litigation "vigorously." "Our flight operations, safety and maintenance teams appropriately investigated and determined there was no credible security threat," she said. The airline said all its safety procedures as well as those of the Federal Aviation Administration were followed, "including a comprehensive safety sweep prior to boarding." "The pilots, mechanics and safety leaders deemed the aircraft entirely safe to fly," she said. The flight attendants refused to fly when the airline would not deplane passengers and conduct a security screening of the aircraft, according to the complaint filed Monday. They believed the potential threat, possibly an explosive, could endanger the lives of more than 300 passengers and crew, it said. The flight was ultimately canceled.
"In the interest of maintaining its flight schedule at all costs, United first tried to bully the flight attendants into flying, and, when they refused to accede to company threats, accused them of 'insubordination' and fired them all," the complaint alleges. The flight attendants' lawyer, David Marshall, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks, said: "Our clients did exactly what the flying public would expect from a group of highly experienced airline professionals. Our clients are entitled to legal protection for doing what was right." The flight attendants allege their termination was a violation of a law that protects whistleblowers in the airline industry from retaliation for reporting air safety issues. Together, the flight attendants had 299 years of experience, each with at least 18 years with United, according to the complaint. The flight attendants asked to be reinstated with back pay and compensatory damages. gkarp@tribpub.com Twitter @spendingsmart Thirteen senior flight attendants at United Continental Holdings Inc., who were fired last year for refusing to staff a plane bound for Hong Kong on security fears, filed a whistleblower complaint earlier this week with the government, according to their lawyer.

Saturday's flight was the first movement of material held at the Caithness plant to the US since an announcement in February. David Cameron, who was prime minister at the time, said the UK and US governments had agreed to an exchange of nuclear materials. He said the UK would receive a type of uranium used to diagnose cancer. But Highlands and Islands SNP MSP Maree Todd has criticised the weekend's flight and the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of nuclear material at Dounreay. She said there should not be a need for an exchange of nuclear material, and the UK should be able to purchase what it requires for medical diagnoses. Dounreay, near Thurso, is being decommissioned and the site cleaned up. Most of the radioactive materials held there, such as fuel, are being moved to other locations, including Sellafield in Cumbria where it will be reprocessed or stored. These shipments are being made by rail. Other material has been returned to nuclear sites overseas. During the 1990s, nuclear material was sent from abroad to Dounreay for reprocessing. The customers included power plants and research centres in Australia, Germany and Belgium. Under the UK-US deal signed earlier this year, highly-enriched uranium (HEU) stored at Dounreay is being sent to the US. Saturday's flight took place under tight security from Wick John O'Groats Airport, which is about 30 miles (48km) from the Dounreay nuclear site. It involved a US military Boeing C-17 transport aircraft. Radioactive material from the civil nuclear industry has been transported by plane from the UK to other countries in the past. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) provided Highlands and Islands Airports Limited with funding to upgrade Wick John O'Groats Airport in preparation for the US flights. A spokesman for Dounreay said: "All nuclear materials are being removed from the site.
This programme started in 2001 and we expect it to continue for a number of years. "Our priority at all times is to comply with regulations governing the safe and secure transportation of nuclear material, both in storage and transit. "Compliance with these regulations includes protecting information about routes, dates, timings and locations of nuclear material in any current or future transport." MSP Ms Todd told BBC Radio Scotland: "I am disappointed we are hearing reports from people living up in Wick that this has happened, but got no official notification. "I understand that there has to be some secrecy surrounding this industry, but I feel there is more secrecy than is absolutely required." She added: "I understand that this material is weapons-grade in exchange for some medical radionuclides. "I fail to understand why we cannot pay money for these things than have to supply them with weapons-grade nuclear material from the UK."
Burmese investigators have said they believe the Myanmar migrant workers accused of murdering two . British tourists in Thailand are innocent, but witnesses who . might be able to prove this are too afraid to testify. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun are on trial for the murder of 24-year-old David Miller and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on the island of Koh Tao in September. The migrant workers, both 21, . initially confessed to the murders but later retracted their . confessions saying they had been beaten and threatened by Thai . police. Zaw Lin (left) and Win Zaw Htun (right) are on trial for the murders of two British tourists on the Thaii island of Koh Tao in September . But Thai police deny those accusations and say they have . solid evidence, including DNA evidence, against the two men who . were arrested in October. A committee set up by Myanmar's embassy in Thailand to . investigate the case said they had interviewed about 40 Myanmar . nationals who were working on Koh Tao at the time of the . murders. Some of those interviewed were 'strong witnesses' who might . provide evidence to exonerate the accused, said Kyaw Thaung, who . heads the committee. But he said that they were reluctant to testify and had . returned to Myanmar for fear of being implicated in the crime. 'If they go to court and speak as witnesses, they'll have . problems with the Thai police and Thai bosses,' Kyaw Thaung told . reporters in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. Thai Police Major General Suwat Jaengyordsuk, defended the . investigation, which he led, and said Myanmar was welcome to . present witnesses.
Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right) both 21,initially confessed to the murders but later retracted theirconfessions saying they had been beaten and threatened by Thai police . The workers pleaded not guilty on December 8 to charges including . conspiracy to commit murder and rape. The first hearing in the . case will take place on December 26. 'Whatever the Thai government decides in this case, we . believe these two young people did not commit this crime,' said . Htoo Chit, the Myanmar committee's spokesman. The murders of the two tourists dealt a blow to Thailand's vital tourism industry, which generates almost 10 per cent of the gross domestic product. The country was already struggling to recover from months of political upheaval that culminated in a May 22 coup, with the unrest keeping some visitors away, and the government called on police to solve the case quickly. But human rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats. Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right )took part in a reconstruction on Koh Tao, Thailand, after Thai police said DNA from the men matched samples found on victims . The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene. But last month, the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case. 'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Ms Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office.

'We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes.' Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds. 'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement. They added: 'They must respond to these charges, and their arguments must be considered with the same scrutiny as those of the prosecution. 'Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.'

The photo showed Netanyahu pointing toward someone in the audience at the King David Hotel press conference, with Merkel to his right. The shadow created by his index finger formed a shadow above Merkel’s lip, giving the vague impression that she sported a mustache similar to Adolf Hitler’s. “I was just trying to find a good place to take pictures of them,” said Sellem Tuesday night.
“I positioned myself between Merkel and Netanyahu, and I shot the photographs that I needed for the story. Then at the end, when I saw Netanyahu begin to point, I thought it would be interesting so I just started shooting, something like seven pictures a second.”Later, when Sellem was sorting the photos on his computer, he noticed the image of Merkel, thought it was a unique picture, and included it in his email of photographs that go to the editors of the Post and its sister publication in Hebrew, The Post.One of their online editors immediately saw the unique photo of Merkel and placed it on the Post’s website. Within minutes, it had been shared over 1,000 times and retweeted hundreds of times.Both Sellem and The Jerusalem Post editorial staff were inundated with queries from media outlets around the world, asking if the photo had been retouched with Photoshop (it hadn’t been) and asking permission to reprint it.The Jerusalem Post management initially made a decision not to publish the photo or make it available to other media outlets, but once it proliferated on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, the avalanche was irreversible.Local Israeli TV news reports and websites posted the photo, as well as international outlets, from the Drudge Report to the Daily Mail.A shell-shocked Sellem said late Tuesday night that he hadn’t intended for the photo to cause an uproar.“When I saw the photo on my computer, I thought that it was unique and funny. It was not my intention to insult Merkel in any way or to make any kind of Nazi connotation with the photo.”
(CNN) -- America's top intelligence official on Thursday night challenged news reports claiming Facebook posts, Gmail messages and more have been intercepted for years in a vast data-mining operation, saying the reports "contain numerous inaccuracies." The Guardian, a British newspaper, and the Washington Post reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies had access to the central servers of nine of the country's biggest technology firms including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The Post reported the program -- called PRISM -- underwent "exponential growth" since its founding in 2007. In fact, the newspaper said the program has become the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications. Yet several tech giants whose servers were reportedly ensnared in the program denied any knowledge of it Thursday. And James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, questioned the Guardian and Post articles in a statement Thursday night. He referred to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which he noted was recently reauthorized by Congress -- one of the bodies, along with the executive branch and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with oversight over aspects of intelligence gathering. Section 702, Clapper added, "is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States." "It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States," he said in his statement. While he made no mention of data mining, Clapper did defend the American intelligence effort generally, saying, "Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats."
Clapper also called out the person or people behind "the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program," saying such apparent leaks are "reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans." The Post reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed briefing presentation document on the PRISM program. The program has been running since 2007 and has undergone "exponential growth" since then, the Post reported. It is now the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications. According to a briefing slide published by the Guardian, PRISM began with data from Microsoft in 2007. The program began collecting data from Yahoo in 2008 and from Google, Facebook and the message system PalTalk in 2009. YouTube became a source in 2010, Skype and AOL in 2011 and Apple in late 2012, the slide claims. The NSA declined to comment, but several companies -- many of them using similar language -- denied Thursday any knowledge of such a program. Microsoft, for instance, said in a statement it only provides user data when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that "if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it." Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the social media giant works to "carefully scrutinize any request for compliance" and does not give government agencies "direct access" to its servers. Apple spokesman Steve Dowling offered a similar response -- saying Apple hands over information only when a government agency gets a court order. Dowling added that his company has never heard of PRISM. "We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully," a Google spokesman said in response to the stories.
"From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data." Even with these denials and Clapper's defense, President Barack Obama's administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism. Patriot Act at center of Verizon phone log controversy . That includes news, first reported on Wednesday by the Guardian and commented on by U.S. politicians, that the FBI and National Security Agency have been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans -- specifically Verizon customers and perhaps others -- over a several year period. Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed, "Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency." But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post conflated Obama with his predecessor George W. Bush while a New York Times editorial said "the administration has now lost all credibility" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism. "Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it," the Times' editorial said. What does the Verizon order mean for me? CNN's Augie Martin and Stefan Simons contributed to this report.
By . Martha De Lacey . If you get dizzy at the top of tall buildings, spare a thought for Laura Taylor. The 22-year-old from Essex no doubt experienced more than just the head-rush of vertigo when her brave boyfriend sprung her with a marriage proposal 800ft above London at the top of the newly-opened Shard. Miss Taylor was with her boyfriend James Episcopou, also 22 and from Essex, at the official opening of the Shard's observation deck on level 72, when her beau got down on one knee and surprised her. James Episcopou proposing to Laura Taylor at top of the Shard 800ft above London as Boris Johnson opens building . Moments earlier, Mayor Boris Johnson cut the ribbon to welcome visitors to the highest vantage point in western Europe - 800ft (244m) above London. Undaunted by the world's media and the Mayor of London watching him, Mr Episcopou dropped to one knee beside the glass wall and asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage and was rewarded for his bravery when Miss Taylor said yes. The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital. After the event, Mr Episcopou, a supervisor at John Lewis, said he had no idea that Boris Johnson and a media pack would be on the observation deck at the same time. He said: 'I've had it planned since July last year. When tickets first came out I thought I've got to buy them, it's the perfect place to propose. 'Laura means everything to me and I wanted to make her feel on top of the world. 'We had no idea the media were going to be there, but when we arrived we saw Boris Johnson and there were cameras everywhere.' When asked if the presence of the media made him even more nervous, he replied: "There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to do it.
'For Laura it's made the day even more special. When people plan a proposal they think, "how can I make it special?". I managed to do quite a good job.' Miss Taylor, a 22-year-old accountant, said: 'I had no idea he had planned it. I thought we were going up to look at the view. 'James asked me to come over to him because some photographers would like to take our picture. The next moment he was on one knee and proposing. I was so shocked. I said "yes, definitely", but then I was speechless.' Laura Taylor got engaged to James Episcopou at the top of The Shard . Mr Johnson described London's tallest building as 'a most amazing place'. He said: 'I don't think there's anything in London like this. 'It's the closest thing to being in an airplane and looking down on London. But you can walk around, you've got complete stability. 'You can see all the bends in the river, you can see my office, you can see Buckingham Palace, you can see the whole thing for 40 miles around.' The Shard's architect, Renzo Piano, added: 'This building is magic for a number of reasons. 'First, because it's in London, second, because it's so tall, and third, because this building is a part of London. It's a sense of London. 'It's sad when London is sad, it's joyful when London is brilliant and joyful.' Some 800ft in the air, James Episcopou asked Laura Taylor to be his wife . On a clear day, visitors to the Shard, which towers over the city at a height of 1,016ft, are promised a spectacular view of the capital. But visibility was restricted for the dignitaries, journalists and members of the public attending the launch because of wet and cloudy weather.
Some 4,800 people paid for admission today - at £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children. Terry Quelch and his wife Merill travelled from Bristol to be among the first to experience the new attraction. Mr Quelch, 69, said: 'It's great looking down and seeing all the landmarks. I do like the shape of the building, the way it spikes up like an icicle in reverse.' His wife, 65, said: 'London hasn't had anything like this since the Eye. I think it's brilliant.' The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital . On a clear day, visitors will be able to enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital's skyline, from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city. With the help of specially designed telescopes, they should be able to pick out London's landmarks in the streets below. Visitors to the attraction - on floors 68, 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high-speed lifts in around 60 seconds. Irvine Sellar, chairman of Sellar Property and developer of the Shard, said: 'I think Londoners will feel ownership of the Shard. They'll adopt it as the Parisians adopted the Eiffel Tower or the Americans adopted the Empire State. 'I think we need a new landmark building, something that stands out.' Boris Johnson cuts the ribbon on the Shard observation deck . Anders Nyberg, chief executive of The View from The Shard, claimed it offered a unique experience. 'You're seeing a tapestry of history,' he said. 'We're in a 21st century tower, right across the river from an 11th century tower, the Tower of London. Nowhere else in the world can you get that kind of perspective.'
Heavy clouds cover the London skyline, as seen from The View at the Shard building in London, which opens to the public today .

It has even been suggested that Jeremy took Justin to the . local jail to see his criminal pal – known locally as JP - back in February.

Canadian authorities only retain criminal records for seven . years, but Atchison still had 33 charges against his name in that period of . time.
They include possession of crystal meth, robbery, assault . with a weapon and a huge number of parole violations. The fact that Jeremy hangs out with Atchison and allows . him to spend time with his superstar son will add to the intense fear that he . is a terrible role model. A source close to the Bieber camp told MailOnline: ‘Jeremy . has got a very dubious past and has spent time with a lot of very unpleasant . people, but Justin’s fame has given him the chance to move away from all of . that.

What kind of father would allow their child to spend time with a person like that?'

By . Jo Macfarlane, Nick Craven and David Rose . PUBLISHED: . 19:03 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:45 EST, 15 December 2012 . Thousands of hospital beds are set to be scrapped under secret plans drawn up by NHS managers. Doctors warn the loss of so many beds will put patients at risk in an NHS that is already ‘overwhelmed’. Cutbacks: The number of hospital beds could be cut by up to 25 per cent in some areas (stock image) The proposals, tucked away in documents published by Trusts planning to close or downgrade A&E departments, reveal: . The plan suggests that GPs and other services will play a bigger role in providing care in the community . The disclosures come just days after . the publication of a report warning that hospitals are ‘full to . bursting’, with Government figures showing that 94 per cent of beds were . occupied last month – more than the recommended maximum of 85 per cent . to ensure patient safety. Campaigners . argue the proposed cuts are being ‘smuggled through without proper . debate’. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: . ‘I’m shocked. The NHS is heaving. We don’t have enough beds. We’ll be . looking after sicker and sicker people in the community, with nowhere to . put them. ‘We can’t cope. Community services are stretched beyond belief. Patients will suffer in the end. We could end up with beds in corridors all over again.’ A report for NHS North West London, which was leaked to The Mail on Sunday, assesses proposals to close four out of the area’s nine casualty units.
The opening page of the report, which was written by independent public-health specialist Dr David McCoy, warns that its contents should not be ‘quoted or disseminated’ and are strictly for ‘limited circulation’. The report says the closures involve ‘a significant shift of health care activity and expenditure’, to be achieved by closing A&E wards and ‘a reduction in the number of hospital beds’. Dr McCoy writes: ‘A potentially more serious issue than the closure of A&Es is the reduction in number of hospital beds by nearly 25 per cent . . . However, details of the clinical rationale and modelling used to arrive at the proposal are absent.’ He adds that ‘any shortcoming in the plans to compensate for this by strengthening and improving out-of-hospital care will have serious consequences for patients and families’. None of the hundreds of bed closures in North-West London – mostly acute beds along with 20 paediatric and maternity – are explicitly mentioned in a 78-page consultation document supplied to local residents. 'Putting lives at risk': Campaigners argue hospitals are currently operating at full capacity and community services are already at breaking point . Dr John Lister, director of campaign . group London Health Emergency, described the plans as ‘shockingly . irresponsible’. He said: ‘This is being smuggled through without proper . debate. The consultation document told local people and health . professionals only part of the story, and kept key details tucked away . in obscure documents. We urge a reopening of consultation and a proper . debate with all the facts on the table.’ In . South-East London, a special administrator appointed by the Government . to oversee changes at South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which is close . to bankruptcy, has highlighted the need to close hundreds of beds.
The information is on page 54 of Appendix K of the administrator’s draft report and reveals there should be 618 bed closures by 2017 – 15 per cent of the current total. This includes 173 at Lewisham Hospital and 224 at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. However, a spokeswoman for Guy’s and St Thomas’ denied there were any plans to close beds. Documents from a consultation in Trafford, Greater Manchester, show similar plans. The ‘pre-consultation business case’ says: ‘Hospital beds required by the population of Trafford are reduced and those beds are replaced by the extended supported care in the community.’ At Barts Health NHS Trust in East London, bed numbers are forecast to drop by 21 per cent by 2016-17. Elsewhere in the Trust, Newham University Hospital will lose 72 beds and Whipps Cross University Hospital 138. Karen Reissman, a nurse and Unison representative from Bolton, said plans to reorganise health services in Manchester would also include bed losses, despite the public consultation literature failing to explicitly mention such changes. She said: ‘They’re saying 25 per cent of people in hospital do not need to be treated in hospital. It’s all about affordability, and it’s shocking.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This reveals the full extent of the risks being taken with patient care. Hospitals are sailing dangerously close to the wind. Ministers must take urgent action to ensure patient safety.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Changes should happen with patients, not simply to patients. The Government’s decision to drive through £20 billion of NHS savings is having a real impact on care.
They need to rethink.’ A spokesman for NHS North West London denied the figures had been ‘hidden’, adding: ‘The figures are all given in the document and explained in detail in the appendix. We have published all these figures on beds in 73,000 distributed copies of our consultation plan – to which we received over 17,000 responses. Modern health care means people can be better supported at home.’ A spokesman for the Health for North East London consultation, representing King George Hospital, said the bed losses could be revised lower but ‘significant reductions’ were planned. He said: ‘These relate to efficiency gains. They are not a consequence of the A&E changes. The Trust needs to bring itself back into financial balance and in line with national benchmarking around length of stay.’

Sharp departs along with assistant Danny Evans after two years at the club, with Featherstone set to announce his successor within the next 24 hours. "We feel leaving Jon in charge for the Qualifiers, only for him to depart in October, would make little sense," chairman Mark Campbell said. "We are now looking forward to seeing how our Super 8s campaign unfolds. We are aiming high and expect to leave a mark this time around." Sharp joined Featherstone in July 2015, helping them win the Championship Shield, achieve consecutive top-four finishes in the Championship and reach a Challenge Cup quarter-final. Featherstone have already secured a place in the Qualifiers, but need to beat Toulouse in their final league game of the season on Saturday to be sure of finishing in third place.
(CNN) -- When someone tells you to go jump in a lake, sometimes it's best to take their advice. For one golfer, it saved him from a world of hurt. At first, Pablo Larrazabal thought nothing was out of the ordinary when he swatted an insect away from his face at a tournament in Malaysia on Friday. The next thing he knew, he was being attacked by a swarm of hornets. "They were three times the size of bees," said the Spaniard. "They were huge and 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time. "I didn't know what to do. My caddy told me to run, so I start running like a crazy guy, but the hornets were still there, so the other players told me to jump in the lake. "I ran to the lake, threw my scorecard down, took off my shoes and jumped in the water. "It was the scariest moment of my career, for sure. I've never been so scared." Thankfully, after some treatment, the 30-year-old was able to continue. Remarkably, he birdied the hole he was on when the attack occurred -- the 14th -- then completed his second round in four-under-par 68, which meant he made the halfway cut of the European Tour event. "The referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax," Larrazabal said on the European Tour website. "After the injections I felt a lot better and could continue. Without the help of the referees I couldn't have finished the round, because I was in no state to play golf. "Tomorrow it will be very, very scary to play that hole. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but hopefully I will play it as quickly as I can."
Larrazabal, ranked 65th in the world, has won one tournament this year -- at January's Abu Dhabi Championship, where he beat major winners Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson by one shot to claim the $2.7 million first prize. He will go into the weekend at the Malaysian Open tied for 25th place, trailing leader Lee Westwood by 11 shots. The Englishman, a former world No. 1, followed up his opening 65 with a 66 to be four clear of European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts. The Belgian was tied for second with 327th-ranked Antonio Lascuna of the Philippines, who finished 90th in the Kuala Lumpur tournament last year.
By . Sara Malm . A top television executive has taken the blame for a public street fight with his best friend, Australia’s third richest man, outside a luxury apartment complex at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday. David Gyngell, 47, chief executive of Nine Entertainment, has said he started the brawl with billionaire casino mogul James Packer, 46, at the latter's home in the exclusive Sydney suburb. Despite Mr Gyngell admitting he instigated the fight, and that no complaints have been made, police are now investigating the incident which was captured on camera and widely published in newspapers across Australia this morning. Mischief managed: David Gyngell, left, has admitted he started the fight with his billionaire best friend James Packer, pictured right on Tuesday with a black eye, at Packer's luxury apartment block in Sydney . Mr Gyngell and Mr Packer’s fathers revolutionised the television industry in Australia and as well as being best friends since high school, they were each other’s best men at their weddings. Mr Gyngell’s television company, The Nine Network, later broadcast a statement where he accepted blame for the fight on the curb outside James Mr Packer’s flat on Sunday. ‘David Gyngell respects the job police do and will cooperate fully with their investigation,’ the statement said. ‘He also fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,’ it said. ‘Clearly had he not turned up at Mr Packer's premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred.’ The morning after: TV boss David Gyngell leaves James Packer's Bondi Beach house on Monday, the day after the fight . Looking a bit better: James Packer's shiner had cleared up on Tuesday afternoon when he was pictured out in Sydney with his mother Roz .
News Corp., headed by Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell’s long-time friend Lachlan Murdoch, reportedly paid more than $200,000 for pictures of the outside Mr Packer's luxury apartment at Bondi Beach on Sunday. James Packer is chairman of Crown Resorts and has interests in casinos in Australia, Macau and Manila. Forbes lists him as Australia's third-richest person worth an estimated $6.6 billion and he is allegedly dating supermodel Miranda Kerr. It is said that the fight started after Mr Packer sent angry texts to Mr Gyngell after seeing a van from the latter’s television channel parked near his apartment and assumed Nine were trying to catch him and Miss Kerr together. Nine employee Nick Tokic later told . reporters that he lived near Mr Packer and had brought the van home . overnight for an early job Monday morning. Mr . Packer had just returned home to Sydney from Jerusalem and was met by . an angry Mr Gyngell blocking his driveway when he arrived at his flat. Cause of it all? Packer is said to have become angry when he thought a TV van from Gyngell's network was trying to catch him with his alleged new girlfriend, supermodel Miranda Kerr, pictured with her son Flynn in Sydney on the day of the fight . By his side: David Gyngell was James Packer's best man when he married his ex-wife Erica in 2007 (pictured) Best man: At the 2007 wedding of James Packer . and Erica Baxter (above, left), in the south of France, David Gyngell . (above right, on wedding platform) stood by Packer . Mr Gyngell can be heard shouting: 'I didn't even know you were in f****** Australia,' in video footage of the punch-up.
The pair fought for several minutes while Mr Packer's driver and security guard attempted to separate them. Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell released a joint media statement on Monday which they said would be their last word on the fight. ‘We have been friends for 35 years and still are,’ they said. ‘In that time, we have had our fair share of ups and downs.’ New South Wales state police on Tuesday said they were investigating the melee and appealed for any witnesses to come forward, despite no official complaint being made.

Today, fossil fuel power stations are usually built with towers that emit vapour as well as greenhouse gases into the air. Special Report: The Technology of Business Make-It-Yourself: The rise of the micro-manufacturers Could high-end camping gear save lives around the world? Could renting Fido make you rich? The maps transforming how we interact with the world Is 'mind control' now a reality? But what if a new kind of power station could create electricity without belching harmful gases into the air? Despite the development of renewable technologies, fossil fuels are still used to generate the overwhelming majority of the world's power, and it is likely they will continue to do so for many years. In the US, about 70% of the country's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. Other major economies, such as China, are even more dependent. But now Net Power, based in the US state of North Carolina, believes it can redesign the power plant so it can still run on coal or natural gas, but without releasing harmful fumes. Rodney Allam, chief technologist at 8 Rivers Capital, which owns Net Power, says: "The perception has been that to avoid emissions of [carbon dioxide] CO2, we have to get rid of fossil fuels. "But unfortunately, fossil fuels represent over 70% of the fuel that's consumed in the world and the idea that you can get rid of that in any meaningful sense is a pipe dream." The Net Power system is different from currently operating power plants because carbon dioxide, normally produced as waste when making electricity, would become a key ingredient when burning the fuel. A brief history of climate change Carbon dioxide would be put into the Net Power combustor at a very high temperature and pressure along with the fuel, such as natural gas or coal, and oxygen.
Using the carbon dioxide as a so-called working fluid - used to make the turbine function - it would pass through the system in a loop, to be recycled and used again. Mr Allam says: "I've developed a system where we can actually make use of the impurity itself to try and assist the removal of that impurity from the power system." In addition, Net Power believes its technology would be cheaper to operate than current power stations. Mr Allam says: "It was my ambition to create a cycle which would be cheaper - or at least as cheap - as existing technology without CO2 capture, and yet go for 100% CO2 capture." The system is geared to enable a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would see the excess carbon dioxide from the fuel combustion funnelled into a pipeline or a tanker instead of being released into the air. Mr Allam says that because the whole cycle happens at a high pressure of about 320 atmospheres, the gas emerges with a pressure and level of purity that is "capture ready" - or ideal for storage. This is different from the carbon dioxide produced by other kinds of power plants, which is mixed with gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. Separating the carbon dioxide is hard, so it is difficult to apply the process to existing coal-fired power stations. 'Buying time' Experts agree that although CCS models could be effective, they are still new and need to be proven to work well. Source: UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, Nasa, International Panel on Climate Change Human role in warming 'more certain' Are ideas to cool the planet realistic? Q&A: Climate change "It would be a good idea to try out the technology and see whether it works, and what it costs," says Prof Dieter Helm at Oxford University.
Meanwhile, Dustin Benton, head of resource stewardship at the Green Alliance, says there is "huge promise" for CCS in the UK. But he adds: "CCS doesn't solve the emissions problems for the power sector. But if it's cost-effective, it will buy time and help us decarbonise rapidly. "We don't know what it will cost yet - the promise of CCS mustn't distract us from developing renewables as well." Net Power says it is planning to build a small power plant that would demonstrate the technology works. They hope to begin construction within the next 12 months. Their technology has arrived at a moment when the UK is trying to promote low carbon technologies. The UK's energy sector is in urgent need of investment, but does not have many new projects in place, says Prof Helm. He adds that by 2015-16 the UK power sector is likely to be under a lot of pressure, as a government programme requiring some power plants to close comes into effect. The government has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. "There is going to have to be fairly wholesale changes to power as well as transport infrastructure in the UK if we want to meet those targets," says Prof Martin Williams, at King's College's Environmental Research Group. Mr Benton says this makes the UK a good place to explore the implementation of CCS. "The UK has a unique combination of [research and development] and offshore engineering expertise, strong, science-led carbon budgets, and an industrial and commercial base that wants CCS to happen," he says. There is still the question of what to do with the carbon dioxide, once it has been captured and stored. "You can put it straight into a pipeline and deliver it to be disposed of - usually geologically," Mr Allam says. "You put it underground somewhere." But carbon dioxide pipelines have not been built in the UK yet.
Another option would see the gas put on a ship and taken to the North Sea to be used for a process called enhanced oil recovery, where the gas is pumped deep underground into oil fields where most of the oil has already been extracted. Because of the way carbon dioxide swells when it mixes with oil, it can be used to push the oil out of places that are hard to reach, getting more out of an existing basin. But oil emissions are difficult to capture so some researchers say enhanced oil recovery could pose its own environmental challenges. Mr Benton explains: "CCS might help in the transition to a low-carbon economy, but not if it doesn't reduce emissions overall."
By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 13:31 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:16 EST, 7 November 2012 . A former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper has tonight made the shocking claim that Jimmy Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes. Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem. Scroll down for video . Savile, seen at Broadmoor in 1991, as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe meets boxer Frank Bruno, who was on a visit to open a new gym . John Stainthorpe said a member of the public named Savile as a suspect . 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' Today, however, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman . said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be . more specific than that at this time. 'Details of all who were questioned . in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that . Jimmy Savile was spoken to.' Mr Stainthorpe said the person who gave police the anonymous tip-off was 'aiming in the right direction'. 'Child perverts soon become child killers,' he added. The detective's shocking revelation comes as the killer claimed today that Savile regularly visited him in custody and the pair became friends. Rubbishing claims the late DJ abused . around 300 victims over six decades, Sutcliffe said those making allegations .
were 'jumping on the bandwagon'. The Yorkshire Ripper's horrific crimes shocked the nation as he embarked on a murderous rampage across the country, slashing his victims, mutilating them and killing them. Between 1975 and 1980, the vicious murderer attacked women, stabbed his victims with screwdrivers, stamped on them, left notes with their bodies taunting police for not catching him and killed in total 13 women. Officers desperate to catch him cast their net far and wide as they hunted for the man who signed his notes as 'Jack The Ripper' and launched a huge campaign, publishing his notes and voice recordings in a bid to have someone identify the murderer by his writing or voice. In 1981 he was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. Sutcliffe, 66, who will never be released from Broadmoor mental hospital, told the Sun that the claims made against his 'friend' Savile were just exaggerations. Jimmy Savile, shown relaxing at his penthouse flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in 2006, lived just yards from where Sutcliffe killed his third victim . A victim of Savile has demanded police instigate any links between him and the Yorkshire Ripper . Peter Sutcliffe has defended Savile . He said: 'It's a load of rubbish. People are just getting carried away. 'He visited a lot. He'd always come and chat with me on visits and I would introduce him to my visitors. Several times he left £500 for charities I was supporting.' One of Savile’s abuse victims urged police to investigate any links between the pair, The Sun reported. The victim told the newspaper: 'Sutcliffe and Savile are two peas in a pod. 'It's quite fitting the only person to stick up for Savile is Sutcliffe.'
Sutcliffe's 'friend' Savile was said to have been given his own set of gold-plated keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital, where Sutcliffe is a patient. He was allegedly given bedrooms or an office at . three hospitals, and yesterday more former patients came forward to say . he abused them on children’s wards. The details come after it was reported that Sutcliffe killed his third victim, . Irene Richardson, mere yards from Savile’s flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in . 1977. Miss Richardson was killed near the disgraced paedophile's three-bedroom penthouse, which overlooks Roundhay Park. It is three miles outside Leeds city . centre, with floor to ceiling windows, and has been put on the market . for £325,000, with the proceeds intended for the Jimmy Savile Charitable . Trust. Savile's relatives said they do not . want a penny of his £4.3million estate and called for the cash to be . donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed . At . Broadmoor, Savile boasted that he was actually responsible for getting . some mentally ill patients - among them murderers - freed from their . sentences. He called himself the ‘Governor’ of the . hospital and was made chairman of a hospital taskforce by the Department . of Health in the 1980s. Savile, who died a year ago aged 84 in his Leeds flat, is now believed by police to be one of the UK's most prolific child abusers. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities.
Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. Savile was allegedly questioned by police about the crimes of Peter Sutcliffe. Seen here are twelve of his 13 victims . Police are pictured searching the grounds of a property where the body of Marguerite Walls, the 12th victim of Peter Sutcliffe, was discovered. A detective claims the disgraced DJ was quizzed by police in connection with the terrible deaths . Police and forensic experts, seen examining the place where another victim was killed by the Yorkshire Ripper, spoke to hundreds in their hunt for the killer . The police launched a huge campaign to track down the killer who hurt so many women, and were given Savile's name by a member of the public during the inquiry . Last month health chiefs announced an inquiry into Jimmy Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals. It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent. Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’, Downing Street pledged. It will examine why the paedophile presenter was allegedly given the keys to Broadmoor mental hospital, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General Infirmary. He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital. ‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to the police.’ Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the alleged abuse.
Savile, who raised £40million for the hospital in his lifetime, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased.
By . Donna Sawyer . A 41-year-old elephant has been introduced to its another of its kind for the first time in over three decades. Mila met Mary, the leader of the herd at San Diego Zoo, after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years and then taken in by Franklin Zoo in New Zealand. Video footage of the heart-warming meeting shows the African elephants entwining their trunks through a wire fence. Scroll down for video . Kindred spirits: Mila meets herd leader Mary at San Diego Zoo after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years . It is common for elephants to communicate by touching and entwining their trunks, according to African Elephant expert Tim Fullman's website. He writes that trunks 'play an important role in smell and that rubbing trunks in greeting may be partially to smell each other to gain information.' Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield, who was crushed to death by Mila in an accident in 2012, had always hoped the elephant would one day be returned to a herd of its own kind. The tragic incident sparked a fundraising effort by supporters of the zoo, who hoped to raise enough money for Mila to be relocated to a zoo with that had other African elephants. The supporters raised $1.5 million, enough for Mila to be moved from New Zealand to San Diego Zoo. Friendship grows: Mila entwines trunks with the matriach of the herd Mary in a heart-warming scene . Touching trunks: It is common for elephants to communicate to each other by touching and entwining their trunks . Elephant talk: Trunks play an important role in smell and this greeting may be to smell each other to gain information . San Diego Zoo's African elephant herd includes six African and Indian elephants ranging in age from 33 to 49 years old.
Lead keeper at the zoo Ron Ringer says that so far, Mila and Mary are really hitting it off. 'Mary walked up to Mila and they both started eating from the same tree,' Mr Ringer said. 'This is a great behavior to see because they were both calm and accepting of each other and it’s one of the types of things we look for with animal introductions.' Accidental death: Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield was crushed to death by the elephant in an accident in 2012 . Zoo keepers felt the best way to introduce Mila to the herd was to start with a one-on-one with the matriach. 'In late January, we gave Mila the first opportunity to meet another elephant with limited interaction. We decided that Mary was the best option, given she is a dominant elephant in the herd, is relatively calm, and has a good track record with meeting newcomers.' 'Being excited, nervous, scared, aggressive, or submissive were all possibilities we could have expected to observe,' zookeeper Robbie Clark said. 'Mary was curious of the newbie while Mila was surprised to find something as big as her on the other side of the wall!'
Speaking to Sky News in Sleaford on Monday, Mr Farage could be seen standing in front of a UKIP poster with a letter 'n' in the word Hykeham. Mr Farage was visiting the constituency in support of UKIP candidate Victoria Ayling. The by-election takes place on Thursday. Mr Farage seemed unaware of the error as he spoke about Brexit. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason was one of those to highlight the error on social media. One user, @HelenAnne73, tweeted: "Nice one @UKIP. Apparently I live in North Hykenham, not North Hykeham!!!" Another, @richcrook85, said: "Where is North Hykenham? Is it near North Hykeham?" The BBC contacted UKIP, but is yet to receive a response. The Lincolnshire seat is vacant following the resignation of Conservative MP Stephen Phillips Mr Phillips, who had held the seat since 2010, quit following what he described as "irreconcilable policy differences" with the government.

Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The judge overseeing the Mel Gibson child custody case ordered a probe into the leak of sealed court documents published on celebrity news website TMZ, a lawyer in the case said. The confidential documents "were stolen probably from the court" and the leaker "got paid a good deal of money," said Martin Garbus, an attorney for Gibson's ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. Grigorieva and Garbus discussed the leaks in an interview scheduled to air Wednesday night on CNN's "Larry King Live." "It's medical documents, declarations, court opinions, transcripts, everything it seems," Garbus told King. TMZ has published sworn statements from Gibson, Grigorieva and another witness in the court fight over custody of 1-year-old Lucia. "They say over 2,000 pages of documents were leaked and the district attorney's office has started an investigation," Garbus said. A spokewoman for the Los Angeles district attorney said Tuesday that she was not aware of an investigation. TMZ's spokeswoman declined to comment on the report of the investigation or the source of the documents. Lawyers involved in the case had copies, but Garbus suggested the leaked papers likely "came out of the courthouse." "Whoever took the files from the courthouse -- it's 2,000 pages -- certainly got paid a good deal of money," Garbus said. The judge ordered the probe on Friday, Garbus said. A lawyer for Gibson declined to comment, but a publicist for Grigorieva said the leaks did not come from her side. "It could be quite terrible because this case could turn into a gossip story, and swayed from what's important here," Grigorieva said. "It's domestic violence and Lucia at stake." She has accused Gibson of domestic violence during their breakup earlier this year, while he accused her of extorting him with tapes she secretly made of their arguments.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating both accusations. In another development, Grigorieva's family lawyer, Alan Shifman, stepped aside and has been replaced by Los Angeles attorney Ronald Litz, her publicist confirmed. Gibson and Grigorieva are both scheduled to return to court on Monday.

The scene was chaotic at McCorkle Place on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill on the evening of August 20. Students and antiracist activists were angry after brief skirmishes with the university police, but they were mostly determined that the Confederate monument Silent Sam would come down. They were also on edge as neo-Confederates and other far-right activists milled around the periphery in the semi-darkness, watching with grim resignation. Some walked up to students holding banners and verbally sparred; one has been accused of charging a student protester, while another has been accused of threatening someone with a knife. Among the crowd at the base of Silent Sam before the statue was pulled down that night was Dwayne Dixon, a forty-six-year-old UNC teaching assistant professor, and a group of friends.
Dixon might be the most renowned antifascist activist in the state because of his role with the left-wing militia Redneck Revolt in providing armed security for a park held by antiracist activists during the August 12, 2017, Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and then a week later when he carried a rifle in response to a threatened Ku Klux Klan rally in Durham. He had been charged with going armed to the terror of the people and bringing a weapon to a downtown demonstration for his involvement in the Durham incident, but a judge dismissed the charges, finding that they were unconstitutional. Some of the far-right activists stationed at the periphery of the crowd recognized Dixon at the Silent Sam protest on August 20. “There’s Dwayne Dixon, that communist leader!” one man exclaimed angrily. More than one person stalked Dixon with a camera phone, accusing him of “chasing” James Fields Jr. with a rifle and causing him to kill Heather Heyer when he rammed his car into a crowd of people in Charlottesville. One of the accusers, who declined to give his name, was captured on video accosting Dixon. Another was Patrick Howley, the twenty-eight-year-old editor of the alt-right website Big League Politics. The hideous falsehood—that Dixon caused Fields to kill Heyer—is among the most durable hoaxes to grow out of Unite the Right. Popularized by the far-right outlets InfoWars and Gateway Pundit, along with Howley’s outfit Big League Politics, the hoax has been widely embraced as a deflection of responsibility by Unite the Right participants. On the evening of August 20, Howley approached Dixon near the base of Silent Sam. “Dwayne, why did you chase James Fields with a rifle right before he hit those people?” Howley asked.
The sixty-eight-second video posted on YouTube by Big League Politics reporter Peter D’Abrosca shows the two men arguing; at one point the lens is obscured and the shot jumps as if the person holding the phone was jostled. The next day, Howley published an article on the Big League Politics site with the title “VIDEO: UNC Antifa Professor Assaults Big League Editor At Statue Tear-Down.” × Accompanied by his friend, a Chapel Hill-based political consultant named Noel Fritsch, Howley later went to a local magistrate’s office and swore out a warrant resulting in a misdemeanor charge against Dixon for simple assault. In a victim statement, Howley wrote that Dixon “rushed me, grabbed my left hand and armed with my phone in it, and struck me repeatedly.” Dixon stood trial in Orange County District Court on November 15. His lawyer, Scott Holmes, mounted an elaborate defense, attempting to impeach Howley’s credibility as a witness by building a case that Howley’s coverage is driven by ideology and monetizes a pattern of falsehoods based on dubious sourcing. Holmes also argued that the video contradicted Howley’s testimony about the alleged assault, resulting in a “fatal variance.” But Judge Samantha Cabe didn’t have to rule on any of those questions. Holmes was holding an ace card—an apparent typo by the magistrate that the District Attorney’s Office failed to correct before taking the case to trial. “Finally, the reason that it’s really defective is that it names Dwayne Dixon as the victim and not only the perpetrator,” Holmes said. “They have not proven that Mr. Dixon assaulted himself.” Judge Cabe quickly announced that she was dismissing the charge because of a “fatal flaw” in the charging document.
× Expand Jordan Green UNC professor Dwayne Dixon addresses the media on the steps of the Orange County courthouse before standing trial. Flanked by supporters before the start of the trial, Dixon gave a brief statement on the steps of the courthouse in Hillsborough. He accused Howley and his colleagues of continuing “to create falsehoods in order to create a narrative to maintain power—a power that they can only finally ever acquire by actually killing people, by killing Heather Heyer, by killing the eleven people who died in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. This is the truth that needs to be told: that these individuals are working in collusion with the very killers who are now incarcerated for murder.” Although he benefited from skillful representation, Dixon made it clear that whatever the outcome of the trial, he viewed the legal process as illegitimate from the start. “I have no truck with this legal system,” he said. “I have no faith in it. And yet, if we as a larger society are going to be in agreement about something, it’s that putting people in the ground is not the way to create a healthy, beneficial, and open life for all of us. So when I go in today, the things that are going to happen today are largely immaterial. I’m not concerned. This was completely based on untruths.” Holmes cross-examined Howley for more than an hour—roughly seven times the length of the time used by the prosecutor for direct examination and showing the video of the incident. Throughout the trial, Howley displayed evasion and even defiance. On eight different occasions, Judge Cabe admonished him to answer Holmes’s questions, and three times she told him to not speak unless he was responding to a question. The judge also expressed impatience with Holmes, sharply ordering him to “move on” at one point.
Holmes reminded Howley that August 20 was not the first time he had approached Dixon with a camera phone and attempted to ask him about James Fields. Howley admitted that when he and Noel Fritsch accosted Dixon in the hallway of a UNC academic building in February, he did not have an appointment to meet Dixon and did not give him notice that he was coming. And although Howley publicly accused Dixon of assaulting Noel Fritsch—identified on the site as a “Big League cameraman”—Howley testified that Fritsch opted to not pursue charges. Howley presented himself as a neutral interlocutor who remains open-minded while attempting to pose questions. He said that, in addition to asking Dixon about James Fields, he wanted to ask Dixon if he stood “behind the violence that Redneck Revolt has perpetrated across this country”—another leading question based on a faulty premise. Howley, like other activists and media figures on the far right, latched on to a Facebook comment by Dixon—since deleted—in retort to an anti-Antifa viral social media post by the firearms maker Spike’s Tactical, in which Dixon said he was proud to have carried a Spike’s firearm when he “chased off James Fields” from the block he was patrolling when Fields drove past, shortly before Fields rammed into a crowd of antiracist marchers three blocks south. Later, Dixon clarified in a talk at Harvard University that Fields “paused right in front of me, and I waved him off with my rifle.” During the trial, Holmes asked Howley if he had seen the video presented by prosecutors in the Fields case that showed the defendant putting his car in reverse for more than a block, and then accelerating into the crowd. Howley’s responses were evasive, and after Holmes asked a third time, he finally said, “I saw the video.
That’s your interpretation of what happened.” Judge Cabe said she didn’t understand “the purpose of rehashing what happened in Charlottesville.” “It shows how his level of competency as a witness—to somehow accuse Mr. Dixon of—to have seen the video of what happened and want to go to UNC campus and stick a camera in his face and accuse him of any responsibility shows that this person lacks all credibility whatsoever,” Holmes replied. Holmes called Howley’s attention to an article in which he described Dixon as “the de facto leader” of the August 20 rally that ended with the toppling of Silent Sam. After initially refusing to answer the question of how many sources he had for the statement, Howley finally responded, “Based on my research, I count myself as a source on that. I did my research. There are many sources who would say that Dwayne Dixon is the leader of this network. There are two sources that I can think of right now.” Holmes also asked Howley about a statement he published that “Dixon mostly carried out his activist plots in anonymity until Charlottesville,” asking Howley if he “had any knowledge of anonymous plots that Mr. Dixon participated in.” After deflecting by referencing events in Charlottesville and at the Silent Sam protests, Howley finally conceded that one “source said Mr. Dixon was acting anonymously prior to Charlottesville and him being exposed in Charlottesville forced him to change his strategy.” His final testimony dropped any reference to “plots” prior to Unite the Right. Howley acknowledged on the stand that he was put on suspension from Breitbart News for four days, prior to founding Big League Politics. “And that incident working with Breitbart News had to do with an incident where a reporter was accusing someone else of assaulting them,” Holmes said.
“Isn’t that correct?” Howley acknowledged the incident, in which he expressed skepticism in a series of tweets about the allegation that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski assaulted his Breitbart colleague Michelle Fields during a campaign event in March 2016. According to screen-grabs of deleted tweets that were shared by CNN reporter Hadas Gold, Howley insinuated that Fields’s allegation was manufactured to sabotage Trump in the mainstream press. × After initially brushing aside the question as “irrelevant,” Howley reluctantly testified that Big League Politics is partially owned by Mustard Seed Media, “which is owned by my friend, Reilly O’Neal.” Howley testified that Big League Politics receives revenue through advertisements, but when asked if the site has a list of subscribers, he responded, “I really don’t want to get into that.” “Is it true or untrue that you have subscribers?” Cabe asked impatiently. “True.” “Isn’t it true that one of the sources of your revenue is selling your subscriber list to political campaigns?” Holmes asked. “I believe it is possible. You’d have to ask my business partner.” O’Neal, a Raleigh-based political consultant who owns Tidewater Strategies, could not be reached for comment. Tidewater Strategies has worked on campaigns for far-right Republican candidates, including Greg Brannon, who ran for the U.S. Senate against Thom Tillis in the 2014 primary; Corey Stewart, who decisively lost his U.S. Senate race this year in Virginia to Democrat Tim Kaine; Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore; and Paul Nehlen, who unsuccessfully sought to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin’s First Congressional District. Howley has publicly sought to play down his right-wing ideological orientation.
“I consider myself to be an independent,” he testified. “I consider myself to be a populist and a citizen. I’m not a conservative or a liberal.” Tidewater Strategies is more straightforward about its orientation. “We are a full-service political consulting firm working exclusively with conservative candidates and organizations across the country,” its website announces. Some of the messaging in the campaigns that O’Neal has worked on align with Big League Politics’ drumbeat of coverage promoting the idea of antifascists being violent and out of control. In response to an inquiry from WBTV 3 in Charlotte, O’Neal acknowledged that he helped set up a political action committee called Principled Leadership Project, which ran a controversial ad in support of Republican Karen Handel during the 2017 special election to fill the vacant Sixth Congressional District seat in Georgia. The ad, which ran after a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise at a congressional baseball game, urged voters to “stop” Handel’s opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff, while claiming that the “unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans.” “When will it stop?” a narrator asks. “It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday, because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week’s shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff. And if he wins, they win.” Fritsch, the cameraman who accompanied Howley to confront Dixon inside an academic building in February, is also a political consultant, who, like O’Neal, has worked on the Nehlen, Stewart, and Moore campaigns. Howley gave a contradictory explanation of Fritsch’s involvement with Big League Politics during his testimony. “Does he work for Big League Politics?” Holmes asked.
“No, he’s my friend,” Howley said. “He works with me. … Yes, I suppose you could say he’s a photographer for Big League Politics.” “You just said he wasn’t,” Holmes said. “Well, I changed my answer. He is.” Howley was listed as a witness in the charging document for the August 20 incident but was not called to testify. After Judge Cabe’s dismissal of Dixon’s charge, Howley stood up in the courtroom and walked out, uttering aloud: “Unbelievable. Wow.” As Dixon and his supporters were leaving, Howley returned with his cell phone. Howley turned on his camera near the courthouse’s security checkpoint and started filming Dixon as he stood near the front entrance. Howley’s question was predictable. “Can I ask you a question now about Charlottesville?” he asked. “Can we get an officer of the court to intervene here please?” Dixon asked. Frustrated once again, Howley turned his ire on the court system, and the mainstream media. “Obviously it was rigged on a technicality, but the facts are clear that Dwayne Dixon did assault me and he is a very violent person,” Howley said. “And I think that people in Chapel Hill are put in harm’s way by the radical, violent riots he and his friends cause on campus and elsewhere in this country. And until the media, sir—until the media starts reporting on this violence, we’re not gonna be able to come together and have rational conversations in this country because we’re just gonna descend into street fighting out there. And is that what the media wants?
That’s not what I want.” Howley and Big League Politics gave ample coverage about the case in the run-up to the trial. Since the verdict, both the site and its editor’s Twitter account have remained silent about the charge’s disposition. Lawyers for James Alex Fields, 21, the Ohio man charged with the first-degree murder of Heather Heyer and accused of plowing his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of demonstrators on Fourth Street August 12, 2017, suggested he may argue self defense in early questioning of potential jurors. Fields, a self-described neo-Nazi, is also charged with five counts of aggravated malicious wounding, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of leaving the scene. He appeared in court unshaved and wearing a dark suit and tie. The case—and the swarms of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in the streets of Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally—made national news. Fields’ attorney, former commonwealth’s attorney Denise Lunsford, earlier had requested a change of venue. Judge Rick Moore took the motion under advisement, but seemed confident he could find 12 impartial jurors and four alternates. Questionnaires went out to 360 potential jurors, the largest pool ever in Charlottesville, and by 10am November 26, around 60 were sitting in Charlottesville Circuit Court. Jury selection got off to a slow start. Potential jurors were put in a group of 28 for the first round of questioning to determine juror bias. One was dismissed because she no longer lived in Charlottesville. Nearly all of the 28 raised their hands when asked if they’d heard about the case through the media. The prosecution said it planned to call 40 witnesses, including victims Marcus Martin and Marissa Blair, and former Daily Progress reporter Ryan Kelly, whose photo of the Fourth Street crash won a Pulitzer prize.
Lunsford listed around 15 possible witnesses, including Officer Tammy Shifflett, the school resource officer who left her position blocking Fourth Street at Market when she became fearful for her personal safety, and Fields’ mother, Samantha Bloom, who has called police in the past because she was frightened by her son’s behavior. The trial is expected to last three weeks.
Over the last decade, he has written and produced hits for Beyonce (XO), Adele (Rumour Has It) and Taylor Swift (Welcome To New York), while his own band's hits include Apologise, Counting Stars and the current single Kids. You may have heard him talking about songwriting, because that's what most interviews - including his last encounter with the BBC - tend to focus on. But the 37-year-old is pop music's very own Renaissance Man - investing in medicine, accumulating historical artefacts and compiling the ultimate coffee bible. So, rather than ask him about Adele and Beyonce, we used the song titles from the new OneRepublic album, Oh My My, as the jumping off point for a series of random, but revealing questions. It turns out that some things are more important than his trophy cabinet What's the worst injury you've ever had? When my Achilles heel exploded. I was playing basketball and my ankle just went off like a firework. That was very painful, but it wasn't close to what happened next. I got to the hospital and the last little bit of tendon that was attaching my calf muscle to my ankle popped, so my entire calf muscle rolled up behind my knee. No pain in this lifetime will compare. It was so severe that I actually passed out. What will happen to America after the election? Oh my God. My grandfather was born in the 1930s and he says this is the worst election he's seen in his lifetime. I don't think either candidate is the devil. If you're voting experience, Hillary clearly wins because you get two presidents for the price of one - her and Bill. But then you have all the trust issues. Trump, I don't even have to go into detail on why that's scary. But I'll say this: The future still looks good because of the checks and balances system we have.
If Trump gets in, he's going to get stonewalled. What's the best thing about being a father? Everything is the best thing about being a father. When our youngest kid sees me, he lights up like a Christmas tree. It's love on another level. Rare is the person you would throw yourself in front of a moving car for, but kids bring that out in you. Do you have a recurring nightmare? I've had one since college. It's the last week of school, and I get a call from a professor saying, "You didn't come to my class once this entire semester and I'm failing you, so you're not going to graduate". You know why I have that dream? Because that actually happened. I was enrolled on a physical education course, but I didn't know and I missed every lesson. The guy said the only way he'd pass me was if I came in the next three days in a row, and ran two miles, then three miles, then five miles. And I had to do each one in a certain time. The three-mile race I had to do in 22 minutes, so a seven-minute mile, and I almost died. After I did it, the guy looked at me and he shook his head, and he said, "You're lucky you're in decent shape because I was ready to fail you". You grew up in Tulsa which is a big oil city. Are you for or against fossil fuels? When I first made money from Apologise and Bleeding Love, I wanted to buy a solar panel farm. I was immediately looking into that as an investment strategy. I've invested in Elon Musk's [solar panel company] SolarCity and Tesla. I refuse to believe we live on a planet that doesn't have 100% renewable resources.
I don't like to invest in bonds and mutual funds, so you have to find something, whether it's a streaming service or a green technology service, or a cancer-fighting company, and invest early. I'll cold call them and be like, "Hey, you're developing an early-detection cancer system, what would it take to invest in your company?". Is it possible for a songwriter to improve with age? That's a really interesting question. In Nashville, there's a much greater likelihood that you can continue to have hits in your 50s and 60s. The only pop writer I can name in the whole world who has continued to have true hits is Billy Steinberg [Madonna's Like A Virgin, The Bangles' Eternal Flame]. He still understands the craft and melody. And the key is collaboration. You have to have youth injected into your sphere. So I'd say it's possible, but unlikely. What was the key ingredient in the conception of this album? Friends. Ed Sheeran influenced a few songs in terms of how I approached the lyrics. Bono made me question everything, try and beat every lyric, be more brutal. But I have a couple of guy friends who are in their early 30s and they don't care about pop music. Those guys give me the best feedback. Their response means more to me than anyone. Have you had your hands insured? I'm not Elton John, I've never thought of insuring my hands! But if we're in the middle of a tour I'm not really supposed to ski. Our tour insurance policy forbids it. Who is your most famous neighbour? I have two. On my left is Hedi Slimane, the fashion designer, and my other next-door neighbour is Mark Hoppus from Blink 182. Our other neighbours are the Clintons' doctors. So at least twice a year our entire cul-de-sac gets shut down.
The Clintons will come over and you have to go through secret service to get to your own house. What's the first thing you do when you arrive in a new city? I look for the best coffee shop in the city. I get online the night before and I Google coffee shops and then I read reviews on Yelp. Then I'll go and look at photos of them - because I'm a total nerd. I do this in every city. And I mean every city: Belgrade, Bucharest, Auckland, Moscow. Will I write a book? Maybe. I have all the notes stored in my phone. If your house burned down, what's the one thing you'd save, apart from your family? I would say the documents that I've collected. I have handwritten letters from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. I have one of the last remaining photographs of Lincoln before he died. I have a hand-drafted letter from Napoleon while he was at the peak of his power, with the seal of Italy. I've got a photo of the first flight taking off in Kitty Hawk, signed by Orville Wright. I have coins that were minted in 2 AD in Jerusalem, as Christ was literally walking through the streets. They're all in the same area of my house and they're mostly wood and paper, so I'd be sprinting to those with a blanket, and I'd grab them and run out the door. The Grammys can burn. Do you read your own press? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It literally depends on the mood. My issue with critics is… it's funny… I read a negative review of us a few years ago and I was like, "I need to know more about this guy because he's speaking as though he wouldn't like us if we were the last band on earth".
So I go and look at who he likes, and he just went to a Black Sabbath concert, he loves Megadeth, he thinks Arcade Fire is "too pop". I was like this guy can go stuff himself. That's the only time I get irritated. Don't review us if you are predisposed to hate us. Oh My My is out now on Polydor Records.

A woman who was seriously wounded in the Boston Marathon bombings has made an emotional plea to find an unknown Afghanistan war veteran who stayed by her side during the horrific ordeal. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told a news conference on Tuesday that while meeting the injured at Tufts Medical Center he spoke to a young woman called Victoria, a student at North Eastern University. She had sustained a serious shrapnel wound to her leg in the first blast on Monday afternoon and was by her own description, 'completely hysterical'. Scroll down for video . Plea: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick asked the public to help him find Army Sgt 'Tyler' who helped a seriously injured young woman following the Boston Marathon bomb blasts . Victoria said that she had been carried to a medical tent where she was comforted by a man called Tyler, an oil rig worker. He managed to calm the young woman over her injuries. A hospital spokeswoman said that Tyler told Victoria: 'You’re going to have a scar, but you’re going to be OK. It’ll be like my scar', according to the Boston Globe. Governor Patrick said it was unclear whether Tyler had been working in the medical tent or, like so many others, simply rushed to help the wounded. The Governor asked for the public's help to track down Tyler as Victoria desperately wanted to thank him personally after he was there for her in the midst of her distress. Anyone with information on 'Tyler' was asked to call 617-725-4000 so that he could be put in touch with Victoria. Help: Medical workers aid injured people near the finish line . Victoria is among 183 injured following the Boston Marathon terror attack including nine children. Among those wounded, 23 people are in a critical condition.
Three people died in the bomb blasts - eight-year-old Martin Richard; Krystle Campbell, 29, and a Boston University graduate student who is yet to be named. The two bombs which wreaked the devastation were made from six-liter pressure cookers crammed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings and stashed in black backpacks, police sources revealed on Tuesday.

(CNN) -- The Wu-Tang Clan -- the New York hip-hop supergroup that spawned millions of album sales, nine solo acts and a few acting careers -- almost never was. If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says. Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir. Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's "Protect Ya Neck" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book. "Come over here, yo!" RZA beckoned, according to "The Tao of Wu" (Riverhead). "He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there." Interactive: Where's the Wu been? » . It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in "The Tao of Wu," out Thursday. Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition.
RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced "Rizza," also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers. RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem. Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length: . CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation? RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with. Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came.
CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas? RZA: Like it says in the Bible, "In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path. It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. You remove the messenger and take the message. CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years "was a product of my history and environment" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not? RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence. Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved.
He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, "Your duty is your duty." So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow. CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death? RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. So it got to a point, I was like, "[expletive] it, let him do his drugs" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. But it's still neglect, yo. CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach? RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it.
CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance? RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure. CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish? RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, "Well he did this; he did that." I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason. CNN's Kyle Almond contributed to this report.
The failure of teachers to control badly behaved children in lessons is dragging down standards, the chief inspector of schools will warn this week. Too many teachers have come to believe that poor discipline is an inevitable part of life in the classroom and heads need to crack down on the problem, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say. He will deliver his verdict after the publication of a major report by the schools inspectorate Ofsted, showing that a vast amount of teaching time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils. Scroll down for video . Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw, centre, said teachers need to crack down on poor classroom discipline . Teacher unions hit back last night, accusing Sir Michael of ‘talking nonsense’ by suggesting teachers accepted poor discipline, arguing instead that they were being let down by out-of-touch senior staff. The Oftsed report, based on specially commissioned surveys of teachers and parents and more than 3,000 school inspections, found that most teachers admit they are plagued by pupils making silly comments to get attention, swinging on chairs, passing notes around, humming or using mobile phones. Many teachers complained that heads were failing to back them and did not assert their authority when dealing with pupils flouting rules. The findings will bolster Sir Michael’s concerns that ‘a culture of casual acceptance’ of persistent disruption was preventing England’s school system from competing with high-performing Asian countries. This week he will also say that while serious breaches of discipline are less common today, the chances of pupils being in calm and well-ordered classrooms had become ‘something of a lottery’, damaging their future prospects. Ofsted’s annual report in December found that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT said teachers are not failing to address disruptive pupils .
And in a challenge to heads, he will argue that strong leadership is the key to cracking down on disruptive behaviour and creating good conditions for learning. Chris Keates, general secretary of union NASUWT, said her members acknowledged there was a widespread problem with low- level disruption in lessons. But she added: ‘The Chief Inspector is, as usual, talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it. ‘What teachers do say is that… they are frequently unsupported by school leaders who too often do not teach and are divorced from the day to day realities of life in the classroom.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving, according to Ofsted itself. ‘We agree that school leaders must support staff. ‘Good behaviour comes from the skills of teachers but also from a consistent policy across the institution.’

Beer is one of the world's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia. Now, 5,000-year-old fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv, Israel. The pottery shards come from large ceramic basins, which were used to prepare fruity beer that was left to ferment under the sun.

Diego Barkan, of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said that 17 pits were found that had been used to store produce in the Early Bronze Age, from 3,500 to 3,000 BC. Beer was the favourite drink of humans and gods in ancient Egypt. It was also drank by rich and poor, adults and children. This was because it was cleaner than water, which came from a river or canal and was often polluted. Beer was considered as staple, along with bread, Reshafim.org reported. Workers were paid with bread, oil, beer and vegetables by their employers. The standard ration was two jars containing three-and-a-half pints (two litres) of beer. Just like today, the Egyptians liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water. ‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ he said in a statement. The vessels were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries.
The excavation is the first to offer evidence of an ‘Egyptian occupation’ in the centre of Tel Aviv 5,000 years ago. As well as the basins, a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered. Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age. ‘Until now we were only aware of an Egyptian presence in the northern Negev and southern coastal plain, whereby the northernmost point of Egyptian occupation occurred in Azor. Fragments of pottery that are around 5,000 years old and were used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv. Here, Diego Barkan holds the basin parts .

The tomb of Khonso Em Heb, who lived 3,200 years ago, was found by a Japanese team and has been been described as 'one of the most important discoveries' made at the Thebes necropolic site in the city of Luxor. Egypt's antiquities minister Mohamed Ibrahim described Khonso Em Heb as the chief ‘maker of beer for gods of the dead'. He was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man. The walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals.
‘Now we know that they also appreciated what the Tel Aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer, just as Tel Avivians do today’. According to the antiquities authority, ‘beer was the Egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread.’ It said beer was consumed by the entire population of Egypt, regardless of age, gender or status. ‘It was made from a mixture of barley and water that was partially baked and then left to ferment in the sun. ‘Various fruit concentrates were added to this mixture in order to flavour the beer.’ The mixture was filtered in special vessels before serving. Previous excavations carried out in Egypt's Delta region uncovered breweries that indicate beer was already being produced in the mid-fourth millennium BC, the Israeli authority said. The fragments were discovered in pits on Ha-Masger Street in central Tel Aviv (marked on the map). Excavations are taking place before the construction of an office building . The vessels (pictured) were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries. This one dates to the Early Bronze Age I (3,500 BC) Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age.
