But turning up and talking like this she has quite taken the wind out of my sails. She called in the woman who had just come and asked her, What are these annual allowances for Master Huan and Master Lan for? For a years refreshments at school and the remainder for stationery, was the reply. Each gets eight taels of silver a year. All the young masters expenses are covered by the monthly allowances for the different apartments, countered Tanchun. Huans two taels a month are given to Concubine Zhao, Baoyus to the old ladys maid Xiren and Lans to Madam Zhus maid. So why this extra eight taels for the school? Do they go to school for the sake of this eight taels? From now on this will be cancelled. Tell your mistress this from me, Pinger, when you go back. Say I think theres no need for it. This should have been cut long ago, said the maid with a smile. Last year my mistress did speak of doing it, but with all the bustle over New Year she forgot. Then the matron had to assent and take herself off. Now servants from Grand View Garden brought lunch hampers, and Pinger set out the dishes on the small table put ready by Daishu and Suyun. You can go and attend to your business now that youve had your say, Tanchun told her. You dont have to help out here. Im free now. replied Pinger, smiling. The Second Mistress sent me partly to give you that message, partly to help the girls wait on you if I found you short-handed. Wheres Miss Baochais lunch? asked Tanchun. Some girls hurried out to notify the matrons, Miss Baochais lunching here too. Have her food brought over. Hearing this Tanchun said loudly, Dont start ordering them about. Theyre all the wives of chief stewards, not people you can send to fetch rice and tea! Have you no manners? Pinger has nothing to do here. Let her go. Pinger promptly agreed and went out. The stewards wives quietly drew her aside and said, Theres no need for you to go, miss. Weve already sent someone. They dusted off the steps with their handkerchiefs and urged her to have a rest there in the sun after standing for so long. As soon as she sat down, two women from the boiler house brought over a mattress. That stones cold, miss, they said. This is quite clean, do use it. As she thanked them with a smile, someone else brought her a bowl of good freshly brewed tea. This isnt our usual tea but some for the young ladies, she whispered. Do try it. Pinger inclined her head and accepted it. Then wagging finger at them all she scolded, Youve really gone too far. Shes only a girl and, quite properly, doesnt like to lose her temper but thats no reason why you should be rude to her. If you really made her angry, at worst she could be blamed for flaring up but youd get into big trouble. If she made a scene, even Lady Wang would have to humour her, and theres nothing the Second Mistress could do either. How have you the nerve to slight her in that way? Its like an egg dashing itself against a rock. How dare we? they protested. It was all Concubine Zhaos fault. Thats enough, my good women, whispered Pinger. If a wall starts tottering, everyone gives it a shove. Concubine Zhao does tend to turn things upside down, I grant you, but when theres trouble you put all the blame on her. Ive seen for myself these years the airs you give yourselves and the tricks you play. If the Second Mistress werent so able, you fine ladies would have got the upper hand of her long ago. Every chance you get, you still try to land her in trouble. Several times shes only just missed falling into your traps. People say youre scarred of her because shes such a terror, Pinger continued. But I who know her best can tell you shes afraid of you too. Only the other day, we were saying things couldnt go on like this there were bound to be a couple of rumpuses. Though Miss Tanchuns an unmarried young lady, youve all misjudged her. Shes the only one of the young ladies that my mistress is half afraid of yet you think you can treat her any way you please! They were interrupted by Qiuwens arrival. All the matrons greeted her and urged her to rest for a while. Theyre having lunch inside, they explained. Youd better not go in till theyve finished. What time have Ito wait?
As she clasped the hands of her grandmother and mother, the hearts of all three were too full to speak they could do nothing but sob. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Xifeng, Yuanchuns half sister Tanchun and her cousins Yingchun and Xichun also stood beside them weeping silently. But at last the Imperial Consort mastered her grief and forced a smile as she tried to comfort them. Since you sent me away to that forbidden place, it hasnt been easy getting this chance today to come home and see you all again, she said. But instead of chatting and laughing, here we are crying! Soon I shall have to leave you, and there is no knowing when I can come back again. At this she broke down afresh. Lady Xing and the others did their best to console her and the Lady Dowager asked her to take a seat, after which she exchanged courtesies with each in turn and more tears were shed. Next the stewards and attendants of both mansions paid their respects outside the door, and so did their wives and the maids. This ceremony at an end, Yuanchun asked why Aunt Xue, Baochai and Daiyu were missing. Lady Wang explained that they were afraid to presume, not being members of the Jia family and having no official status. The Imperial Consort asked them to be invited in at once, and they were about to pay homage according to Palace etiquette when she exempted them too and chatted with them. Next Baoqin and the other maids whom Yuanchun had taken with her to the Palace kowtowed to the Lady Dowager, who hastily stopped them and sent them off to have some refreshments in another room. The senior eunuchs and ladies-in-waiting were also entertained by members of the staff of both mansions, leaving only three or four young eunuchs in attendance. When the ladies of the family had spoken with feeling about their separation and all that had happened since, Jia Zheng from outside the door-curtain asked after the health of his daughter, and she in turn paid her respects. With tears she told him, Simple farmers who live on pickles and dress in homespun at least know the joys of family life together. What pleasure can I take in high rank and luxury when we are separated like this? With tears too he replied, Your subject, poor and obscure, little dreamed that our flock of common pigeons and crows would ever be blessed with a phoenix. Thanks to the Imperial favour and the virtue of our ancestors, your Noble Highness embodies the finest essences of nature and the accumulated merit of our forbears such fortune has attended my wife and myself. His Majesty, who manifests the great virtue of all creation, has shown us such extraordinary and hitherto unknown favour that even if we dashed out our brains we could not repay one-thousandth part of our debt of gratitude. All I can do is to exert myself day and night, loyally carry out my official duties, and pray that our sovereign may live ten thousand years as desired by all under heaven. Your Noble Highness must not grieve your precious heart in concern for your ageing parents. We beg you to take better care of your own health. Be cautious, circumspect, diligent and respectful. Honour the Emperor and serve him well, so as to prove yourself not ungrateful for His Majestys bountiful goodness and great kindness. Then it was Yuanchuns turn to urge her father to devote himself to affairs of state, look after his health and dismiss all anxiety regarding her. After this Jia Zheng informed her, All the inscriptions on the pavilions and lodges in the Garden were composed by Baoyu. If you find one or two of the buildings not too tame, please condescend to re-name them yourself, that would make us extremely happy. The news that Baoyu was already able to compose inscriptions made her exclaim with delight, So hes making progress! When Jia Zheng had withdrawn, the Imperial Consort observed that Baochai and Daiyu stood out from their girl cousins, being truly fairer than flowers or finest jade. Then she inquired why Baoyu had not come to greet her. The Lady Dowager explained that, unless specially summoned, as a young man without official rank he dared not presume. At once the Imperial Consort sent for him and a young eunuch ushered him in to pay homage according to Palace etiquette. His sister called him to her and took his hand. Drawing him close to her bosom, she stroked his neck and commented with a smile, How you have grown! But even as she spoke her tears fell like rain. Madam You and Xifeng stepped forward then to announce, The banquet is ready. We beg Your Highness to favour us with your presence.
And if you find out that one of the little maids stole it, dont report it to the mistresses but give her something in exchange for it. This isnt just anything! If its really lost, thats more serious than losing Master Bao! As Sheyue and Qiuwen were leaving, she hurried after them with a final warning Dont start by asking those who came to the feast. Because then, if you cant find it, that will cause more trouble and make matters worse. Sheyue and Qiuwen agreed and went off separately to make inquiries but nobody had seen the jade, and they were all alarmed. The two of them hurried back to eye each other blankly in consternation. By now Baoyu was alarmed too, while Xiren could only sob in desperation. The jade had vanished, and they dared not report it. All the inmates of Happy Red Court were petrified. While they were in this state of stupefaction, along came some people who had heard of their loss. Tanchun ordered the Garden gate to be closed and sent an old serving-woman with two young maids to make another comprehensive search, promising a handsome reward to anyone who found the jade. Eagerness to clear themselves and receive a reward made everyone search frantically high and low they even scoured the privies. But it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. They searched all day in vain. This is no laughing matter, said Li Wan in desperation. Ive a blunt proposal to make. What is it? the others asked. Things have come to such a pass, we cant be too nice. Now apart from Baoyu all the others in the Garden are women. Im going to ask all you girls, as well as the maids you brought with you, to take off your clothes to be searched. If the jade isnt found, well tell the maids to search the serving-women and the maids doing the rough work. What do you say? Thats an idea, they agreed. With such a crowd of us here were a mixed lot, and this would be a way to clear ourselves. Only Tanchun made no comment. As the maids also wanted to clear themselves of suspicion, Pinger volunteered to be the first to be searched. Then the others stripped too, and Li Wan searched them in turn. Sister-in-law! snapped Tanchun. Where did you learn to behave in this scandalous way? If anyone stole it she wouldnt keep it on her, would she? Besides, this jade may be treasured here but to outsiders not in the know its quite useless, so why should anyone steal it? Im sure that someone is up to monkey tricks. When they heard this and noticed Huans absence though earlier on he had been running all over the place they suspected him but were unwilling to say so. Huans the only one whod play such a trick, Tanchun continued. Send somebody to fetch him quietly and persuade him to return it then give him a scare to make him keep his mouth shut, and that will be that. The others nodded approval. Li Wan told .Pinger, Youre the only one who can get the truth out of him. Pinger agreed to try and hurried off, coming back before long with ha Huan. The rest pretended that nothing was amiss and told maids to serve him tea in the inner room. Then they excused themselves, leaving him to Pinger. Your Brother Bao has lost his jade, she told him with a smile. Have you seen it? Jia Huan flushed scarlet and glared. When he loses something, why suspect me? he protested. Am I a convicted thief? He looked so worked up that Pinger dared not press him. I didnt mean that, She explained with a smile. I thought you might have taken it to scare them thats why I simply asked if youd seen it or not, to help them find it. He was the one wearing the jade, so hes the one you should ask instead of me. You all make so much of him! When theres something good going, you dont ask me to share it but when anythings lost, Im the one you ask about it! He got up and marched out, and they could not stop him. All this troubles due to that silly thing! burst out Baoyu. I dont want it, so you neednt make such a fuss. When Huan gets back hes bound to tell everyone and raise a fearful rumpus. Weeping in desperation Xiren said, You may not care that the jades lost, Little Ancestor, but if this comes to the mistresses ears itll be the death of us! She broke down and sobbed. Now that it was clear that this could not be hushed up, feeling even more worried they discussed how best to report it to the old lady and other mistresses.
Besides, I dont like noodles. I didnt have a proper meal this morning and Im hungry, so Ive told Mrs. Liu to prepare me a bowl of soup and half a bowl of rice and send them here. Ill eat here. If were drinking tonight you mustnt let anyone stop me I mean to drink my fill. At home, in the old days, I used to be able to drink two or three catties of good Huiquan wine but after I learned this wretched singing they said drinking might spoil my voice, so for the last few years I havent so much as smelt a whiff of wine. I shall take the chance today to break my fast. Thats simple, he said. Now a maid arrived with a hamper from Mrs. Liu. Xiaoyan took it and opened it, then put on the table one bowl of chickenskin soup with shrimp balls, one bowl of steamed duck with wine sauce, one of salted goose and another of four pine-kernel cream puffs, as well as a big bowl of hot green rice. She then fetched pickles, bowls and chopsticks, and filled one small bowl with rice. Who wants such greasy stuff? complained Fangguan, just ladling some soup on the rice and eating a bowlful with two pieces of goose. To Baoyu, the food smelled more appetizing than his usual fare, so first he ate one cream puff, then asked Xiaoyan for half a bowl of rice which he ate with soup and found delicious, exactly to his taste, much to the two girls amusement. After he had finished, Xiaoyan prepared to take back what was left. You may as well finish it off, proposed Baoyu. If its not enough ask for some more. Theres no need for that this is plenty for me, she answered. Just now Sister Sheyue brought us two plates of cakes. After eating this Ill have had enough and shant need any more. So standing there by the table she finished all the food except two cream puffs, saying, Ill keep these for my mother. If youre drinking tonight, give me a couple of bowls. So you like wine too? exclaimed Baoyu. Wait till this evening then, and well have a good bout of drinking. Your sisters Xiren and Qingwen have a good capacity and enjoy drinking too, only normally they dont feel they should. Well, today everyone can break her fast. Theres another thing I meant to tell you which Ive only just remembered. In future you must take good care of Fangguan, and tell her if she does anything wrong. Xiren hasnt time to look after so many girls. I know all that, said Xiaoyan. You dont have to worry. But what about Wuer? Tell Mrs. Liu to send her here tomorrow. Ill inform them about it later and that will be that. Fangguan hearing this exclaimed, Now thats something really important! Xiaoyan called in two young maids then to wait on them while they washed their hands and to pour them tea while she herself cleared the table, gave the dishes to a serving-woman, washed her hands and went to see Mrs. Liu. Baoyu started back then to Red Fragrance Farm to rejoin the girls, followed by Fangguan carrying his handkerchief and fan. As they went out of the gate they met Xiren and Qingwen, coming back hand in hand. What are you two doing? Baoyu asked them. The meals on the table waiting for you, Xiren said. Smiling, Baoyu told them what he had just eaten. I always say youre as bad as a cat, Xiren laughed. Whatever you smell takes your fancy. Other peoples food tastes better to you than your own. Still, youd better go and keep them company and make a show of eating. Qingwen stabbed at Fangguans forehead with her finger. You vamp! she cried. When did you sneak off to have a meal? How did you two arrange it? Why didnt you let us know? They just happened to meet, said Xiren soothingly. They certainly didnt arrange it in advance. If thats how it is, he doesnt need us, said Qingwen. Tomorrow well all clear out, leaving just Fangguan here to wait on him. Xiren chuckled, All the rest of us can go, but not you. Qingwen retorted, I should be the first to go, lazy, stupid, bad-tempered and useless as I am. Supposing that peacock-feather cape gets burned again, who can mend it if youre gone? asked Xiren. Dont give me that silly talk. When I ask you to do anything, youre too lazy to thread a needle.
As her family owned so many osmanthus trees, she had been given 2433 the pet name Jingui Golden Osmanthus so she forebade the whole household to use these two words. Any maid careless enough to slip up and do so was severely beaten and punished. Then, realizing the impossibility of banning any reference to osmanthus, she decided to give the flower a new name and recalling the story of the osmanthus and the Moon Goddess, 4 she changed the name of the flower to moon-goddess flower to add to her own dignity in this way. Now Xue Pan was a man who would discard the old as soon as he had something new, and one who looked tough but lacked stamina. Pleased with his new wife at the start, he humoured her. And Xia Jingui observing this tried to control him more strictly step by step. For the first month they were on equal terms after two months Xue Pan began to give ground. One day after drinking he consulted her on something he wished to do and, when she would not hear of it, losing his temper he made an angry retort then went ahead and did it. Then Jingui cried as if she were demented, refused all food and pretended to be ill. The doctor summoned to see her said She has anger in her blood and should take some tranquillizing medicine. Aunt Xue berated her son. Youre a married man now and will soon have a son of your own, yet youre still such a fool! she fumed. She was brought up like a young phoenix, a daughter as delicate as a flower and her family agreed to let you have her, thinking you a gentleman. Yet instead of keeping yourself in check, behaving yourself and living peacefully, you act like an oaf and bully her in your cups. Youll have to suffer for it and spend money now on medicine. Xue Pan, filled with remorse by these reproaches, went in to comfort his wife. But Jingui, delighted to have her mother-in-law take her side, behaved still more arrogantly in her gratification at this and out-manoeuvred him by simply ignoring him. Not knowing what to do, he had to lump it. And it took him nearly a fortnight to mollify her. After that Xue Pan took greater pains not to provoke her, and inevitably this humbled him still more. Seeing that her husband was lowering his colours and her mother-in-law was good-natured, Jingui pressed her at- 2435 tack by degress. At first she simply kept Xue Pan under her thumb later she tried artfully to control Aunt Xue as well, and Baochai too. Baochai had long recognized her impropriety and knew how to cope with it, giving her hints not to over-reach herself. When Jingui saw that she was not to be bullied, she tried to pick fault with her in various ways but being unable to find any chinks in her armour, she finally had to come to terms with her. One day Jingui, at a loose end, started chatting with Xiangling and asked about her home district and her parents. When Xiangling said she could not remember them, Jingui flared up and accused her of deliberately hiding things from her. She then asked who had given her the name Xiangling, and on being told that it was Baochai she gave a scornful smile. Everyone says shes learned, she scoffed, but this name doesnt make sense. Xiangling answered with a conciliatory smile, A iya, madam! You may not know, but even her uncle is always praising her for her scholarship. To know what Jinguis answer was, read the next chapter. Chapter 8 Nanny Li Makes a Nuisance of Herself by Warning Against Drinking Baoyu Breaks a Teacup and Flies into a Temper After Xifeng and Baoyu reached home and had paid their greetings, Baoyu told the Lady Dowager of Qin Zhongs eagerness to attend their clan school, and the incentive it would be for him to have a friend and companion in his studies. He painted a glowing picture of the other boys admirable character and lovable qualities. Xifeng backed him up, adding, In a day or two Qin Thong will be coming to pay his respects to our Old Ancestress. She then took advantage of the old ladys pleasure at this news to invite her to the opera in two days time. In spite of her age, the Lady Dowager looked forward to any excitement. When the day arrived and Madam You came to invite her, she took Lady Wang, Daiyu, Baoyu and others along to watch the performances. At noon the old lady went home for her siesta. And Lady Wang, who liked peace and quiet, returned too after her mother-in-laws departure.
Xue Ke was to be put up in Xue Pans study. The Lady Dowager then told Lady Xing, Your niece neednt go home for a few days either. Let her enjoy herself in the Garden first. As Lady Xings elder brother was poorly off, he and his wife had counted on her providing them with accommodation and financial assistance during this visit to the capital so Xiuyan was entrusted to Xifeng. Now there were many girls, temperamentally different, in the Garden and as Xifeng considered it unnecessary to open up another house for Xiuyan, she decided the best thing would be to put her up with Yingchun for then if later Lady Xing heard that her niece was dissatisfied, no blame would attach to Xifeng. And not counting the time she chose to spend at home, each month that she stayed in Grand View Garden Xifeng would allocate her the same monthly allowance as Yingchun. Dispassionately appraising Xiuyans character and behaviour, she found her unlike both Lady Xing and her parents, being extremely gentle and lovable. So Xifeng gave her preferential treatment out of pity for her poverty and hard life, whereas Lady Xing paid little attention to her. Because the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang appreciated Li Wans good qualities and her admirable conduct since her husbands untimely death, they would not hear of her widowed aunt staying anywhere but in their house. So although most reluctant to impose on them, on the old ladys insistence Li Wans aunt had to move into Paddy-Sweet Cottage with her two daughters. Barely had the newcomers settled in than Shi Nai, Marquis of Baoling, was transferred to a provincial governorship. In a few days he would be taking his family to his new post. Not wanting to part with Xiangyun, the Lady Dowager kept her and had her fetched to their house, directing Xifeng go to give her a separate establishment. This Xiangyun resolutely declined, however, and at her insistence they let her move in with Baochai instead. Things were livelier in Grand View Garden now that thirteen people, counting in Xifeng, lived there. In addition to Li Wan who had senior status there were Yingchun, Tanchun, Xichun, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Li Wen, Li Qi, Baoqin and Xiuyan, as well as Xifeng and Baoyu. Apart from the two married women, the other eleven were all about the same age fifteen, sixteen or seventeen. Some of them had been born in the same month, on the same day or at the same hour, with the result that they themselves often confused their ages. Thus the terms elder sister, younger sister, younger brother and elder brother were bandied about at random. Xianglings whole heart was nowadays set on writing poetry, but she did not like to trouble Baochai too much. For her, talkative Xiangyuns arrival was a stroke of luck, as the latter was only too glad to be consulted on poetry and would cheerfully hold forth on the subject at all hours of the day and night. Youre deafening me with this noise, protested Baochai jokingly. Real scholars would laugh to hear a girl discussing poetry so seriously. Theyd say youd forgotten your place. One Xiangling is more than enough without a chatterbox like you joining in and spouting about Du Fus profundity, Wei Yingwus quiet distinction, Wen Tingyuns brilliance and Li Shangyins recondite obscurity. All these are dead poets why harp on them without any mention of our two living poets? Which two living poets? Do tell me, dear sister, begged Xiangyun. The hard-working eccentric Xiangling and the garrulous lunatic Xiangyun, answered Baochai. Xiangling and Xiangyun were laughing uproariously when Baoqin arrived. She was wearing a glittering green and gold cape made of some fabric they did not recognize. Where did this come from? asked Baochai. The old lady got it out for me because it was beginning to hail, replied her cousin. Xiangling examining it more closely remarked, No wonder its so pretty its made of peacock feathers. Not peacock feathers, Xiangyun corrected her. The feathers from wild ducks heads. That shows how fond of you the old lady is. Fond as she is of Baoyu, she never gave him this to wear. As the proverb says, The fortune of each is predestined, put in Baochai. I never thought shed come here at this time or that, having come, the old lady would take such a fancy to her. Xiangyun told Baoqin, There are two places here where you can enjoy yourself just as you please the old ladys apartments or here in the Garden.
It should still all be spent on her. The old lady's from the south, where there is a graveyard but no houses for offering sacrifices. As her coffin's to go back to the south, we should keep some money to build houses in the ancestral graveyard and use the remainder to buy a few acres of fields to provide for sacrifices. Even if we don't return south ourselves we can let some poor relations live there, to sacrifice to her during festivals and to see to the upkeep of the grave.' Don't you agree that that's a sound idea? So how can we spend the whole sum on the funeral?" "Have they issued the silver yet?" 'Who's seen any silver? All I know is that after my mother heard this she thoroughly approved, telling the Second Master and Mistress that it was a good idea. So what can I do? Now the men putting up the funeral sheds outside want several hundred taels, but no silver has been issued. When I went to draw some, they said they had the money but we should get the workmen to finish the job before settling accounts with them. Just think, all those servants with money have skedaddled. When we call the roll, some are said to be on sick leave, others 10 have gone to the farm. Those few left here, unable to leave, are just out to make money. Who's going to advance us any?" Xifeng was struck speechless. Eventually she asked, "Then how are We to manage?" Just then a maid came in and said, "The Elder Mistress wants to ask you, madam, why everything's still topsy-turvy though today is the third day. After the sacrifice, why keep relatives waiting around? She called several times for the meal before the dishes came without any rice. What way is this to manage?" Xifeng at once went to expedite the servants and manage to get a meal of sorts served to the guests. As ill luck would have it, many guests had come, but all the servants were so apathetic that Xifeng had to see to things herself. Then in her concern she burned out and made Lai Wang's wife summon all the serving-women to assign them different tasks. The women accepted these but made no move. "What time is it?" Xifeng demanded. "Why haven't you prepared the sacrificial offerings?" "That's easily done," they answered. "But first we have to be issued with supplies." "You stupid creatures!" fumed Xifeng. "Of course you'll get what you need for the jobs you're given." The women went off then reluctantly, while Xifeng hurried to the main apartment to ask Their Ladyships' permission to fetch what would be needed. She could hardly do this, however, in front of so many guests. As it was nearing sunset, she had to find Yuanyang and tell her which of the old lady's things she wanted. "Why ask me?" replied Yuanyang. "Didn't Master Lian pawn them that year? Has he ever redeemed them?" "We don't need gold or silver, just an ordinary dinner service." "Hasn't that gone to Lady Xing and Madam You?" Xifeng realized that this was so and went to Lady Wang's quarters to find Yuchuan and Caiyun. Having got what she required from them she hastily made Caiming list these things, then handed them over to the serving-women. Xifeng had looked so flustered that Yuanyang did not like to call her back. She wondered, "Why is she bungling things like this now when she used to be such a good manager? In the last few days things have been at Sixes and sevens. The old lady's love for her was thrown away!" She was unaware that Lady Xing had concurred with Jia Zheng's proposal because she had been worrying about her family's future and was eager to put something by. Besides, as the old lady's funeral should have been superintended by the senior branch of the family, although Jia She was away, each time there was some decision to make punctilious Jia Zheng would say, "Ask the Elder Mistress." Lady Xing had always considered Xifeng extravagant and Jia Lian unreliable and would therefore not let any money out of her hands. Yuanyang, assuming that the funeral expenses had already been issued, suspected Xifeng of floundering because she did not take the business seriously. Accordingly she kept weeping and wailing before the old lady's coffin. When Lady Xing heard these implied reproaches, instead of blaming herself for not facilitating Xifeng's work she said, "It's true, Xifeng isn't putting herself out." That evening Lady Wang summoned Xifeng and told her, "Though our family's in these straits, we must keep up appearances.
The boys striking charm and air of distinction contrasted so strongly with Jia Huans vulgar, common appearance that he was reminded of his dead son Zhu. He glanced at Lady Wang. She had only this one son left and she doted on him. As for him, his beard was already turning grey. Bearing all this in mind, he forgot his usual aversion to Baoyu. After a pause he said Her Highness has ordered you to study and practise calligraphy with the girls in the Garden, instead of fooling around outside and neglecting your studies. Mind that you apply yourself there to your lessons. If you go on misbehaving, watch out! Yes, sir, agreed Baoyu hastily. Then his mother drew him over to sit beside her while Jia Huan and the other two sat down again. Stroking her sons neck fondly Lady Wang asked Have you finished those pills prescribed for you the other day? All but one. You must fetch ten more tomorrow. Get Xiren to see that you take one each evening at bedtime. Ever since you ordered it, madam, Xiren has been giving me one every evening. Who is Xiren? demanded Jia Zheng. One of the maids, his wife told him. A maid can be called anything, I suppose. But who thought up such a suggestive name for her? To shield Baoyu from his fathers displeasure Lady Wang said, It was the old ladys idea. Such a name would never occur to the old lady. This must have been Baoyus doing. Since there was no hiding the truth Baoyu rose to confess I remembered that line of an old poem -740 When the fragrance of flowers assails men we know the day is warm. As this maids surname is Hua Flower, I called her Xiren. You must change it when you go back, put in Lady Wang quickly. Then she turned to her husband. Dont be angry, sir, over such a little thing. It doesnt really matter, theres no need to change it. But this shows that instead of studying properly Baoyu gives all his time to romantic trash. Then he said sternly to Baoyu What are you standing there for, you unnatural monster? Run along, urged Lady Wang. The old lady is probably waiting for you for supper. Baoyu assented and slowly withdrew. Once outside he grinned and stuck out his tongue at Jinchuan before hurrying off with the two nurses. He found Xiren leaning in the doorway of the entrance hail. Her face lit up when she saw that he was back safely, and she asked what his father had wanted. Nothing much. Just to warn me to be on my best behaviour when I move into the Garden. Having by now reached the Lady Dowagers room he told her what had happened. Then he asked Daiyu, who was there, in which part of the Garden she would like to live. Daiyu had been thinking this over and she answered My choice would be Bamboo Lodge. I love those bamboos half hiding the winding balustrade, and the place is quieter than anywhere else. Just what I thought! Baoyu clapped his hands. Thats where I want you. With me in Happy Red Court, we shall be close together and beautifully quiet. At this point Jia Zheng sent a servant to report to the Lady Dowager that the twenty-second of the second month would be an auspicious day for the move into the Garden, and the young peoples quarters would be ready by then. Baochai was to have Alpinia Park, Daiyu Bamboo Lodge, Yingchun the Pavilion of Variegated Splendour, Tanchun the Studio of Autumn Freshness, Xichun Smartweed Breeze Cot, Li Wan Paddy-Sweet Cottage, and Baoyu Happy Red Court. Two old nurses and four maids were assigned to each apartment in addition to the occupants nanny and own attendants, and there were other servants whose sole duty was cleaning and sweeping. On the twenty-second they all moved in and at once the Garden gay with flowers and willows ruffled by a fragrant breeze from embroidered sashes lost its former air of desolation but no need to describe this in detail. Baoyu found life in the Garden all he could wish. He asked nothing better than to spend every day with his sisters, cousins and maids, reading, writing, strumming the lute, playing chess, painting, chanting poems, watching the girls embroider their phoenix patterns, enjoying the flowers, softly singing, guessing riddles or playing the guess-fingers game. In a word, he was blissfully happy. There he wrote the following verses on the four seasons, which although quite commonplace give some idea of his sentiments and the scenery. SPRING NIGHT -740 The walls flaunt hangings bright as sunset clouds To muffle the frogs croaking in the lane The rain outside the window chills my pillow, This vision of spring seems like the girl of my dreams.
Their Ladyships stared at her speechlessly. It was Caiyun who interceded, "Sister Yuanyang, you died of your own accord and Concubine Zhao had nothing to do with it. Please let her be." In Lady Xing's presence she dared not say any more. 'I'm not Yuanyang," protested Concubine Zhao. "She's long since gone to the immortals' realm. The King of Hell has sent to arrest me, to try me for practising witchcraft with that priestess Ma." Then she screamed, "Good Madam Lian! Don't denounce me to the King of Hell! Bad as I was I must have done a bit of good as well. Dear madam, kind madam! I didn't mean to kill you. I was muddled for a while and did what that old bitch said." While she was raving like this, Jia Zheng sent for Jia Huan. Serving-women reported to him, "Concubine Zhao is bewitched and Master Huan is looking after her." "What nonsense!" scoffed Jia Zheng. 'We shall go first then." So the gentlemen set off. Concubine Zhao went on raving in the temple and they did not know how to bring her to her senses. For fear of further disclosures Lady Xing said, "Leave some people here to look after her. We'll go back first. When we reach the city we'll send a doctor to see her." Lady Wang who had never liked Concubine Zhao also washed her hands of her. But Baochai was too kind-hearted to do this, despite the attempt on Baoyu's life which she remembered, and so she secretly told Concubine Zhou to stay and look after her. The latter, being a good soul, agreed. Li Wan volunteered to stay too but Lady Wang overrode her. "Do I have to stay here?" asked Jia Huan in desperation as they were leaving. 'Stupid creature!" snapped Lady Wang. "Your mother may be dymg. How can you leave?" This silenced Jia Huan, and Baoyu told him, "Good brother, you mustn't leave. When I get back to town I'll send people to see you." Then they all went home by carriage, leaving only Concubines Zhao and Zhou, Jia Huan, Yingge and a few others in the temple. After Jia Zheng, Lady Xing and the others reached home, they went to the old lady's room and wept. Lin Zhixiao led in the servants to kneel and pay their respects. 'Get out!" ordered Jia Zheng sternly. "We'll question you tomorrow. Xifeng had been feeling too faint that day to come out to welcome them. Xichun met them blushing with shame. Lady Xing ignored her, while Lady Wang treated her as if nothing had happened and Li Wan and Baochai took her hand and said a few words to her. Only Madam You sneered, "Thank you, miss, for looking after the house the last few days." Xichun made no answer, her face flushing crimson as Baochai pulled Madam You's sleeve and shot her a glance. Then they all dispersed to their own quarters. Jia Zheng after a cursory look round heaved a sigh but made no comment. He went to sit in his study and summoned Jia Lian, Jia Rong and Jia Yun to give them certain instructions. Baoyu's offer to keep him company there he declined and Lan remained with his mother. After an uneventful night, Lin Zhixiao came to the study first thing in the morning to kneel before his master. Questioned about the theft, he mentioned Zhou Rui's involvement. "The police have arrested Bao Er," he said. "They found on him Some of the things listed as stolen. Now they are interrogating him to find out the whereabouts of that gang of thieves." "What ingratitude!" thundered Jia Zheng. 'Family slaves bringing thieves to rob their masters! Outrageous!" He at once sent men out of the city to tie up Zhou Rui and take him to the police to be cross-examined. Lin Zhixiao remained kneeling before him in trepidation. "Why are you still kneeling there?" Jia Zheng demanded. "I deserve death. I beg you, sir, to be merciful!" Just then Lai Da and other senior servants came in to pay their respects and present the accounts for the funeral. "Give those to Master Lian to check and report back to me." This order given, Jia Zheng dismissed the stewards. ha Lian going down on one knee whispered something to him.
When they started fighting, he slipped away. Bring him here! This is the limit! The servants assented. In the midst of this commotion Jia Lian came back and his cousin described what had happened. Scandalous! exclaimed Jia Lian. He sent more servants in search of Zhou Rui, who came, knowing he was in for it. Tie them all up! Jia Zhen ordered. Jia Lian fumed at Zhou Rui, Your earlier dispute could have been overlooked, and the master had already dismissed you both. Why start another fight outside? The two of you fighting was bad enough, but you dragged in that bastard He San as well to make trouble. And instead of checking them, you cleared off! He gave Zhou Rui several kicks. Just beating Zhou Rui is not enough, said Jia Zhen. He ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes apiece, then drive them out, after which he and Jia Lian discussed other business. The servants, in private, aired different views about this. Some said Jia Zhen was biased, unable to settle disputes, others that he was a debauchee. Earlier on, when the You sisters were carrying on in that shameless way, wasnt it he who persuaded Master Lian to take Bao Er on? one pointed out. Now it must be because hes lost interest in Bao Ers wife that hes found fault with Bao Er. Thus they argued the matter at length. Now Jia Zhengs post in the Ministry of Works enabled his domestics to enrich themselves. And ha Yun, getting wind of this, hoped to procure some lucrative job himself. He approached contractors outside, and after coming to terms with them bought some fashionable embroidery with which to persuade Xifeng to secure him a commission. Xifeng, at home, heard from the maids that Jia Zhen and her husband, angry with some of the servants, were having them beaten. She was about to send to find out what had happened, when Jia Lian came in and told her the whole story. Its a small matter in itself, was Xifengs comment, but well have to put a stop to such behaviour. Our family still counts as enjoying good fortune, but even so these underlings dare fight! Later on, when the younger generation takes over, theyll get quite out of hand. The other year, in the East Mansion, I saw Jiao Da lying as drunk as a lord at the foot of the steps cursing wildly. Swearing at high and low he was, quite regardless! He may have served his first master well, but still hes only a servant and ought to show some respect. Your Cousin Zhens wife if you dont mind my saying so is so easy-going that all her staff are spoilt and quite above themselves. And now theres this fellow Bao Er! I understood that he was a favourite with you and your Cousin Zhen, so why did you beat him today? Embarrassed by this question, Jia Lian sheepishly changed the subject, then left her on the pretext that he had business. Xiaohong came in next to report that ha Yun was outside asking to see her. Invite him in, said Xifeng, wondering why he had come. Hongyu went out and smiled at Jia Yun, who hastily stepped closer. Did you give her my message, miss? he asked. Blushing she said, You seem to have a lot of business, sir! How often have I troubled you before? he protested. Only once, the other year when you were in Uncle Baos place.... For fear of detection she cut him short by asking, Did you see the handkerchief I left you that time, sir? Jia Yun was overjoyed by this question. But before he could answer a young maid came out, and he and Hongyu hurried towards the house, walking side by side, not keeping their distance from each other. When I come out presently, whispered Jia Yun, I want you to see me out, Ive something amusing to tell you. Hongyu blushed and glanced at him, but did not answer. When they reached Xifengs room, she went in first to announce him, then came out again and raised the portiere. She beckoned him in, but said deliberately, Madam Lian asks you to come in, Master Yun. Smiling, he followed her into the room and paid his respects to Xifeng. My mother sends her greetings, he added. Xifeng inquired after his mother too, then asked, What can I do for you? Ive never forgotten your past goodness to me, aunt, and have always wished I could show my gratitude. Only I was afraid you might suspect I had ulterior motives.
The other nurses dont dare take you to task either. As for Baoyu, hes like a ten-foot lampstand that sheds light on others but none on itself. He complains that other people are dirty, yet leaves you to turn his own rooms topsyturvy. Disgraceful, I call it. The maids knew quite well that Baoyu would not mind, and since Nanny Li had retired and left the house she had no further authority over them. They went on amusing themselves and simply ignored her. Asked how much Baoyu are at each meal and what time he went to bed, they just answered at random. What an old pest she is! one muttered. Is that a bowl of junket? asked Nanny Li. Why didnt you send it over to me? Id better eat it here right now. She picked up a spoon and started eating it. You leave that alone! cried one girl. Thats for Xiren. Hell be annoyed when he comes back, and unless you own up youll get all of us into trouble. I cant believe it of him. Nanny Li was both indignant and embarrassed. What is this, after all, but a bowl of milk? He shouldnt begrudge me that or more costly things either. Does he think more of Xiren than of me? Has he forgotten who brought him up? Its my milk from my own hearts blood that he was raised on, so why should he be angry if I have a bowl of his milk? I declare I will, just to see what hell do. You seem to think the world of Xiren, but who is she? A low-class girl. I should know, I trained the creature. With that, in a huff, she finished off the junket. Theyve no manners, said another maid soothingly. I dont wonder youre cross, granny. Baoyu often sends you presents. This isnt going to upset him. You dont have to humour me in that sly way, Nanny Li snorted. Do you think I dont know how Qianxue was dismissed, all because of a cup of tea? Ill come back tomorrow to hear what my punishments to be. She went off then in a temper. Presently Baoyu came home and sent someone to fetch Xiren. He saw Qingwen lying motionless on her bed. Is she ill? he asked. Or did she lose some game? She was winning, Qiuwen told him. But then Grandame Li came along and raised such a rumpus that she lost the game. She went to bed to sulk. You mustnt take Nanny Li so seriously. Baoyu smiled. Just leave her alone. He turned then to welcome Xiren who had only just come in. After asking where he had dined and what time he had reached home, she gave the girls greetings from her mother and cousins. When she had changed out of her visiting clothes, Baoyu called for the junket. Granny Li ate the lot, his maids reported. Before he could make any comment Xiren interposed with a smile, So thats what you kept for me thank you. The other day I enjoyed it, but it gave me a bad stomachache afterwards until Id brought it all up. So its just as well shes had it. Otherwise it would have been wasted. What Id fancy now are some dried chestnuts. Will you peel a few for me while I make your bed? Taking this for the truth, Baoyu thought no more of the matter but started peeling chestnuts by the lamp. And since the others had left he asked with a smile, who was that girl in red this afternoon? My mothers sisters child. Baoyu heaved a couple of admiring sighs. Why are you sighing? asked Xiren. I know how your mind works. You think she isnt good enough to wear red. What an idea! If a girl like that isnt good enough to wear red, who is? I found her so charming, I thought how nice it would be if we could get her here to live with us. Nice, you call it? Xiren snorted. Nice to be a slave here? Dont be so touchy, he retorted with a smile. Living in our house doesnt have to mean being a slave. Couldnt she be our relative? Were too far beneath you for that. When Baoyu went on peeling the chestnuts in silence, Xiren laughed. Why dont you say anything? Have I offended you? All right, tomorrow you can buy her for a few taels of silver. How do you expect anyone to answer you? Baoyu grinned. All I meant was that she looks just the person to live in a mansion like this, much more so than some of us clods who were born here.
Who told you hes no good? One of our servants, of course. You think nothing of us Wangs, not even of me, much less our servants. Ive spoken to Caixias mother and shes consented gladly. Am I to call her back now and tell her its off? Theres no need for that if youve already made the proposal. Ill just tell the boys father tomorrow to give him a good dressing-down. The rest of their conversation need not concern us. Now Caixia after being released from service was waiting for her parents to choose her a husband. Although she had been on friendly terms with ha Huan, nothing had come of it and now she saw Lai Wang coming repeatedly to ask for her hand. As she had heard that his son was a drunkard and gambler and ugly into the bargain, she felt all the more upset for if Lai Wang fixed up this match with Xifengs backing her whole life would be ruined. This prospect made her so frantic that that evening she secretly sent her younger sister Xiaoxia to Concubine Zhao, to find out the situation. Concubine Zhao had always been on good terms with Caixia and was all for giving her to Jia Huan, for then she would have an ally in the house. She had never expected Lady Wang to discharge her. Day after day she urged ha Huan to go and ask for her, but he was too shy to speak and not too attracted by Caixia in any case. To him, she was only a maid and he would have others in future so he procrastinated, quite willing to give her up. His mother was reluctant to do this, however. After the younger sister came for news, as she was free that evening she went to enlist ha Zhengs help. Whats the hurry? he asked. Wait till the boys have studied a year or two more before we get concubines for them. Ive already got two suitable maids in mind, one for Baoyu, one for Huan. But theyre still young and it might hold up their studies so lets wait a couple of years. Baoyus had one for two years already. Didnt you know that sir? asked Concubine Zhao. At once Jia Zheng demanded, Who made the decision? Before she could answer they heard a crash outside. To know what had happened, read the following chapter. Chapter 73 A Foolish Maid by Chance Picks up a Pornographic Pouch A Timid Young Lady ignores the Loss of Her Gold Phoenix Tiara Concubine Zhaos conversation with Jia Zheng was interrupted by a crash outside. Upon inquiry they found that one of the shutters of the outer room, not being properly secured, had clattered to the ground. Concubine Zhao reprimanded the maids and got them to fix it in place, then helped Jia Zheng to bed. Meanwhile, in Happy Red Court, Baoyu had just gone to bed and his maids were thinking of turning in themselves when someone knocked at the gate. An old woman opened it to admit Xiaoque, a girl working for Concubine Zhao, who would not state her business but went straight in to find Baoyu already in bed, with Qingwen and some other maids sitting chatting beside him. Whats happened? they asked. What brings you here at this hour? Addressing herself to Baoyu, Xiaoque announced, Ive got some news for you. Just now my mistress was talking to Lord Zheng and I heard your name. So look out tomorrow if he sends for you. This said, she turned to leave. Xiren urged her to stay for some tea, but for fear that the Garden gate would be closed she went off. Baoyu instantly felt as distraught as Monkey King on hearing the incantation to tighten the magic band around his head. Staggered, he racked his brains but could think of no way out except to cram in readiness for a test the following day. He fancied that if he could give correct answers from his books, other lapses would be overlooked and he might muddle through. Throwing a jacket round his shoulders he got up to study, thinking remorsefully, I was sure he wouldnt test me these first few days, so I let things slide and got rusty. If Id known, Id have done some revising every day. Now, the only ones of the Four Book he knew by heart together with the commentaries were the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean and the Analects. His knowledge of the first half of Mencius was so sketchy that if suddenly give one sentence from it he would be unable to recite what followed, and the whole of the second half had slipped his mind. When it came to the Five Classics, while writing poems himself he had browsed quite often through the Book of Songs and if questioned on that should be able to get by.
We didnt know he was like this. What a pity when hes such a handsome boy. Dont believe the nonsense he talks, sister, said Third Sister. Weve met Baoyu several times. The way he behaves and speaks does seem rather effeminate, but thats because he spends all his time in the inner apartments. You cant call him muddle-headed. Remember when we were in mourning, that day the monks filed round the coffin? We girls were all standing there and he stepped in front of us, standing in our way. People said he had no manners and should know better but later didnt he tell us in confidence, You know, sisters, its not that I had no sense of respect, but those monks are so dirty I was afraid youd find their stench overpowering. Then he was drinking tea, and you wanted some too. When that old woman took his bowl to pour some for you, he said at once, Ive dirtied that bowl you must wash it first. From these two incidents, viewed dispassionately, I saw how obliging he is towards us girls he knows how to make himself agreeable to us. It just doesnt seem right to outsiders thats why they cant understand him. It sounds as if the two of you are already of one mind, Second Sister chuckled. How would it be if we were to betroth you to him? Inhibited by Xingers presence, Third Sister just lowered her head and went on cracking melon-seeds. As far as looks and behaviour go, theyd make a fine couple, chortled Xinger. Only hes already made his choice, although it hasnt yet been announced. Its bound to be Miss Lin. Nothing has been done so far, as shes so delicate and theyre both still young but in another two or three years, as soon as the old lady says the word it will certainly be settled. As they were chatting, Longer came back to report, The old master has some business, something extremely important and confidential, that hes sending Second Master to Pinganzhou to attend to. Hes to set out in a few days and the whole trip there and back will take more than a fortnight. So he cant come back today. He hopes the old mistress and Second Aunt will see to that matter right away, so that he can make the final decision when he comes tomorrow. This said, he went off with Xinger. Second Sister ordered the gate to be closed and they turned in early, but she spent most of the night questioning her sister. The next day it was after noon before Jia Lian arrived. Why be in such a hurry to come when youve other important business? Second Sister asked him. You mustnt delay your journey on my account. Its not all that important, he told her. The nuisance is Ive got to make a long trip, starting early next month, and I shant be back for a fortnight. Well, just go with an easy mind. You neednt worry about anything here. My sisters not the type that keeps changing her mind. She says shes going to turn over a new leaf, and shell be as good as her word. Shes already made her choice of a man. All you need do is to fall in with her wishes. Who is he? asked Jia Lian. Hes not here now, and theres no knowing when hell come back. But shes made an intelligent choice. If he stays away for a year, shell wait for a year, she says. If he doesnt return for ten years, shell wait for ten years. If hes dead and never comes back, shell gladly shave off her hair and become a nun, fasting and chanting sutras all her life. Who can the fellow be that has won her heart so completely? Its a long story, said Second Sister with a smile. Five years ago, when it was our grandmothers birthday, my mother took us there to offer congratulations. Theyd invited a troupe of amateur actors, among them a certain Liu Xianglian who liked to play the young heros part in operas. She took such a fancy to him, she now declares hes the only man for her. Last year we heard that hed got into trouble and run away. We dont know whether he has ever come back. Well, I never! exclaimed Jia Lian. So thats who it is. I was wondering what sort of fellow he could be. Yes, shes made a good choice. But you know this Second Master Liu, for all hes so handsome, is cold and stand-offish. He has no time for most people but happens to get on splendidly with Baoyu. Last year after he beat up that fool Xue Pan he left, feeling too embarrassed to see us, and we dont know where hes gone. Some people say hes returned. I suppose we can ask Baoyus pages to find out.
As the maids had gone to fetch tea and there was no one else present, Jia Lian kept darting smiling glances at Second Sister, who lowered her head to hide a smile but did not respond, and he dared not make any further advances. Seeing that she was toying with the handkerchief to which her pouch was fastened, he felt his waist as if groping for his own pouch. Ive forgotten to bring my pouch of betel-nuts, he said. Will you let me try one of yours, sister? I have some, but I never give mine away. Smiling, he approached her to take one and afraid this would look bad if someone came in, she laughingly tossed him her pouch. Having caught it he emptied it out, chose one half-eaten nut which he popped into his mouth, then pocketed all the others. He was about to return the pouch when the two maids came back with the tea. As Jia Lian sipped his tea, he surreptitiously took off a Han-Dynasty jade pendant carved with nine dragons and tied this to her handkerchief. And when both maids were looking the other way, he tossed the handkerchief back. Second Sister just let it lie and went on drinking her tea, as if she had not noticed. Then the portiere behind them swished and in came old Mrs. You and Third Sister with two young maids. With a wink Jia Lian signalled to Second Sister to pick up the handkerchief, but she simply paid no attention and not knowing what she meant by this he felt frantic. He had to step forward to greet the newcomers. As he did so, he glanced back at Second Sister, who was still smiling as if nothing had happened. But looking again he noticed with relief that the handkerchief had vanished. They all sat down now and chatted for a while. My sister-in-law says she gave you some silver the other day to keep for her, madam, said Jia Lian. Today they have to settle an account, so Cousin Zhen sent me to fetch it and to see if everything is all right at home. On hearing this old Mrs. You immediately sent Second Sister to fetch the key and get the silver. Jia Lian went on, I wanted to come anyway to pay my respects to you and see both the young ladies. Its good of you to have come here, madam, but were sorry to be putting our two cousins to such trouble too. What way is that for close relatives to talk! she protested. Weve made ourselves at home here. The truth is, sir, that since my husband died weve found it hard to make ends meet, and weve only managed thanks to my son-in-laws help. Now that they have their hands full, we cant help in any other way but at least we can keep an eye on things here for them how can you talk of putting us to trouble? By now Second Sister had brought the silver and given it to her mother, who passed it to Jia Lian. He sent a young maid to fetch a serving-woman. Give this to Yu Lu, he ordered her. Tell him to take it back to the other house and wait for me there. As the old woman assented and left, they heard Jia Rongs voice in the courtyard and presently in he came to pay his respects to the ladies. Just now His Lordship your father was asking about you, uncle, he said. He has some business he wants you to see to and was gong to send to the temple to fetch you, but I told him youd be coming presently. His Lordship told me, if I met you, to ask you to hurry. As Jia Lian rose to leave he heard Jia Rong tell old Mrs. You, The young man I told you about the other day, grandmother, the one my father has in mind for Second Aunt, has much the same features and build as this uncle of mine. How does he strike you, madam? As he said this he pointed slyly at Jia Lian and motioned with his lips at Second Sister. She was too embarrassed to say anything, but her sister scolded What a devilish monkey you are! Have you nothing else to talk about? Just wait, Im going to pull out that tongue of yours. She ran towards him but Jia Rong had slipped out, laughing, and now Jia Lian took his leave of them with a smile. In the hall he cautioned the servants not to gamble and drink, then secretly urged Jia Rong to hurry back and take the matter up with his father. Next he took Yu Lu over to the other house to make up the sum of silver needed and while the steward went off with this he paid his respects to his father and the Lady Dowager.
What a thing to say! Weve always treated each other with respect, but now youre suddenly talking like this the idea! No wonder everyone says its no good being too familiar with you. She turned then and went off. Baoyu was very much put out. He stood there in a daze for a while, his thoughts wandering, shedding tears, then returned dejectedly to Happy Red Court. 2429 He passed an uneasy night. In his dreams he called for Qingwen or had frightening nightmares which gave him no peace. The next day he had no appetite and ran a fever, all because of the recent happenings the search of the Garden, the dismissal of Siqi, the departure of Yingchun and the death of Qingwen which had filled him with mortification, dread and grief. And on top of that he had caught cold, so now he fell ill and was confined to his bed. When the Lady Dowager heard this, she came daily in person to see him. Lady Wang regretted having scolded him too sharply on Qingwens account, but she gave no outward sign of her remorse, simply ordering the nurses to look after him well and sending doctors twice a day to examine him and prescribe medicine. Not until a month had passed did Baoyu begin to recover. He was told to convalesce for a hundred days, touch no greasy food and not stir out of his rooms. During this whole period he was not even allowed to go to the gate of his court, but only to amuse himself indoors. After forty of fifty days spent in this way he felt ready to burst from boredom how could he put up with this? But plead as he might, the old lady and Lady Wang were adamant, and he simply had to accept the situation. So he fooled about with the maids in every conceivable way. One day he heard that Xue Pan was giving a feast and opera show to celebrate his wedding, and the party was uncommonly lively. Told that this young lady from the Xia family was a beauty with literary accomplishments too, he longed to go over then and there to see her. Some days later he heard that Yingchuns marriage had taken place and grieved deeply that he had been unable to see her off, reflecting that he and his girl cousins had always been together, but were they to meet again after this separation they could not be as intimate as before. He found it thoroughly exasperating being unable to go and see them now. However, he had to be patient and amuse himself with his maids. At least he was spared his fathers constant reproofs and admonitions to study. So during these hundred days he and his maids rampaged as they pleased, getting up to mischief never heard of before and stopping short only of pulling down Happy Red Court. We can draw a veil over the details. 2431 Xiangling after scolding Baoyu that day decided that he had been deliberately rude to her. She thought, No wonder Miss Baochai dared not get too close to him. I lacked her foresight. And no wonder Miss Lin keeps quarrelling with him and crying for rage. He must keep teasing her too. Id better steer clear of him. So after that she seldom went into the Garden. Xue Pans marriage kept her busy every day. She imagined his new wife would protect her and share her responsibilities, enabling her to lead a quieter life. And having heard that this young lady was talented as well as beautiful, she assumed she must be refined and gentle too. She was therefore ten times more eager even than Xue Pan for her arrival. Finally the day came when the bride arrived, and she began waiting hand and foot on her new mistress. Now this Miss Xia, who had just turned seventeen, was quite good-looking and had some education. As regards ability and craftiness, she took after Xifeng. In one respect only had she been unlucky. Because her father had died when she was a child, and she had no brothers either, her widowed mother had spoilt this only daughter, doting on her and falling in with all her whims. Inevitably, this over-indulgence had made her like the brigand Dao Zhi of old she had as high an opinion of herself as if she were a goddess, and treated others like dirt. In appearance pretty as a flower, at heart she was a termagant. At home she had vented her temper on her maids, for ever cursing them or beating them. Now that she was married, she felt it incumbent on her to behave as the mistress of the house, not with the gentle shyness befitting a girl she must show her authority to keep others under her thumb. In view, moreover, of Xue Pans pig-headed pride and extravagance, she decided she must strike while the iron was hot and tame him completely, or she would never be able to have her own way.
You dont understand, aunt, replied Daiyu with a smile. It doesnt matter here, but people anywhere else might well take offence. Sending a hand-stove over from my quarters as if my hosts didnt possess such a thing! Instead of calling my maids too fussy, people would imagine I always behave in this outrageous fashion. You take such things too seriously, said Aunt Xue. Such an idea would never have entered my head. By now Baoyu had already drunk three cups, and Nanny Li came in again to remonstrate. But he was enjoying himself so much talking and laughing with his cousins, he refused to stop. Dear nanny, he coaxed, just two more cups--- thats all. Youd better look out, she warned. Lord Zhengs at home today, and he may want to examine you on your lessons. With a sinking heart, Baoyu slowly put his cup down and hung his head. Dont be such a spoil-sport, protested Daiyu. If Uncle sends for you, cousin, we can say Aunt Xue is keeping you. This nanny of yours has been drinking and is working off the effects of the wine on us. She nudged Baoyu to embolden him and whispered, Never mind the old thing. Why shouldnt we enjoy ourselves? Now, Miss Lin, dont egg him on, cried Nanny Li. Youre the only one whose advice he might listen. Why should I egg him on? Daiyu gave a little snort. I cant be bothered with offering him advice either. Youre too pernickety, nanny. The old lady often gives him wine, so why shouldnt he have a drop more here with his aunt? Are you suggesting that aunties an outsider and he shouldnt behave like that here? Amused yet vexed, Nanny Li expostulated, Really, every word Miss Lin says cuts sharper than a knife. How can you suggest such a thing? Even Baochai couldnt suppress a smile. She pinched Daiyus cheek and cried, What a tongue the girl has! One doesnt know whether to be cross or laugh. Dont be afraid, my child, said Aunt Xue. Ive nothing good to offer you, but Ill feel bad if you get a fright which gives you indigestion. Just drink as much as you want, Ill answer for it. You neednt leave till after supper. And if you do get tipsy you can sleep here. She ordered more wine to be heated, saying, Ill drink a few cups with you and then well have our rice. Baoyus spirits rose again at this. His nurse told the maids, Stay here and keep an eye on him. Im going home to change, then Ill come back. She urged Aunt Xue on the sly Madam, dont let him have it all his own way or drink too much. When she had gone the two or three other elderly servants who were left, not being over-conscientious, slipped out to enjoy themselves. There remained only two maids eager to please Baoyu. But by dint of much coaxing and teasing, Aunt Xue kept him from drinking too many cups before the wine was whisked away. Then Baoyu had two bowls of soup made from pickled bamboo-shoots and duck-skin and half a bowl of green rice porridge. By this time Baochai and Daiyu had finished too and all of them drank some strong tea, after which Aunt Xue felt easier in her mind. Now Xueyan and three other maids came back from their own meal to wait on them, and Daiyu asked Baoyu Are you ready to go? He glanced at her sidewise from under drooping eyelids. Ill go whenever you do. Daiyu promptly rose to her feet. Weve been here nearly all day, its time we left. They may be wondering where we are. As they took their leave their wraps were brought, and Baoyu bent his head for a maid to help him on with his hood. She shook out the crimson hood and started slipping it over his head. Stop, stop! Not so roughly, you silly thing, he protested, stopping her. Have you never seen anyone put on a hood before? Better let me do it myself. What a commotion! Daiyu stood up on the kang. Come here. Let me see to it. Baoyu went up to Daiyu, who put her hand gently over his coronet and placed the edge of the hood on his chaplet. Then she made the red velvet pompon, the size of a walnut, bob up in front. Thats better, she said, surveying her handiwork. Now you can put on your cloak. As Baoyu did so his aunt remarked, None of the nurses who came with you is here.
who was staying with Baochai and the two Li sisters, who had moved out to live with Aunt Li on account of all the troubles in the Garden. So Daiyu saw only a few of the girls. For a while they discussed this strange phenomenon of blossom out of season. Crab-apple should blossom in the third month, said the old lady. Although its now the eleventh, because the solar seasons are late this year its actually like the tenth, and were having an Indian summer which makes it warm enough for trees to blossom. Youve seen so much, madam, you must be right, Lady Wang concurred. Its not all that remarkable. I heard this plant had withered for a whole year, said Lady Xing. Why is it blossoming now? There must be some reason. Im sure the old lady and mistress are right, put in Li Wan with a smile. In my foolish opinion, this blossoming shows that something good is coming Baoyus way. Tanchun remained silent, thinking, It cant be a good omen. All living things which obey Heavens will must prosper, while all which flout it must die even plants know that. So unseasonable blossom must be an evil omen. She could not say this, however. Daiyu, elated by this talk of good luck for Baoyu, said gaily, The Tian family of old had a red-bud tree which withered when the three brothers split up the property. That made them go back in remorse to live together, and then the tree blossomed again. This shows that plants change in accordance with human beings. Now Cousin Bao is studying hard and uncle is pleased with him, so these crab-apples have blossomed again. The old lady and Lady Wang were delighted with this explanation. Daiyus made an.apt comparison, they said. Most interesting! As they were talking, Jia She and Jia Zheng arrived with Huan and Lan to look at the flowers. If I were you, Id cut them down, said Jia She. It must be some flower-monster making trouble. Jia Zheng retorted, Ignore a monster and it will destroy itself. Just let it be. Theres no need to cut it down. What nonsense are you talking? his mother protested. This is something auspicious and good theres no monster here. If good comes of this, you can enjoy it. If bad comes of it, Ill take all the consequences. But 1 wont have you talking such rubbish! Thus silenced, Jia Zheng withdrew sheepishly with ha She. Then the old lady in high spirits told them to order the kitchen to prepare a feast at once, so that they could enjoy the flowers. Baoyu, Huan and Lan must each write a poem to commemorate this happy event, she decreed. Daiyus just over her illness, so we mustnt trouble her to write but if shes in the mood she can polish your lines. She told Li Wan, All of you must drink with me. Li Wan agreed to this, then said teasingly to Tanchun, This is all your fault. Weve not even been allowed to write poems, retorted Tanchun. So surely this has nothing to do with us? Didnt you start the Begonia Society? Now these crab-apples want to join your club too. At that everybody laughed. Presently wine and dishes were served. And as they drank they all tried to please the old lady by cheerful talk. Baoyu poured wine for the others, then made tip and wrote out a quatrain which he read to his grandmother. It was as follows -771 What made the crab-apple wither away? And today why have fresh blossoms come? To foretell a long life for our Old Ancestress It is flowering anew, ahead of the plum. Huan also wrote and read out this poem -771 Crab-apples should burgeon in the spring, But ours were bare this year. The world is full of strange phenomena, Yet only here do winter blooms appear. Lan wrote out his verse neatly and presented it to the old lady, who made Li Wan read it out as follows -771 Its misty charm had faded by last spring, But after snow and frost pink blooms unfold. Do not accuse this flower of ignorance Good fortune at this feast it has foretold. The old lady said, I dont know much about poetry, but I think Lans is the best. Huans is no good. Now come and eat, everyone. Baoyu was pleased to see her in a good mood until it occurred to him, The crab-apple died at the same time as Qingwen. Now that its blossoming again, of course that augurs well for us in this compound, but it cant bring Qingwen back to life like this flower.
"'Pot' and 'door' aren't easy to fit in," was Baoyu's comment. Daishu prepared four lots of paper and writing-brushes, and all quietened down to think. All but Daiyu, who went on fondling the wu-tong trees, looking at the autumn scene or joking with the maids. Yingchun had a stick of Sweet-Dream Incense lit. Being only three inches long and no thicker than a lampwick, this burnt quickly. The poems had to be finished before it burnt out, on pain of a penalty. Tanchun was the first to finish. She wrote out her poem, made one or two corrections, and handed the paper to Yingchun. "Are you ready, Lady of the Alpinia?" she asked Baochai. "Yes, mine's done, but it's no good," replied Baochai. Baoyu, his hands behind his back, was pacing up and down the corridor. "Hear that?" he said to Daiyu. "They've finished theirs." "Don't worry about me," she answered. Then he saw that Baochai had copied out her poem. "Good gracious!" he exclaimed. "There's only one inch of the incense left, but all I've done is four lines." He turned to Daiyu. "The incense is nearly burnt out. Do stop squatting on the damp ground." Daiyu paid no attention. "I can't help you now," he said. "I must write mine out, however bad it is." With that he walked to the desk. "We're going to look at the poems now," announced Li Wan. "Anyone who doesn't hand his in by the time we finish reading the others will have to pay a forfeit." "The Old Peasant of Sweet Paddy may not write well herself," remarked Baoyu, "but she's a good judge and absolutely impartial. We'll all stand by your verdict." The rest agreed. First they looked at Tanchun's paper. -774 Chill the sunset grass in front of the closed door, Thick the green moss the rain-drenched pot below Her spirit's purity surpasses jade, Her gentle form is ravishing as snow. A faint ethereal loveliness is hers, Her shadow at midnight chequers the moon's light. Do not fly from me, chaste goodess Abide with me as fall the shades of night. -384 After admiring this they read Baochai's poem -774 For the sake of the flowers the door is closed by day As I go to water the pots with moss overgrown Immaculate its shadow on autumn steps, Pure as snow and ice its spirit by dewy stone. Only true whiteness dazzles with its brightness Can so much sadness leave a flawless jade? Its purity rewards the god of autumn, Speechless and chaste it stays as sunbeams fade. -400 Li Wan remarked with a smile, "Trust the Lady of the Alpinia!" Then they turned to Baoyu's poem -774 Autumn blooms cast chequered shadows by the door, Seven nodes of snowy flowers in pots arrayed, Like Lady Yang's shade, fresh from the bath, ice-pure, Or Xi Shi's mournful spirit fair as jade. No morning breeze can scatter this infinite sadness, And the rain adds fresh tear-stains at night Leaning by painted balustrade it seems sensate As pounding of clothes and fluting put dusk to flight. When all had read this, Baoyu expressed his own preference for Tanchun's verse, but Li Wan insisted that Baochai's was more distinguished. She then asked Daiyu for her poem. "Have you all finished?" cried Daiyu. At once she took up her brush and dashed off eight lines which she tossed over to them. Li Wan and the others read -774 Half-rolled the bamboo blind, half-closed the door -800 Crushed ice serves as mould for jade pots. "How do you do it?" exclaimed Baoyu in admiration before reading on. -800 Some whiteness from the pear-blossom is stolen, Some of its spirit winter-plum allots. "Splendid!" cried the others. "She's really original." They read on -800 The goddess of the moon sews a white gown, The maid's weeping in autumn chamber never ends Silently, shyly, with never a word of complaint, She reclines in the autumn breeze as night descends. "This is the best!" cried the young people. "It's certainly the most charming and unusual," said Li Wan. "But our Lady Alpinia's has deeper significance and real substance." "Quite right," put in Tanchun. "The Queen of Bamboos should come second." "And the Happy Red Prince last," said Li Wan.
Daiyu, complying, turned round and Baochai arranged her dishevelled hair for her. Baoyu, watching, decided that this way of dressing her hair was an improvement and regretted having sent her to comb her hair before the job should have been left for Baochai. His reverie was cut short by Baochai remarking If youve finished that list, you can show it to the old lady tomorrow. We may have the things at home if not, they can be bought. Ill help you with the preparations. Baoyu put the list away then and they chatted. That evening after dinner they went as usual to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager. As she had been suffering from nothing more serious than a slight chill caught when she was tired, a day in bed and a dose of medicine had set her right by the evening. What happened the day after is told in the next chapter. Chapter 43 To Kill Time Money Is Raised to Celebrate a Birthday Incense Is Burned on the Ground to Undying Love The Lady Dowager was not really ill but had simply caught a chill that day in the Garden. Knowing that a visit from the doctor and some medicine had set her right, Lady Wang stopped worrying and sent for Xifeng whom she told to prepare some things to be taken to Jia Zheng. While they were discussing this, the old lady summoned them and they both hurried over. Are you feeling better, madam? asked Lady Wang. Much better, replied the Lady Dowager. Just now I tried some of that quail soup you sent, and found it tasty. I ate a few mouthfuls of the flesh too, and enjoyed it. That was a filial offering from Xifeng, said Lady Wang. It shows a proper respect for her elders and due gratitude for all your kindness to her. Its good of her to be so thoughtful. The old lady nodded. If theres any left not yet cooked, Id like a few slices fried, because being salty it goes well with porridge. The soup doesnt, although its good. Xifeng promised to see to this at once and had the order passed on to the kitchen. Meantime the Lady Dowager told Lady Wang, Ill tell you why I sent for you. The second of next month is Xifengs birthday. Last year and the year before that I meant to celebrate it, but each time something urgent cropped up and I let matters slide. This year everyones here and nothings likely to happen, so lets all have some good fun. Just what I was thinking, replied Lady Wang. If thats what you want, madam, why not settle on it? For birthdays in the past weve always sent our presents separately, which is stereotyped and rather formal. Now Ive thought of a new, informal way which should be fun. Well do whatever you think best, madam. Well then, why dont we copy those poorer families in which everybody chips in, and however much is collected goes for a treat. What do you say? Wouldnt that be fun? Very good. But how shall we go about it? Hearing this, the Lady Dowager in high spirits at once gave orders to invite over Aunt Xue, Lady Xing, the girls and Baoyu, as well as Jia Zhens wife Madam You from the other mansion, and the wives of the chief stewards such as Lai Da. The maids, infected by the old ladys good humour, bustled off cheerfully to deliver her invitations and in less time than it takes for a meal the room was packed with people, old and young, high and low. Aunt Xue and the Lady Dowager had the seats of honour Lady Xing and Lady Wang had two chairs by the door Baochai and five or six other girls sat on the kang Baoyu sat at his grandmothers knee and the rest stood, crowding the floor. The Lady Dowager ordered stools to be fetched for Lai Das mother and a few of the older and most highly thought of nurses for it was the family custom to show more respect to domestics who had served the older generation than to the sons and daughters of the house. Hence Madam You and Xifeng remained standing while, after a show of declining, Lai Das mother and three or four other old nurses sat down. Then the Lady Dowager, beaming, announced her plan. All fell in readily with the novel suggestion. Those on good terms with Xifeng liked the idea, those afraid of her were glad of a chance to please her and since everyone could afford it they agreed with alacrity. The Lady Dowager made the first contribution, promising to give twenty taels. Ill follow suit, said Aunt Xue, and give twenty too. We dare not rank ourselves with the old lady, disclaimed Lady Xing and Lady Wang laughingly.
She must have gone out on some business. Swaying a little, Baoyu called over his shoulder, She has a better time of it than our old lady. Why ask for her? I wish shed leave me in peace to live a little longer. While saying this he reached his apartment, where his eye fell on the brush and ink on the desk. Qingwen greeted him with a smile, exclaiming, A fine one you are! You made me grind that ink for you this morning because you were feeling good but you only wrote three characters, then threw down your brush and marched off. Youve kept us waiting for you the whole day. You must set to work quickly now and use up this ink. Reminded of that mornings happenings, Baoyu asked, Where are the three characters I wrote? This fellows drunk! Qingwen laughed. Just before you went over to the other house you told me to have them pasted above the door, yet now you ask where they are. Not trusting anyone else to do a good job, I got up on a ladder to paste them up myself. My hands are still numb with cold. I forgot. Baoyu grinned. Let me warm your hands for you. He took Qingwens hands in his while they both looked up at the inscription over the lintel. Just then Daiyu came in and he asked her, Tell me honestly, dear cousin, which of these three characters is the best written? Daiyu raised her head and read the inscription Red Rue Studio. Theyre all good. I didnt know you were such a calligrapher. You must write an inscription for me some time too. Youre making fun of me again. Baoyu chuckled. Wheres Xiren? he asked Qingwen. Qingwen tilted her head towards the kang in the inner room, where Baoyu saw Xiren lying, fully dressed. Thats good, he said. But its rather early to sleep. At breakfast in the other house this morning there was a plate of beancurd dumplings. Knowing youd like them, I asked Madam You to let me have them for supper, and they were sent over. Did you get them all right? Dont ask! answered Qingwen. I knew at once they were meant for me, but as Id just finished my breakfast I left them here. Then Nanny Li came and saw them. Baoyu wont be wanting these, she said. Ill take them for my grandson. She got somebody to send them home for her. At this point Qianxue brought in tea and Baoyu said, Do have some tea, Cousin Lin. The maids burst out giggling. Shes gone long ago. Yet you offer her tea. After drinking half a cup himself he remembered something else and asked Qianxue, Why did you bring me this tea? This morning we brewed some maple-dew tea, and I told you its flavour doesnt really come out until after three or four steepings. I did save that other tea, she replied. But Nanny Li insisted on trying it and she drank it all. This was too much for Baoyu. He dashed the cup to pieces on the floor, spattering the maids skirt with tea. Then springing to his feet he stormed Is she your grandmother, that all of you treat her so respectfully? Just because she suckled me for a few days when I was small, she carries on as if she were more important than our own ancestors. I dont need a wet-nurse any more, why should I keep an ancestress like this? Send her packing and well all have some peace and quiet. He wanted to go straight to his grandmother to have the old woman dismissed. Now Xiren had only been shamming sleep, in the hope that Baoyu would come in to tease her. She hadnt troubled to get up when he asked about the dumplings but now that he had smashed a cup and flown into a passion she jumped up and came out to smooth things over, just as a maid arrived from his grandmother to ask the reason for the noise. Id just poured out some tea, said Xiren. I slipped because of snow on my shoes and the cup was smashed. Then she turned to calm Baoyu. So youve decided to dismiss her. Good. Wed all like to leave. Why not take this chance to get rid of the lot of us? That would suit us, and youd get better attendants too. Thus silenced, Baoyu let them help him to the kang and take off his clothes. He was still mumbling to himself but could hardly keep his eyes open, so they put him straight to bed. Xiren took the precious jade off his neck, wrapped it up in her own handkerchief and tucked it under his mattress, so that it should not be cold to the touch when he put it on the next day.
said one. How? his companion asked. I heard today that some young master in the Rong Mansion has lost a piece of jade, and a notice has been posted up describing its size, shape and colour. Ten thousand taels reward has been offered for its return, and five thousand for news of its whereabouts. Though Jia Zheng had not caught every word distinctly, he had heard enough to hurry home in amazement. The gateman when questioned reported, The first 1 heard of this, sir, was at noon today when Master Lian passed on the old ladys order and sent people to post up a notice. Our family must be on the decline! Jia Zheng sighed. For our sins weve been saddled with this degenerate. At the time of his birth he was the talk of the town, but after ten years and more the gossip died down. Now were raising this hue and cry again to find his jade preposterous! He hurried inside to question Lady Wang, who told him the whole story. As this had been done on his mothers instructions, Jia Zheng could not oppose it. He just vented his anger briefly on his wife before going out again to order the notice to be taken down without the old ladys knowledge. However, some idlers had already -made off with it. A few days later, a man came to the Rong Mansion claiming to have brought back the jade. In great jubilation the servants at the gate said, Hand it over and well go and report it for you. The fellow reached in his pocket for the notice, pointing at it for them to see. Wasnt this put up by your house? he asked. It says clearly here that whoever returns the jade will get a reward of ten thousand silver taels. I may look poor now to you gentlemen, but once I have that silver I shall be rich so dont be so high-handed! He spoke with such confidence that the gateman answered, Well then, just show me the jade so that I can report this for you. At first the man was unwilling, but on second thoughts he produced the jade and displayed it in the palm of-one hand. Isnt this it? he demanded. These servants on duty at the gate all knew of the jade, but this was their first close look at it. They hurried in, eager to be the first with this good news. That day Jia Zheng and Jia She were out. Only Jia Lian was at home. Hearing this report, he asked, Is it genuine? Weve seen it for-ourselves, the servants answered. -But he wont give it to us underlings. He wants to see one of the masters, to hand over the jade to him in exchange for the money. Jia Lian hastened in happily to report this to Lady Wang who then told the old lady, so delighting Xiren that she clasped her hands together, invoking Buddha. And the Lady Dowager was as good as her word. Tell Lian to ask that man to wait in the study while he brings the jade here, she said. Once weve seen it well give him the silver. Jia Lian accordingly invited the fellow in, treating him as a guest and thanking him profusely. I would like to take this jade in to show the young master himself, he said. Then well give you your full reward. The man handed him a red silk wrapper. Jia Lian opened it and saw indeed a fine translucent jade. He had paid scant attention to Baoyus jade before and now took a good look, a careful scrutiny disclosing the inscription warding off evil. Overjoyed, he ordered servants to wait on the visitor, then hurried in to let the old lady and Lady Wang identify the stone. By now everyone was agog to see the jade. As soon as Jia Lian came in Xifeng snatched it from him and, not venturing to examine it herself, presented it to the old lady. Jia Lian chuckled, So even over a trifle like this, you wont let me take the credit! When the Lady Dowager unwrapped the jade, it struck her as much more opaque than before. She rubbed it with her fingers while Yuanyang fetched her spectacles and, putting them on, she scrutinized the stone. Thats odd! she exclaimed. This is the jade all right, but how is it that its lost all its former lustre? Lady Wang examined it for some time but could not give a positive opinion. She told Xifeng to have a look. It resembles it, but the colours not quite right, Xifeng observed. Better let Baoyu look at it himself, then we shall know. Xiren beside her also had her doubts, but in her eagerness to have the stone prove authentic she did not express them.
You waste all your time with those rowdies and you're too careless. If nothing happens, well and good. But if trouble starts everyone is bound to suspect you, whether you caused it or not. Why, even I would suspect you, let alone others." Blunt, outspoken Xue Pan could not stand such insinuations. Baochai's warning against fooling about outside and his mother's charge that his careless talk had caused Baoyu's flogging made him stamp with rage and swear he must clear himself. "Who's been shifting the blame on to me?" he fumed. "I'll smash the scoundrel's teeth. It's obvious that to make up to Baoyu they're using me as a whipping-boy. Is Baoyu the king of heaven? Whenever his father whacks him the whole household's bound to be upside down for days. After my uncle caned him for misbehaving last time, it somehow came to the old lady's ears that Cousin Zhen was behind it and she summoned him to give him a big dressing-down. This time they're picking on me. Well, I'm not afraid. I'll go and kill Baoyu then pay with my life -- make a clean sweep!" He seized the door bar and started rushing out. In desperation his mother dragged him back. "You'll be the death of me, you monster," she scolded. "Off to pick a fight, are you? Better kill me first." Xue Pan's eyes nearly started from his head in fury. "What's all this nonsense!" he bellowed. "You won't let me go, yet pin this thing on me for no reason at all. As long as Baoyu lives, I shall always be his whipping-boy. We'd better all die and be done with it." "Do have patience," urged Baochai, stepping quickly forward. "Mother's so upset, yet instead of soothing her you raise this rumpus. When people -- especially your own mother -- advise you, it's for your own good. You shouldn't fly into a temper." "So you 're nagging again, are you?" he roared. "You're the one who started this." "You only blame me for nagging, never blame your own thoughtlessness." "Instead of blaming my thoughtlessness, why don't you blame Baoyu for looking for trouble outside? Let's take just one example -- that recent business of Qiguan. I've met Qiguan a dozen times without his making up to me once but the very first time Baoyu met him, before he even knew his name, Qiguan gave him his girdle. That was my fault too, I suppose?" "There you go again," cried his mother and sister frantically. "That's why he got beaten. This shows you're the one who told." "You want me to burst with anger," growled Xue Pan. "It's not being wrongly accused that enrages me, it's this fearful fuss you make over Baoyu." "Who's making a fuss?" retorted Baochai. "You started it by arming yourself and threatening to fight. Now you accuse us of fussing." As all her arguments were so reasonable and even harder to refute than his mother's, Xue Pan cast about for some way to silence her in order to have his say. And being in a towering rage, he did not trouble to weigh his words carefully. "It's no use flying into a huff with me, my dear sister," he sneered. "I can see into your heart. Mother's told me about your gold locket which has to be matched with jade. Naturally you looked round carefully, and now that you find Baoyu has that rubbishy thing you're bound to take his side." Baochai was speechless at first with indignation. Then catching hold of her mother she sobbed "Do you hear what he's saying, mother?" At this Xue Pan knew he had gone too far and sullenly retired to his own room. Though trembling with rage, Aunt Xue tried to comfort her daughter. "You know that monster always talks nonsense," she said. "Tomorrow I'll tell him to apologize." Bitterly wronged as Baochai felt, she could not make a scene for fear of upsetting her mother. So with tears in her eyes she took her leave and went back to her own apartment to cry all night. The next morning she rose early and, without troubling to make a careful toilet, simply straightened her clothes and set off to see her mother again. On the way she happened to meet Daiyu standing alone under the shade of some blossom and was asked where she was going. Baochai, not stopping, said she was on her way home. Daiyu saw that she looked in low spirits, quite unlike her usual self, and had been crying.
Our young ladys warned us many a time not to joke with you. Havent you noticed recently how shes been avoiding you? She got up then and took her needlework inside. Baoyu felt as if doused by a bucket of cold water. He was staring blankly at the bamboo grove when Mrs. Zhu came to dig up some bamboo shoots and trim the bamboos. Then, stupefied, he went away. Presently, his wits wandering, not knowing what he did, he sank down in a daze on a rock and shed tears. For the time half a dozen meals would take he sat there brooding, but could not think what to do. It so happened that Xueyan passed here now on her way back from Lady Wangs quarters with some ginseng. Turning her head towards the rock below the peach tree she noticed someone sitting there lost in thought, his face propped on his hands. To her surprise she saw it was Baoyu. Whats he doing here all alone on such a chilly day? she wondered. Springs a dangerous time for people in delicate health. Can his wits be wandering again? Going over she crouched down beside him. What are you doing here? she asked. What do you want with me? countered Baoyu as soon as he saw who it was. Arent you a girl too? To prevent gossip shes ordered you to ignore me, but here you come seeking me out. If youre seen, there will be talk. Hurry up and go home. Thinking Daiyu had been scolding him again, Xueyan had to go back to Bamboo Lodge where she gave Zijuan the ginseng, as their mistress was still asleep. Whats Her Ladyship doing? Zijuan asked. Shes been having a siesta too. Thats why Ive been so long, replied Xueyan. But let me tell you something amusing, sister. As I was waiting for the mistress and chatting with Sister Yuchuan in the maids quarters, who should beckon me out but Concubine Zhao. I thought she had some message, but it turned out she was there to ask leave from the mistress to go to her brothers wake tonight and the funeral tomorrow and she wanted to borrow my pale- blue satin tunic for her little maid Jixiang, whos to go with her too but has nothing decent to wear. Well, I thought, theyve clothes of their own, they just dont want to wear them to the funeral for fear of getting them dirty theyd rather borrow someone elses to soil. Of course, Im not all that fussy about my clothes, but what kindness has that woman ever done us? So I told her. All my clothes and trinkets are kept by Sister Zijuan on our young ladys orders. I should have to tell her first and then report to my young mistress. And as our young ladys not well, it would be a lengthy business and delay you, madam. Cant you borrow from someone else? You imp! Zijuan laughed. You shift the blame for not lending your things to us, to stop her complaining about you. Is she leaving now or not till tomorrow morning? She was just setting off. I expect shes gone by now. Zijuan nodded in silence. If our young ladys still asleep, whos been upsetting Baoyu? continued Xueyan. Hes sitting out there crying. Out where? Under the peach-blossom behind Seeping Fragrance Pavilion. At once Zijuan laid down her needlework. Be ready if she calls, she told Xueyan. If she asks for me, tell her Ill be back in a minute. So saying she left Bamboo Lodge to look for Baoyu. Finding him, she told him gently, I was only thinking of whats best for us all. Why take offence and rush over here to sit crying in the wind? Are you trying to scare me by risking your health like this? I didnt take offence, he answered with a smile. You were quite right. But if everyone feels the way you do, before long nobody will speak to me at all. The thought of that upset me. Zijuan sat down too then beside him. Just now we were talking face to face but you wouldnt stay, he pointed out. Why are you sitting right beside me now? Youve probably forgotten, but a few days ago you and your cousin had just started talking about birds nest when Concubine Zhao burst in. Ive just heard that shes gone out, and that reminded me to come and ask you what more did you mean to say if she hadnt interrupted you that day? Oh, nothing much, said Baoyu. It simply occurred to me that now that shes taking birds-nest and has to keep it up, its not right to impose too much on Baochai whos only a visitor here.
All night the pelting rain and soughing wind Accompany her tears for one now gone. Chill mist enwraps the court in loneliness, Bamboos drip by the lattice without pause None can tell when the wind and rain will cease, But already tears have soaked her windows gauze. Having read this through, she had just put down her brush and was about to go to bed when Baoyu was announced. And in he walked, in a large hat of plaited bamboo leaves and a coir cape. Where does this fisherman come from? she greet him laughing. Do you feel better today? Have you taken your medicine? How is your appetite? As he made these inquiries he took off his cape and hat and picked up the lamp, shading it with one hand, to examine her face intently. You look a little better today, was his verdict. She saw that he was wearing a red silk coat, no longer new, with a green girdle, green silk trousers embroidered with flowers, cotton socks embroidered with gold thread, and slippers with butterfly and flower designs. Why did you only protect your head and clothes from the rain, not your footwear? she asked. Not that your shoes and socks are dirty either. Ive got a complete set of rain-wear, he told her gaily. I came here in pyrus-wood pattens, which I left outside on the verandah. She noticed then that his cape and hat were not the usual sort sold in the market, but extremely finely made. What plant are they woven of? she asked. You dont look like a hedgehog in that cape, for a wonder. These three things are all presents from the Prince of Beijing. When its raining he wears a similar outfit at home. If you like them, Ill get you a set. The best thing is the hat as its adjustable the crown can be detached. So men or women alike can wear it in winter in the snow. Ill get you one for when it snows this winter. No thank you, Daiyu chuckled. If I wore one of those, I should look like the fishermans wife in paintings and operas. As these words left her lips she remembered with dismay that she had just greeted Baoyu as a fisherman. She flushed scarlet and leaned forward over the table, coughing as if she could never stop. Baoyu, however, appeared not to have noticed. Catching sight of the poem on the table, he picked it up, read it through, and exclaimed in involuntary admiration. Daiyu hearing this instantly snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp. Too late! I know it by heart, he said cheerfully. Im better now. Thank you for coming so often to see me, even in the rain, she said. Now its late and Id like to sleep. Please go now. Come again tomorrow. At this he took from his pocket a golden watch the size of a walnut. Its hands, he saw, showed that it was after nine. Replacing the watch he agreed Yes, its time to turn in. Ive disturbed you too long again. He put on the cape and hat and took his leave, turning back at the door to ask, What would you like to eat? Let me know and Ill tell the old lady first thing in the morning. Im a better messenger than those old women. Ill think about it during the night, and let you know early tomorrow. Listen, how its pouring outside. Youd better go quickly. Have you anyone with you? Two serving-women answered, Yes, theyre waiting outside with umbrellas and a lantern. A lantern? In this weather? she asked in surprise. Thats all right, said Baoyu. Its a horn lantern, and its rainproof. She took an ornate glass lantern from the bookcase, ordered a small candle to be lit in it, and handed it to him. This is brighter, just the thing to use in the rain. I have one like that too, he said. I didnt bring it for fear they might slip and break it. Which is more valuable, lamp or man? Youre not used to wearing pattens, so get them to carry the horn lantern in front and take this one yourself, since its handy and bright and meant to be used in the rain. Wouldnt that be better? You can send it back later. And even if you drop it, it wont matter. Whats come over you suddenly that you want to cut open your stomach to hide a pearl. Baoyu promptly took the lantern. Two serving-women led the way with an umbrella and the horn lantern, while two young maids with umbrellas followed behind. He made one of these hold the glass lantern and rested a hand on her shoulder. Scarcely had he gone when a woman, also with an umbrella and a lantern, arrived to deliver a big package of the best quality birds-nest and a packet of fine plum-petal snow-white sugar from Alpinia Park.
How much money does Your Lordship want us to fetch from home? I've heard that the governor will be celebrating his birthday in a few days, and all the other officials are sending him thousands of taels. Row much shall we send?" 'Why didn't you tell me earlier?" "You know how it is, sir. We're new here and haven't had much to do with those other gentlemen so why should they send us word? They're only hoping you won't call to congratulate him, sir so that when you're dismissed they can get your lucrative post." 'Nonsense!" Jia Zheng retorted. "I was appointed by His Majesty. The governor can't dismiss me just because I fail to congratulate him on his birthday." "You're right, of course, sir," replied Li with a smile. "But the capital is far away, and it's the governor who reports on everything here. If he commends you, you are a good official if he finds fault you're likely to lose your job. By the time the court learns the truth, it is too late. Our old lady and the other mistresses are all longing for you to have a magnificent success here." Jia Zheng of course understood his drift. "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" he repeated. "I dared not, sir. Now that you ask me, it's my duty to speak but if I do, most likely you will be angry. "Not if what you say makes sense." "Those clerks and runners all bribed their way into this yamen so of course they all want to feather their nests," Li explained. "They have families to support. Since you came to this post, sir, and before you've achieved anything for the state, there's already been talk." "What are people saying?" "The common folk say, 'The stricter the orders a new official gives, the more grasping he will be. The more frightened the county officials, the bigger the bribes they'll send in. "When the time comes to levy grain, your yamen officials say they have orders from the new commissioner not to accept any money, and this makes it difficult for those country people who'd rather grease their palms and be done with it. So instead of praising you, sir, they complain that you don't understand the situation. But your close friend and kinsman has climbed to the top in just a few years, simply because he has the good sense to please both his superiors and his inferiors" "Rubbish," protested Jia Zheng. "Are you implying that I lack sense? As for pleasing both superiors and inferiors, do you want me to connive with rogues - to be 'a cat sleeping with rats'?" "I spoke frankly, sir, out of concern for you, not wanting to keep anything back," Li answered. "If you were to go on like this till you had no achievements to your credit and your reputation was damaged, you could accuse me of disloyalty for not putting the facts before you." "What would you do in my place?" "Just this, sir. While you're in your prime, with friends at court and the old lady in good health, look after your own interests. Otherwise, in less than a year you'll have spent all your family's money and made those above and below resent you too. They'll all assume that in this provincial post Your Lordship must be salting money away. So if some trouble crops up, who's going to help you? By then it will be hard to clear yourself' and too late to regret!" "Are you advising me to become a corrupt official? Forfeiting my life would be of less consequence, but would you have my ancestors deprived of their noble titles?" "A gentleman of your discernment, sir, must surely have noticed which officials have landed in trouble in recent years. All old friends of your Lordship's they were, and you often remarked on their probity but now what has become of their good name? On the other hand, some relatives whom you have always run down have been promoted. It all depends on how well one handles things. You must understand the need, sir, to care for the local officials as well as for the people. Why, if you had your way, sir, and wouldn't let the local magistrates make a cent, who would handle all the work in the provinces? All you need to do is keep up appearances, living up to your good name as an honest official, while in private we underlings get the job done and take whatever blame there may be without involving Your Lordship. We have been so long in your service, sir, you can surely rest assured of our loyalty." Jia Zheng did not know what rejoinder to make to this. "I can't risk my life!" he exclaimed. "If you get into trouble, I won't be responsible." Re then retired to his room.
How often do you wake? I had a good night yesterday, with only two fits of coughing. But I only managed to sleep through the fourth watch after that I couldnt get back to sleep again. Ive just remembered something important. Drawing closer to her he whispered, I think that birds-nest Baochai gave you.... He was cut short by the arrival of concubine Zhao, come to ask after Daiyus health. Daiyu knew that she had only called out of politeness on her way back from Tanchuns apartments. She made her sit down and remarked, It was considerate of you to come out on such a cold day. She ordered tea, glancing at Baoyu as she did so. Taking the hint, he left to join his mother for dinner, and was there reminded to make an early start the next day. Upon his return to Happy Red Court he saw to it that Qingwen took her medicine and slept in the warmth inside the alcove, while he remained outside. The brazier was moved closer to the alcove, and Sheyue slept on the clothes-warmer. They passed a quiet night. The next morning Qingwen woke Sheyue before it was light. Get up! she called. You never seem to have had enough sleep! Go and get them to make some tea while I wake him up. Sheyue scrambled into her clothes. Lets get him up and dressed first, and move away this clothes-warmer before we call the others, she proposed. The nurses said he wasnt to sleep in this room for fear of infection. If we let them see us all crowded together in here, theyll start nagging again. Just what I think, agreed Qingwen. Baoyu woke up himself as they were about to rouse him. He got up and dressed without delay while Sheyue called in some young maids to tidy the room. Only when this was done were Qiuwen and Tanyun summoned to wait on Baoyu. As he finished his toilet Sheyue said, Its cloudy again and looks like snow, youd better wear something woollen. He nodded and changed his clothes, then sipped a little of the lotus-seed and date broth a young maid offered him on a small tray, and took a piece of crystallized ginger from the plate Sheyue brought him. Finally, having urged Qingwen to look after herself, he went to the Lady Dowagers apartments. His grandmother was still abed, but hearing that Baoyu was going out she had him admitted to her bedroom, where he saw Baoqin lying asleep behind her, her face to the wall. The Lady Dowager noticed that Baoyu was wearing, over his brown velvet archers coat lined with fox fur, a scarlet felt jacket embroidered with gold thread. Its slate- blue satin border was fringed with tassels. Is it snowing? she asked him. Not yet, but it looks as if it will, he replied. Bring him that peacock-feather cape taken out yesterday, the old lady ordered Yuanyang. The maid promptly brought in a cape which shimmered gold, green and blue and was no less magnificent, in a different style, than Baoqins cape of wild-duck down. This is called golden peacock felt, his grandmother told him with a smile. It was woven of peacock feathers in Russia. The other day I gave your cousin one of wild-duck down, so now Im making you a present of this. Baoyu kowtowed his thanks and put on the cape. Mind you show it to your mother before you go out, the Lady Dowager charged him with a smile. He agreed to this and, going out, saw Yuanyang standing in the passage rubbing her eyes. Since the day on which she had vowed never to marry, she had upset him by ignoring him. At sight of him now she started to slip away, but he stepped forward to greet her. Look, dear sister! How does this suit me? She flung away from him into the old ladys room. Baoyu had to go on then to show the cape to his mother, after which he returned to the Garden and displayed it to Qingwen and Sheyue. He went back then to the Lady Dowager. Mothers seen it and thinks it a pity to wear it, he said. She told me to be extra careful not to spoil it. Its the only one left, replied his grandmother. If you spoil it, you wont get another. Impossible to replace it. She warned him not to drink too much and to come back early, which he promised to do. Some old nurses followed him to the main hall where six stewards Nanny Lis son Li Gui, Wang Rong, Zhang Ruojin, Zhao Yihua, Qian Qi and Zhou Rui were waiting for him.
We spoil our boy because he looks so engaging, and because his manners to visitors are even better than those of many grownups. Thats why nobody can help being fond of him and why he has his own way so often at home. If he behaved badly to outsiders too, making us lose face, then no matter how handsome he was hed deserve to be beaten to death. You are quite right, madam, they replied cheerfully. Thought our Baoyu is so naughty and so wayward, his manners to guests are better than most grown-ups. So everybody takes a fancy to him and cant understand why he should sometimes be beaten. They dont know the way he runs wild at home, saying and doing the most outrageous things which make our master and mistress very angry. Its natural for boys of noble families to be wilful, extravagant and lazy such faults can be corrected. But what can we do when he was born with such a strange cranky temper? As they were talking Lady Wang was announced. She came in to inquire after her mother-in-law, and when the four visitors had paid their respects to her and said a few words the old lady told her to go and rest. This Lady Wang did, having first served her with tea. She was followed by the four women when they had taken their leave of the old lady, and they chatted together for a while about family affairs before she sent them away. But enough of this. Meanwhile the Lady Dowager was gleefully telling everyone who came in that another family had a Baoyu just like their own. The others thought little of it, supposing that many official families must use the same names and that it was the general rule, rather than the exception, for a grandmother to spoil her grandson. Only Baoyu, being a prejudiced simpleton, imagined that the four women had made this up to please his grandmother. He went back to the Garden to see how Xiangyun was. Now you can be as naughty as you like, she teased. Before this it was a case of A single thread cant make a cord nor a single tree a forest. But now that there are two of you, next time youre beaten for raising a rumpus you can run away to Nanjing to find your double. Dont believe such nonsense, he said. How could there be another Baoyu? Wasnt there a Lin Xiangru in the Warring States Period and a Sima Xiangru in the Han Dynasty? she retorted. All right, Ill grant you that. But two people cant possibly look just alike. Didnt the men of Kuang take Confucius for Yang Hu? Confucius and Yang Hu looked alike but had different names Lin Xiangru and Sima Xiangru had the same name but looked different. How can I look the same and have the same name as someone else? Unable to refute him Xiangyun said, Youre just quibbling, I refuse to argue with you. Whether its so or not, this has nothing to do with me. Then she lay down to sleep. Baoyu stared reflecting dubiously, I may say this cant be, yet I feel all the same its true. Yet how can I be sure, when I havent seen my double with my own eyes? Feeling at a loss, he went back to his room and lay down on the couch to think. Soon he dozed off and dreamed he was in a garden. Is there another garden like this apart from our Grand View Garden? he exclaimed in surprise. As he was puzzling over this some girls all serving-maids approached. Again he exclaimed in surprise, So Yuanyang, Xiren and Pinger arent the only fine girls! What is Baoyu doing here? the girls asked each other. Assuming that they were talking about him he answered with a smile, I happened to stroll in here, not that I know which of my familys friends this garden belongs to. Will you show me round it, sisters? Why, this isnt our Baoyu, cried the girls. Hes not bad-looking though, and soft-spoken too. Do you have another Baoyu here, sisters? he asked. It was the old lady and mistress who told us to call him Baoyu, so as to make him live longer and keep him out of danger, they said. He likes it when we call him by his name. But how can a stinking young upstart from far away like you start using it at random? Youd better watch out or well beat you to a pulp, you filthy lout! Lets go before Baoyu sees him, urged another. Hed think talking to this stinking wretch had made us stink too. With that they left. Why should they insult me like this? wondered Baoyu. Ive never been treated in such a way before.
"I'll go now and discuss this with her." He set off at once with Cuimo at his heels, and had just reached Seeping Fragrance Pavilion when the serving-woman on duty at the back gate of the Garden appeared with a letter. Catching sight of Baoyu she approached him and announced "Master Yun sends his respects. He is waiting at the back gate and told me to give you this." Baoyu opened the letter and read Your unworthy child Jia Yun sends his respectful greetings and wishes his noble father boundless health and happiness. Since I had the good fortune to become your adopted son, I have been longing day and night to please you but found no way to show my filial piety. Recently I was entrusted with the purchase of flowers, and thanks to your great influence I have been able to make the acquaintance of many gardeners and visit many celebrated gardens. I discovered a rare species of white begonia and after considerable difficulty have succeeded in acquiring just two pots. If you consider me as your own son, please keep these flowers to enjoy. As the weather is so hot I will not presume to intrude, for fear of disturbing the young ladies in the Garden. I kowtow with humble respect, wishing you good health. Having read this Baoyu asked with a smile, "Did he come all alone?" "Just with two pots of flowers," said the old woman. "Go and tell him I've read his letter and appreciate his thoughtfulness. You can put the flowers in my room. With that he went with Cuimo to the Studio of Autumn Freshness where Baochai, Daiyu, Yingchun and Xichun were assembled. "Here comes another!" they cried, laughing, as he entered. "Not so vulgar, was it, that sudden idea of mine?" asked Tanchun gleefully. "I wrote a few invitations to see what would happen, and you all turn up in force." "We should have started a club like this long ago," observed Baoyu. "Start one if you like, but don't count me in," said Daiyu. "I'm not up to it." "If you're not, who is?" countered Yingchun with a smile. "This is a serious business," declared Baoyu. "We should encourage each other, not back out of politeness. Let's all give our ideas for general discussion. What suggestions have you, Cousin Baochai? And Cousin Daiyu?" -400 "What's the hurry?" asked Baochai. "We're not all here yet." Before she had finished speaking Li Wan walked in. "How very refined!" she cried, laughing. "If you're going to start a poetry club, I'll volunteer to preside. I had this very idea last spring, but on second thoughts decided it would only be asking for trouble as I can't write poetry myself. So I dropped the idea and forgot it. Now that Third Sister's so keen, I'll help you get this going." "If you're set on starting a poetry club," said Daiyu, "we must all be poets. And first, to be less conventional, we must stop calling each other 'sister,' 'cousin,' 'sister-in-law' and so forth." "Quite right," agreed Li Wan. "Let's choose some elegant pen-names. I'll be The Old Peasant of Sweet Paddy. No one else can have that name. "I'll be Master of Autumn Freshness," cried Tanchun. "There's something unreal and awkward about 'master' and 'scholar,"' objected Baoyu. "With all these wu-tung trees and plantains here, why not use them in your name?" "Yes, I know what. I like plantains best so I'll call myself The Stranger Under the Plantain." The others approved this as more original. Only Daiyu teased, "Drag her off, quick! Stew some slices of her flesh to go with our wine." When the others looked mystified she explained with a smile, "Didn't an ancient say, 'The deer was covered with the plantain'? If she calls herself The Stranger Under the Plantain, she must be a deer. Let's hurry up and cook this venison." Amid general laughter Tanchun cried, "Just you wait! You're very clever at making fun of people, but I've got the right name for you, a perfect name." She turned to the rest. "The wives of King Shun 4 shed so many tears on bamboos that thereafter their stems became speckled, and now the speckled bamboo is called by their name. Well, she lives in Bamboo Lodge and she's always crying. When one day she pines for a husband, I'm sure the bamboos there will grow speckled too.
He went off to bed in a huff. Then Aunt Xue discussed the matter with her daughter. If my brothers really serious about working properly, thats good, said Baochai. But if hes just saying this to talk you round, once away from home he may slip back into his bad old ways and it will be even more difficult to restrain him. Still, its no use worrying too much. If he truly reforms, so much the better for him if he doesnt, theres nothing you can do about it, mother. It depends half on what one can do for him half on his own fate. Hes no longer a boy, and if you keep him at home this year for fear hes too inexperienced to travel or do business, itll be just the same next year. As his arguments sound reasonable, you may as well send him off to have a try at worst it only means wasting eight hundred or a thousand taels. After all, hell have assistants who cant very well cheat him. Besides, once hes gone therell be no one to egg him on or to back him up, and he wont be able to throw his weight about. If he has food, he can eat if not, hell just have to go hungry. And for all we know, seeing that hes on his own, he may cause less trouble than at home. Aunt Xue thought this over for a while. Youre quite right, she said at last. Its worth a little money if hell learn to behave himself better. Having agreed on this they retired for the night. The next day Aunt Xue invited Zhang Dehui to a meal in the study at which Xue Pan presided, and standing in the back corridor she urged Zhang very earnestly through the window to take good care of her son. Zhang promised to do so. After the meal as he took his leave he said, The fourteenth is an auspicious day to start a journey. Please get your luggage ready, sir, and hire mules. On the fourteenth we can make an early start. Xue Pan was overjoyed and passed on this message to his mother, who promptly set to work with Baochai, Xiangling and two old nurses to prepare his things. An old steward, the husband of Xue Pans wet-nurse, was to accompany him with two other experienced old bondsmen as well as two of the pages who usually attended him, making a party of six. Three carts were hired for the luggage, and four sturdy mules. Xue Pan himself would ride a large black mule from the family stable, in addition to which a horse was provided for him too. When all these preparations had been made, his mother and sister went on to give him good advice and warnings which we can pass over here. On the thirteenth, Xue Pan want to take his leave first of his maternal uncle, then of other members of the Jia family but we need not dwell on all the farewell banquets offered by Jia Zhen and the rest. On the fourteenth, first thing in the morning, his mother and sister saw him out of the ceremonial gate and with tears in their eyes watched until he was out of sight before turning back again. Aunt Xue had brought to the capital only four or five families of servants apart from a few old nurses and young maids. Now that five of the men had gone with her son, only one man-servant was left. That same day, accordingly, she had all the ornaments, curtains, and other furnishings of the study stored away and ordered the wives of two men who had accompanied Xue Pan to move into the inner quarters. She also told Xiangling to clear up and lock her room and to share her own bedroom. You already have quite a few people to keep you company, mother, observed Baochai. Why not let Sister Xiangling move in with me? Weve plenty of space in the Garden, and now that the nights are getting longer and I sew every evening, wouldnt it be better if I had one more companion? Of course. Her mother smiled. That had slipped my mind or I should have suggested it. Only the other day I was telling your brother that Wenxings too young to do much, and Yinger cant wait on you properly all on her own. We must buy you another maid. A girl bought outside is a dark horse, objected Baochai. If she turns out badly the money will be wasted, but thats a small matter compared with the trouble she may cause. Wed better take our time making inquiries, and not buy a girl until we know her record. She urged Xiangling to pack up her bedding and toilet things, and ordered an old nurse and Zhener to take them to Alpinia Park. Then she went back to the Garden with Xiangling. I thought of asking our ladys permission to stay with you after your brother left, Xiangling confided.
I didnt dare come before because I was told you were very strict and took offence at the least little thing. Now I see how charming and how kind you are, you may be sure Ill come, even if it costs me my life. Youre certainly much more understanding than Jia Rong and his brother. They look so refined one would expect them to be understanding, but theyre stupid fools with no insight at all into other peoples hearts. Inflamed by this praise, he edged closer. Staring at the purse hanging from her girdle, he asked if he might look at her rings. Take care, she whispered. What will the maids think? He drew back instantly as if obeying an Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha. You had better go now, Xifeng smiled. Dont be so cruel. Let me stay a little longer. This is no place for you during the day with so many people about, she murmured. Go now but come back again secretly at the first watch. Wait for me in the western entrance hall. To Jia Rui this was like receiving a pearl of great price. Youre not joking, are you? he demanded. How can I hide there with people passing back and forth all the time? Dont worry. Ill dismiss all the pages on night duty. Once the gates on both sides are locked, no one can come through. Hardly able to contain himself for joy, the young man hurried off, convinced he would have his desire and longing for the evening. That night, sure enough, he groped his way to the Rong Mansion, slipping into the entrance hall just before the gates were bolted. It was pitch dark and not a soul was about. Already the gate to the Lady Dowagers quarters was locked, only the one on the east remaining open. He waited, listening intently, but no one came. Then with a sudden clatter the east gate was bolted too. Frantic as he was, he dared not make a sound. He crept out to try the gate and found it securely closed. Escape was out of the question, for the walls on either side were too high to climb. The entrance hall was bare and draughty. As it was the depth of winter the nights were long and an icy north wind chilled him to the bone. He almost froze to death. At last dawn came and a matron appeared to open the east gate. As she went over to knock on the west gate and was looking the other way, Jia Rui shot out like a streak of smoke, hugging his shoulders. Luckily no one else was up at this early hour. He was able to escape unseen through the postern door. Jia Rui had been orphaned early and left in the charge of his grandfather Jia Dairu, a strict disciplinarian who allowed him no freedom for fear he drink or gamble outside and neglect his studies. Now that he had stayed out all night his grandfather was furious and suspected him of drinking, gambling or whoring, little guessing the truth of the matter. In a cold sweat with fright, Jia Rui tried to lie his way out. I went to my uncles house, and because it was late he kept me for the night. You have never dared leave home before without permission, thundered his grandfather. You deserve a beating for sneaking off like that. And a worse one for deceiving me. He gave Jia Rui thirty or forty strokes with a bamboo, would not let him have any food, and made him kneel in the courtyard to study ten days lessons. This thrashing on an empty stomach and kneeling in the wind to read essays completed the wretched youths misery after his freezing night. But still too blinded by infatuation to realize that Xifeng was playing with him, he seized his first chance a couple of days later to call. She reproached him for his breach of faith, earnestly as he protested his innocence and since he had delivered himself into her hands she could not but devise further means to cure him. Tonight you can wait for me in another place that vacant room off the passage behind this apartment. But mind you dont make any mistake this time. Do you really mean it? Of course I do. If you dont believe me, dont come. Ill come, Ill come, even if I should die for it. Now, youd better go. Assuming that this time all would go well, Jia Rui went off. Having got rid of him, Xifeng held a council of war and baited her trap while the young man waited at home impatiently, for to his annoyance one of their relatives called and stayed to supper. By the time he left the lamps were being lit, and Jia Rui had to wait for his grandfather to retire before he could slip over to the Rong Mansion and wait in the place appointed.
Master Lian's in a bad temper over something and taking it out on u That's just too bad!" She turned to challenge him, "Madam's done enough for you, hasn't she, always bearing the brunt for you? It's not my place to say this, sir, but you've taken advantage of her all this time, and it's not much you're doing for her now -- not just for her sake either yet you make such a song and dance about it. Don't you mind hurting her feelings? "Besides, you can't pin this on her. If we get up late, you've a right to be angry with us -- after all, we're only slaves. But madam's ruined her health by wearing herself out. Why treat her so unkindly?" She was on the verge of tears. Jia Lian had been bursting with rage, but he was floored by these sharp yet gentle reproaches from his lovely wife and beautiful concubine. "All right, all right!" he laughed. "She's quite enough for me to cope with, without your taking her side. Anyway I'm not wanted here the sooner I die the better off you'll be." "Don't talk like that," Xifeng retorted. "Who knows what will happen? I may die before you. The earlier I do, the sooner I'll have some peace." She wept again, and Pinger had to console her. By now the sun was shining through the window and Jia Lian, having no more to say, rose and left. Xifeng had just got up to make her toilet when a young maid came in with a message from Lady Wang "The mistress wants to know whether you're going to call on your uncle, madam. If you are, she'd like you to take Madam Bao along." Xifeng was depressed after her husband's disclosure and resented the way her family had let her down on top of which she really felt very limp after her fright the night before in the Garden. "Tell Her Ladyship I still have one or two things to attend to, so I can't go today," was her answer. "Besides, it isn't an important occasion. If Madam Bao wants to go, she can go by herself." The girl assented and went back to report this. After Xifeng had finished her toilet, she reflected that even if she did not go she ought to send some message besides, Baochai, still a new bride, should be accompanied if she paid a visit. So she went to see Lady Wang, then made some excuse to look in on Baoyu. She found him lying fully dressed on the kang, raptly watching Baochai as she combed her hair. Baochai was the first to see Xifeng in the doorway. She hastily rose to offer her a seat, and Baoyu got down from the kang. Xifeng seated herself with a smile. "Why didn't you announce Madam Lian?" Baochai scolded Sheyue. "As soon as she came in, she signed to us to keep quiet," the maid replied with a smile. Xifeng asked Baoyu, "Why are you still here? You're grown up now, yet you still behave like a child. Do you have to stick around watching her doing her hair? Together all day long, don't you see enough of each other? Aren't you afraid the maids will make fun of you?" She laughed and smacked her lips. Baoyu, though rather sheepish, paid no attention. Baochai blushed all over her face, feeling she should not let this pass but not knowing what to say. At this point Xiren brought in tea, and to hide her confusion Baochai passed their guest a tobacco-pipe, which Xifeng stood up to accept with a smile. "Never mind us, sister," she said. "Hurry up and get dressed." Baoyu, too, tried to pass off his embarrassment by rummaging around. "You go on ahead," Xifeng urged him. "Who ever heard of gentlemen waiting to go with the ladies?" "I just feel these clothes I'm wearing aren't very good, not up to that peacock-feather cape the old lady gave me that year." "Why don't you wear it then?" she asked mockingly. "It's too early in the season. Thus reminded, Xifeng regretted having spoken. Luckily Baochai was related to the Wangs, still she felt rather put out in front of the maids. But then Xiren interposed, "You don't realize, madam, that he wouldn't wear it even if the weather was cold." "Why not?" asked Xifeng. "Because our young master's behaviour is really fantastic.
No wonder he dared not go home! exclaimed the maid. He must be hiding somewhere. Goodness knows what hell be up to next! Let me clear up for you, sister. Theres no need. Luckily there was still a bit of cow bezoar left, and its ready now. Youd better go. Im going back to tell Concubine Zhao, said the maid. This should stop her singing his praises every day. On her return she was as good as her word. Concubine Zhao sent angrily for her son, and the maid found him skulking in an outer room. You good-for-nothing! scolded his mother. Why spill their medicine, giving them a chance to curse us? I told you to call to ask after her, not to go in. But in you went, and instead of leaving at once you had to catch lice on the tigers head. Just wait till I tell your father, and see what a thrashing hell give you! As Concubine Zhao was storming, Jia Huan in the outer room made an even more startling statement. To know what it was, read on. Chapter 85 Jia Zheng Is Promoted to the Rank of Vice-Minister Xue Pan Is Involved in Another Manslaughter Case As Concubine Zhao in her room was raging at Jia Huan in the outer room, he suddenly blurted out All I did was upset the skillet and spill some medicine I didnt kill the brat! Why should everyone curse me as if I were a monster? Do you want to hound me to death? Some day Ill kill that little bitch, and lets see what you do then! Just tell them to watch out. His mother hurried out to stop his mouth. Still raving! she cried. Do you want them to kill me first? Mother and son wrangled for a time. And Xifengs taunts so rankled with Concubine Zhao that she sent her no further condolences. Although in a few days Qiaojie recovered, their two households were on even worse terms than before. One day, Lin Zhixiao reported to Jia Zheng, Today is the birthday of the Prince of Beijing. What are your instructions, sir? Just send presents as we did in the past, after letting Lord She know. The steward accepted these orders and went to carry them out. Presently Jia She came over and they decided to take Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Baoyu with them to offer congratulations. The others took this as a matter of course, but Baoyu was most eager to see more of the prince whose distinguished appearance and manners had so impressed him. He changed hastily into ceremonial dress and went with his father to the princes mansion, where Their Lordships sent in their cards, then waited to be summoned. Soon a eunuch came out, a chaplet in his hand, and beamed at the sight of them, asking How are you two gentlemen? Jia She and Jia Zheng greeted him in return, and the three young men followed suit. His Highness asks you to come in, said the eunuch. The five of them followed him in past two gates and one court to the inner palace gate, where they halted while he went in to announce their arrival and the young eunuchs there stepped forward to greet them. Before long, the eunuch returned to invite them in, and they followed him respectfully. The Prince of Beijing in ceremonial robes had come out to the corridor to meet them. First Their Lordships stepped forward to pay their respects, and after them Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Baoyu. The prince took Baoyu by the hand. Its so long since I saw you, he said, Ive been thinking of you. With a smile he asked, Have you kept that jade of yours safe? Baoyu bowed and bent one knee as he replied, By the grace of Your Highness, yes. Ive no rich fare to offer you today, but let us have a chat, the prince proposed. Some eunuchs raised the portiere and he led the way in, followed by Jia Shes party with bowed heads. First Jia She asked to pay homage and knelt down even while the prince was declining. Then Jia Zheng and the others made obeisance too. As they were withdrawing respectfully, the prince ordered eunuchs to take them all but Baoyu to join his relatives and friends and to entertain them well. He offered Baoyu a seat so that they could talk, and the boy kowtowed his thanks. Then seated on the edge of an openwork porcelain stool near the door he launched into a description of his studies and essay writing, to which the prince listened with sympathetic interest. Yesterday, the prince told him after tea had been served, Governor Wu came to court and spoke of your honourable fathers probity as an examiner, and the great respect in which all the candidates held him.
Its not because youre engaged now to one of our family that I want you to treat me as your relative. Didnt we become friends as soon as you arrived here? If you are afraid of gossip, just send your maid quietly to pass on messages to. Xiuyan lowered her head and assented. Then Baochai pointed at the green jade pendant hanging from her skirt. Who gave you that? Its a present from Cousin Tanchun. Baochai nodded. She must have noticed that you were the only one with no jade to wear so to stop people laughing at you she gave you this. It shows how thoughtful and observant she is. Still, you should know that trinkets like these are only worn in big official families of rich nobles. Just look at me. Do I wear such magnificent ornaments? Seven or eight years ago I did, but not now that our family positions changed. I economize whenever I can. In future, when you come to our family, I dare say youll find a whole chest of such trash still there. But nowadays our familys not like theirs. We should after all dress more simply, not copy them. If thats how you feel, sister, Ill go back and take it off. No, thats not what I meant, disclaimed Baochai hastily. Since she was kind enough to give you this, if you dont wear it shell wonder why. I just happened to mention the matter for you to bear in mind later. Xiuyan assented, then asked her where she was going. To Bamboo Lodge, Baochai told her. Slip back and send a maid over to our place with the pawn ticket. Ill have the clothes redeemed quietly and sent to you this evening, so that you have something warm to wear otherwise youll catch cold, and that would never do. Which shop is it, by the way? A shop called Heng Shu on the main road west of the Drum Tower. It happens to belong to our family. Baochai smiled. If the shop assistants knew theyd say, Before the bride is fetched her clothes have arrived. Xiuyan blushed when she realized that it was one of the Xues shops. Making no answer she went away with a smile. At Bamboo Lodge, Baochai found her mother chatting with Daiyu. When did you get here, mother? she asked. I didnt know you were coming. Ive been too busy till today to call to see her and Baoyu, said Aunt Xue. And now I find both of them are well again. Daiyu offered Baochai a seat. Life is certainly full of surprises, she said to her. Take Aunt Xue and my Eldest Aunt, for instance. Theyre going to be linked more closely still by marriage. What do girls like you know about such things, child? replied Aunt Xue. Theres an old saying People a thousand ii apart may be linked by marriage. Its all the doing of the Old Man of the Moon. If hes secretly fastened his red thread around the ankles of two young people, not even the ocean or a whole country, or even a family feud for generations can stop them from becoming husband and wife. It always comes as a surprise. On the other hand, if the Old Man of the Moon doesn t do his part, even if the parents on both sides are willing and the young people have been brought up together and think themselves destined for each other, theyll never be united. Take the case of you two girls. We dont yet know whether youll marry someone close at hand or beyond mountains and seas. Mother always drags us in! protested Baochai. Resting her head against her mothers breast she asked laughingly, Shall we go now? Look at her. teased Daiyu. Such a big girl, and when youre not around, aunt, she looks very dignified but when shes with you she acts just like a baby. Caressing her daughter Aunt Xue told Daiyu, This child means as much to me as Xifeng does to the old lady. When Ive serious business, I consult her when theres none, she amuses me. When I see her like this all my troubles melt away. Tears came into Daiyus eyes. Shes doing this on purpose here, to wound me by reminding me that Ive no mother. Look, mother! cried Baochai gaily. Whos acting like a baby now? You cant blame here for being upset, replied Aunt Xue. She has no parents, poor thing, no one to care for her. She turned then to caress Daiyu as well. Dont cry, theres a good child, she urged. It upsets you to see how fond I am of your cousin, but I love you even more if you only knew it.
The officers there, assurning that they were going out on official business, did not even challenge them. They whipped their horses on to Twenty-li Slope to join the rest of their gang, then made their way by different routes to the south coast. Whether Miaoyu lived on in shame after being kidnapped, or whether she resisted and was killed we cannot venture to say, not knowing the sequel. Another of Miaoyu's attendants in Green Lattice Nunnery had been sleeping in the back room at the fifth watch when she heard a call from in front and supposed that her mistress was too restless to meditate. Next, she heard what sounded like a man's footsteps and a window being opened. She wanted to get up and investigate, but felt too listless even to call out. Hearing no summons from Miaoyu she waited till dawn by which time her head had cleared. Throwing on some clothes she got up then and called the deaconess to prepare tea and water. When she went to the front, however, Miaoyu had vanished without a trace and the window was wide open. Remembering the noises during the night, she had misgivings and wondered, "Where can she have gone so early?" Going out of the courtyard to have a look, she found a rope-ladder by the wall and on the ground a pouch and dagger sheath. "Mercy on us!" she cried. "Some thief must have drugged us last night!" She frantically called to the others to get up and make a search. The gate of the nunnery was still locked. "We must have been overcome by charcoal fumes so that none of us could get up," said the serving-women. 'But what do you want us for so early in the morning?" "Our mistress has disappeared." "She'll be meditating in the hall." 'You're still dreaming! Come and look!" In bewilderment they opened the nunnery gate and made a search of the whole Garden. Drawing a blank and assuming that Miaoyu had gone to see Xichun, they knocked at the inner gate and were once more roundly abused by Bao Yong. They explained, "Sister Miaoyu disappeared last night so we've come looking for her. Please be good enough to open the gate to let us ask whether she's here or not." "That mistress of yours brought in thieves to rob our family," he swore. "Now she's gone off with them to enjoy the loot." "Amida Buddha! What a thing to say! Aren't you afraid of going to the Hell Where Tongues Are Cut Out?" 'Shut up!" he fumed. "If you go on making a row I'll beat you up." "Please tell them to open the gate," they begged, "We just want to have a look. If she isn't there we won't trouble you again, sir." "If you don't believe me, go ahead and look. But if you don't find her you'll have to answer for it." With that he called people to open the gate and Miaoyu's attendants trooped into Xichun's compound. Xichun was feeling anxious and depressed. She wondered, "After Miaoyu left so early, can she have heard what that fellow Bao said? If she's offended she may never come back, and I shall be left friendless. I'm really in a fix now, with my parents dead and my sister-in-law against me. The old lady used to be good to me but now she's gone too, leaving me all alone. What's to become of me?" She mused, "Cousin Yingchun died through cruel treatment Cousin Xiangyun' 5 husband is dying of consumption and Cousin Tanchun has gone so far away. This was their fate, they had no say in the matter. Miaoyu' 5 the only one who's completely free, free as a cloud or wild crane. How I do envy her! But how can the daughter of an official family do as she pleases? I'm in disgrace now because of this robbery. How -400 can I look people in the face again? And I doubt whether Their Ladyships understand me, so I've no idea what the future holds for me." She decided to cut off her hair and become a nun. When Caiping and the others saw what she was doing they hastily intervened, but not before half of it had been snipped off. "Before one trouble ends, another starts!" exclaimed Caiping frantically. "What shall we do?" As they were crying out in consternation, Miaoyu's attendants arrived in search of her. When Caiping knew their errand she gave a start. "She left first thing yesterday morning and hasn't been back," she told them.
Assenting repeatedly, Xinger withdrew. Once outside he stuck out his tongue in dismay. That was touch and go! he exclaimed. I only just escaped a good beating. He regretted having passed on the news to Lai Wang, and was scared stiff for worrying what to say when Jia Jian returned. But no more of this. After the page had left, Xifeng turned to Pinger and asked, Did you hear what Xinger said? Yes, I heard it all. How can there be such a shameless man in the world? Guzzling whats in the bowl, he has his eyes on whats in the pan. He wants every woman he sees, the greedy dog. Talk about off with the old love and on with the new! Its a pity to give a lecher like him the insignia of the fifth or sixth rank. He may believe in the saying that the flowers at home arent as sweet as flowers growing wild but if he thinks that, hes making a big mistake. Sooner or later hell cause such a scandal outside, he wont be able to face relatives and friends and then only will he give up. To mollify her Pinger said, Of course youre right to be angry but youve only just got over your illness, madam, you shouldnt let yourself be carried away. After that affair with Bao Ers wife, the master seemed to be restraining himself and behaving much better. So why is he having affairs of this sort again? It must be Lord Zhens fault. Of course Lord Zhens to blame too. Still, its because our master is so debauched that its easy for people to tempt him. As the proverb says, If an ox doesnt want to drink, you cant force it to. Lord Zhens wife ought to have stopped him from doing such a thing. Exactly. How could Madam You let her sister be betrothed to two different families? First the Zhangs, then the Jias. Have all the other men in the world died out? Must all girls marry into our Jia family? Are we so well off, or what? Its lucky that slut Third Sister You had sense enough to kill herself first otherwise theyd have married her to Baoyu or Huan. Madam You doesnt seem to have cared about saving her sisters face how could she ever have held up her head in future? But she wouldnt worry about that, as after all Second Sister was only her half-sister and, by all accounts, a loose living, shameless bitch. But Cousin Zhens wife is a lady of rank shouldnt she feel ashamed of having such a flighty sister at home? Yet instead of trying to keep her away she blatantly brings her here to carry on in that shocking way, not caring if people laugh. Besides, Lord Zhens an official. He may not know all the rules of propriety, but surely he knows that its taboo for a man in mourning to marry, or to spurn his wife and take another woman. What Im wondering is this did he fix this up as a favour for his cousin or to harm him? Yes, Lord Zhen is too short-sighted, said Pinger. He just wanted to please his cousin without worrying about the consequences. Please his cousin? Xifeng snorted sarcastically. No, this was giving him poison. Of all our cousins, hes the oldest and most experienced but instead of setting the others a good example he teaches them bad ways to spoil their reputation. And when theres a public scandal hell just stand aside watching the fun. Honestly, I cant find words strong enough to damn him. The scandalous goings-on in that East Mansion of his dont bear speaking of. And to cover up his own debauchery he must needs make his cousin follow his example. Is this the way an elder brother should behave? He should have drowned himself in his own piss and died in place of his father, for whats his life worth? Look how virtuous Lord Jing of the East Mansion was, fasting, chanting sutras and doing so many good deeds. How could he beget a son and grandson like these? I suppose all the familys good luck, generated by the auspicious geornancy of the ancestral tombs, was used up by the old man. That does seem to be the case. How else could they be so lacking in decency? Its lucky the old lady, Lord She and Lady Xing havent heard of it. If it came to their ears, not only would our good-for-nothing master get beaten and cursed, even Lord Zhen and Madam You would certainly be made to smart for it. Xifeng went on cursing and raging, refusing to go over for lunch on the excuse that her head ached. Seeing that she was working herself up into a greater fury, Pinger urged Youd better calm down, madam.
You're used to Cousin Bao who's so considerate. You haven't met my brother, who fears neither Heaven nor Earth and blurts out whatever happens to be in his mind." Baoyu's interruption when she spoke of Xue Pan had made Xiren realize that her tactlessness must have embarrassed Baochai, whose last remarks abashed her even more. As for Baoyu, he could see that while saying what was right and proper Baochai was also trying to put him at his ease. He felt even more touched. But before he could speak again she rose to leave. "I'll come back tomorrow to see how you are," she assured him. "Have a good rest. I've given Xiren something to make you a salve tonight, and that should help." With that she left, and Xiren escorted her out of the courtyard. "Thank you, miss, for taking so much trouble," she said. "When Master Bao's better he'll come himself to thank you." Baochai turned and smiled. "There's nothing to thank me for. Just persuade him to rest properly and not let his imagination run away with him. We don't want the old lady and the mistress and everyone disturbed. For if word of it reached the master's ears, even if he did nothing for the time being, there'd be trouble later on." So saying, she went off. With a warm sense of gratitude to her, Xiren returned to Baoyu. Finding him in a dreamy, drowsy state, she went to the other room to tidy herself. Although Baoyu lay as still as he could, his buttocks were smarting as if scorched by fire, pricked by needles, or cut by knives. The slightest movement wrung a groan from him. Dusk was falling, Xiren had gone, and he dismissed the other maids saying that he would call if he wanted anything. Dozing off, he dreamed that Qiguan had come to tell of his capture by prince Zhongshun's steward after which Jinchuan appeared, in tears, to explain why she had thrown herself into the well. Half sleeping and half waking, he paid only scant attention. But then he felt himself shaken and caught the faint sound of sobbing. He opened his eyes with a start to see Daiyu. Suspecting at first that this was another dream, he propped himself up to look at her more closely. Her eyes were swollen, her face was bathed in tears it was Daiyu beyond a doubt. He would have gazed at her longer, but the pain in his legs was so unbearable that he fell back with a groan. "You shouldn't have come," he said. "Though the sun's set, the ground is still hot. Walking here and back may make you unwell again. I'm not in any pain after my beating, just putting on an act to fool them so that word of it will get out to my father. I'm shamming actually. Don't you worry about me. " Daiyu was not crying aloud. She swallowed her tears in silence till she felt as if she would choke. She had a thousand replies to make to Baoyu, but not one word could she utter. At long last she sobbed "Never do such things again." "Don't you worry," replied Baoyu with a long sigh. "Please don't talk this way. I would die happily for people like them, and I'm still alive." At this point some maids in the courtyard announced Xifeng's arrival. Daiyu at once stood up. "I'll go out the back way and drop in again later," she said. Baoyu caught her hand protesting, "That's a strange thing to do. Why should you be afraid of her?" Daiyu stamped one foot in desperation. "Look at my eyes," she whispered. "She'd make fun of me if she saw. " At once he released her and she slipped past his bed and out through the back court just as Xifeng came in from the front. "Are you better?" she asked Baoyu. "If you fancy anything to eat, send someone to my place for it." Aunt Xue called next. And then the Lady Dowager sent maids to inquire after the invalid. When it was time to light the lamps, Baoyu swallowed two mouthfuls of soup and soon dozed off. Then came some of the older maid-servants, the wives of Zhou Rui, Wu Xindeng and Zheng Haoshi, who were in the habit of calling and had dropped in after hearing of today's trouble. Xiren hurried out to greet them with a smile. "You're a second too late, aunties," she whispered, "Master Bao has just gone to sleep." She offered them tea in the outer room and after sitting quietly for a while they left, having asked her to let Baoyu know that they had called.
I remember standing up feeling quite all right before the fit came on. Then it seemed as if someone had clubbed my head from behind, and it hurt so badly that everything went black. Still, I saw green -faced, long-fanged devils all over the place, who were swinging swords and clubs. When I lay down on the kang, my head felt as if clamped in a vice. I passed out from the pain. When I came round, I remember seeing a shaft of golden light in the hall which shone on to my bed. All the devils ran away from it and vanished. My head stopped aching too and my mind cleared. That sounds like it, observed the old lady to Lady Wang. At this point Xifeng came in and paid her respects to both her seniors in turn. What did you want to know, Old Ancestress? she asked. Do you still remember what it was like when you were seized by that fit of madness that year? I cant remember too clearly, was Xifengs answer, But I felt I couldnt control myself, as if someone was pushing and tugging me to kill people. I tried to seize every weapon I could lay hands on and kill everyone I saw. Even when I was exhausted, I couldnt stop. And when you got better? prompted the old lady. I thought I heard a voice in the air just what it said I cant remember. Judging by this, it was her all right, said the Lady Dowager. The way they felt during their fits coincides with what weve just heard. How could that old witch be so vicious! And to think that we chose her to be Baoyus godmother! It was that monk and priest Buddha be praised! who saved his life, yet we never thanked them for it. Why are you interested in our illnesses, madam? Xifeng wanted to know. Ask your aunt. Im too tired to tell you. Then Lady Wang explained. Just now the master was here. He told us that Baoyus godmother was actually a witch who practised black magic. Now that her secrets out, shes been arrested by the police and taken to prison to be put to death. A few days ago some fellow Pan Sanbao I think his name was brought evidence against her. He sold a house to the pawnshop across the street for several times what it was worth, but still wanted more. The pawnbroker naturally refused this demand. Then Pan bribed that old witch, as she was for ever calling in at the pawnshop and knew everybody there to cast a spell so that all their women fell ill and their homes were topsy-turvy. Thereupon she went there claiming that she could cure them, and burnt paper offerings which proved efficacious. She got several dozen taels from them as well. But all-seeing Buddha meted out retribution. She left in such a hurry that day that she let fall a silk bundle, which the shop assistants picked up. On opening it, they found inside a whole lot of paper figures as well as four pills with a pungent smell. They were wondering what these could be when the old witch went back for them, and they caught and searched her. They found on her a box with two carved ivory naked devils inside, one male and one female, besides seven red embroidery needles. At once she was haled to the police court, where she disclosed many secret affairs of ladies in big official families. This being reported to the garrison, a search was made of her house and a whole lot of clay devils were brought to light together with some boxes of knockout scent. In addition, in an unoccupied room behind her kang hung a seven-star lamp, and under it were straw effigies some with iron bands round their heads, some with nails stuck in their chests, some fastened with locks. In the cupboard was a great stack of paper figures. And below were account books listing the families which had employed her and the amounts of silver due to her. She had also collected a good deal of money as donations for oil and incense. Yes, she must have been our jinx! Xifeng exclaimed. After we got well, I remember, that old witch called several times to ask Concubine Zhao for money. When she saw me, she changed colour and her eyes blazed. I couldnt guess the reason at the time. Now its clear what they were up to! In my case, of course, running the household Im bound to get myself hated by certain people, and its not to be wondered at if they try to kill me. But what reason has anyone to hate Baoyu? How could they be so vicious? I suppose its because I prefer Baoyu to Huan, said the old lady. That sowed the seeds of hatred. The old creatures already been sentenced, observed Lady Wang, so we can hardly bring her here as a witness.
Yes, madam, said Baoyu, then slipped away. The old lady asked Xifeng, Whos talked of presenting operas? Uncle Wang. He said that the day after tomorrow, which is an auspicious day, hell send over a new company of actresses to congratulate you, madam, as well as the master and mistress. She added with a twinkle, Itll not only be an auspicious day but a happy occasion too. That day... She winked at Daiyu, who smiled back. Why, of course! exclaimed Lady Wang. Its our nieces birthday. The old lady thought for a second and then said, It shows Im growing old, I get so muddled. Its lucky I have Xifeng as my mentor. All right then. If Baoyus uncle wants to offer congratulations, Daiyus uncles family can celebrate her birthday too. Everybody laughed. Whatever our Old Ancestress says is so aptly put, no wonder she has such good fortune! someone exclaimed. Baoyu coming back just then was in raptures when he heard about Daiyus birthday. Presently they all had a meal there and made merry with the old lady. After the meal, Jia Zheng came hack from thanking the Emperor and kowtowed to the ancestors, then to his mother. Standing before her, he spoke to her briefly before going out to entertain his guests. A constant stream of kinsmen was coming and going now, with a great noise and bustle. Carriages and horses thronged the gate silks and sables filled the hall. Truly -771 Bees and butterflies converge on flowers in bloom Sea and sky stretch boundless under the full moon! These visits continued for two days till the time for the celebration. Early that morning Wang Ziteng and other kinsmen had sent over a company of actresses, and a stage was set up in front of the Lady Dowagers main hall. Outside it waited the men of the family, in official robes. More than ten tables of feasts had been prepared for relatives and as the actresses were new and the old lady was in high spirits, they set up a glass screen in the inner hall to feast the ladies there. At the table of honour sat Aunt Xue accompanied by Lady Wang and Baoqin. Opposite was the table for the old lady accompanied by Lady Xing and Xiuyan. The two lower tables were vacant, and the old lady urged the girls to seat themselves there quickly. Presently Xifeng, a troop of maids behind her, escorted in Daiyu. Dressed in new clothes and made up, she appeared like the moon goddess come down to earth as she greeted the others with a bashful smile. Xiangyun, Li Wen and Li Qi invited her to take the best seat at their table, but she declined. You must sit there today. insisted the old lady, smiling. Aunt Xue rose to ask, Is this a happy occasion for Miss Lin too? Yes, its her birthday. How could I have forgotten! Aunt Xue went over to Daiyu. Excuse my bad memory, child! Ill send Baoqin over presently to offer her congratulations. You are too kind. Daiyu smiled. While every one took a seat, she looked around and seeing Baochai was not there, she asked Aunt Xue, Hows Cousin Baochai? Why hasnt she come today? She should have come, but we have no one to keep an eye on things at home, so she has to stay in, Aunt Xue explained. But now she has a sister-in-law, aunty, surely you dont need Baochai to mind the house? I suppose she doesnt like joining in noisy parties, but I do miss her so! Its good of you to think of her, said Aunt Xue. She longs to see you all too. One of these days Ill send her over to have a chat with you. Now maids came in to pour wine and bring in dishes, while outside the performance had started. The first two items, of course, had propitious themes. When it came to the third, they saw fairy pages and maids with flags and pennons lead in a girl dressed as a goddess, with black gauze on her head, who sang an aria and then left the stage. No one knew what opera this was till they heard it said outside that this was the scene Returning to Heaven from Hell from the new opera The Tale of Ruizhu. 2 The girl was the moon goddess who descended to earth and became betrothed to a mortal luckily the goddess Guanyin had shown her the right course and she died before her marriage took place. She was now going back to the moon. That was why she sang -771 Sweet they say is the love of mortals, Yet autumn moon and spring flowers are soon abandoned, And I nearly forgot the palace of the moon.
Only the reference to dusk seems inappropriate. He quoted the old poem then with the line, The alpinia in the court weeps in the dusk. Too sad, too sad, they protested. Heres one for your consideration, said another. -763 Along three paths white angelica scents the breeze, In the court a bright moon shines on golden orchids. Jia Zheng thoughtfully tugged at his beard and seemed about to propose a couplet himself when, raising his head, he caught sight of Baoyu, now afraid to open his mouth. Well? he said sternly. When its time to speak you say nothing. Are you waiting to be begged for the favour of your instruction? We have no musk, moon or islands here, said Baoyu. If you want allusive couplets of that kind, we can easily compose hundreds. Who is putting pressure on you to use those words? Well then, I suggest Pure Scent of Alpinia and Iris. And for the couplet -763 Singing on cardamons makes lovely poetry Sleeping beneath roses induces sweet dreams. Jia Zheng laughed. You got that from the line Write on plantain leaves and green is the writing. This is mere plagiarism. Theres nothing wrong with plagiarism provided its well done, countered the others. Even Li Bai copied from Yellow Crane Pavilion when he wrote his Phoenix Tower. If you consider this couplet carefully, sir, it is livelier and more poetical than the original. It even looks as if the other line plagiarizes this by our young master. Preposterous! Jia Zheng smiled. From there they went on some way until ahead of them loomed towering pavilions enclosed by magnificent buildings, all of them connected by winding passageways. Green pines brushed the eaves, white balustrades skirted the steps, the animal designs glittered like gold and the dragon-heads blazed with colour. This must be the main reception palace, observed Jia Zheng. Its one fault is that it is too luxurious. Unavoidably so, they reasoned. Although Her Royal Highness prizes frugality, this is no more than is due to her present exalted rank. They were now at the foot of a marble arch finely carved with rampant dragons and coiling serpents. What should be inscribed here? asked Jia Zheng. The Fairy Land of Penglai? He shook his head and said nothing. As for Baoyu, he felt strangely stirred by this sight, as if he had seen a place of this kind before though just when he could not remember. Called upon to compose an inscription, he was too preoccupied to think of anything else. The others, not knowing this, imagined that his wits were wandering and he was exhausted after his long ordeal. Fearing that if he were pressed too hard the consequences might be serious, they urged his father to give him a days grace. Jia Zheng, aware that his mother might well be anxious, said with an ironic smile, So sometimes you are at a loss too, you young rascal. Very well, Ill give you until tomorrow. But if no inscription is ready then, so much the worse for you. This is the most important place, so mind you do your best. They continued with the tour of inspection and had covered little more than half the grounds when a servant reported that someone had arrived with a message from Yucun. We cant see the rest of the places, said Jia Zheng. But by going out the other way we can at least get a general idea, even if we dont see them all. He led the way to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of cascading water. This was the sluice admitting water from outside. Jia Zheng asked for a name for it. Since this is the source of the River of Seeping Fragrance it could be called Seeping Fragrance Lock, Baoyu suggested. Rubbish, said his father. We just wont have Seeping Fragrance. On they went past quiet lodges and thatched huts, stone walls and pergolas of flowers, a temple secluded in the hills and a convent half hidden among the trees, long covered walks, meandering grottoes, square mansions and round kiosks, none of which they had time to enter. However, it was so long since their last rest that all were footsore and weary by the time they saw another lodge in front, and Jia Zheng said, Here we must rest a little. He led the way in past some double-flowering peach in blossom and through a moon-gate made of bamboo over which climbed flowering plants. Whitewashed walls and green willows confronted them then. Along the walls ran covered corridors, and the rockery in the centre of the courtyard was flanked on one side by plantains, on the other by a red multi-petalled crab-apple tree, its branches trained in the shape of an umbrella, with green trailing tendrils and petals red as cinnabar.
Instead we must celebrate your birthday too today, so as to make me feel better. Baoyu, Xiangyun and the rest approving this, Tanchun sent a maid to report to Xifeng, Weve decided not to let Pinger go today, as were all chipping in to celebrate her birthday. The maid went off smiling, returning after some time with Xifengs reply. Madam Lian thanks you young ladies for doing her such an honour. She wants to know what birthday treat youll be giving Pinger, and says if you promise not to leave her out she wont come to plague her. All laughed at this. Tanchun said, As it happens, our meals today arent being prepared by the kitchen in the Garden. Were having noodles and dishes cooked outside. So we can whip round for the money, and get Mrs. Liu to take charge and prepare something here. The others all agreed to this. Tanchun then sent to invite Li Wan, Baochai and Daiyu, while another maid summoned Mrs. Liu who was instructed to lose no time in preparing in her kitchen a feast for two tables. Mrs. Liu was puzzled by this. The outside kitchens got everything ready, she said. You dont understand, Tanchun told her. Today is Miss Pingers birthday. The meal prepared outside is provided by the chief accountants office. Now weve raised the money ourselves for a special party for Pinger. You just choose and make some new appetizing dishes, and bring the bill to me later. Mrs. Liu laughed. So its Miss Pingers birthday too, eh? I didnt know that. She approached Pinger to kowtow to her, and when Pinger stopped her went off to prepare the feast. Tanchun had already invited Baoyu to have his noodles with them in the Council Hall so as soon as Li Wan and Baochai had arrived, maids were sent to invite Aunt Xue and Daiyu over. As the day was mild and Daiyu was feeling better, she accepted the invitation. The hall was packed with people, gay with flowers and silks. But now Xue Ke sent Baoyu four birthday presents a scarf, a fan, some scent and silk so Baoyu went over to eat noodles with him. Both families had prepared feasts and exchanged gifts. At noon Baoyu drank a few cups of wine with Xue Ke, and Baochai took Baoqin to pay her respects to him too. After toasting Xue Ke, Baochai told him Theres no need to send a feast to the other house. Better dispense with those formalities and just invite the shop assistants to a meal. Were going to the Garden now with Cousin Baoyu, as we have others to look after so we cant keep you company. Dont let me keep you, cousins, replied Xue Ke. The shop assistants will be here any time. Then Baoyu asked to be excused and left with the girls. When they entered the side gate, Baochai ordered the women in charge there to lock it, and took the key herself. Why lock this gate? asked Baoyu. Hardly anyone uses it but now auntie and you two are inside and it will be awkward if you want something fetched from your home. One can never be too careful, was Baochais reply. Theres been all sorts of trouble in your house these last few days, but our household wasnt involved that shows the advantage of keeping the gate shut. If it were left open, people might take a short cut through here, and then which of them should we stop? Better lock it, even if thats less convenient for mother and me. Dont let anyone through. Then whatever trouble there may be, our household wont be implicated. So you knew wed lost some things recently, remarked Baoyu with a smile. You only heard about the rose flavoured juice and pachyma flour because of the girls involved, retorted Baochai. If not for them, you wouldnt even have known of those two things. Actually there have been losses more serious than that. If it isnt noised abroad, so much the better for everyone otherwise, goodness knows how many people in the Garden would be implicated. Im telling you this because you pay no attention to what goes on. I told Pinger the other day, too, because shes an intelligent person and as her mistress isnt here I wanted her to know. if word doesnt get out, we may as well do nothing if theres a scandal, shell have been forewarned and know what its all about, then she wont wrong innocent people. Take my advice and be more careful in future. And dont repeat what Ive told you to anyone else. They now reached Seeping Fragrance Pavilion where a dozen or so girls were amusing themselves by watching the fish.
Since Ive moved out and dont come so often, youve grown quite out of hand, she scolded. The other nurses dont dare take you to task either. As for Baoyu, hes like a ten-foot lampstand that sheds light on others but none on itself. He complains that other people are dirty, yet leaves you to turn his own rooms topsyturvy. Disgraceful, I call it. The maids knew quite well that Baoyu would not mind, and since Nanny Li had retired and left the house she had no further authority over them. They went on amusing themselves and simply ignored her. Asked how much Baoyu are at each meal and what time he went to bed, they just answered at random. What an old pest she is! one muttered. Is that a bowl of junket? asked Nanny Li. Why didnt you send it over to me? Id better eat it here right now. She picked up a spoon and started eating it. You leave that alone! cried one girl. Thats for Xiren. Hell be annoyed when he comes back, and unless you own up youll get all of us into trouble. I cant believe it of him. Nanny Li was both indignant and embarrassed. What is this, after all, but a bowl of milk? He shouldnt begrudge me that or more costly things either. Does he think more of Xiren than of me? Has he forgotten who brought him up? Its my milk from my own hearts blood that he was raised on, so why should he be angry if I have a bowl of his milk? I declare I will, just to see what hell do. You seem to think the world of Xiren, but who is she? A low-class girl. I should know, I trained the creature. With that, in a huff, she finished off the junket. Theyve no manners, said another maid soothingly. I dont wonder youre cross, granny. Baoyu often sends you presents. This isnt going to upset him. You dont have to humour me in that sly way, Nanny Li snorted. Do you think I dont know how Qianxue was dismissed, all because of a cup of tea? Ill come back tomorrow to hear what my punishments to be. She went off then in a temper. Presently Baoyu came home and sent someone to fetch Xiren. He saw Qingwen lying motionless on her bed. Is she ill? he asked. Or did she lose some game? She was winning, Qiuwen told him. But then Grandame Li came along and raised such a rumpus that she lost the game. She went to bed to sulk. You mustnt take Nanny Li so seriously. Baoyu smiled. Just leave her alone. He turned then to welcome Xiren who had only just come in. After asking where he had dined and what time he had reached home, she gave the girls greetings from her mother and cousins. When she had changed out of her visiting clothes, Baoyu called for the junket. Granny Li ate the lot, his maids reported. Before he could make any comment Xiren interposed with a smile, So thats what you kept for me thank you. The other day I enjoyed it, but it gave me a bad stomachache afterwards until Id brought it all up. So its just as well shes had it. Otherwise it would have been wasted. What Id fancy now are some dried chestnuts. Will you peel a few for me while I make your bed? Taking this for the truth, Baoyu thought no more of the matter but started peeling chestnuts by the lamp. And since the others had left he asked with a smile, who was that girl in red this afternoon? My mothers sisters child. Baoyu heaved a couple of admiring sighs. Why are you sighing? asked Xiren. I know how your mind works. You think she isnt good enough to wear red. What an idea! If a girl like that isnt good enough to wear red, who is? I found her so charming, I thought how nice it would be if we could get her here to live with us. Nice, you call it? Xiren snorted. Nice to be a slave here? Dont be so touchy, he retorted with a smile. Living in our house doesnt have to mean being a slave. Couldnt she be our relative? Were too far beneath you for that. When Baoyu went on peeling the chestnuts in silence, Xiren laughed. Why dont you say anything? Have I offended you? All right, tomorrow you can buy her for a few taels of silver. How do you expect anyone to answer you? Baoyu grinned.
if you go at it too hard now you may fall ill again No, Ill be all right, he assured her. The old lady also expressed the fear that he might overwork and ruin his health. Dont you worry, madam, said Baochai and Tanchun. His reading we cant do for him, but writing we can. Well each copy out one sheet for him every day to get him out of this fix then His Lordship wont be angry when he comes home, and Baoyu wont fret himself ill. The old lady was delighted with this idea. When Daiyu heard that Jia Zheng was coming home, she knew he would certainly check on his sons studies and was afraid Baoyu would get into trouble. So she pretended to have lost interest in re-starting the poetry society, in order not to distract him. Tanchun and Baochai each day neatly copied out a sheet of characters in the orthographic script for Baoyu, while he himself put on a spurt and wrote two or three hundred characters a day. In this way, by the end of the third month, he had amassed quite a number of exercises. He reckoned that with another fifty sheets he could get by. Then to his surprise Zijuan came to give him a rolled-up package. When he opened it he found a number of sheets of old bamboo paper filled with small characters modelled on those of Zhong You and Wang Xizhi, exactly as he would have written them himself. Baoyu joyfully bowed his thanks to Zijuan, and went over in person to thank Daiyu. Xiangyun and Baoqin also copied out some sheets for him. So altogether, althought less than was strictly required, he had about enough. And once this was off his mind, Baoyu started reading the classics he had been set. But it so happened that at this time some coastal regions were devastated by tidal waves and the local officials reported this to the court, whereupon the Emperor decreed that Jia Zheng on his way back should inspect these areas and supervise relief work. This meant that he would not be home till the end of winter. When Baoyu heard this, he put aside his books and calligraphy exercises and started amusing himself again as before. It was then the end of spring. Xiangyun, feeling listless one day, watched the swaying willow catkins and then dashed off the following short poem to the melody Rumengling -763 Boughs with silk floss entwined Or sweet mist glimpsed through a half rolled-up blind? As slender fingers with the catkins play, Cuckoo and swallow cry out in dismay Stop, pray! Do stay! Dont let spring steal away. Feeling rather pleased with this verse she wrote it down and showed it to Baochai, then went to find Daiyu. Daiyu read it and pronounced, Good. Its fresh and original. I cant write in this way myself. Our poetry club has never tried writing irregular metres, said Xiangyun. Why dont you call a meeting tomorrow to do that? Wouldnt that make a change? Intrigued by this suggestion Daiyu cried, Of course! Thats a wonderful idea. Ill send out invitations right away. She gave orders for refreshments to be prepared, then sent her maids out to invite the others while she and Xiangyun fixed on willow catkins as the subject and on the different melodies to be used. They fastened a notice to this effect on the wall. When the others arrived they read first this notice and then Xiangyuns poem, which they praised. Baoyu said Im no good at irregular metres. Still, I shall have to write some sort of nonsense. They drew lots for the different metres and Baochai got Linjiangxian Baoqin, Xijiangyue Tanchun, Nankezi Daiyu, Tan tuoling and Baoyu, Dielianhua. Zijuan lighted a stick of Sweet-Dream Incense then and they started. Very soon Daiyu had finished and written her verse out. Then Baoqin and Baochai completed theirs. They looked at each others poem. Baochai said with a smile, Let me see yours first, and then you can see mine. How come the incense is burning so fast today? exclaimed Tanchun. Theres only one third left, yet Ive just made up half. She asked Baoyu, How about you? Baoyu did not think what he had written was any good, so he crossed it out meaning to start again, then looking round saw that the incense was nearly burnt up. The others laughed. Baoyus lost again, said Li Wan. Youd better write out the half youve done, Tanchun.
Youre an artful puss to have found me after all. Theres no need to show your dutifulness in this way. I didnt come out of any sense of duty, countered Xifeng laughingly. When I found your place so quiet and questioned the maids, they wouldnt tell me where you were. Just suggested I try the Garden. I was puzzling over this when a few nuns turned up. I realized they must have come with an alms list, or to make their annual requests for donations or incense money. So many people apply to our Old Ancestress just before New Year, I knew youd run away to avoid being dunned. Now Ive come to report to our Old Ancestress Your duns have gone, you can come out of hiding. Ive some very tender pheasant ready. So please come back for dinner. If you leave it any later, itll be overcooked. Amid the general merriment that followed, and before the old lady could make any retort, Xifeng ordered her sedan-chair. The Lady Dowager mounted it with Xifengs help, in smiling acquiescence, and was carried through the east gate of the covered walk, chatting with the rest of the party. All about lay snow, soft as powder, bright as silver. And suddenly, at the top of a slope, they saw Baoqin in the cape of wild ducks down, with a maid behind her carrying a vase of red plum-blossom. So there she is! they cried laughingly. No wonder two people were missing. Shes got herself some plum-blossom as well. Just look! exclaimed the old lady in delight. This snowy slope matched with a girl like her, in that costume too, and with plum-blossom in the background what does it remind you of? Its like Qiu Yings t painting The Beauty in Snow which hangs in your room, madam, some of them answered. The Lady Dowager shook her head. No, the girl in that painting hasnt a costume like hers, and she isnt a patch on Baoqin for looks, either. Even as she spoke, someone in a red felt cape stepped out from behind Baoqin. Which of the girls is that? asked the old lady. All the girls are here, they told her. Thats Baoyu. My eyes are failing, she sighed. While talking they had drawn level with Baoyu and Baoqin. Smilling, Baoyu told Baochai, Daiyu and the rest, Just now I went back to Green Lattice Nunnery, and Miaoyus given you each a spray of plum-blossom. Theyve already been sent to your rooms. As they thanked him for going to such trouble, they left the Garden and made their way to the Lady Dowagers quarters. They were chatting there after dinner when Aunt Xue arrived. I havent come over to see you all day because of this heavy snow, she told the old lady. Are you in low spirits, madam? You should have gone out to enjoy the snowy landscape. What makes you think Im feeling low? I went out and amused myself for a while with the girls. Last night I was thinking of asking my sister for the use of the Garden for one day, to invite you to a simple meal so as to enjoy the snow. But I found youd gone to bed early, and as Baochai told me you werent feeling too well I didnt like to bother you. If Id known, I should have invited you. Its only the tenth month, and this is the first fall of snow this winter, rejoined the old lady. Youll have plenty of chances to treat us later on. I hope so, said Aunt Xue. That will give me an opportunity to show my respect. Mind you dont forget, aunt! cried Xifeng playfully. Why not weigh out fifty taels of silver now and give it to me to keep? Then as soon as it snows again, Ill prepare the feast. Thatll save you trouble and the danger of forgetting. The Lady Dowager chuckled. Yes, just give her fifty taels, she said to Aunt Xue, and well take half each. When it snows, Ill excuse myself on the pretext of illness, so as to save you trouble, while Xifeng and I reap all the benefit. Xifeng clapped her hands. Excellent! Just what I was thinking. General laughter greeted this sally. Bah! For shame! exclaimed the Lady Dowager. Youve always got an eye to the main chance. Aunt Xue is our guest and its we who should be inviting her, instead of neglecting her so badly. How can we let her spend money on us? Yet instead of issuing an invitation, you have the nerve to ask for fifty taels.
Giggling, Xiangyun pointed at the mechanical boat. Hurry up and leave by that boat, and stop talking nonsense! she retorted. Amid more laughter they read the instructions, As she is deep in a fragrant sleep and cannot drink, the two next to her must each drink a cup instead. Xiangyun clapped her hands. Amida Buddha! she cried. This is really a lucky dip! It so happened that Daiyu and Baoyu were one either side of her, so they both filled their cups. Baoyu first drank half the cup, as no one was watching, then passed the rest to Fangguan, who drained the cup. As for Daiyu, while chatting with the others she quietly poured her drink into a rinse-bowl. Xiangyun then threw a nine, which made it Sheyues turn. On the lot she drew they saw a rose with the motto Flower of final splendour and the line When the rose blooms, spring flowers fade. Below was written, All at the feast should drink three cups each to farewell the spring. When Sheyue asked what was written there, Baoyu frowned and hid the slip, saying, We must all drink. So they took three sips each to symbolize three cups. Then Sheyue threw nineteen and it was Xianglings turn. She drew a picture of two flowers on one stem with the motto Double beauty linked with good fortune and the line Double flowers bloom on a single stem. The instructions were All must congratulate the one who draws this lot and make her drink three cups, drinking one each themselves. Xiangling then threw a six, making it Daiyus turn. I hope I get something good, she thought while drawing a lot. It showed a hibiscus flower with the motto Quiet and sad in wind and dew and the line Blame not the east wind but yourself. The instruction was Both hibiscus and peony must drink a cup. Fine! cried the others. Shes the only one here fit to be compared to a hibiscus. Daiyu smiled too as she drank, then threw a twenty which made it Xirens turn. Xiren drew a picture of peach-blossom with the motto Exotic scene at Wuling and the line Another spring returns and the peach blooms red. The instructions were, The apricot-blossom, as well as those born in the same year, on the same day and those with the same surname must drink one cup. This one is lively and good fun, cried the rest. They worked it out that Xiangling, Qingwen and Baochai were the same age as Xiren, while Daiyus birthday fell on the same day but they could not think of anyone with the same name until Fangguan said My family name is Hua. Ill drink with her. As they filled their cups Daiyu remarked to Tanchun, Youre the apricot-blossom destined to have a noble husband. So drink up quickly and well follow suit. Stop talking nonsense! retorted Tanchun. Sister-in-law, give her a slap. She hasnt got a noble husband and now you want me to beat her, teased Li Wan. No, I cant bring myself to do it. At that they all laughed. Xiren was about to throw the dice when they heard someone at the gate. An old woman went to see who was there and found it was a maid sent by Aunt Xue to fetch Daiyu back. What time is it? everyone asked. After the second watch, the maid informed them. The clocks just struck eleven. Baoyu could not believe it was so late, but when he called for his watch and looked at the time it was ten past eleven. I cant stay up any longer, said Daiyu getting up. 1 have to take medicine too after I go back. All agreed that it was time to disperse, so when Xiren and Baoyu tried to keep them Li Wan and Baochai demurred It doesnt look right being so late. Weve already made an exception to our rule. In that case, said Xiren, lets each have one final cup. Qingwen and the others filled the cups, and after drinking them they called for lanterns. Xiren and the rest, having seen the visitors past Seeping Fragrance Pavilion to the other side of the stream, came back and locked the gate, then continued their game. They also filled several big goblets and selected several dishes for the old maid-servants waiting on them. And now, being slightly tipsy, they played the finger-guessing game and made the losers sing songs. By the time of the fourth watch, the old women in addition to drinking their share had stolen more wine on the sly so that the whole vat was empty.
Something quiet, not too rowdy, advised Xiren. We dont want people to hear us. And nothing too literary either, as were no scholars. How about the dice game Grabbing the Red? said Sheyue. Thats no fun, objected Baoyu. Better play the Flower Game. Yes, do lets! cried Qingwen. Ive always wanted to play that. Its a good game, agreed Xiren, but no fun for just a few people. Ive an idea, put in Xiaoyan. Lets quietly invite Miss Baochai and Miss Daiyu over to play for a short time. It wont matter if we go on till the second watch. If we go around knocking different people up, we may run into some night-watchers, Xiren pointed out. Dont be afraid, said Baoyu. My Third Sister likes drinking too we should count her in. And Miss Baoqin as well. Not Miss Baoqin, the others demurred. Shes with Madam Zhu, so that would make too much of a stir. Never mind, insisted Baoyu. Hurry up and invite them. Xiaoyan and Sier, who had been awaiting this order, immediately called for the gate to be unlocked and went off to the different apartments. They may not be able to get Miss Baochai and Miss Daiyu, predicted the senior maids. Well have to go and drag them here by main force. So, telling an old woman to bring a lantern, Xiren and Qingwen went off as well. Sure enough, Baochai objected that it was too late while Daiyu pleaded poor health, but the two maids begged them Do give us a little face. Just go and sit there for a while. As for Tanchun, she was eager to come but felt that if Li Wan were left out and came to hear of it later that wouldnt be good so she told Zuimo and Xiaoyan to insist that Li Wan and Baoqin should both be invited. Presently they all arrived, one by one, at Happy Red Court, where Xiren had dragged Xiangling over as well. Another table had to be put on the kang before they could all sit down. Cousin Daiyu feels the cold, said Baoyu. Come and sit by the partition. She was given a cushion for her back while Xiren and the other maids fetched chairs and seated themselves beside the kang. Leaning against her back-rest some way from the table, Daiyu teased Baochai, Li Wan and Tanchun, Youre always accusing people of drinking and gambling at night, and now thats just what were doing. How can we blame others in future? It doesnt matter, replied Li Wan, if we only do this on birthdays or festivals, not every night. Theres nothing to be afraid of. As she was speaking, Qingwen brought in a carved bamboo container filled with ivory slips bearing the names of flowers. Having shaken this she put it down in the middle. Next she brought the dice-box and shook it, and upon opening the box saw that the number on the dice was five. She counted, starting from herself, and Baochai being the fifth was the one who should start. Ill draw, said Baochai. I wonder what I shall get. She shook the container and took out a slip on which they saw the picture of a peony with the words Beauty surpassing all flowers. Inscribed in smaller characters beneath was the line of Tang poetry, Though heartless she has charm. The instructions read, All the feasters must drink a cup by way of congratulations, for this is the queen of the flowers. She can order anyone to compose a poem or tell a joke to enliven the drinking. What a coincidence! all exclaimed laughingly. A peony is just the flower for you. With that they drank a cup each. After Baochai had drunk she decreed, Let Fangguan sing us a song. In that case, said Fangguan, you must all finish your cups. When all had drained them, Fangguan started singing The Birthday Feast Is Spread in a Fine Season. Not that song, protested the others. We dont want you, right now, to congratulate him on his birthday. Sing us your best song instead. Then Fangguan had to give them a careful rendering of a verse set to the melody The Season for Enjoying Flowers. 2 -740 With a broom of green phoenix feathers, I leisurely sweep fallen blossoms for immortals Lo, a wind rising all of a sudden Swirls jade dust under the clouds, So far removed though just outside the gate. Do not miss by an inch again your slash at the yellow dragon, Nor return to the poor wine-vendor in the east.
I thought she ordered that soup out of kindness.... "This is even greater nonsense!" fumed Jingui's mother. "If she wanted to poison Xiangling, why should she get poisoned herself?" Baochai asked, "Xiangling, did you drink that soup yesterday?" "A few days ago I was too ill even to raise my head," Xiangling replied. "When the mistress told me to drink I dared not refuse but before I could struggle up the soup was spilt and she had to clean up the mess -- I felt very bad about it. Yesterday, again, she told me to drink some soup. I didn't want to, but I had to. Before I could start on it, though, I came over dizzy and to my relief Sister Baochan took the bowl away. I was dozing off when the mistress drank her own soup and told me to try mine, so I forced myself to take a couple of sips...." Baochan broke in, "That's it! I'll tell you the truth. Yesterday the mistress told me to make two bowls of soup for her to drink with Xiangling. I was furious! I thought Who is Xiangling that I should make soup for her? So, on purpose, I put an extra handful of salt in one of the bowls and marked it secretly, meaning that one for Xiangling. But as I carried it in the mistress stopped me and sent me to tell a page to order a carriage, as she wanted to go home. When I came back from this errand, I saw the bowl I'd marked in front of the mistress. I was afraid she'd scold me for over-salting it, and didn't know what to do but then she moved to the hack of the room, and while she wasn't looking I changed the bowls round. Well, it served her right! She came back and carried the soup to Xiangling's bed, saying while she drank her bowl, 'You must at least taste this.' Xiangling didn't seem to find it too salty, and they both finished their bowls while I laughed up my sleeve at Xiangling for not noticing the salt. How was I to know that my devilish mistress wanted to poison her? She must have put in the arsenic while I was out, then didn't know that I'd changed the bowls around. Truly, 'Heaven is just, and each reaps as he has sown. The others thought over the sequence of events and could find no flaw in her story. They untied Xiangling too and made her lie down in bed. But in spite of these incriminating facts Jingui's mother went on protesting, whereupon Aunt Xue and the others, all talking together, insisted that her son must pay with his life for the murder. Jia Lian called from outside, "There's no need to argue. Get everything cleared up quickly. The officers from the Board of Punishments are coming." This flustered Mrs. Xia and her son, who foresaw dire consequences. "It's all the fault of my dead daughter," Mrs. Xia had to plead with Aunt Xue. "She brought this on herself. If we let them hold an inquest, it will reflect badly on your family too. Do hush the business up, madam!" "That's impossible," said Baochai. "We've already reported it how can it be hushed up?" Zhou Rui's wife intervened, "The only way to hush the matter up is for Mrs. Xia herself to call off the inquest, in which case we shall say no more about it." Jia Lian outside had also intimidated the son so that he was only too willing to go to the Board of Punishments to sign a statement that no inquest was needed as the cause of death was clear and to promise not to bring any suit later on. And to this the others agreed. Aunt Xue sent to buy a coffin for Jingui -- but no more of this. Let us return to Jia Yucun, who had now been promoted to be prefect of the capital in charge of taxation. One day he went out of the city to check on the acreage of arable land, and passing through the County of Esoteric Understanding he reached the ford in the Stream of Rapid Reversal. He made his chair-bearers stop there to wait for his retinue. And seeing a small temple by the village, its crumbling walls revealing some hoary pines, he sauntered towards it. The gold had flaked off the images inside, and the hall was rickety. On one side was a broken tablet, but he could not decipher the half-obliterated inscription on it. He decided to stroll to the back. In the shade of a green cypress there he saw a thatched hut in which a Taoist priest was sitting cross-legged, his eyes closed in meditation.
She thought, "Lian was the one to blame for my two sisters' deaths yet he's in no trouble now, not parted from his own wife, while we're left stranded. How are we to cope?" These reflections made her sob. The old lady's heart ached for them. She asked Jia Zheng, "Can't your elder brother and Zhen come home now that they've been sen- tenced? And as Rong is not involved, shouldn't he be released as well?" 'According to the rules, elder brother can't come home," he told her. 'But I've asked people to put in a word so that he and Zhen can come back to get their luggage together, and the ministry has agreed. I expect Rong will return with his grand-uncle and father. Please don't worry, madam. I shall see to this." "These years I've grown so old and useless that I haven't checked up on our family affairs," she said. "Now the East Mansion has been confiscated. Not only the house either, but your elder brother and Lian have lost all their property too. Do you know how much is left in our West Mansion's treasury? And how much land in our eastern estates? You must give them a few thousand taels for their journeys." Jia Zheng was in a dilemma. He reflected, "If I tell her the truth she may be very worried but if I don't, how am I to manage now to say nothing of the future?" Accordingly he answered, "If you hadn't questioned me, madam, I wouldn't have ventured to report this. But since you ask and Lian is here too I must tell you that yesterday I investigated. Our treasury is empty. Not only is all the silver gone but we have debts outside too. Now that elder brother is in this predicament, if we don't bribe people to help, then in spite of His Majesty's kindness they may be hard put to it. But I can't think where the money is to come from. We've already used up next year's rent from our eastern estates, so can't raise any sums there for the time being. We shall just have to sell those clothes and trinkets which thanks to Imperial favour weren't confiscated, to cover the travelling expenses of elder brother and Zhen. As to what to live on ourselves, we can worry about that later." The old lady shed tears in her consternation. "Is our family reduced to this?" she exclaimed. "I didn't see it for myself, but in the old days my family was ten times richer than this one, yet after a few years of keeping up appearances - though we were never raided like this - it went downhill and in less than two years was done for! Do you mean to say we shan't be able to manage even for a couple of years?" "If we'd kept those two hereditary stipends we could still manoeu vre outside. But whom can we expect to help us now?" In tears he continued, "All those relatives whom we helped before are poor, and the others we didn't help won't be willing to come to our rescue. I didn't investigate too carefully yesterday, but simply looked at the register of our servants. Quite apart from the fact that we can't meet our own expenses, we can't afford to feed such a large staff." The old lady was distraught with anxiety when Jia She, Jia Zhen and Jia Rong came in together to pay their respects to her. At sight of them she clasped Jia She with one hand, Jia Zhen with the other, and sobbed. Her grief made them blush for shame and fall to their knees. "We are reprobates who have forfeited the honours accorded to our ancestors and brought you grief, madam," they said tearfully. "We don't even deserve a piece of ground in which to bury our bones after death!" All present seeing this gave way to weeping. Jia Zheng interposed, "The first thing to do is make ready for their journey. The authorities will probably not agree to their staying at home for more than a couple of days." Holding back her tears the old lady dismissed Jia She and Jia Zhen to see their wives. Then she told Jia Zheng, "There's no time to be lost! I'm afraid it's no use trying to raise money outside, and it will be bad if they fail to leave by the appointed time. So I had better settle this for you. But the household is topsy-turvy - this won't do!" She sent Yuanyang off to restore order. After Jia She and Jia Zhen had withdrawn with Jia Zheng, weeping again they deplored their past excesses and spoke of their grief at parting. Then they went to lament with their wives.
Its not as if her parents had been our slaves or received any special kindness from us. After her mother died I meant to give her some silver for the funeral, but somehow it slipped my mind. The other day the mistress gave her forty taels, and that should have been enough, interposed Xifeng. The Lady Dowager nodded. Thats all right then. As it happens, Yuanyangs mother has just died too but because her homes in the south I didnt send her back for the funeral. Now they can keep each other company. She ordered a serving-woman to take them some refreshments. Yuanyangs gone without waiting to be told, put in Hupo with a smile. They went on with their feast then, still watching the opera. Meanwhile Baoyu had gone straight back to the Garden. And seeing that he was going to his own quarters, the nurses did not follow him but sat down by the stove in the Garden gatehouse to drink and gamble with the women in charge of making tea there. Baoyu found his compound brightly lit but strangely silent. Can they all be in bed? wondered Sheyue. Lets go in quietly and give them a fright. Tiptoeing past the full-length looking-glass, they saw Xiren lying opposite someone on the kang, with two or three old serving-women dozing on the other side. Baoyu thought they were asleep. He was on the point of going in when he heard Yuanyang say with a sigh Theres no telling what will happen in this life. You were on your own here while your parents lived outside and were for ever travelling east and west, so no one would have expected that youd be able to attend their death-beds. Yet this year your mother died at home and you were able to go to her funeral. Yes, said Xiren. I never thought Id be able to be there when she breathed her last. And the mistress gave me forty taels too, which was a very handsome reward to her for having brought me up, and more than I dared hope for. Baoyu turned to whisper to Sheyue, I didnt know Yuanyang was here too. If I go in, shell leave again in a huff. Wed better go back and leave them to chat in peace. Im glad she came, Xiren was lonely all on her own. So they slipped out quietly. Then Baoyu, stepping behind some rocks, lifted his gown. Sheyue and Qiuwen had stopped and averted their faces. Dont undo your pants till youve squatted down, they cried, or you may catch a chill on your stomach! When the two younger maids behind knew what he was up to, they hurried to the room where tea was made to get hot water. As Baoyu was about to rejoin the others, two of the servants wives approached. Whos that? they called. Its Baoyu, replied Qiuwen. Dont shout like that or you may startle him. Sorry, we didnt know, said the women with a smile. So weve caused you trouble on this festival. You must all be very busy, miss, these days. As they had drawn level now, Sheyue asked them what they were carrying. Some cakes and fruit from the old lady for Miss Jin and Miss Hua. Theyre playing The Eight Gallants over there, not The Magic Box, quipped Qiuwen. So where does this Goddess Jinhua come from? 1 Baoyu made Qiuwen and Sheyue open the hampers, and as they did so the two women squatted down. Seeing some of the choicest fruits, sweetmeats, cakes and dishes from the feast there, he nodded and moved on. The two girls hastily closed the hampers and followed. Those are friendly, tactful women, remarked Baoyu cheerfully. Theyll be tired out themselves these days, but they said how busy you must be. Theyre not boastful show-offs. Those two are all right, rejoined Sheyue. Some of the others really have no manners. Youre intelligent girls, he said. You should make allowances for those poor coarse creatures. By now he had approached the Garden gate. The nurses, who had been looking out for him while drinking and gaming, tagged after him as soon as he reappeared and followed him to the corridor behind the feasting hall in the small garden. There the two young maids had been waiting for some time, one holding a basin, the other a towel and a small flask of ointment. Qiuwen dipped her fingers in the basin. How careless youre growing, she scolded. Fancy bringing such cold water! Its the fault of the weather, miss, explained the girl. I took boiling water for fear it might get cold but its cooled off all the same.
No silly tricks now, Cousin Baoyu, she warned him. The ladies are all in the gallery, one of the girls told her. Just up those stairs, madam. Xifeng gathered up her skirts to mount the stairs and found Madam You waiting for her on the landing. You and your niece are so thick, I thought youd never tear yourself away, teased Madam You. Youd better move over tomorrow and stay with her. Sit down now and let me give you a toast. Xifeng asked Lady Xing and Lady Wangs permission to be seated and exchanged a few polite remarks with Madam Yous mother, then she sat down beside her hostess to sip wine and watch the performance. Madam You sent for the list of their repertoire and asked her to choose a few items. How can I presume when Their Ladyships are present? demurred Xifeng. Old Mrs. You has chosen several already, replied Lady Xing and Lady Wang. Its your turn to pick a couple of good ones for us. Xifeng rose to signify obedience. Taking the list she read through it and marked The Resurrection 1 and The Rhapsody 2 Handing it back she observed, When theyve finished this Double Promotion 3 therell be just time enough for these two. Yes, said Lady Wang. We must let our hosts have some rest soon. Especially as this is a worrying time for them. You come over so seldom, protested Madam You, I do hope youll stay a bit longer. Its early yet. Xifeng stood up to look below and asked, Where are the gentlemen? Theyve gone to drink in the Pavilion of Lingering Dawn, replied one of the matrons. They took the musicians with them. Our presence cramps their style, remarked Xifeng. I wonder what theyre up to behind our backs? How can you expect everybody to be as proper as you? said Madam You jokingly. So they laughed and chatted till the plays came to an end, when the wine was taken away and rice brought in. After the meal they returned to the drawing-room for tea, then ordered their carriages and took their leave of old Mrs. You. They were seen to their carriages by Madam You, attended by all the concubines and maids, and there they found the young men waiting with Jia Zhen. The latter urged Lady Xing and Lady Wang to come back again the next day, but Lady Wang declined. Weve spent the whole day here and were tired. We shall have to rest tomorrow. Jia Rui kept his eyes on Xifeng as the visitors got into their carriages and drove off. After Jia Zhen and the others had gone indoors, Li Gui led round Baoyus horse and the boy mounted it and followed his mother home. When Jia Zhen and all the young men had dined, the party broke up and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day. Xifeng dropped in more often now to see Keqing, who seemed slightly better on some days although in general her health did not improve, to the great dismay of her husband and his parents. And ha Rui, calling several times on Xifeng, invariably found she had gone to the Ning Mansion. The thirtieth day of the eleventh month would be the winter solstice. As it approached, the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and Xifeng sent daily to inquire after Keqing and were told each time that she was neither better nor worse. Its a hopeful sign, Lady Wang told the Lady Dowager, if an illness grows no worse at a season like this. Yes, of course, replied the old lady. If anything were to happen to the dear child, Im sure it would break my heart. In her distress she sent for Xifeng and said, You and she have always been good friends. Tomorrows the first of the twelfth month, but the day after that I want you to call on her and see just how she is. If shes any better, come and tell me. That would take a great weight off my mind. And you must have the things she used to like to eat made and sent round. Xifeng promised to do this and after breakfast on the second she went to the Ning Mansion to see Keqing. Although the invalid appeared no worse, she had grown very thin and wasted. Xifeng sat and chatted with her for some time, assuring her that she had no cause for alarm. Whether Ill ever recover or not well know when spring comes, said Keqing. Maybe I shall, for the winter solstice has passed and Im no worse. Please tell the old lady and Lady Wang not to worry. Yesterday I ate two of the yam cakes stuffed with dates that the old lady sent, and I think they did me good.
Zhen is young, it is only right for him to work hard otherwise he won't be able for long to enjoy the fortune left us by our ancestors. The old lady had never been too fond of Jia She, while Jia Zhen being of the East Mansion was not one of her descendants. Only Lady Xing and Madam You were sobbing as if they would never stop. Lady Xing was thinking. "We've lost everything and my husband is going so far away in his old age. Though I still have my son Lian, he always listens to his Second Uncle, and now that we have to live on him naturally Lian and his wife will take their side. What's to become of me left all on my own?" Madam You had been in sole charge of household affairs in the Ning Mansion, second only to Jia Zhen, and they were a well-matched couple. Now he was to be banished in disgrace, all their property had been confiscated, and she would have to live in the Rong Mansion where, though the old lady was fond of her, she would be a poor dependent saddled with Peifeng and Xieluan into the bargain for her son Rong and his wife were in no position to restore the family's fortunes. She thought, "Lian was the one to blame for my two sisters' deaths yet he's in no trouble now, not parted from his own wife, while we're left stranded. How are we to cope?" These reflections made her sob. The old lady's heart ached for them. She asked Jia Zheng, "Can't your elder brother and Zhen come home now that they've been sen- tenced? And as Rong is not involved, shouldn't he be released as well?" 'According to the rules, elder brother can't come home," he told her. 'But I've asked people to put in a word so that he and Zhen can come back to get their luggage together, and the ministry has agreed. I expect Rong will return with his grand-uncle and father. Please don't worry, madam. I shall see to this." "These years I've grown so old and useless that I haven't checked up on our family affairs," she said. "Now the East Mansion has been confiscated. Not only the house either, but your elder brother and Lian have lost all their property too. Do you know how much is left in our West Mansion's treasury? And how much land in our eastern estates? You must give them a few thousand taels for their journeys." Jia Zheng was in a dilemma. He reflected, "If I tell her the truth she may be very worried but if I don't, how am I to manage now to say nothing of the future?" Accordingly he answered, "If you hadn't questioned me, madam, I wouldn't have ventured to report this. But since you ask and Lian is here too I must tell you that yesterday I investigated. Our treasury is empty. Not only is all the silver gone but we have debts outside too. Now that elder brother is in this predicament, if we don't bribe people to help, then in spite of His Majesty's kindness they may be hard put to it. But I can't think where the money is to come from. We've already used up next year's rent from our eastern estates, so can't raise any sums there for the time being. We shall just have to sell those clothes and trinkets which thanks to Imperial favour weren't confiscated, to cover the travelling expenses of elder brother and Zhen. As to what to live on ourselves, we can worry about that later." The old lady shed tears in her consternation. "Is our family reduced to this?" she exclaimed. "I didn't see it for myself, but in the old days my family was ten times richer than this one, yet after a few years of keeping up appearances - though we were never raided like this - it went downhill and in less than two years was done for! Do you mean to say we shan't be able to manage even for a couple of years?" "If we'd kept those two hereditary stipends we could still manoeu vre outside. But whom can we expect to help us now?" In tears he continued, "All those relatives whom we helped before are poor, and the others we didn't help won't be willing to come to our rescue. I didn't investigate too carefully yesterday, but simply looked at the register of our servants. Quite apart from the fact that we can't meet our own expenses, we can't afford to feed such a large staff." The old lady was distraught with anxiety when Jia She, Jia Zhen and Jia Rong came in together to pay their respects to her. At sight of them she clasped Jia She with one hand, Jia Zhen with the other, and sobbed.
Im aware of it its no use talking about it. Youve found yourself a good niche now, and so has mother, and its only right and proper that I should look for a home of my own too. But marriage is a serious business its for life, not a joking matter. Ive had a change of heart and mean to turn over a new leaf, but I must find someone congenial before Ill marry. If your choice, no matter how rich, talented and handsome, wasnt a man after my own heart then my whole life would be wasted. Thats no problem, said Jia Lian. You can make your own choice. And well provide the whole dowry, so that mother neednt worry about that either. Sister knows who I mean, sobbed Third Sister. I dont have to name him. Who is he? Jia Lian asked Second Sister, but she could not think who it could be. While the others were wondering, Jia Lian, sure that he had guessed, clapped his hands. I know who it is! Hes certainly not bad. Youve made a good choice. Who is it? asked Second Sister. It must be Baoyu, he chuckled. No one else would do for her. Second Sister and old Mrs. You thought he had guessed right, but Third Sister spat in disgust. If there were ten of us sisters, would we all have to marry your brothers and cousins? she asked. Are there no men outside your family? This puzzled them all. Who else could it be? They wondered. Forget about the present, sister, said Third Sister. Just think back five years and youll know. As they were talking, Jia Lians trusted page Xinger came in to report, The old master wants you to go over at once, sir. I told him youd gone to see your uncle, then came straight to fetch you. Did they ask about me at home yesterday? demanded Jia Lian hastily. I told Madam that you were at the family temple making plans for the hundredth day sacrifice with Lord Zhen, so you probably couldnt come home. Jia Lian promptly called for his horse and rode off, accompanied by Longer, leaving Xinger behind to attend to other things. Second Sister ordered two dishes and made him drink a goblet of wine as he squatted by the kang while she questioned him about the Jia family. How old was Madam Lian? Was she really a terror? How old were the old lady and Lady Wang? How many girls were there in the household? Beaming as he ate and drank beside the kang, Xinger regaled old Mrs. You and her daughters with a detailed account of the Rong Mansion. I keep watch at the inner gate, he said. We have two shifts, four men in each, eight altogether. Some of us are trusted by Madam, some by the master. Were careful not to annoy her men, but theyre always provoking us. You ask about our mistress. Well, I shouldnt really be telling you this, madam, but shes crafty and vicious with a sharp, quick tongue. Second Master is all right, but hes under her thumb. Still Miss Pinger in their apartments is good-natured even though shes on Madam Lians side, behind her back she often does people good turns. If we do anything wrong, Madam wont let us off but if we beg Pinger for help she smoothes things over. Theres no one now in the whole household, barring Their Ladyships, who doesnt hate her. We just make a show of liking her out of fear. Thats because she looks down on everyone and just sucks up to the old lady and mistress. Whatever she says goes, and no one dares stop her. She tries to save up piles of silver so that Their Ladyships will praise her for being a good manager but of course we servants are the ones to suffer, while she takes all the credit. If anything good happens, she rushes to take the credit before anyone else can report it. If anything bad happens, or if she herself makes some mistake, she ducks and shifts the blame on to other people, stirring up more trouble too on the side. Now even her own mother-in-law, the Elder Mistress, cant stand her, calling her a fair-weather sparrow, or a black hen that neglects her own nest but keeps butting in everywhere else. If not for the old ladys backing, her mother-in-law would have fetched her back long ago. Second Sister smiled. The way youre talking behind her back makes me wonder what youll say about me in future. As Im lower in status you can lay it on even thicker! Xinger hastily fell on his knees. If I do, may a thunderbolt strike me dead!
Petty-minded people who dont know us so well might imagine we look down on everyone else. Gracious Buddha! exclaimed Granny Liu. Were too hard up to gad about. And even if Your Ladyship didnt slap our faces for coming, your stewards might take us for tramps. Thats no way to talk! Xifeng laughed. Were simply poor officials trying to live up to our grandfathers reputation. This household is nothing but an empty husk left over from the past. As the saying goes The Emperor himself has poor relations. How much more so in our case? She asked Mrs. Zhou if she had notified Lady Wang. I was waiting for madams instructions, was the reply. Go and see how busy she is. If she has visitors, never mind. But if shes free, let her know and see what she says. After Mrs. Zhou left on this errand, Xifeng told the maids to give Baner some sweetmeats. She was asking Granny Liu questions when Pinger announced the arrival of a number of servants to report on affairs in their charge. I have a guest. They can come back this evening, said Xifeng. Only bring in anyone whose business wont wait. Pinger went out, reappearing to say, Theyve nothing pressing so I sent them away. As Xifeng nodded, Mrs. Zhou came back. Her Ladyship isnt free today, she said. She hopes youll entertain them and thank them for coming. If they just dropped in for a call, well and good. If they have any business they should tell you, madam. Ive no special business, put in Granny Liu. I just came to call on Her Ladyship and Madam Lian, seeing as how were related. If youve nothing special, all right, said Mrs. Zhou. If you have, telling our second mistress is just the same as telling Her Ladyship. She winked at Granny Liu, who took the hint. Although her face burned with shame, she forced herself to pocket her pride and explain her reason for coming. By rights, I shouldnt bring this up at our first meeting, madam. But as Ive come all this way to ask your help, Id better speak up. . Just then pages by the second gate called out, The young master from the East Mansion is here. Cutting Granny Liu short Xifeng asked, Where is Master Rong? Booted footsteps sounded and in walked a handsome youth of seventeen or eighteen. Slender and graceful in light furs, he wore a jewelled girdle, fine clothes and a gorgeous hat. Granny Liu didnt know whether to sit or stand and longed for some hiding-place. Sit down, said Xifeng with a twinkle. Its only my nephew. Granny Liu perched gingerly on the edge of the kang. Jia Rong announced cheerfully, My fathers sent me to ask a favour, aunt. Hes expecting an important guest tomorrow, and hed like to borrow that glass screen for the kang that our Grand-Aunt Wang gave you. Hell return it promptly. Youre too late, replied Xifeng. I gave it to somebody only yesterday. Chuckling, Jia Rong half knelt by the foot of the kang. If you wont lend it, aunt, Ill be given another sound thrashing for not asking properly. Have pity on your nephew! You seem to imagine all the Wangs things are special. Havent you plenty of stuff of your own over there? Nothing half as good. He laughed. Please, aunt, be kind! Then look out for your skin if you chip it! She ordered Pinger to fetch the keys to the upstairs rooms and find trustworthy people to deliver the screen. Ive brought men to carry it. Jia Rongs face lit up, his eyes twinkled. Ill see that theyre careful. He had barely left when she suddenly called him back. Servants outside echoed, Master Rong, youre asked to go back. The young man hurried in again and stood at attention to hear his aunts instructions. Xifeng sipped her tea slowly and thoughtfully for a while, then said with a laugh Never mind. Come back again after supper. Ive company now and dont feel in the mood to tell you at the moment. So Jia Rong slowly withdrew. Granny Liu felt easy enough at last to say, The reason I brought your nephew here today is that his parents havent a bite to eat. And winters coming on, making things worse. So I brought your nephew here to ask for your help. She nudged Baner. Well, what did your dad tell you? What did he send us here for? Was it just to eat sweets?
he asked Qingwen. Qingwen tilted her head towards the kang in the inner room, where Baoyu saw Xiren lying, fully dressed. Thats good, he said. But its rather early to sleep. At breakfast in the other house this morning there was a plate of beancurd dumplings. Knowing youd like them, I asked Madam You to let me have them for supper, and they were sent over. Did you get them all right? Dont ask! answered Qingwen. I knew at once they were meant for me, but as Id just finished my breakfast I left them here. Then Nanny Li came and saw them. Baoyu wont be wanting these, she said. Ill take them for my grandson. She got somebody to send them home for her. At this point Qianxue brought in tea and Baoyu said, Do have some tea, Cousin Lin. The maids burst out giggling. Shes gone long ago. Yet you offer her tea. After drinking half a cup himself he remembered something else and asked Qianxue, Why did you bring me this tea? This morning we brewed some maple-dew tea, and I told you its flavour doesnt really come out until after three or four steepings. I did save that other tea, she replied. But Nanny Li insisted on trying it and she drank it all. This was too much for Baoyu. He dashed the cup to pieces on the floor, spattering the maids skirt with tea. Then springing to his feet he stormed Is she your grandmother, that all of you treat her so respectfully? Just because she suckled me for a few days when I was small, she carries on as if she were more important than our own ancestors. I dont need a wet-nurse any more, why should I keep an ancestress like this? Send her packing and well all have some peace and quiet. He wanted to go straight to his grandmother to have the old woman dismissed. Now Xiren had only been shamming sleep, in the hope that Baoyu would come in to tease her. She hadnt troubled to get up when he asked about the dumplings but now that he had smashed a cup and flown into a passion she jumped up and came out to smooth things over, just as a maid arrived from his grandmother to ask the reason for the noise. Id just poured out some tea, said Xiren. I slipped because of snow on my shoes and the cup was smashed. Then she turned to calm Baoyu. So youve decided to dismiss her. Good. Wed all like to leave. Why not take this chance to get rid of the lot of us? That would suit us, and youd get better attendants too. Thus silenced, Baoyu let them help him to the kang and take off his clothes. He was still mumbling to himself but could hardly keep his eyes open, so they put him straight to bed. Xiren took the precious jade off his neck, wrapped it up in her own handkerchief and tucked it under his mattress, so that it should not be cold to the touch when he put it on the next day. Baoyu fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Meantime Nanny Li had come in. Hearing that he was drunk she dared not risk further trouble, and having quietly made sure that he was asleep she left easier in her mind. Upon waking the next morning, Baoyu was told that Jia Rong from the other mansion had brought Qin Zhong over to pay his respects. He hastened to greet his new friend and presented him to the Lady Dowager, who was delighted by his handsome looks and pleasing manner. Convinced that he would make an excellent schoolmate for Baoyu, she kept him to tea and a meal, then ordered servants to take him to meet Lady Wang and the rest of the family. Qin Keqing was a general favourite, and they liked her brother for himself as well. All gave him presents on parting. The Lady Dowagers gift was a purse containing a small golden effigy of the God of Learning symbolizing literary talent and harmony. You live so far away, she said, in hot or cold weather you may find the journey too much. You are welcome to stay here and must make yourself at home. Stay with your Uncle Baoyu, and dont get into mischief with those lazy young rascals. Qin Zhong agreed readily, then went home to report what had happened. His father Qin Ye, a secretary in the Board of Works, was nearly seventy and had lost his wife early. Having no children of his own he had adopted a son and daughter from an orphanage, but the boy had died leaving only the little girl, Keqing. She grew up to be a graceful, charming young woman.
Sure enough he found Daiyu, Baochai, Xiangyun, Baoqin and Tanchun all there reading a poem. Why are you so late up? they demanded. For a year our poetry clubs been broken up and no ones called it together again. Now its early spring, a fresh start for all living things and high time to bestir ourselves to get it going again. We started the club in autumn, added Xiangyun. Thats why it didnt prosper. If we start it again now in spring when everything burgeons, its bound to come to life. And this poem on peach-blossom is so good, why not change our Begonia Club into Peach-Blossom Club? Baoyu nodded approvingly and asked to read the poem. But the others proposed, Lets go and find the Old Peasant of Sweet Paddy, to talk it over together and get things going. With that they all got up and set off for Paddy-Sweet Cottage, Baoyu reading the poem on the way. It was as follows -740 PEACH-BLOSSOM Outside the blind, peach-blossom, a soft spring breeze Within, a girl is languidly dressing her hair. Outside, the peach-blossom within the girl Not far apart the blossom and maid so fair. Obligingly, the breeze blows back the blind And holds it to afford a glimpse of her bower Outside, the peach is blooming as of old, Frailer the girl within than any flower. The flowers, knowing pity, grieve for her Their sighs gentle breezes express Breeze wafts through bamboo slats, blooms fill the court, But this spring scene redoubles her distress. The gate of the quiet, mossy courtyard is closed, At sunset she leans alone on the balustrade Then, shedding tears in the soothing breeze, Neath blossoming boughs slips the red-skirted maid. Luxuriant the foliage and blooms With petals a fresh red, leaves emerald green These myriad trees enwrapped in mist Cast a rosy glow, as if of warmth, on her screen. Duck-and-drake brocade from heavens loom is burned, While on coral pillow she wakes in balmy spring But chill to the touch of rouged cheeks, Sweet spring water in golden basins her maids bring. To what can the vividness of rouge be likened? The colour of flowers? A girls tears dropping slow? If tears are likened to blossom, Long as the blooms retain their charm they flow. As she gazes at the blossom her tears run dry Her tears run dry, spring ends, blooms fade away The fading blossoms hide the fading maid Blossoms drift down, she tires, dusk follows day. A cuckoo-call and spring is left behind, Only faint moonlight falls on the lonely blind. Baoyu instead of praising this poem shed tears, for he knew it must be by Daiyu. But not wanting the girls to see how moved he was, he hastily wiped his eyes. Where did you get this? he asked. Guess who wrote it, challenged Baoqin. The Queen of the Bamboos, of course. No, she didnt, giggled Baoqin. I did. I dont believe it. The style and spirit are definitely not yours. That just shows how little you know, put in Baochai. Were all Tu Dus lines like clustered chrysanthemums have flowered twice in tears for other days? He has other exquisite lines like Plums steeped in rain will wax crimson in days to come and The waterweed in the breeze trails long emerald belts. Even so, Baoyu retorted, I know youd never let your cousin write such sad lines. And even if she had the talent, she wouldnt want to. Cousin Daiyu is different. Shes known such grief that she writes mournful lines. All laughing, they now reached Paddy-Sweet Cottage where they showed Daiyus poem to Li Wan, who was of course loud in her praise. Then they discussed the poetry club and decided to start it the following day, the second of the third month, and to change its name from Begonia Club to Peach-Blossom Society, electing Daiyu as its president. The next day after breakfast they all gathered in Bamboo Lodge. When the question arose of a subject for the first poem, Daiyu suggested that each of them should write a hundred rhyming couplets on peach-blossom. That wont do, objected Baochai. There have been so many poems since ancient times on peach-blossom, if we did that wed be bound to produce something stereotyped, not to be compared with your poem. We must think of a different subject.
Once out of the Garden, however, she ordered the matrons in all the Garden apartments to investigate carefully. It was Miss Xiuyans maid whom we suspected. We thought that, being poor and never having seen such things before, the child might have picked it up. We never dreamed it would turn out to be one of your girls. Luckily Madam Lian was out when Mrs. Song brought the bracelet back to me saying shed seen young Zhuier take it, and shed come to report it to Madam Lian. I was very glad to get my bracelet back. I couldnt help thinking then how considerate Baoyu is to you girls, and how proud of you as well. Yet two years ago Lianger stole a piece of jade, which is still making idle tongues wag, and now another of your girls has stolen a gold bracelet from one of his neighbours, too! Its a shame that Baoyu of all people should be disgraced by his own maids in this way. So I hurriedly asked Mrs. Song on no account to tell him but just to forget it, and to say nothing to anyone about it. For if this came to the ears of the old lady and Lady Wang, how angry theyd be! It would reflect badly on Xiren and the rest of you as well. So I simply told Madam Lian that the clasp of my bracelet was loose and so Id dropped it in the grass on the way to Madam Zhus place, when the snow was too deep to find it. Today after the snow had melted and it lay glinting in the sun, I picked it up where Id dropped it. And she took my word for it. The reason Im telling you this is so that youll take precautions in future and not send Zhuier out on any errands. When Xiren comes back, you can talk it over with her and cook up some excuse for dismissing the girl. Its not as if the little bitch hadnt seen plenty of things of that sort, exclaimed Sheyue. Why did she have to steal it? Theres not too much gold in that bracelet, though the pearl on it is a good size, remarked Pinger. Its one that Madam Lian gave me. She called it her shrimp-beard bracelet. I havent told Qingwen because shes as hot-tempered as crackling charcoal. Shed be bound to flare up and start beating or cursing the girl then the whole story would get out. Thats why Im just warning you to be on your guard. This said she took her leave. Baoyu had overheard this with mixed feelings pleasure at Pingers consideration for him, anger at Zhuiers dishonesty, and regret that such an intelligent girl should do something so underhand. He went back to Qingwen and told her all that Pinger had said, concluding, She didnt want you to know till you were better, because you take things so much to heart that this news might make your illness worse. Indeed, Qingwens eyebrows had shot up and her eyes were round with rage. She wanted to summon Zhuier then and there. All Pingers consideration for us would be wasted if you make a scene, he warned. As shes been so thoughtful, lets do as she suggested and get rid of Zhuier later. Its all very well for you to talk, cried Qingwen. But I cant stand it Im so angry! Its not worth flaring up about. Just concentrate on getting better. Qingwen took some medicine then and that evening had the second infusion. She sweated a little that night, but not enough, and awoke the next morning with a fever, headache, a stopped-up nose and sore throat. Doctor Wang called again and made certain alterations in the prescription but although her temperature went down a little, her head continued to ache. Bring her some snuff, Baoyu told Sheyue. Shell feel better after a few good sneezes. Sheyue accordingly brought him a small flat, golden-starred glass case with gilt double-catches, and Baoyu opened it. Inside the lid, in western enamel, was a picture of a naked girl with yellow hair and fleshy wings the case contained some genuine Wangqia foreign snuff but instead of taking it, Qingwen just pored over the picture. Do hurry up and take some, Baoyu urged her. Its not good to expose snuff to the air too long. She promptly dipped one finger-nail into the snuff, put it to her nose and inhaled. As she felt no effect, she tried a larger amount. At once her nose tingled and the smarting spread right up to her cranium. She sneezed so violently, five or six times in succession, that her nose and eyes started to run. My, thats better!
Thats all very well, said Xifeng hastily. I certainly dont want her to leave us, and I certainly wont let her. If youve any feeling for me, nephew, just give him a bigger sum in settlement. Jia Rong knew very well that in spite of Xifengs protestations she really wanted to get rid of Second Sister and was only posing as broad-minded. He had to agree, however, to whatever she said, at which she looked delighted. The problem outside is easy to handle, but what about the arrangement at home? Xifeng now asked. You must come back with me to report this. This threw Madam You into another panic. She begged Xifeng to make up some story for her. If you cant talk your way out, why do this in the first place? asked Xifeng sarcastically. Ive no patience with the way youre carrying on. But it wouldnt be like me to refuse to find a way out for you, as Im so soft-hearted that even when people trick me I still act like a fool. All right then, Ill see to this. Both of you keep out of it. Ill take your sister to pay her respects to Their Ladyships, and tell them that I took a fancy to her, and because I have no son I was thinking of buying a couple of concubines. Finding your sister so charming, and as were relatives too, I wanted her to be Lians second wife. But because her parents and sister had died recently and she was finding it hard to manage, with no home of her own, how could she possibly wait till after the full hundred days mourning? So I decided to bring her into our house, and Ive made the side rooms ready for her to stay in for the time being. Once the mourning is over she can live with my husband. I shall brazen it out somehow in my shameless way. If anyone is blamed it wont be you. What do you think of this plan? Madam You and Jia Rong responded, Its most generous and kind of you. How clever you are! Once its settled, well certainly both come to thank you. Madam You ordered her maids to help Xifeng wash her face and comb her hair. Then the table was spread and she herself served the wine and food. Before long, however, Xifeng rose to go. She went to the Garden and told Second Sister what had happened, explaining how worried she had been, how she had ascertained the facts, and what would have to be done to keep them all out of trouble. She promised to get them out of the dilemma. To know what her plans really were, read the next chapter. Chapter 69 Crafty Xifeng Kills Her Rival by Proxy And Second Sister Swallows Gold and Dies Unable to express all her gratitude, Second Sister went off with Xifeng. And propriety required Madam You to accompany them to report to the old lady. You neednt say anything. Xifeng assured her, Leave all the talking to me. Of course, agreed Madam You. If theres any blame well let you take it. They went first to the Lady Dowagers room where she was chatting and laughing with the girls from the Garden. At sight of the pretty young woman Xifeng had brought in, the old lady looked at her searchingly. Whose child is this? she asked. So charming! Xifeng stepped forward and said with a smile, Take a good look, Old Ancestress. Isnt she sweet? Pulling Second Sister forward too, she told her, This is grandmother-in-law. Hurry up and kowtow to her. At once Second Sister prostrated herself to pay her respects. Then Xifeng introduced the girls to her one by one. Now you know them, she said. After the old ladys through with inspecting you, you can pay your respects to each other. Second Sister pretended that this was the first time she had met them, then stood there with lowered head while the Lady Dowager looked her up and down. What is your name? she inquired. How old are you? Never mind about that, Old Ancestress, Xifeng chuckled. Just say, is she prettier than me? The old lady put on her spectacles, telling Yuanyang and Hupo, Bring the child closer. I want to look at her skin. Amid suppressed laughter, Second Sister was pushed forward and subjected to a carefully scrutiny. Then the Lady Dowager made Hupo hold out her hands for inspection. Yuanyang lifted Second Sisters skirt as well to show her feet. Her examination at an end, the old lady took off her spectacles. Perfect! she pronounced. Shes even prettier than you. Smiling. Xifeng promptly knelt down to relate in detail the story she had made up in Madam Yous room.
Jia Zhen withdrew to prepare the written prayers, burn incense and order the actors to start. But no more of this. Baoyu, seated next to his grandmother upstairs, told one of the maids to bring him the tray of gifts. Having put on his own jade again he rummaged through his presents, showing them one by one to the old lady. Her eye was struck by a gold unicorn decorated with turquoise enamel, which she picked up. "I'm sure I've seen something like this on one of the girls," she remarked. "Cousin Xiangyun has one like that, only a little smaller," Baochai told her. "So that's it!" exclaimed the Lady Dowager. "All this time she's been staying with us, how come I've never noticed it?" asked Baoyu. "Cousin Baochai's observant," chuckled Tanchun. "She never forgets anything either." "She's not so observant about other things," remarked Daiyu cuttingly. "But she's most observant about other people's trinkets." Baochai turned away and pretended not to have heard. As soon as Baoyu knew that Xiangyun had a unicorn too, he picked this one up and slipped it into his pocket. Then, afraid people might see through him, he glanced surreptitiously round. The only one paying any attention was Daiyu, who was nodding at him with a look of speculation in her eyes. Embarrassed by this, he took the unicorn out again and showed it to her. "This is rather fun," he said with a smile. "I'll keep it for you till we get home, then put it on a cord for you to wear. " Daiyu tossed her head. "I don't fancy it." "If you really don't, in that case I'll keep it for myself." He put it away again. Before he could say more, Madam You and Rong's second wife -- Jia Zhen's wife and daughter-in-law -- arrived to pay their respects. "You shouldn't have come," protested the old lady. "I'm just out for a little jaunt." The next second it was announced that messengers had come from General Feng. For as soon as Feng Ziying heard that the Jia family were celebrating a mass in the abbey he had prepared gifts of pigs, sheep, incense, candles and sweetmeats and had them sent along. The moment Xifeng knew this she hurried over to the main balcony. "Aiya!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands. "I wasn't prepared for this. We just looked on this as an outing, but they've sent offerings under the impression that we're making a serious sacrifice of it. It's all our old lady's fault. Now I shall have to prepare some tips." That same instant up come two stewards' wives from the Feng family. And before they had left more presents arrived from Vice-Minister Zhao, to be followed in quick succession by gifts from all their relatives and friends who had heard that the ladies of the Jia family were holding a service in the abbey. The Lady Dowager began to regret the whole expedition. "This isn't a regular sacrifice," she said. "We just came out for fun, but we've put them to all this trouble." So after watching only one performance she went home that same afternoon and refused to go back the next day. "Why not go the whole hog?" Xifeng reasoned. "Since we've already put everybody out, we may as well amuse ourselves again today." But Baoyu had been sulking ever since Zhang the Taoist broached the subject of his marriage to his grandmother. He was still fulminating against the priest and puzzling other people by muttering "I never want to set eyes on him again." As for Daiyu she had been suffering since her return from a touch of the sun. For these reasons the old lady remained adamant. When Xifeng saw that she would not go, she took some others back with her to the abbey. Baoyu was so worried on Daiyu's account that he would not touch his food and kept going over to find out how she was. Daiyu, for her part, was worried about him. "Why don't you go and see the shows?" she asked. "Why should you stay at home?" The Taoist's officiousness still rankled with Baoyu, and when Daiyu, said this he thought "I could forgive others for not understanding me, but now even she is making fun of me." So his resentment increased a hundredfold. He wouldn't have flared up had it been anyone else, but Daiyu's behaving this way was a different matter. His face clouded over.
But the coats on the drab side. Its not warm enough either. You need one with thicker fur. The mistress gave me this squirrel, and the ermine too, Xiren replied. She promised to give me a fox-fur as well at New Year. Well, I have a fox-fur, but I dont care for the way the fringe hangs and was meaning to have it altered, said Xifeng. You may as well have that for the time being. When the mistress orders a coat for you for New Year, Ill have it made for myself instead. That 11 compensate me for the one Im giving you. Everybody present laughed. We know your way of talking, madam, they said. You give with both hands, the whole year round, privately giving away all sorts of things to make up for the presents that the mistress forgets. Theres really no saying how much youve given. And you never charge the mistress for them, of course. Yet you talk in this stingy way to raise a laugh. How can the mistress remember all these things, which arent important anyway? Xifeng retorted. But if no one saw to them, it would reflect badly on the family and Im quite willing to put my hand in my pocket to keep everyone decently dressed for the sake of my own good name. Im in charge of the household, after all, and if everyone here looked like scarecrows Id be blamed for fitting you out in such a beggarly way. This impressed them all. No one else can hold a candle to you, madam, they said. So considerate as you are to Her Ladyship, and kindness itself to those of us beneath you. Pinger had been sent to fetch Xiren the fox-fur-lined coat of slate- blue silk tapestry with eight circular designs which Xifeng had worn the previous day. Now, seeing that Xirens wrapper was of black and white silk gauze, lined with pink silk, and in it she had only two worn silk-padded jackets and one fur jacket, Xifeng told Pinger to bring her own jade-coloured velvet wrapper with a silk lining, as well as a cape for the snow. Pinger brought two capes, one of worn crimson felt, the other a rather newer one of red satin. One is already too much, Xiren demurred. The felts for you, chuckled Pinger. Ive brought the other at the same time to send to Miss Xiuyan. Yesterday, in that heavy snow, the others were all wearing felt, camlet or satin, and it was really a splendid sight a dozen or so red capes against the snow. She was the only one in a shabby cape, all hunched up with cold, poor thing! So wed better give her this. See the way she gives away my property! cried Xifeng. As if Im not spending enough myself without her help. A fine thing! Its your fault, madam, for being so dutiful to Her Ladyship and so good to us servants, they retorted, smiling. If you were the stingy sort that hoards things up with no consideration for those below you, she wouldnt dare do such a thing. Thats because shes the only one with some inkling of my character, rejoined Xifeng. She told Xiren, Lets hope your mother is better. If not, youll just have to stay there but send me word, and Ill have your bedding sent over. Dont use their bedding or combs. She turned to Mrs. Zhou. You all know our rules, of course. I dont have to remind you. We know, madam, replied Mrs. Zhou. When we get there, well ask the others to keep their distance. If we stay, well insist on a couple of inner rooms. She went out then with Xiren and ordered the servant-boys to light the lanterns. Mounting their carriages, they drove to Hua Zifangs house. Meanwhile Xifeng had summoned two old nannies from Baoyus quarters. Xiren probably wont be back today, she told them. You know which of the older girls have most sense. Get a couple of them to keep watch at night in Baoyus rooms. You must see to things too. Dont let Baoyu run wild. The two nannies assented and left, returning presently to report Weve told Qingwen and Sheyue to attend Master Bao. The four of us will keep watch at night in turn. Xifeng nodded. See that he goes to bed early and gets up early. They promised to do this and went back to the Garden. Before long Zhou Ruis wife sent word that Xirens mother was dying, and Xiren could not come back.
Still, when I was young and your kinsman Mr. Jia Yucun was my tutor, I read a few essays too. Some of them showed good sense, some were quite subtle. Though I didnt altogether understand them, I thought quite highly of them. I dont see how you can condemn them so sweepingly. Besides, If you want an official career, this is the scholarly way to go about it. Baoyu was disgusted by talk of this kind. Daiyu never used to be like this, he reflected. Whats made her so worldly-wise all of a sudden? But not wanting to argue with her, he simply snorted. Just then they heard the voices of Qiuwen and Zijuan outside. Sister Xiren said Id find him in the old ladys place, but instead hes here, said Qiuwen. Weve just made tea, Zijuan told her. Wait till hes drunk it before fetching him back. Then the two of them came in. Ill be coming presently, Baoyu promised Qiuwen. Im sorry you had the trouble of looking for me. When Qiuwen made no answer, Zijuan said, Drink up quickly and go. Theyve been longing for you all day. Shut up, you bitch! cried Qiuwen. Amid general laughter he rose to take his leave, and Daiyu saw him to the door while Zijuan waited at the foot of the steps, not reentering the house until he had gone. Baoyu soon reached Happy Red Court. As he went in, Xiren emerged from the inner room. Is he back? she called out. Long ago, Qiuwen answered. I found the Second Master with Miss Lin. Did anything happen today? Baoyu wanted to know. Nothing much, said Xiren. Only Her Ladyship sent Sister Yuanyang over just now with a message The master has set his mind on your studying hard, and if any maids dare fool about with you theyll be dealt with in the same way as Qingwen and Siqi. After serving you all this time, I must say I find a warning like that uncalled for! She was looking most put out. Good sister, dont worry, he cried. Ill have to study hard so that the mistress doesnt scold you again. In fact, I must do some reading this evening, as tomorrow Ive got to expound texts to the teacher. If I need anything, Sheyue and Qiuwen can attend to it. Youd better go and rest. If youre really going to study hard, well be glad to wait on you, was her reply. Baoyu had a hasty supper, then made them light the lamp so that he could revise the Four Books. But where to start? When he leafed through one volume, the text seemed clear enough yet when he thought it over carefully, he was not too sure of the meaning. He consulted the notes and then the commentaries, until the first watch had sounded. I find poetry very easy, but with this Im getting nowhere, he reflected as he sat there, his mind in a whirl. Go to bed now, urged Xiren You cant digest all that in just one night. When Baoyu mumbled agreement she and Sheyue helped him to bed, then turned in themselves. But Xiren, waking later, heard him still tossing about. Are you still awake? she asked. Stop racking your brains! You must get some rest if youre going to study well tomorrow. I know, but I cant sleep. Will you come and take off one of these quilts for me? Better keep it on its not hot. Well, I feel hectic. He started kicking off one of his quilts. Xiren promptly got up to stop him, and laying one hand on his forehead found it a little hot. Dont move, She coaxed. Youre rather feverish. I know. How come? Dont worry. Its because Im feeling frantic. But dont raise an alarm, or my fathers hound to say Im shamming to get out of going to school or why else should I fall ill now of all times? Ill be well enough to go back to school tomorrow then everything will he all right. Taking pity on him she said, Ill come and sleep with you. She massaged his back for a while, then they both dozed off, not waking until the sun was high in the sky. Confound it, Ive overslept! exclaimed Baoyu. He hastily dressed, paid his respects to his elders and hurried to school. Already the teacher was glowering. No wonder your father is angry and calls you good-for-nothing you start slacking on your second day at school! What time is it now? Baoyu excused himself by explaining about his feverish night, then settled down again to study.
Theyre all been driven away. She ordered the attendants, In future dont let Lin Zhixiaos wife into the Garden. And never mention the name Lin again. Mind you all do as I say like good children. Suppressing their smiles at this, the others assented. Baoyus eye now fell on a golden boat with an engine, a toy from the West, which was on his cabinet. Isnt that the boat coming to fetch them? he shouted, pointing at it. Its mooring there. The Lady Dowager ordered its instant removal, and when Baoyu reached out for it Xiren gave it to him. He tucked it under his bedding. Now they wont be able to sail away, he laughed. Seizing tight hold of Zijuan he refused to let her go. At this point Doctor Wang was announced, and the old lady ordered him to be brought straight in. Lady Wang, Aunt Xue and Baochai withdrew to the inner room while the Lady Dowager seated herself by Baoyu. When Doctor Wang found such a company assembled, he paid his respects to the Lady Dowager before taking Baoyus hand to feel his pulse, while Zijuan had to stand there with lowered head, to the doctors astonishment. Presently the doctor rose and declared, The trouble with our honourable brother is that some sharp distress has clouded his mind. According to the ancients, Disorders of the phlegm take different forms indigestion owing to a weak constitution, derangement brought on by a sudden fit of anger, and obstruction caused by sudden distress. This is a disorder of the third kind. It is only a temporary blockage, however, less serious than the other types. Just tell us if hes in danger or not. urged the Lady Dowager. Who wants to hear this recital of medical lore? Doctor Wang bowed. He is in no danger, no. Is that really true? she persisted. There is really no danger, madam, I give you my word. In that case, please take a seat in the outer room to make out your prescription. If you cure him, I shall prepare presents to show my gratitude and send him to kowtow to you in person. If you delay his recovery, though, I shall send to tear down the main hall of your Academy of Imperial Physicians! The doctor bowed again. You are too good, too good! For he had heard only the first part of her speech and not the jocular threat with which it concluded. He went on protesting his unworthiness until the old lady and all the rest burst out laughing. When the medicine had been prepared according to the prescription and Baoyu had taken it, he did indeed calm down a little. He still refused to let go of Zijuan, however. If she leaves here, theyll go back to Suzhou! he cried. The Lady Dowager and Lady Wang had perforce to let Zijuan stay there. They dispatched Hupo in her place to look after Daiyu, who from time to time sent Xueyan over to ask for news and was deeply moved when she learned all that had happened. As everyone knew how cranky Baoyu was, and how close he and Daiyu had been since they were children, they took Zijuans joke as quite natural and his illness as nothing out of the way either, not suspecting anything else. That evening, as Baoyu was quieter, his grandmother and mother returned to their own quarters but sent several times during the night for reports from the sickroom. Nanny Li, Mrs. Song and some other matrons nursed the patient devotedly, while Zijuan, Xiren and Qingwen watched day and night by his bedside. Whenever he slept he had nightmares, and would wake up crying that Daiyu had gone or that people had come to fetch her. Each time this happened Zijuan had to comfort him. Now his grandmother had Baoyu given all sorts of rare medicine-pills to dispel evil influences and powders to clear the mind. And the next day, after more of Doctor Wangs medicine, his condition gradually improved but although he was in his right senses again, he pretended from time to time to be delirious in order to keep Zijuan with him. As for her, thoroughly repenting the mischief she had caused she served him day and night without a murmur. Xiren, herself once more, told her, As youre the one to blame for this, its up to you to cure him. Ive never seen such a simpleton as our young master, the way he catches at shadows. Whats to become of him? But enough of this. By now Xiangyun was better, and she came every day to see Baoyu. Finding that he had recovered his faculties she mimicked his crazy behaviour during his illness until, lying on his pillow, he had to laugh.
At any rate I heard it all last night. So my line is The north wind blew hard all night. Will that do? The others exchanged smiling glances. It may be crude but it doesnt show what is to follow, and thats the proper way to start a poem, was their verdict. So besides being good, it leaves plenty of scope for the others. Lets start with this line. Hurry up and write it down, Old Peasant of Sweet Paddy, then complete the couplet and begin a new one. Xifeng, Aunt Li and Pinger drank a few more cups of wine with them, then went off on their own business. Meanwhile Li Wan wrote -355 Xifeng -732 The north wind blew hard all night After this she went on to write down the following lines composed by herself and others -355 Li Wan The door opens on a flurry of snow. Pity the pure white mingling with the mud.... -355 Xiangling Jade scattered on the earth below. Fain would it revive the dead grass -355 Tanchun But no veil on withered plants throw. The village brew, matured, is costly now -355 Li Chi With a good crop the granaries overflow. Ash flying from the pipe shows the change of season. Li Wen The Dipper turns and longer the nights grow. Cold hills have lost their vivid green -355 Xiuyan In frozen creeks no tide is heard to flow. The snow hangs lightly on sparse willow boughs. -355 Xiangyun But slides off tattered plantain leaves drooped low. Musk-ink is melted in the precious tripod -355 Baoqin Rich sables hide the silken sleeves below. Brightness the mirror by the window catches -355 Daiyu Scent clings to walls with pepper dye aglow. A side wind blows and blows incessantly -355 Baoyu While the clear dream lingers slow. Whence comes the sound of the plum-blossom flute 7 -355 Baochai Who is it that on green jade pipe doth blow? The giant turtle fears the earth may sink Li Wan interposed at this point, Ill go and see about getting some wine heated for you. Baochai urged Baoqin to go on but before she could do so, Xiangyun stood up boisterously. -355 Xiangyun Dragons fight, the cloud-wrack billows to and fro. A lone boat puts back to the lonely shore.... Baoqin, standing up too, continued -355 Baoqin A whip points at the bridge, the poet must go. Fur coats are issued to the garrison.... Xiangyun could never bear to take second place. And being more quick-witted than the others, arching her eyebrows now she straightened up and declaimed -355 Xiangyun Cotton-padded clothes to conscripts in the snow. Hard the going through gullies and hills.... Well done! cried Baochai, and continued -355 Baochai They must not shake the branches hanging low. Soft and gleaming swirls the snow.... Daiyu cut in -355 Daiyu In swaying dance, now swift, now slow. Fresh taros are steamed for a treat.... She nudged Baoyu, but he was too intent on watching Baoqin, Baochai and Daiyu compete against Xiangyun to be bothered to join in himself. Prompted by Daiyu, however, he improvised -355 Baoyu To scattered salt the song compares the snow. The boatman is fishing still in his coir cape.... Youre no good! cried Xiangyun with a laugh. Keep out of this. Youre only holding us up. Baoqin took over. -355 Baoqin -1511 Silent the woodmans axe, unheard each blow. Hill after hill like crouching elephants.... Xiangyun struck in -355 Xiangyun A single snake-like path winds to and fro. Congealed by cold these flowers of ice.... As Baochai and the others exclaimed in admiration, Tanchun went on -355 Tanchun Beauty no frost can blight or overthrow. In the deep courtyard chilly sparrows take fright.... As Xiangyun was thirstily gulping down some tea, Xiuyan took this chance to join in. -355 Xiuyan In lonely hills an old owl hoots its woe. Snow dances up and down the courtyard steps.... Xiangyun hastily put down her cup to interject -355 Xiangyun Drifts at will on the lake below. Glittering bright in dawns clear light.... -355 Daiyu Setting the whole night aglow. Truly the cold of three feet of snow is forgotten.... Xiangyun hastily continued -355 Xiangyun Its promise clears the sovereigns gloomy brow.
I may as wall walk to loosen up my old bones. Jia She and Jia Zheng led the way, followed by two old nurses with horn-lanterns. Yuanyang, Hupo and Madam You kept beside the old lady to help her along while Lady Xing and the rest clustered behind, and a mere hundred paces brought them to the summit on which stood Convex Emerald Hall, so called because it was built on a promontory. On its front terrace, partitioned into two by a large screen, were tables and chairs all round in shape to symbolize perfect reunion. The old lady took the centre seat with Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong on her left, on her right ha Zheng, Baoyu, Jia Huan and Jia Lan. The circle, however, was only half complete, the other half being conspicuously vacant. I dont usually feel there are too few of us, yet tonight I do, observed the old lady. Why, in the old days, on an evening like this thered have been thirty to forty menfolk and womenfolk and it would have been ever so lively. This is too small a party. We cant ask others to join us, as theyre all celebrating at home with their own parents, so lets get some of the girls to fill up the gap on the other side. Yingchitn, Tanchun and Xichun were fetched, and Jia Lian, Baoyu and the other boys stood up to offer them seats, taking lower places themselves. Then the Lady Dowager called for a twig of osmanthus and ordered a serving-woman to beat a drum on the other side of the screen as the twig passed from hand to hand. Whoever had it when the drumming stopped had to drink a cup of wine and tell a joke as forfeit. The game started with the old lady passing the twig to Jia She, and so on in turn. After two rounds Jia Zheng was left with it in his hand and had to drink up, while his children, nephews and nieces nudged or tugged at each other meaningly as they waited, smiling, to hear what joke he would tell. As his mother was in high spirits he felt constrained to do his best to please her. If you cant make us laugh, she warned, we shall punish you by making you tell another. 1 have only the one joke, madam. If you dont find it funny Ill accept the penalty... .There was a man who was hen-pecked.... He was interrupted here by a burst of laughter, as Jia Zheng had never told jokes of this type before. This must be a good one, said the old lady, laughing. If you think it good, you must drink another cup, madam. Agreed. He went on, This hen-pecked husband never dared go anywhere without his wifes permission. But on the Moon Festival, going out to do some shopping, he met friends who dragged him home to drink with them. He got drunk and slept in their house. The next day when he woke up, quite conscience-stricken, he had to go home to apologize. It happened that his wife was washing her feet. She said to him, Well, if you lick my feet Ill forgive you. So the man had to lick her feet. But he couldnt help retching, and this so enraged his wife that she threatened to beat him. What insolence! she cried. He fell on his knees in fright and explained, Its not that your feet stink, madam, but all the rice-wine and mooncakes I had yesterday have turned my stomach today. The whole company laughed, and Jia Zheng at once poured a cup of wine for the old lady. If thats how you feel, lets replace this wine with spirits, she proposed. We dont want you to be sick. Amid general mirth the drumming started once more, stopping this time when Baoyu had the osmanthus. His fathers presence made him feel on edge, but here he was caught with the twig in his hand. If I fail to tell a good joke Ill be scolded for being too stupid even to tell a joke, he thought. If I tell an amusing one hell say Im no good at studying, only able to gab, and blame me all the more. So Id better get out of it. He stood up and pleaded, Im no good at telling jokes. Please set me some other forfeit. Well then, said Jia Zheng, write an occasional poem with autumn as the rhyme. If its good youll get a reward. If not, look out tomorrow! Were just playing a drinking game, objected the old lady. Why make him write a poem?
This is truly fantastic!" "Let's not talk about him," said Jia Zheng. "My brother should never have agreed to that match. My niece has already paid dearly for his stake, and now her husband has started dunning me!" As they were talking Xue Ke brought back the news, "Commissioner Zhao of the Imperial Guards insists on pressing the charges made by the censors. I'm afraid things look black for the Elder Master and for Master Zhen." "You must go and beg the princes to intervene, sir," Jia Zheng's friends urged hirn. "Otherwise both your families will be ruined." He agreed and thanked them, after which they dispersed. It was already time to light the lamps. Jia Zheng went inside to pay his respects to his mother and found her better. Returning to his own quarters, he brooded resentfully over the folly of Jia Lian and his wife, whose usury now that it had come to light had landed the whole family in trouble. He was most put out by this disclosure of Xifeng's misdoings. But ince she was so ill and must be distraught too by the loss of all her possesions, he could hardly reprimand them for the time being. Thus the night passed without further incident. The next morning Jia Zheng went to court to express his gratitude for the Imperial favour, then called on both princes to kowtow his thanks and beg them to intervene on behalf of his brother and nephew. After they had agreed to do this, he went to enlist the help of other colleagues. Let us returil to Jia Lian. Unable to extricate his father and cousin from the straits they were in, he returned home. He found Pinger sitting weeping by Xifeng, who was being abused by Qiutong in the side-room. ha Lian walked over to Xifeng, but as she seemed at her last gasp he had to hold back his reproaches. "What's done is done," sobbed Pinger. "We can't get back what we've lost. But the mistress is so ill, you must send for a doctor for her." "Pah!" spat out Jia Lian. "My own life is still at stake why should I care about her?" At this Xifeng opened her eyes and, without a word, shed tears. As Soon as Jia Lia had left she said to Pinger, "Stop being so dense. Now that things have come to this pass, why worry about me? I only wish I could die this very minute! If you have any feeling for me, just bring up Qiaojier after my death and I shall be grateful to you in the nether regions!" This only made Pinger sob more bitterly. "You've sense enough to see," Xifeng continued, "that even if they haven't come to complain he must hold me to blame. Though the trouble was sparked off outside, if I hadn't been greedy for money I'd have been in the clear. Now after scheming so hard arid trying all my life to get ahead, I've ended up worse off than anyone else! If only I hadn't trusted the wrong people! I heard something vaguely too about Master Zhen's trouble and how he abducted the wife of an honest citizen named Zhang to be his concubine, forcing her to kill herself rather than submit. Well, we know, don't we, who that fellow Zhang was? If that business comes out, Master Lian will be involved too and I shall lose face completely. I'd like to die this instant, but I haven't the courage to swallow gold or take poison. And here you are talking of getting a doctor for me! That's not doing me a kindness but a bad turn." This upset Pinger even more. She was at her wit's end. For fear that Xifeng might try to take her own life, she kept a close watch over her. Luckily the Lady Dowager was ignorant of these developments. Now that her health was improving, she was relieved that Jia Zheng had kept out of trouble and Baoyu and Baochai stayed by her side every day. As Xifeng had been her favourite she told Yuanyang, "Give some of my things to Xifeng, and take Pinger some money so that she can look after her well. Once she's better I'll see what else can be done for her." She also told Lady Wang to help Lady Xing. Since the whole estate of the Ning Mansion had been confiscated, all its bondservants registered and taken away, the Lady Dowager sent carriages to fetch Madam You and her daughter-in-law over. Alas for the Ning Mansion, once so grand! All that remained of it was these two ladies and the concubines Peifeng and Xieluan, without a single servant.
As your worthy son just remarked. An old quotation beats an original saying. The ancients have already supplied the most fitting name Apricot Village. Jia Zheng turned with a smile to Jia Zhen, saying, That reminds me. This place is perfect in every other respect, but it still lacks a tavern-sign. You must have one made tomorrow. Nothing too grand. Just a tavern-sign of the sort used in country places. Let it be hung on a bamboo pole from a tree-top. Jia Zhen readily agreed to this, then suggested, Other birds would be out of place here, but we ought to have some geese, ducks, hens and so on. When this proposal had met with general approval, Jia Zheng observed, Apricot Village is first-rate, but since it is the name of a real place we should have to get official permission to use it. True, agreed the other. We shall have to think of something else. What shall it be? Without giving them time to think or waiting to be asked by his father, Baoyu blurted out, An old poem has the line, Above flowering apricot hangs a tavern-sign. Why not call this Approach to Apricot Tavern? Approach is superb, they cried. It suggests the idea of Apricot Village too. Apricot Village would be too vulgar a name. Baoyu smiled scornfully. But an old poet wrote A wicker gate by a stream sweet with paddy. How about Paddy-Sweet Cottage? Again the secretaries clapped in approbation but his father sternly silenced him. Ignorant cub! How many ancient writers have you read and how many old poems have you memorized that you dare show off in front of your elders? I put up with your nonsense just now to test you in. fun dont take it seriously. With that he led the party into one of the cottages. It was quite free of ostentation, having papered windows and a wooden couch. Secretly pleased, he glanced at his son and asked, Well, what do you think of this place? The secretaries nudged the boy to induce him to express approval. But ignoring them he answered, It cant compare with Where the Phoenix Alights. Ignorant dolt! Jia Zheng sighed. All you care for are red pavilions and painted beams. With your perverse taste for luxury, how can you appreciate the natural beauty of such a quiet retreat? This comes of neglecting your studies. Yes sir, replied Baoyu promptly. But the ancients were always using the term natural. I wonder what they really meant by it? Afraid his pig-headedness would lead to trouble, the others hastily put in, You understand everything else so well, why ask about the term natural? It means coming from nature, not due to human effort. There you are! A farm here is obviously artificial and out of place with no villages in the distance, no fields near by, no mountain ranges behind, no source for the stream at hand, above, no pagoda from any half hidden temple, below, no bridge leading to a market. Perched here in isolation, it is nothing like as fine a sight as those other places which were less far-fetched. The bamboos and streams there didnt look so artificial. What the ancients called a natural picture means precisely that when you insist on an unsuitable site and hills where no hills should be, however skilfully you go about it the result is bound to jar.... Clear off! thundered Jia Zheng. Stop. Come back. Make up another couplet. If its no good Ill slap your face on both accounts. Baoyu had to comply. He declaimed -763 The green tide fills the creek where clothes are washed Clouds of fragrance surround the girls plucking water-cress. Worse and worse, growled Jia Zheng, shaking his head as he led the company out. The path now curved around a slope, past flowers and willows, rocks and springs, a trellis of yellow roses, an arbour of white ones, a tree-peony pavilion, a white peony plot, a court of rambler roses and a bank of plantains. Suddenly they heard the plash of a spring gushing from a cave overhung by vines, and saw fallen blossoms floating on the water below. As they cried out in delight, Jia Zheng asked them to suggest another inscription. What more apt than The Spring of Wuling? said one. Too hackneyed. Besides, its also the name of a real place, objected Jia Zheng with a smile. Then how about The Refuge of a Man of Qin? Even more impossible, cried Baoyu. How can we use something that implies taking refuge in time of trouble?
Ive been with you for half a year and Im with child, but dont know whether it will be a boy or a girl. If Heaven has pity and the child is born, well and good. Otherwise, I shant be able to save myself, let alone the child. Dont you worry, Jia Lian, in tears himself, reassured her. Ill get a good doctor for you. He immediately went out to send for the doctor. However, Doctor Wang was busy maneuvering to get a post in the army in order to acquire a noble title for his offspring. In his absence the servants fetched Doctor Hu Junrong. His diagnosis was that her menstruation was irregular and some tonic would set her right. When Jia Lian told him that she had missed three periods and was often sick, so it looked like a pregnancy, Hu Junrong asked the serving-women to show him the ladys hand, and Second Sister stretched our her hand from behind the curtains. After feeling the pulse for some time he declared If it were a pregnancy, the liver humour should be strong. But the wood is in the ascendant, and that engenders the fire element which causes irregular menstruation. May I make so bold as to ask to have a glimpse of the ladys face, so that I can see how she looks before venturing to make out a prescription. Jia Lian had to order the curtain to be raised. But the sight of Second Sister robbed Hu Junrong of his senses. He was too dazed to know what he was doing. Then the curtain was lowered and Jia Lian escorted him out. Asked what the trouble was he said Its not a pregnancy, just congestion of the blood. To make her periods normal, we must get rid of the congestion. He then wrote a prescription and took his leave. Jia Lian ordered servants to send over the doctors fee and buy and prepare the medicine for the patient. In the middle of the night, Second Sister had such a pain in her stomach that she miscarried the foetus was male and bled so copiously that she fainted. Jia Lian hearing this cursed Hu Junrong and had another doctor fetched at once. He also sent men to go and beat up Hu but the latter heard of this in time to bundle together his things and run away. The newly summoned doctor said, She had a weak constitution to begin with, and after conceiving she seems to have been bottling up some resentment. That other gentleman made the mistake of using potent drugs which have undermined the ladys health completely. We cannot look for a speedy recovery. She will have to take both potions and pills, and must pay no attention to any malicious gossip then we can only hope she may get well. This said, he left. In a frenzy, Jia Lian asked who it was that had fetched that fellow Hu and had the man beaten within an inch of his life. Xifeng showing ten times more anxiety exclaimed, We seem fated to have no son! After going to such trouble to beget one, we come up against this bungling quack. She offered incense and kowtowed to Heaven and Earth, praying earnestly, Let me fall ill if only Sister You can recover, conceive again and give birth to a boy. Then Ill gladly fast and chant sutras for the rest of my life. Jia Lian and the others, seeing this, could not but praise her. While Jia Lian stayed with Qiutong, Xifeng prepared soup and broth for the invalid. She also berated Pinger, Youre just as luckless as me with my illness, because youre not ill, just barren! It must be our bad luck thats brought the Second Mistress to this pass or may be someones horoscope clashes with hers. Thereupon she sent out to consult fortune-tellers, who returned the reply that the trouble had been caused by a woman born in the year of the rabbit. They checked, and as Qiutong was the only one in their household born in that year they laid the blame at her door. Qiutongs jealousy had already been aroused by the care Jia Lian lavished on Second Sister, fetching doctors, giving her medicine, and having the servant who had blundered beater. Now she was told that she was the one to blame, and Xifeng advised her to move out for a few months and make herself scarce. Qiutong wept and stormed, Whats all this senseless talk from that blind rascal? I kept clear of her as well water and river water. How could my horoscope clash with hers? She had all sorts of contacts outside, the slut. Why does the jinx have to be found here? Which of all those fine fellows she knew got her with child? Its only this credulous master of ours whos taken in by her.
Thats the idea, said Jia Zheng. Actually, a short account has already been written. The other day an Imperial Decree was issued ordering a search to be made for all those who should have been commended but were left out of past records, whether monks, nuns, beggars or women, as long as they had performed some worthy deed. The ac- 2393 counts were to be sent to the Board of Rites for the Emperors approval. So this account was sent to the Board of Rites. And after hearing this story, you should all write a poem on the Lovely Generals loyalty and sense of honour. So we should, they all agreed, laughing. And whats still more admirable is the fact that our dynasty is showing such unprecedented kindness, unmatched in earlier times. The men of Tang said, Our sagacious court overlooks nothing, and this has come true today. Our dynasty lives up to this prediction. Jia Zheng nodded. Exactly. As they were speaking, Huan and Lan arrived, and Jia Zheng told them to look at the subject. Though both of them, like Baoyu, could write poetry, this was not their special line. When it came to writing examination papers, Huan and Lan might surpass Baoyu but when it came to literature in general, they were much inferior. Besides, they lacked Baoyus literary brilliance and poetic flair. Thus the poems they wrote were like eight-section essays, inevitably stereotyped and pedantic. Baoyu, though not to be reckoned a good scholar, had innate intelligence and loved to browse on literature of all kinds. He believed that some ancient classics were apocryphal and contained errors too, thus they should not be taken for gospel moreover, if one had too many scruples and just stuck together phrases from old books, such writing would be most uninteresting. These being his views, when he saw a subject for poetry whether difficult or easy he would write on it effortlessly, just as glib talkers having nothing to go on rely on their ready tongues to hold forth at random, spinning lengthy yarns which though they have no basis in fact delight all those who hear them. Even strict sticklers for the truth cannot beat such entertaining fantasies. Jia Zheng, growing old now, no longer hankered after fame and profit besides, by temperament, he was fond of poetry, wine and liberal talk. Although he felt constrained to guide his sons and nephews along the right path, when he saw that Baoyu albeit not fond of study had some understanding of poetry, he decided that this did not really disgrace their ancestors for they themselves, he recalled, had been the same and though 2395 working hard for the examinations had never distinguished themselves apparently this was the Jia familys destiny. Moreover, his mother doted on this grandson. So Jia Zheng did not insist too much on Baoyu working for the examinations and had recently treated him more leniently. And he wished that Huan and Lan, apart from writing eight-section essays, would follow Baoyus example. This was why, whenever they were composing poetry, he would summon all three boys together to write. But enough of this. Now Jia Zheng told them to write a poem apiece, promising the reward to one who finished first and to give an additional prize for the best poem. As Huan and Lan had recently written several poems in company, they no longer lacked confidence. After reading the topic, they went off to think it over. Before long, Lan was the first one to finish. And Huan, afraid to be left behind, finished his too. By the time both had copied their verses out, Baoyu was still lost in thought. Jia Zheng and his secretaries read the two younger boys verses. Lans heptasyllabic quatrain read as follows -763 Fourth Mistress Lin, Lovely General, Had jade-like beauty but an iron will Because she gave her life to requite Prince Heng Today the soil of her district is fragrant still. The secretaries said admiringly, When a boy of thirteen can write like this, it truly shows the influence of a scholarly family. Jia Zheng smiled. The language is childish, but its quite a good effort. Then they read Huans eight-line pentameter, which was as follows -763 Fair young ladies know no sorrow, But a general has no relief Wiping her tears she left her broidered hangings And took the battlefield, her heart filled with grief. -6024 She wanted to requite the princes kindness Who else would wreak vengeance on the enemy. -763 Let us, at her grave, eulogize her loyalty And her eternal, peerless gallantry. This is even better! the secretaries exclaimed. Being a few years 2397 older after all, he is more original. Its not too bad, said Jia Zheng, but it still lacks real feeling.
The thing is to die for good reasons. Those vulgar sods believe that ministers who die for remonstrating with the Emperor and generals who die in battle win immortal fame as fine, upright men -- but wouldn't it be better if they didn't die? After all, there has to be a despot on the throne before ministers can remonstrate but they court death in their eagerness to make a name, with a complete disregard for their sovereign. In the same way, there has to be a war before generals can die in battle so they fight recklessly and try to win glory by dying, with no thought of the country's welfare. That's why I say these aren't worthy deaths." "Loyal ministers and good generals only die when it's necessary, countered Xiren. "If a foolhardy general has no idea of strategy and gets killed through incompetence, is that necessary? Civil officials are even worse. They learn by heart a few passages from books and if the government has the slightest fault they remonstrate at random, in the hope of winning fame as loyal men. If they court death in a fit of temper, is that necessary too? They should know that the sovereign receives his mandate from Heaven. Heaven wouldn't entrust such an onerous task to anyone but a benevolent sage. So, you see, they die to win a reputation, not for the sake of noble principles. "In my own case, if I had any luck I should die now with all of you around me still better if your tears for me were to become a great stream and float my corpse away to some quiet spot deserted even by crows or any other birds, to vanish with the wind, never again to be born as a human being. That's how I should like to die." To cut short such wild talk Xiren said she was tired and gave up answering him. Then Baoyu closed his own eyes and went to sleep. Nor did he revert to the subject the next day. That day, bored with the Garden, Baoyu recalled some songs in The Peony Pavilion and read through the libretto twice. Still not satisfied, he decided to look for Lingguan who played the part of young ladies and was said to be the best singer among the twelve young actresses in Pear Fragrance Court. So he went out through the side gate in search of her. Baoguan and Yuguan, whom he found in the courtyard there, greeted him pleasantly and invited him in. "Where is Lingguan?" he asked. "In her room," they told him. He hurried in and found her lying alone on her bed, and she did not move when she saw him. Used as he was to playing about with girls, he imagined Lingguan would respond like all the others so he sat down beside her and with a coaxing smile begged her to get up and sing for him the passage describing the visit to the garden. To his surprise she sat up and moved away. "I've strained my voice," she said gravely. "I didn't even sing the last time Her Imperial Highness sent for us. Now that she had sat up, Baoyu saw she was the girl who had written Qiang at the foot of the rose trellis. Never before had he been snubbed like this. His cheeks burning, he left the room. And when Baoguan and the others asked what the matter was, he told them. "Just wait a bit till Master Qiang comes," advised Baoguan. "If he asks her to sing, she will." "Where is he?" asked Baoyu, rather puzzled by this. "He's just gone out. Lingguan must have taken a fancy to something and he's out trying to procure it for her." Baoyu waited, mystified, until Jia Qiang arrived with a bird-cage containing a bird and a miniature stage. He strode in cheerfully, eager to see Lingguan, but halted at sight of his uncle. "What sort of bird is that," inquired Baoyu, "able to hold a flag in its beak and walk round the stage?" "It's a jade-crested oriole," Jia Qiang told him. "How much did you give for it?" "One tael, eighty cents." Urging Baoyu to sit a while, he went in to see Lingguan. By now Baoyu no longer wanted to hear her sing but was curious to know her relationship to Jia Qiang, who had walked in gaily calling out "Get up and look at this!" "What is it?" Lingguan raised herself on one elbow. "I've brought you a bird to stop you feeling so bored. Let me show you how to put it through its tricks." Holding out a few seeds, he coaxed the bird to pick up a mask and flag and strut round the stage.
Lowering his head, he advanced to pay his respects. The Lady Dowager saw from his robes of the sixth official rank that this was one of the Imperial physicians. With a smile she greeted him, then asked Jia Zhen What is this gentlemans honourable name? Wang. In the old days, she said, the director of the Academy of Imperial Physicians. Wang Junxiao, was an excellent diagnostician. Wang bowed and, his head lowered, rejoined with a smile, He was my great-uncle. So our families are old friends. With these words she slowly placed one hand on the cushion. An old nurse put a low stool slightly to one side of the table and Doctor Wang, sitting respectfully on the edge of the stool, bent one knee to lean over the couch. He felt both her pulses in turn for some length of time, his head inclined meditatively, after which he rose with a bow, his head lowered, to take his leave. Thank you for your trouble, said the Lady Dowager. Zhen, take the doctor to the study and see that he gets some tea. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, quick to obey her instructions, conducted the doctor to the study outside. There he told them, There is nothing wrong with the old lady except a slight chill. She need not take any medicine. A light diet and keeping warm will put her right. However, Ill make out a prescription and if she likes the old lady can take one dose. If she feels disinclined, its of no consequence. He sipped some tea then and wrote out the prescription. Just as he was about to leave, Dajies nurse carried her in and asked with a smile Will Doctor Wang look at us too? The doctor at once stood up. Supporting the childs hand with his own left hand as she nestled in the nurses arms, with his right hand he felt her pulse. Then he felt her forehead and made her show him her tongue. This young lady may scold me for what Im going to say, he told them with a smile. She will be all right if she just goes without two meals. Theres no need to dose her with medicine. Ill bring some pills for her to take dissolved in ginger-water before sleeping. With that he left, seen off by Jia Zhen and the others. They went back to report his diagnosis to the Lady Dowager, then laid the prescription on her desk and withdrew. Lady Wang and the younger women and girls had emerged from behind the screen once the doctor had gone, and Lady Wang sat there a little longer before returning to her own apartments. When Granny Liu knew that the old lady was free, she came in to say goodbye. The Lady Dowager urged her to come again and told Yuanyang See Granny Liu out. Im not well enough to see her off myself. Then with final thanks Granny Liu took her leave and withdrew with Yuanyang to the maids room. Yuanyang pointed at a bundle on the kang. Those are two sets of clothes given to the old lady on previous birthdays, she said. She never wears anything made outside, and its a pity to keep them stored away, but shes never once put them on. Yesterday she told me to choose two sets for you to take back you can either give them away or wear them at home. In this hamper are the pastries you asked for. In this packet the medicines plum-blossom powder, purple -gold pills, tonic for the blood and restorative pills, each kind wrapped up with directions for its use. Here are two embroidered pouches you can wear for fun. She loosened the strings of these and took out two silver ingots. Showing her the device May your wishes come true, she suggested with a smile, You take the pouches, granny, and leave these to me. Granny Liu, in such raptures already that she had invoked Buddha several hundred times, at once agreed, Of course, you keep them, miss. Yuanyang smiled to see that the old woman thought her in earnest. Replacing the ingots she said, I was only teasing. Ive plenty of these. Keep them to give the children at New Year. And now a young maid stepped forward to hand Granny Liu a porcelain bowl made in the Cheng Hua period. This is a present from Master Bao, she announced. Well, imagine that! cried Granny Liu, taking the bowl. I must have done good deeds in some past life to have all this happen today. Those clothes you changed into when I asked you to have a bath the other day were mine, Yuanyang told her. If theyre any use to you keep them, and here are a few others. As Granny Liu hastily thanked her, she produced two more sets of clothing and wrapped them up for her.
Im sorry I misjudged you. Well, as this is the case, youve nothing to worry about. You can come whenever you like and I wont pester you. Feeling very relieved he got up and straightened his clothes. Good sister, please take good care of her for a couple of days, he urged her. I must be off now. He went out then to say goodbye to Qingwen. Both were reluctant to part, but part they must and knowing how hard he found it, she covered her face with the quilt and ignored him until he left. Baoyu had wanted to call on Fangguan and Sier too, but as it was dark and he had been out for some time he was afraid he would be missed and a search might be made for him, leading to more trouble. He had better return to the Garden and go out again the next day. When he reached the back gate, pages were bringing out bedding while nurses inside were checking up on people. A minute later and he would have been locked out. Luckily he was able to slip in unobserved. Home again, he simply told Xiren that he had been with Aunt Xue and left it at that. Presently when preparing his bed, she had to ask him how they should sleep that night. Any way you like, was his answer. Now for the last couple of years, since Xiren got into the good books of Lady Wang, she had begun to stand on her dignity and broken off her intimacy with Baoyu even in private or at night, behaving more distantly than when they were young. And though she had no major business to attend to, all the needlework of the household, as well as the accounts and seeing to the clothing and shoes of Baoyu and the young maids kept her fully occupied. Moreover, though she no longer suffered from flux-ions, when she was tired or caught cold she sometimes coughed blood and for this reason she had avoided sleeping in the same room as Baoyu. However, he often woke up in the night and being very timid would always call for someone so Qingwen, who was a light sleeper and soft-footed, had been given the task of pouring him tea and attending him at night and had slept on a bed near his. Now Xiren had to ask who should sleep on the bed near his, as she considered this work at night more important than any daytime tasks. Told to do as she thought fit, she could only move in her own bedding to sleep in Baoyus room as in the old days. That evening he was lost in thought. Finally she persuaded him to go to bed, but after she and the others had turned in she heard him groaning and tossing about in bed till after midnight, when finally he calmed down and started snoring. In relief she dozed off herself, but in less time than it takes to drink half a cup of tea he called for Qingwen. Xiren woke with a start and asked what he wanted. Some tea, he said. She got up, rinsed her hands in a basin of water, then poured him half a cup from the warm pot. After sipping some tea Baoyu said with an apologetic smile, Im so used to calling her, I forgot it was you. You were used to calling me in your sleep when she first took over. It took you months to get out of the habit. So I knew that though Qingwens gone her name would still be on your lips. They lay down again. Baoyu tossed and turned for another hour or two, not falling asleep till the fifth watch. Then he saw Qingwen come in, looking her usual self. Having entered the room, she told him with a smile Take good care of yourselves. I must leave you now. With that she turned and vanished. Baoyu called her, waking Xiren again. She thought it was another slip of the tongue, but he sobbed Qingwen is dead! What a thing to say! How could you know? Dont let other people hear you talk such nonsense. Baoyu insisted that he was right and could hardly wait till dawn to send to find out. Just at daybreak, however, a young maid sent by Lady Wang came to the Garden and called out asking to have the front side gate opened, as the mistress had instructions to be passed on. Baoyu must wash and dress quickly! she cried. The master has been invited out to enjoy the autumn scenery and the osmanthus in bloom. He is pleased with Baoyu because he wrote a good poem the other day, so he means to take him along. Thats what Her Ladyship said, so dont get a word wrong. Hrry up and tell him to come as fast as he can. The masters waiting in the principal apartments for the boys to come and have breakfast.
If they are really in earnest they can come and, in my presence, pay their respects to you now as their Mothers Superior. The three foster-mothers fetched the three girls, and Lady Wang sounded them out carefully. As their minds were made up, they kowtowed to the two abbesses and then to Lady Wang by way of farewell. Seeing that they were determined and not to be dissuaded, she could not help feeling a pang of pity and sent for gifts for them as well as for the abbesses. Then Fangguan went off with Zhitong of Water Moon Convent, and the other two erstwhile actresses with Yuanxin of Ksitigarbha Nunnery. To know what followed, read on. Chapter 78 An Old Scholar at Leisure Has Eulogies Composed His Unorthodox, Witless Son Laments the Hibiscus After the two abbesses had taken the young actresses away, Lady Wang called to pay her morning respects to the Lady Dowager. And finding her in a good mood she reported Baoyus maid Qingwen has grown up row, and this last year or so shes kept falling ill. Ive noticed too that shes saucier and lazier than the others. Recently she was ill again for over ten days, and the doctor diagnosed it as consumption so then and there I dismissed her with instructions not to come back when shes better, giving her to her family to marry off. I also took it on myself to send away those few young actresses. Because, on account of their theatrical training, they talked in a wild way we dont want our girls to hear and as they performed for us here for a time, it wouldnt have been right to ask for money for them. In any case, we have too many maids. If we need more in future, we can always pick a few others. Quite right and proper. The old lady nodded approval. Exactly what I had in mind myself. But I always thought Qingwen a very nice girl. How could she have turned out so badly? She struck me as smarter than the other maids, with a ready tongue too and better at needlework the best choice as a concubine for Baoyu in future. Who could have dreamed that shed change for the worse? You made the right choice, madam, only she wasnt fated to have such good fortune. Thats why she contracted this illness. As the saying goes, A girl changes eighteen times before reaching womanhood. And the smarter the girl, the more out of hand shell get. You must have seen many such cases. Three years ago when I thought about this question too, she was my first choice. No ones a match for her in other ways, its just that shes 2373 a bit flighty. For steadiness and propriety, Xiren comes first. Though whats wanted in a wife is virtue, they say, and in a concubine beauty, still its better to choose a girl with a sweet disposition and steady character. Xiren may not be up to Qingwen in looks, yet shes the best for Baoyus chamber. Trustworthy, too, and honest. These last few years shes never once led Baoyu into mischief. In fact, whenever he does wrong she tries her best to dissuade him after watching her for two years I know this for certain. Thats why I secretly stopped her pay as a maid and gave her two taels a month from my own allowance, so that shed understand and look after him even better. I didnt make it public for two reasons partly because Baoyus young, and if his father knew of this he might think it bad for his studies partly because if she was known to be his concubine she wouldnt dare gainsay him, and Baoyu would carry on more wildly than ever. This is why I didnt report it to you earlier. The Lady Dowager smiled. If thats the case so much the better. Xirens always been so quiet I felt she was rather stupid but as you know her so well you cant be wrong. Im all in favour, too, of not letting Baoyu know. None of us must mention this, just let it be understood. Im well aware that in future Baoyu wont listen to his wifes or concubines advice. I cant understand him either. Ive never known another child like him. One expects a boy to be mischievous, but this extraordinary liking he has for maids has been preying on my mind. Im for ever finding him fooling about with them. At first I thought this intimacy was because hed grown big enough to know about sex but watching him more closely I realized that wasnt the reason, which makes it even odder. Could it be that he was really meant to be born a girl....
The two boys exchanged greetings, then took their leave of her. Baoyu, remembering that he had not said goodbye to Daiyu, hurried to her room. She was sitting before her mirror by the window and smiled when he told her that he was off to school. Good, she said. So youre going to pluck fragrant osmanthus in the palace of the moon. Im sorry I cant see you off. Dont have supper till Im back, dear cousin, he begged. And wait for me to mix your rouge. After chatting for a while he turned to leave. Arent you going to say goodbye to Baochai? Daiyu called after him. With no answer but a smile he left with Qin Zhong. Now this Jia family school, which was only a li away, had been set up several generations earlier so that members of the clan who could not afford to engage a tutor would have somewhere to educate their sons. It was supported by those with official positions, who contributed according to the size of their stipends, and an elderly man of good reputation in the clan was elected to take charge of the boys instruction. When Baoyu and Qin Zhong had been introduced to the other students, they embarked on their studies. From this day onward the two of them became inseparable, going to school and leaving it together. And thanks to the Lady Dowagers partiality, Qin Zhong often stayed for a few days with the Jia family. Indeed, she treated him like one of her own grandsons, giving him clothes, shoes and other necessities when she saw that his family was hard up. In less than a month he was on good terms with everyone in the Rong Mansion. Since Baoyu always followed his own bent regardless of what was due to his position, in his usual unconventional way he privately urged Qin Zhong Were the same age, and schoolmates too. Lets forget that were uncle and nephew and just be brothers and friends. At first Qin Zhong would not agree to this, but since Baoyu kept calling him brother or using his courtesy name, he started doing the same. Now although all the pupils in this school were members of the Jia clan or relations by marriage, as the proverb so aptly says, A dragon begets nine offspring, each one different. And inevitably among so many boys there were low types too, snakes mixed up with dragons. These two new arrivals were both remarkably handsome. Qin Zhong was bashful and gentle, so shy that he blushed like a girl before he spoke, while Baoyu was naturally self effacing and modest, considerate to others and pleasant in his speech. And they were on such intimate terms, it was no wonder that their schoolmates suspected the worst. They began to talk about the pair behind their backs, spreading ugly rumours inside the school and out. Now Xue Pan had not been long in the Rong Mansion before he learned of this school, and the thought of all the boys there appealed to his baser instincts. So he enrolled as a student. But he was like the fisherman who fishes for three days and then suns his net for two. The fee he paid Jia Dairu was thrown away, for he had no intention of really studying, his sole aim being to find some sweet-hearts there. In fact, tempted by his money and other gifts several boys did fall into his clutches, but we need not dwell on this. Chief among these were two amorous youths whose real names have not been ascertained, nor the branches of the family to which they belonged. But on account of their good looks and charm they were nicknamed Sweetie and Lovely. Although the object of general admiration, so that others also had designs on them, they were left unmolested for fear of Xue Pan. Baoyu and Qin Zhong were naturally attracted by these boys too, but knowing them to be Xue Pans friends they did not venture to make any overtures. Sweetie and Lovely were equally drawn to them. But not one of the four spoke of what was in his heart. Every day from four different seats four pairs of eyes kept meeting, and while trying to escape detection they contrived by hints and allusions to reveal their thoughts. However, some sly rascals discovered their secret and began to raise their eyebrows, wink, and cough or clear their throats behind their backs. This had been going on for some time when one day, as luck would have it, Jia Dairu went home early on business, giving the boys a seven-character line to be matched with another and promising them a new lesson in the classics the next day. He left his eldest grandson Jia Rui in charge. Qin Zhong took advantage of the fact that nowadays Xue Pan had virtually stopped coming even to roll-call to make eyes at Sweetie and secretly signal to him.
countered Pinger. We should be lenient whenever we can. This isnt anything so important that you cant overlook it. What I feel is this however hard you work over here, youll be going back eventually to the other house so why make enemies of the servants here, making them bear you a grudge? Its not as if you havent troubles enough of your own. You managed after years to conceive a son but lost him in the seventh month through a miscarriage brought on, for all we know, by overworking and getting too upset and worked up over things. Wouldnt it be better, while its not too late, to shut your eyes to half of whats going on? This advice made Xifeng smile. All right, you little bitch, she said. Do whatever you like. Im just feeling slightly better I dont want to lose my temper. Thats the right way to talk! chuckled Pinger. With that she went out to deal with the women outside one by one. To know what happened later, read the next chapter. Chapter 62 Sweet Xiangyun Sleep Tipsily Among Peonies Silly Xiangling Coyly Takes Off Her Pomegranate Skirt Pinger, going out as we saw, told Lin Zhixiaos wife, A prosperous family ought to minimize big scandals and overlook minor ones. It wouldnt look good if we were to ring bells, beat drums and raise a rumpus over a trifle. So take mother and daughter back now theyre to keep their jobs. And send Qin Xians wife back as well. Theres no need to say any more about this business. Just make a careful inspection every day. With that she left. Mrs. Liu and Wuer hastily stepped forward to kowtow their thanks, after which Mrs. Lin took them back to the Garden and reported the matter to Li Wan and Tanchun, both of whom approved of the way it had been settled. So Siqi and the rest had worked themselves up for nothing. And Qin Xians wife, after this stroke of luck came her way, was able to gloat for no more than half a day. She had busily taken over and checked up on the utensils, rice, grain, charcoal and so forth in the kitchen, where she discovered serious shortages. Theres two piculs of good rice short, she observed. An extra months supply of ordinary rice has been drawn in advance, and theres charcoal missing as well. At the same time she prepared presents for Mrs. Lin, secretly getting ready a load of charcoal, five hundred catties of firewood and one picul of good rice outside the Garden for her nephew to take to the Lins house. In addition, she prepared gifts to send the accountants and some dishes to treat her new colleagues. My coming here is all thanks to your help, she told them. In future we shall be one family. If I overlook anything, please see to it for me. As she was bustling frantically about, a messenger suddenly arrived to announce Youre to leave after serving the morning meal. Mrs. Liu has been cleared and the job given back to her. Thunderstruck and utterly cast down by this news, Qin Xians wife made haste to pack up and beat a retreat. She was badly out of pocket over the presents, and now she had to make good that sum herself. Siqi too was completely taken aback, but fume as she might there was nothing she could do. As for Concubine Zhao, because Caiyun had given her so many things on the sly and Yuchuan had raised such a fuss, she was afraid others would find out the truth. This kept her in a constant cold sweat as she waited to hear the upshot. When Caiyun assured her that there would be no further trouble as Baoyu had taken the blame, this took a great load off her mind. It only made ha Huan more suspicious, however. He fetched out all Caiyuns secret gifts to him and threw them at her face. Sneaky double-crosser! he swore. I dont want this trash of yours. If you werent on good terms with Baoyu, why should he cover up for you? If you had any guts, you wouldnt have let a single person know youd given me these things. Now that youve blabbed about it Id lose face if I kept them. Caiyun frantically assured him that she was not on friendly terms with Baoyu, nor had she told anyone. Sobbingly she tried in all sorts of ways to convince him, but ha Huan stubbornly refused to believe her. If not for our past friendship, he cried, Id go and tell sister-in-law Xifeng that you stole these things and offered them to me, but I dared not take them.
Our house rents and land rents from various places wont be coming in till the ninth month, so right now Im rather hard up. Tomorrow I have to send presents to the Prince of Nanan and prepare Double-Ninth gifts for Her Imperial Highness then there are weddings and funerals coming up in several other families too. I need at least two or three thousand taels, and I cant raise that sum quickly. As the proverb says, Its better to ask of ones own folk than of outsiders. So I wonder, sister, if youll stick your neck out and filch me a case of gold and silver utensils which the old lady isnt using for the time being. I can pawn them for some silver to tide over. In less than half a year, when my money comes in, Ill redeem them and return them. I promise not to land you in any trouble. You certainly know a trick or two, Yuanyang laughed. The idea! I wont lie to you, he chuckled. Apart from you, there are several others who have control of plenty of silver, but none of them is as sensible and plucky as you. If I approached them theyd take fright. So Id rather strike the golden bell once instead of trying all the broken drums. At this point one of the Lady Dowagers maids hurried in in search of Yuanyang. The old lady wants you, miss, she said. Weve been looking everywhere, but here you were all the time. Then Yuanyang quickly went back. As soon as she had gone Jia Lian went in to see Xifeng, who had woken up and heard him ask for a loan. Not liking to interpose, she just lay on the kang until Yuanyang had left and Jia Lian entered her room. Did she agree? she asked him. Not in so many words, but it looks hopeful, he answered cheerfully. You must go and mention it again this evening, and that should fix it. Ill do nothing of the sort, retorted Xifeng. If she agrees, once you get hold of the money youll forget all your fine talk and promises now. Whos going to run such a risk for you? If it came to the old ladys ears, Id lose all the face Ive had the last few years. Be an angel, he begged. If you fix this up, Ill make it worth your while hows that? What with? Whatever you say. Pinger beside them put in, Dont ask for any other rewards, madam. Just yesterday you were saying you needed a couple of hundred taels. If you get this loan you can deduct them from that. Wouldnt that suit you both? Im glad you reminded me, cried Xifeng gaily. All right then. What a hard bargain you drive, protested Jia ian. Dont talk about pawning things for a mere thousand taels when I know you could easily produce three to five thousand of ready cash here and now. You should be thankful Im not borrowing from you, just asking you to put in a word and yet you still demand interest. This is the limit... Before he could go on, Xifeng sprang up. If I have three thousand or fifty thousand, I didnt earn it from you. she cried. Nowadays everybody inside and out, high and low, keeps carping about me behind my back, so you may as well join in. Ghosts from outside dont come in unless theyre invited by some family devils. Where did our Wang familys money come from, pray? Is it all from your Jia family? Dont make me vomit. You think youre as rich as a mint-master. The sweepings from the cracks in our Wang familys floor are enough to last you a lifetime. Arent you ashamed talking like that? Theres evidence to prove it. Just look at the dowries Lady Wang and I brought and compare them with yours. In what way are we inferior to you? Why take a joke so seriously? he asked, smiling. This is nothing to get so worked up about. If you want a couple of hundred taels, thats nothing. More than that I cant manage, but this I can afford. Suppose you take that to be going on with before you raise this loan? Im not waiting for that to pay for my funeral, so whats the hurry? Why carry on like that? Theres no need to flare up. Dont accuse me of temper. But your words cut me to the heart. I was thinking that the day after tomorrow is the anniversary of Second Sister Yous death and as she and I were good friends, the least I can do is burn some paper money at her grave for friendships sake. Though she didnt leave any children, we shouldnt forget her now that shes turned to dust.
Youd better allow her to stay. But Xichun although young had a will of her own and was most uncompromising and eccentric. However hard they pleaded, she was adamant as she felt the maid had disgraced her. I dont want Ruhua, she insisted. Not only that, now that Im growing up I think it best not to visit you people over there myself. Especially as these last few days Ive been hearing a lot of gossip. I dont want to be mixed up in any scandal. Whos been gossipping? asked Madam You. What about? Arent we all one family? If you hear talk about us, you should ask the gossips why they spread such rumours. Xichun smiled scornfully. A fine way to talk! A young girl like me should just steer clear of scandals. What sort of creature would I be if instead I sought them out? And at the risk of offending you I must say Your reputations known, so I dont have to ask what it is. As the ancients said Where good and evil, life and death are concerned, even fathers and sons are unable to help each other. Thats even truer of us. What I care about is my good name, not yours. If you get involved in scandals in future, dont drag me in. Madam You did not know whether to laugh or be angry. She said to the servants, No wonder they all call her young and foolish. I didnt believe them, but you heard the unreasonable way she talked just now showing no judgement or sense of proportion at all. Its childish talk, but it cuts people to the quick. Shes young, madam, the nurses rejoined. You must make allowances. I may be young, Xichun retorted. All the same Im speaking from experience. You dont know enough characters to read, so youre all so benighted that when I talk sense you call me young and foolish. Youre the Number One Scholar, the greatest talent of all times, quipped Madam You. Stupid people like us dont have your sense. Hows that? Even Number One scholars can be foolish. In fact theyre most likely to lack enlightenment. Fine! Madam You crowed. A moment ago you were a talented scholar now youve become a chief monk holding forth on enlightenment. If I werent enlightened, I wouldnt have the heart to give up Ruhua. But that proves you heartless and cold. As the ancients said One must be ruthless to keep out of trouble. Im pure and spotless. Why should I spoil my integrity by letting you involve me in your affairs? Being sensitive on this point, Madam You disliked such talk. She had been mortified to hear that there had been gossip, but had controlled herself in front of Xiehun. This last thrust was more than she could take, however. In what way have we involved you? she demanded. Your maid does wrong, and for no reason you round on me. Ive put up with it for some time, but thats only emboldened you to keep on like this. If youre such a fine young lady, we wont venture to approach you in future for fear of spoiling your good reputation. She ordered her servants to take Ruhua away and got up in a temper to leave. If you do stay away that will save us bickering and trouble, and we can all have a quiet life, cried Xichun. Madam You did not answer this but went straight out. To know what happened later, read the next chapter. Chapter 75 At a Feast One Night Portentous Sighing Is Heard New Poems on the Moon Festival Are Taken as Good Omens Madam You left Xichun in a huff to call on Lady Wang, but the nurses accompanying her quietly warned her, Better not go there, madam. TJia Zhen family have just sent people with some things and they seem to want it kept quiet, so this may not be a good time to call. Only yesterday your master told me that, according to the Court Gazette, tJia Zhens have been charged with crimes, said Madam You. Their house has been raided, their property confiscated, and theyve been fetched to the capital to stand trial. So why have these people come? Why indeed? answered the nurses. The few women who arrived just now looked flustered and agitated. They must be up to something they dont want to be known. In view of this, Madam You called instead on Li Wan. The court physician treating her had just left, and as her health had recently improved she was sitting propped up against her pillow in bed with a quilt around her, just hoping someone would drop in for a chat. She soon noticed, however, that Madam You was not her usual amiable self, simply sitting there lost in thought.
See if you can guess the answer. She recited -755 Parted from his valleys and streams, -748 He fools about midst mankind In utter futility. Fame and profit are vanity. -755 And nothing is left behind. For a long time they failed to guess the answer. Some suggested a monk, others a Taoist, yet others a marionette. Youre all wrong, declared Baoyu, who had been chuckling to himself for a while. Ive got it. It must be a monkey in a circus. -378 Xiangyun confirmed that he was right. The first part makes sense, said the others. But what does the last line mean? Is there any performing monkey that hasnt got its tail docked? asked Xiangyun. All the others protested laughingly, Even when making riddles, shes full of monkey-tricks! Li Wan now turned to Baoqin. Aunt Xue was telling us yesterday that youve travelled a good deal, and seen lots of sights. Do try your hand at some riddles. And since you write such good poems, why not make them in verse? Baoqin nodded cheerfully and went off to rack her brains. Meanwhile Baochai was ready with a riddle which she recited -748 Tier upon tier of carved cedar and sandalwood, By no craftsmen was it reared Even when the sky is swept by wind and rain No holy bells are heard. While the rest were trying to solve this, Baoyu chimed in Vanished from heaven and the world of men, The bamboo frame bids us beware! Gaze up to catch the message from the phoenix, And sigh your answer to the azure air. By now Daiyu had one ready too and she declaimed -755 No need to tether these fine steeds with ropes, Galloping round the walls how fierce they seem! At their masters bidding they speed fast as lightning Only three fairy isles on the giant turtles back have left a name. Tanchun now had one ready too, but before she could tell it to them Baoqin came back. Ive visited many places of historical interest since I was small, she said. So Ive made ten verses about ten of them. Theyre very crude, but at least they recall the past and the answers are everyday objects. I hope youll guess them. How ingenious! exclaimed the others. Wont you write them out for us? If you want to know more about this, read the next chapter. Chapter 51 Baoqin Composes Poems Recalling the Past An Incompetent Physician Prescribes Strong Medicine Baoqin told the others that she had written ten riddles in the form of quatrains, about famous places she had visited in different provinces. How original! they cried. They crowded round to read the poems, which were as follows RED CLIFF -1488 Wrecked by Red Cliff, choking the stream, Nothing remains in the empty hulks but names Yet countless gallant souls are roaming there Where cold winds sough and fan the leaping flames. COCHIN CHINA 2 -1488 His rule is strengthened by great bells of bronze, Whose sound has spread to tribes beyond the seas Ma Yuan assuredly achieved great deeds, And the iron flute of Zhang Liang 3 needs no praise. MOUNT ZHONGSHAN 4 -1488 Fame and profit have never kept you company, Abruptly haled into the dusty world To sever all the strings attached is hard Dont murmur, then, if taunts at you are hurled. HUAJYIN 5 -1488 Even the brave must guard against savage hounds He was made Prince of Qi and died straightway But let not the worldly despise him He remembered the gift of a meal till his dying day. GUANGHNG 6 -1488 Cicadas chirp, crows roost, in a flash they are gone How looks the landscape by Sui Dyke today? I was the emperors romantic reputation That was to blame for so much calumny. PEACH-LEAFFORD 7 -1488 Flowers bloom in idleness by the shallow pool, Peach-Leaf must part company at last with the bough Many mansions stood here in the Six Dynasties, Only a portrait hangs on the bare wall now. THE GREEN TOMB 8 -1488 The dark stream is stagnant, choked, The icy strings of the lute all her grief proclaim How absurd they were, the rules of the House of Han Wood the carpenter scorns should feel eternal shame. MAWEI SLOPE 9 -1488 Lonely traces of rouge and perspiration remain, But with the flowing water her beauty has gone Yet some vestiges of her charm still linger on, And even today a fragrance clings to her gown.
If she comes, my load will be ever so much lighter. But hes set his heart on Miss Lin, so its a blessing that he didnt hear this. If he had, Heaven knows how wildly hed carry on! This set her worrying. What shall I do? she wondered. Their Ladyships have no idea of their feelings for each other. They may be so pleased that they tell him, in the hope of curing him. Then suppose he acts the way he did when he first met Miss Lin and tried to smash his jade or that summer in the Garden, when he mistook me for her and poured out his love or when Zijuan teased him later, and he nearly cried himself to death? If they tell him now that he-s to have not Miss Lin but Miss Baochai, it may not matter if his wits are wandering but if-hes fairly lucid, far from curing his madness it may hasten his death. Unless I explain this to them I may ruin three lives! Having reached this resolve she waited till Jia Zheng had gone, then leaving Baoyu in the care of Qiuwen she slipped out and quietly asked Lady Wang to go with her to the back room. The Lady Dowager paid little attention, assuming that there was something Baoyu wanted, and went on considering the gifts and arrangements for the wedding. Once in the back room with Lady Wang, Xiren threw herself on her knees and burst into tears. Lady Wang pulled her up and asked in surprise, Whats come over you? Whats the trouble? Get up and tell me. This is something a slave shouldnt say, but I see no other way out! Well, take your time and tell me. Your Ladyships have decided to marry Miss Baochai to Baoyu, and of course nothing could be better. All Im wondering, madam, is this which of the two, Miss Baochai and Miss Lin, do you think Baoyu prefers? As he and Miss Lin were together as children, hes slightly fonder of her. Not just slightly fonder, Xiren demurred, going on to cite examples of their behaviour. Except for the avowal he made that summer, which Ive never dared tell anyone, you saw the other instances yourself, madam, she concluded. Holding Xirens hand Lady Wang answered, I did have some inkling from what I saw. Now youve clinched it. But he must have heard what the master said just now. Did you notice his reaction? Nowadays w-hen people talk to him he smiles if no one talks to him he goes to sleep. So-he didnt hear what was said. Then whats to be done? Ive made bold to tell you this, madam. Its for you to tell the old lady and think of some really safe plan. In that case, get back to your work. I wont mention it now there are too many people there. Ill wait for a chance to tell her later on, and then we shall see. She rejoined the Lady Dowager who was discussing Baoyus marriage with Xifeng. What did Xiren want that she looked so secretive? the old lady asked. Lady Wang took this opening to give her a detailed account of Baoyus feeling for Daiyu. For a while the old lady said nothing, and Lady Wang and Xifeng kept silent too. Nothing else really matters, the old lady sighed at last. We neednt worry about Daiyu. But if Baoyu is really so infatuated, its going to be difficult! Not too difficult, said Xifeng after some thought. Ive an idea, but dont know whether Aunt Xue will agree to it or not. If you have a plan, tell the old lady, said Lady Wang. We can discuss it together. To my mind, said Xifeng, the only way is to palm off a dummy on him. Palm off what dummy? the old lady asked. Never mind whether Baoyu is in his right mind or not, we must all drum it into his head that on the masters orders he is to marry Miss Lin, and see how he takes it. If he doesnt care either way, we neednt trick him. If hes pleased, well have to do things more deviously. Well, assuming hes pleased, what then? asked Lady Wang. Xifeng went over to whisper something into her ear, at which she nodded and smiled. That should work, she said. Tell me what you two are plotting, urged the old lady. In order not to give away -the secret, Xifeng whispered in her ear too. As she had anticipated, the old lady did not understand at first and Xifeng, smiling, had to explain more fully. Thats all right, agreed the old lady. Rather hard on Baochai, though.
Then I can explain where you are if she asks for you. "I'm attached to Master Bao's apartments." Xifeng chuckled. "I see. That accounts for it. All right, if he asks, I'll let him know where you are. Now go to my house and tell your sister Pinger that she'll find a packet containing a hundred and sixty taels of silver under the stand of the ju -ware plate on the table in the outer room. That's for the embroiderers. When Zhang Cai's wife comes, she's to weigh it in her presence and let her take it. And there's another thing. I want you to bring me the pouch which is by the pillow on the bed in the inner room Xiaohong went off to carry out these orders. She returned presently to find that Xifeng had vanished. But Siqi had just emerged from a cave and stopped to fasten her skirt. Xiaohong approached her. "Know where the Second Mistress has gone?" she asked. "I didn't notice." Xiaohong looked around and went to ask Tanchun and Baochai, who were watching the fish not far off. "You'll find her with Madam Li Wan, I think," Tanchun told her. Xiaohong promptly set off to Paddy-Sweet Cottage, but on the way met Qingwen and half a dozen other maids. "Still prancing about!" exclaimed Qingwen as soon as she set eyes on her. "You haven't watered the flowers, fed the birds or lit the tea-stove in our courtyard, yet you gad about outside." "Yesterday Master Bao said the flowers needn't be watered today -- once every other day would do," Xiaohong retorted. "I fed the birds while you were still asleep. "And what about the tea-stove?" demanded Bihen. "It's not my turn today, so don't ask me whether there's any tea or not." "Just listen to the way she talks," jeered Yixian. "You'd all better keep quiet and let her fool about." "Who says I was fooling about?" snapped Xiaohong. "I've been on an errand for the Second Mistress." With that she showed them the pouch to silence them, and they patted company. "No wonder!" Qingwen snorted as they walked on. "Now that she's climbed to a higher branch of the tree, she won't pay any more attention to us. Our lady may have thrown her a word or two, without even knowing her name, and she's already eaten up with pride. What's so marvellous about running a little errand? We shall see if anything comes of it or not. If she's all that clever she'd better clear out of this Garden and stay perched on the top of the tree." Xiaohong could hardly have it out with her. Swallowing her resentment she went on and found Xifeng, sure enough, chatting in Li Wan's apartment. She stepped forward to make her report. "Sister Pinger said, madam, that as soon as Your Ladyship left she put away the money and when Zhang Cai's wife came for it, she weighed it in her presence and gave it to her." She handed the pouch to Xifeng and continued, "Sister Pinger asked me to tell Your Ladyship Just now Lai Wang came to ask for your instructions before setting out to the mansion where you sent him, and she sent him off after explaining Your Ladyship's wishes." "How did she explain my wishes?" Xifeng smiled. "She said, 'Our lady sends her compliments to Her Ladyship. Our Second Master is away from home now, so Her Ladyship shouldn't worry over a couple of days' delay. When the Fifth Mistress is better, our lady will come with her to see Her Ladyship. The Fifth Mistress sent a servant the other day to report that our lady's sister-in-law had inquired after Her Ladyship in a letter, and hoped her sister-in-law here would oblige her with two longevity pills. If Her Ladyship has any to spare, please send them to our lady, and the next person to go that way will deliver them to her sister-in-law.'" "Mercy on us!" cut in Li Wan with a laugh. "I've lost track of all these ladies and mistresses." "I don't blame you. Xifeng smiled. "There are five families involved." She turned to Xiaohong. "You're a good child and deliver messages clearly, not like some who mince their words or buzz like mosquitoes. You know," she turned to Li Wan, "my dear sister-in-law, I can't stand talking to most of the maids, apart from, the few in my service.
Second Sister at once stepped forward with a smile to take his outer garments and offer him tea, then asked about this and that. Jia Lian was so pleased that he itched to make love to her. Soon Bao Frs wife brought in wine which the two of them drank, while his mother-in-law went back to her room, sending one of the young maids to wait on them. When Jia Lians trusted page Longer went to stable the horse he discovered another there and, looking closely, recognized it as Jia Zhens. Understanding the situation, he too went to the kitchen where he found Xier and Shouer sitting drinking. At sight of him, they exchanged knowing glances. Youve come just at the right time, they chortled. We couldnt overtake the masters horse, and as we were afraid of being caught out after curfew, we come here to spend the night. Longer chuckled, Well, theres plenty of room on the kang, just lie down as you like. Second Master sent me to bring the monthly allowance to the mistress, so I shant be going back either. Weve drunk too much, said Xier. You must have a cup now. But as Longer sat down and raised his cup, they heard a sudden commotion in the stable where the two horses, unwilling to be tethered together, had started kicking each other. Longer hastily put down his cup and rushed out to soothe them, coming back after he had managed to tie Jia Lians horse up elsewhere. You three stay here, Bao Ers wife told them. Theres tea ready made for you. I must leave you now. With that she left, closing the door behind her. Xier after a few cups was already glassy-eyed. By the time Longer and Shouer had locked the door they saw that he had passed out on the kang. They gave him a shove. Get up and move over, good brother, they urged. If you hog all the space, where are we to sleep? Must play fair tonight, each get a good fuck, Xier mumbled. Anyone who poses as proper Ill fuck his mother. The other two seeing that he was drunk ignored him, simply putting out the light, then lying down to sleep as best they could. The commotion made by the horses had alarmed Second Sister, who tried to distract Jia Lian with conversation. After a few cups, feeling randy, he ordered the maids to clear away the wine and dishes, then closed the door to undress. Second Sister was wearing nothing but a scarlet jacket. With her hair hanging loose, her cheeks flushed, she looked even lovelier than in the daytime. Throwing his arms around her, Jia Lian declared, Everyone calls that shrew of mine good-looking, but to me she isnt fit even to pick up your shoes. I may have good looks but Ive got a bad name, she answered. So it seems not to be good-looking would be better. Why do you say that? he asked. I dont understand. You all think me silly, she told him, shedding tears. But I have my wits about me. Now Ive been your wife for two months, and already in that short time Ive learned that youre no fool either. Ill be yours dead or alive. Being married to you, Ill depend on you all my life, so of course I wont keep any secrets from you. Im provided for, but what about my sister? Seems to me things cant go on the way they are now. We must think of some long-term plan. Dont worry, chuckled Jia Lian. Im not the jealous type. I know all that happened in the past, you dont have to be afraid. As your brother-in-law is my cousin, you naturally dont like to broach the subject. It would be better for me to make the proposal. So he went to the west courtyard and saw through the window that the room was brightly lit and Jia Zhen and Third Sister were drinking and enjoying themselves inside, Jia Lian opened the door and went in. So youre here, sir, he said with a smile. Ive come to pay my respects . Jia Zhen, too embarrassed to speak, simply stood up and waved him to a seat. Jia Lian laughed. Why look so worried? As cousins weve always been on the closest terms. I cant thank you enough for all youve done for me. If you take offence now, I shall be most upset. Please behave just as you did before. Otherwise I shall never dare come here again, not even if it means having no son. He made as if to kneel down. Jia Zhen hastily raised him. Ill do whatever you say, cousin, he assured him.
Xin told them then how the two actors cold-shouldered losers and made up to winners. In that case, said the young man. you had good reason to be angry, uncle. Let me ask you two boys this Uncle Xing has only lost some money, not his prick, hasnt he? So why cold-shoulder him? At this eyeryone roared with laughter, including Xing, who guffawed so hard that he sprayed rice all over the floor. Madam You outside spat in disgust. Listen to those shameless voung scoundrels. she SWOC softly. Barely lost their milk-teeth yet spewing out such dirt. If they go on swilling that yellow wine, who knows what theyll come out with next! She retired to her own room to bed. Jia Zhen kept the guests company until the fourth watch when at last the party broke up, then went to spend the night with his concubine Peifeng. The next day when he got up, some servants reported that the watermelons and mooncakes for the festival were ready for distribution. Jia Zhen told his concubine, Ask your mistress to share them out as she thinks fit. I have other things to attend to. Peifeng reported this to Madam You, who had shares sent over to the different households. Presently the concubine came back to inquire, The master wants to know whether youre going out today or not, madam. He says since we are in mourning we cant celebrate the Moon Festival on the fifteenth of the eighth month, but we can have a family party tonight to mark the occasion with melons, fruit, cakes and wine. I dont want to go out, replied Madam You, but Madam Zhu over there is unwell and Xifeng is laid up too. If I dont go, therell be no one to see to things. Besides, as hes so busy, why have a party? The masters not receiving visitors today and wont be at home to them till the sixteenth. Hes set his mind on inviting you to a feast. All right then, but I cant return this favour. Peifeng went off laughing, returning soon to report, The master hopes youll come home early in time for dinner, madam. And hes told me to go with you. In that case hed better hurry up and have breakfast, so that I can make a start. He says hell have it outside, and wants you to breakfast without him. Whom has he got out there? I hear two men have just arrived from Nanjing, bull dont know who they are. As she was speaking Jia Rongs wife, having finished her toilet, came in to pay her respects. Soon they sat down to breakfast together, Madam You in the higher place, her daughter-in-law in the lower. Then Madam You changed her clothes and went over to the Rong Mansion. On her return that evening, Jia Zhen had indeed prepared a feast a whole pig and sheep together with other dishes and sweetmeats too many to enumerate. Peacock-feather screens and lotus-patterned cushions were set out in the Hall of Green Shrubs in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, and there he and his wife and concubines dined, then drank together to enjoy the moon. By the time of the first watch the breeze was fresh and the bright moon silvered everything high and low. Jia Zhen proposed playing some drinking games, whereupon Madam You made Peifeng and the three other concubines join them, sitting in a row in the lower seats at their table to play the finger-guessing game and drink. Then Jia Zhen, in high spirits after wine, sent a servant to fetch a purple bamboo flute and asked Peifeng to play it while Wenhua sang. Her voice was so clear and tender that the listeners were entranced. After that they played more drinking games until nearly midnight, by when Jia Zhen was eight-tenths drunk. Tea was served, and they had just been brought fresh wine cups when they heard long-drawn-out sighing from the direction of the garden wall. Everyone heard it distinctly and they were fearfully startled. Who is there? demanded iia Zhen sternly. But though he called out several times there was no answer. It maybe one of our servants behind the wall, suggested Madam You. Nonsense, her husband retorted. The servants quarters are nowhere near the wall. Besides, that part is just by the ancestral temple. Who could he there at this hour? That same instant they heard a gust of wind on the other side of the wall and the sound as if of partition windows slamming inside the temple. The air struck them as colder, and the moon just now so bright and clear seemed suddenly dimmed.
There isnt anything else. Lady Wang opened the packets but could not recall what they were, and there was no ginseng among them. She sent to ask Xifeng whether she had any. A few rootlets only, was the reply, not of the best quality either, and she needed these for her medicine every day. Lady Wang then applied to Lady Xing, who said it was because she had run out that she had asked her for ginseng the other day. Then Lady Wang had no other recourse but to apply in person to the old lady. The latter at once ordered Yuanyang to fetch all she had, and this proved to be quite a large packet of ginseng roots each as thick as a mans finger. Yuanyang weighed out two ounces. Lady Wang gave these to Zhou Ruis wife, instructing her to send them to the doctor along with the herbs which they could not identify, and get him to label these. Before long Mrs. Zhou brought them back. All the herbs have been properly wrapped up and labelled, she said. But as for this ginseng, madam, although its of the best quality and costs more than thirty taels of silver an ounce now, its too old. Ginseng isnt like other medicines. No matter how fine the roots, after a hundred years they turn to ashes. There havent turned to ashes yet ,but they have dried up and lost their potency. So the doctor hopes youll take this back and get him some fresher, whatever the quality. Lady Wang lowered her head in thought. Theres nothing for it then, she concluded at last, but to go and buy two ounces. Not interested in examining the other packets she had them put away, then told Zhou Ruis wife, Get the servants outside to buy two ounces of good ginseng. If the old lady happens to ask just tell her we used hers no need to say any more. Baochai who was present put in, One moment, aunt. Theres no good ginseng to be bought outside. Whenever they get a whole root they cut it into two or three pieces and graft other rootlets on to these to be sold, with others, as if they were whole roots so the size is nothing to go by. Our shop often does business with those ginseng dealers. I can easily ask mother to get my brother to send an assistant to approach one of them and buy two ounces of good whole roots. Its worth spending a few taels extra to get the best. Thats a splendid idea! exclaimed Lady Wang. Its good of you to take the trouble. Baochai came back some time later to report that someone had been sent, and they should have the ginseng that evening in time to prepare the medicine the next morning. Lady Wang was greatly relieved. This is like the proverb The pomade-vendor uses water for her own hair, she sighed. Goodness knows how much weve given away, but when we need any ourselves we have to ask for help right and left! Ginsengs expensive, rejoined Baochai with a smile. After all, its only medicine, and such things should be given away to help others. We shouldnt hoard them the way vulgar people do. Lady Wang nodded. Quite right. Baochai left then, and as no one else was about Lady Wang summoned Zhou Ruis wife to ask the result of their recent search of the Garden. Mrs. Zhou had discussed this with Xifeng and agreed to keep nothing back. Her description of all that had happened shocked and enraged Lady Wang. But she was in a quandary too, as Siqi was Yingchuns maid and both of them belonged to Lady Xings house. She proposed reporting the matter to her. Mrs. Zhou demurred, The other day she scolded Wang Shanbaos wife and boxed her ears for being too officious. So now Mrs. Wangs shamming ill and wont leave home especially as Siqis her granddaughter and she fell into her own trap. All she can do now is pretend it never happened and hope things will quiet down. If we report this to Her Ladyship, she may suspect us of trying to stir up more trouble. Better take Siqi to her with the evidence, and after seeing it theyll at most give her a beating and assign a different maid here. Wouldnt that be simpler? If instead of that we just report it, Lady Xing may make excuses in order to shift the responsibility. Why doesnt your mistress deal with it, then? she may ask. Why report it to me? That would cause delay. And if Siqi took this chance to kill herself, that would make matters worse. The women whove been watching over her the last few days are liable to grow slack. Suppose they do, and something happens what then?
Seething with resentment Qiaojie told herself, "It's not that my father is heartless. When mama was alive, uncle made off with ever so many of our things but now he talks as if he had clean hands!" He went down in her estimation. Wang Ren for his part was convinced that his sister must have sizable savings, so that even after the raid they could hardly be short of silver. He thought, "My niece must be afraid I'll cadge on them that's why she's taking her father's side. This minx is no good either!" This made him take a dislike to Qiaojie too. Jia Lian, unaware of this, was preoccupied with raising money. He had put Lai Da in charge of outside business but their home expenses were going to be heavy too, and he had no idea where the money was to come from. Pinger appreciated his anxiety. "Don't ruin your health by worrying too much," she urged him. "To hell with my health!" he exploded. "I haven't even the money for daily expenses. What's to be done? And to make matters worse, this fool has come butting in. What do you expect me to do?" "Dont worry, Second Master. If you're short of money, I still have some things which luckily weren't confiscated. Take them, sir, to be going on with." Jia Lian was most relieved. "That's splendid," he answered with a smile. "It'll save me the trouble of borrowing right and left. I'll pay you back when I'm in funds again" "All I have was given me by the mistress, so why talk about paying me back? I just want this funer to be properly managed." Feeling immensely grateful, Jia Lian raised money on these things of Pinger's, and thereafter he consulted her on all matters, much to Qiutong's annoyance "Now that the mistress is gone, Pinger wants to take her place," she kept complaining. "I was the Elder Master's maid, so how can she outrank me?" Pinger paid no attention to such remarks, but when Jia Lian learned of them he was disgusted and each time he lost his temper would swear at Qiutong. But when Lady Xing knew this she took Qiutong's side, and he had to control his anger. No more of this. After the corpse had been laid out for more than ten days, the funeral took place. All this time Jia Zheng, still in mourning for his mother, was staying in the outer study. By now all his proteges and secretaries had left with the exception of Cheng Rixing who often kept him company. Jia Zheng told him, "Our family's gone downhill with so many dying one after the other, and the Elder Master and Master Zhen away. We are more hard pressed every day, and I don't know what's become of our farm at East Village. All in all, we're in a bad way!" "Yes, after all these years here I know the situation," said Cheng Rixing. "Which of your servants hasn't been battening on you by filching things from your mansion year after year? Naturally you're runing shorter every year. On top of that you have to meet the expenses of the Elder Master and Master Zhen, not to mention your debts outside besides, recently you were robbed, and the police aren't likely to catch the thieves or recover your stolen property. If you want to set your house in order, sir, you will have to summon your stewards and send one whom you trust to check up everywhere. Some servants should be dismissed and if there is a deficit anywhere, make the one responsible pay for it. Then you will know where you are. As for that big Garden of yours, no one would dare sell it but you haven't put anyone in charge of all its produce. During those years when you were away, these people got up to their tricks pretending the place was haunted so that everybody was afraid to go there. Better check up on your staff and keep on only the servants loyal to you, sending the rest away." Jia Zheng nodded. "I don't mind telling you, sir," he said, "that quite apart from the servants even my own nephews aren't to be relied on! If I start investigating, how am I to see to everything myself? Besides, being still in mourning, I can't attend to these things. And never having paid much attention to family affairs, I'm not clear what the situation is." "You are the soul of goodness, sir. If other families owned such a property and fell on hard times, they would be able to get by for five or ten years by applying to these stewards. Some of them, I hear, have had themselves made magistrates." "It's unthinkable to ask one's servants for money," objected Jia Zheng.
What I was going to tell you is that Feng Ziying called just now. He asked why I looked so worried. I told him I was upset because our daughter-in-law isnt well but we cant find a good doctor to tell whether shes ill or pregnant, and whether theres any danger or not. Well, Feng knows a doctor named Zhang Youshi who was his childhood tutor, a very learned man with a comprehensive knowledge of medicine, and an excellent diagnostician. Hes come to the capital this year to purchase an official rank for his son, and hes staying with Feng. Fate may have meant him to cure our daughter-in-law. You never can tell. Ive sent a servant with my card to invite him. It may be too late today, but Im sure hell come tomorrow. Especially as Feng Ziying promised to ask him as soon as he reached home. Lets wait, then, till this Dr. Zhang has seen her. Madam You cheered up at this. And how are we to celebrate your fathers birthday the day after tomorrow? Ive just been to pay my respects to him, answered Jia Zhen. I invited him here to receive congratulations from the whole family, but he said, Im used to a peaceful life and dont want to be disturbed by all the commotion in your house. Of course, youre inviting me to go and have everyone kowtow to me because its my birthday, but it would be a hundred times more to my liking if you had my annotated Rewards and Punishments 1 neatly copied out and printed. Suppose you entertain the two families for me at home the day after tomorrow instead of having them come here. Dont send me any presents either. In fact, theres no need for you to come yourself the day after tomorrow. You can kowtow to me now, if that will make you feel better. If you bring a great crowd to disturb me on my birthday, I shall be very displeased. Since he made such a point of this, I shant venture to go again. You had better order Lai Sheng to arrange for the two days banqueting. It must be handsomely done. You can go to the West Mansion to deliver invitations in person to the old lady, Lady Xing, lady Wang and Xifeng. As he was saying this, ha Rong came in to pay his respects, and Madam You told him what her husband had said. Your father has heard today of a good doctor, she added. Weve sent to ask him round and he should be coming tomorrow. Youll have to tell him all your wifes symptoms. Her son assented and had just withdrawn when he met the page sent to invite Dr. Zhang. Ive been to Mr. Fengs house with His Lordships card, said the page. The doctor said Mr. Feng had just told him about it, but he was so exhausted after a whole round of visits that even if he came now he couldnt take the pulse. Hell come tomorrow after a good nights rest. He added, I know very little about medicine and really shouldnt presume to take up this responsibility, but since Mr. Feng has done me the honour of recommending me to your master I mustnt decline. Go and give your master this message. As for His Lordships card, I really cant presume to keep it. So Ive brought it back. Will you please pass on this message for me, sir? Jia Rong went back to tell his parents this, after which he sent for Lai Sheng to instruct him to prepare the two days feast. And the steward went off to make his preparations. The next day at noon the doctor was announced. Jia Zhen couducted him into the reception hall and made him take a seat. When they had drunk tea he broached the subject, saying, Yesterday I was overwhelmed with admiration by all Mr. Feng told me of your character, learning and profound knowledge of medicine, sir. I am simply an ignorant layman, replied Dr. Zhang. But when I heard yesterday from Mr. Feng that Your Lordships family is considerate to ordinary scholars and had condescended to send for me, how could I disobey your orders? I am ashamed, though, that I have no real learning. You are too modest, sir. May I trouble you to have a look at my daughter-in-law? I am relying on your superior knowledge to relieve our anxiety. Jia Rong accompanied the doctor to Keqings bedside. Is this your worthy wife? asked Dr. Zhang. Yes, sir, said Jia Rong. Do sit down! Would you like me to describe her symptoms to you before you take the pulse? May I suggest that I take her pulse before you enlighten me?
Now you can put on your cloak. As Baoyu did so his aunt remarked, None of the nurses who came with you is here. Why not wait a bit? Why should we wait for them? he asked. Weve the maids to go with us. We shall be all right. To be on the safe side, however, Aunt Xue told two older servants to accompany them. Then Baoyu and Daiyu thanked their hostess and made their way to the Lady Dowagers quarters. The Lady Dowager had not yet dined but was very pleased when she learned where they had been. Observing that Baoyu had been drinking, she packed him straight off to rest, forbidding him to leave his room again that evening. As she gave orders for him to be well looked after, she wondered who was attending him and asked Wheres Nanny Li? The maids dared not disclose that she had gone home. She was here a moment ago, they said. She must have gone out on some business. Swaying a little, Baoyu called over his shoulder, She has a better time of it than our old lady. Why ask for her? I wish shed leave me in peace to live a little longer. While saying this he reached his apartment, where his eye fell on the brush and ink on the desk. Qingwen greeted him with a smile, exclaiming, A fine one you are! You made me grind that ink for you this morning because you were feeling good but you only wrote three characters, then threw down your brush and marched off. Youve kept us waiting for you the whole day. You must set to work quickly now and use up this ink. Reminded of that mornings happenings, Baoyu asked, Where are the three characters I wrote? This fellows drunk! Qingwen laughed. Just before you went over to the other house you told me to have them pasted above the door, yet now you ask where they are. Not trusting anyone else to do a good job, I got up on a ladder to paste them up myself. My hands are still numb with cold. I forgot. Baoyu grinned. Let me warm your hands for you. He took Qingwens hands in his while they both looked up at the inscription over the lintel. Just then Daiyu came in and he asked her, Tell me honestly, dear cousin, which of these three characters is the best written? Daiyu raised her head and read the inscription Red Rue Studio. Theyre all good. I didnt know you were such a calligrapher. You must write an inscription for me some time too. Youre making fun of me again. Baoyu chuckled. Wheres Xiren? he asked Qingwen. Qingwen tilted her head towards the kang in the inner room, where Baoyu saw Xiren lying, fully dressed. Thats good, he said. But its rather early to sleep. At breakfast in the other house this morning there was a plate of beancurd dumplings. Knowing youd like them, I asked Madam You to let me have them for supper, and they were sent over. Did you get them all right? Dont ask! answered Qingwen. I knew at once they were meant for me, but as Id just finished my breakfast I left them here. Then Nanny Li came and saw them. Baoyu wont be wanting these, she said. Ill take them for my grandson. She got somebody to send them home for her. At this point Qianxue brought in tea and Baoyu said, Do have some tea, Cousin Lin. The maids burst out giggling. Shes gone long ago. Yet you offer her tea. After drinking half a cup himself he remembered something else and asked Qianxue, Why did you bring me this tea? This morning we brewed some maple-dew tea, and I told you its flavour doesnt really come out until after three or four steepings. I did save that other tea, she replied. But Nanny Li insisted on trying it and she drank it all. This was too much for Baoyu. He dashed the cup to pieces on the floor, spattering the maids skirt with tea. Then springing to his feet he stormed Is she your grandmother, that all of you treat her so respectfully? Just because she suckled me for a few days when I was small, she carries on as if she were more important than our own ancestors. I dont need a wet-nurse any more, why should I keep an ancestress like this? Send her packing and well all have some peace and quiet. He wanted to go straight to his grandmother to have the old woman dismissed. Now Xiren had only been shamming sleep, in the hope that Baoyu would come in to tease her. She hadnt troubled to get up when he asked about the dumplings but now that he had smashed a cup and flown into a passion she jumped up and came out to smooth things over, just as a maid arrived from his grandmother to ask the reason for the noise.
The doctor mounted his carriage then and left. Jia Lian, having ordered servants to get the medicine, had just gone back to tell Xifeng about Daiyus illness and the doctors prescription, when Zhou Ruis wife arrived to report on some matters of no great consequence. Tell the mistress that, he cut in halfway. Im busy. With that he left. Just now I went to Miss Lins place, said Zhou Ruis wife after transacting her business. She seems in a very bad way! Her face has no colour at all shes nothing but skin and bones. And when I asked how she felt, not a word did she say simply cried. Later Zijuan told me, Our young ladys ill, yet when she needs something she wont ask for it. So I mean to ask Madam Lian to advance us a couple of months allowance. Although we get issued medicine, we need some cash for incidental expenses. I promised to pass on this request to you. Xifeng lowered her head in thought. Ill tell you what, she said presently. Ill give her a few taels to use, and you neednt let Miss Lin know. I cant very well advance the monthly allowance. If once the precedent was set and everyone else followed suit, what should we do? Remember how Concubine Zhao quarrelled with Miss Tanchun all because of the monthly allowance? Besides, as you know, our outlay exceeds our income these days and weve never got around this. Those not in the know think me a bad manager. Some gossips even accuse me of spiriting stuff away to my own family. But you as a stewardess, Mrs. Zhou, must naturally know better. The injustice of it! exclaimed Mrs. Zhou. A big household like this can only be run by someone with your forethought, madam. No ordinary woman could manage it no, not even a man with three heads and six arms! Yet people still talk such rubbish. She suddenly laughed. You havent heard the even more stupid things they say outside, madam. The other day when Zhou Rui came home, he told me outsiders imagine were made of money. They talk of the Jia family having so many storerooms for gold, so many for silver, and of using nothing but golden utensils studded with gems! Some say, When their daughter became an Imperial Consort, naturally the Emperor would give half his things to her family. That time Her Highness paid a visit home, we saw with our own eyes the cartloads of gold and silver that she brought, which is why the house is fitted out like the crystal palace of the Dragon King. And that day they went to give offerings in the temple, they spent tens of thousands of taels, but to them thats just one hair from the hide of an ox. Other people say, The lions outside their gate must be made of jade. In their Garden they had two gold unicorns, but one got stolen so now theres only one left. Not to say the mistresses of the house, even the maids have nothing to do except drink, play chess, strum the lyre or paint they have attendants to wait on them anyway. The silks and gauzes they wear, all their food and ornaments too, are things that common folk never even heard of. As for the young masters and mistresses, of course it goes without saying that if they want the moon from the sky someone will pluck it down for them to play with! Then, madam, theres a song -755 The House of Ning, the House of Rong, Treat silver and gold as clay No end to their victuals and clothing, but at last She broke off here because the final line ran -755 But at last all will vanish away. Mrs. Zhou had been rattling on, only pulling up short when she suddenly remembered how ominous this sounded. And Xifeng, guessing this, did not press her to finish. Well, never mind that, she said. But where did they get that story about the gold unicorn? That was the small gold unicorn presented to Master Bao by the old Taoist priest of that temple. Mrs. Zhou smiled. Later it was lost for a few days, but Miss Shi found it and returned it to him. Then they made up this story outside. Ridiculous, isnt it, madam? Not ridiculous, actually, but rather alarming! Things are getting harder for us every day, and yet we still keep up such an outward show. Bad for a man to be famed, bad for a pig to grow fat, the proverb says. Especially as with us this is empty fame. Goodness knows what the end will be. You have reason to worry, madam. Still, for years now that has been the talk of the town in teashops, taverns and every least little alley.
After that, for some reason, he was demoted three ranks. Now it seems he is going up again. Prosperity and ruin, observed Feng, are as unpredictable as success or failure in ones official career. Yucun counts as one who has got off lightly, rejoined Jia Zheng. There are other families much like ours, the Zhen family for instance, who had the same achievements to their credit, the same hereditary honours, the same way of life, with whom we were very close. A few years ago when they came to the capital, they would send people to call on us and they cut quite a dash. Before long, though, their property was confiscated and no more has been heard of them ever since. We dont know whats become of the family and cant help worrying about them. Dont you think this must strike fear into officials? Well, our family should be safe, ha She observed. Of course, your honourable family has nothing to fear, Feng assured him. You have Her Highness in the Palace to watch over you, and a host of good friends and kinsmen. Besides, not one of your family from the old lady down to your young masters is grasping or niggardly. That may be so, said Jia Zheng. But they have no virtue or ability either. How long can they go on just living on their capital? Dont talk that, protested Jia She. Lets have some more drinks. They drank a few more cups, then rice was served. After they had finished the meal and drunk some tea, Fengs page came over to whisper something to him, and he asked permission to leave. Jia She asked the page what he had said. Its snowing outside, sir, and the first watch has sounded. Jia Zheng sent a servant to look, who reported that more than one inch of snow had fallen. Have you put those valuables away? Jia Zheng asked. Yes, uncle, said Feng. If your honourable family has any use for them, we can of course negotiate the price. Ill keep it in mind. Ill wait to hear from you. Its cold please dont see me out. Jia Zheng and Jia She told Jia Lian to see him out. If you wish to know the sequel, read the next chapter. Chapter 93 A Servant of the Zhen Family Offers His Services to the Jias A Scandal in Water Moon Convent Is Exposed After Feng Ziying had gone, Jia Zheng summoned the gateman. Today the Duke of Linan sent invitations to a banquet, he said. Do you know what the occasion is? I asked, sir, replied the gateman. Its no special celebration, but a company of young actors a company with a fine reputation has come to the Prince of Nanans Mansion and the duke is so pleased with them that hes putting on two days performances for his friends enjoyment. It should be very lively. Theres probably no need to send presents. Jia She came over at this point to ask Jia Zheng if he would be going the next day. I suppose well have to, was the reply, to show our appreciation. Just then the gateman came back to report, The secretary from your yamen has come to ask you to go there tomorrow, sir, as the minister has some business and will need you earlier than usual. Very well. Then two of the familys bailiffs came in and paid their respects. After kowtowing they stood there at attention. Are you two from Hao Village? Jia Zheng asked. Yes, sir. Instead of inquiring their business, -he chatted with Jia She till the latter rose to go and was escorted home by servants with lanterns. Jia Lian then asked the bailiffs, Well, what have you come for? We collected the rent in kind for the tenth month, they reported. It should have arrived here tomorrow, but outside the city our carts were commandeered and, when we protested, all the things on them were dumped on the ground. We told them these werent merchants carts but were delivering rent to your mansions. Still they paid no attention. When we told the carters to drive on, some runners beat them up and made off with our .two carts. So weve come to report this, sir, and ask you to send to the yamen to get them back. Those lawless runners should be punished too. Youve no idea, sir, how hard it is on merchants. All their goods are unloaded, regardless, and their carts are driven away. If the carters so much as murmur, they get their heads smashed in. Outrageous! swore Jia Lian. He there and then wrote a note and told the servants, Take this to the local yamen and demand the return of the carts as well as the produce.
When he found that his uncle had indeed sent for him about the novices, taking his cue from his wife he suggested Jia Qin seems to be shaping well. We might entrust this to him. He can just draw the allowance every month in the usual way. Since Jia Zheng never took much interest in such matters, he made no objection. As soon as Jia Lian went back to tell Xifeng, she sent a maid to notify Jia Qins mother, and the young man came to thank them both profusely. As a special favour Xifeng asked her husband to let him have three months allowance in advance and made him write a receipt, to which Jia Lian put his signature. He was then given the tally to fetch from the treasury three months allowance two or three hundred taels of glittering silver. One piece he picked up casually and gave as a tip to the men who had weighed the silver, For a cup of tea, as he put it. The rest he told his servant to carry home. On his mothers advice he lost no time in hiring a sturdy donkey for himself and several covered carts. Taking these round to the side gate of the Rong Mansion, he called out the twenty-four little novices and seated them in the carts. Then together they set off for Iron Threshold Temple. And there we leave them. Now it had occurred to Yuanchun while she was editing the poems on Grand View Garden that it would be a pity if her father locked up such charming pleasure grounds after her visit in deference to her, so that nobody could go there. The more so when the girls of the family had a taste for poetizing, and if they were to move there the Garden would make a perfect setting for them while its flowers and willows would not lack admirers. Then she reflected that Baoyu was unlike other boys, having been brought up among girls, so that if he alone were excluded he would feel left out in the cold, and this might distress the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. She had better give directions for him to move in there too. Having reached this decision, she sent the eunuch Xia Shouzhong to the Rong Mansion with the order Baochai and the other young ladies are to live in the Garden, which is not to be closed. Baoyu is to move in as well to continue his studies there. This edict was received by Jia Zheng and Lady Wang. As soon as the eunuch had left, they reported it to the Lady Dowager and sent servants to clean up the Garden and prepare the buildings, hanging up blinds, portieres and bed-curtains. The others took the news fairly calmly, but Baoyu was beside himself with joy. He was just discussing it with his grandmother, demanding this, that and the other, when a maid announced that his father wanted him. At this bolt from the blue he turned pale, his spirits quite dashed. He clung like a limpet to the Lady Dowager, too terrified to leave her. Go, my treasure, she urged him. I wont let him be hard on you. Besides, its because you wrote so well that Her Highness has said you should move into the Garden, and I dare say your father only wants to warn you to behave yourself when youre there. Just say Yes to whatever he tells you and youll be all right. She called two old nurses and ordered them to take Baoyu there and see that he was not frightened. The nurses complied and Baoyu left with dragging steps. It so happened that Jia Zheng was discussing some business in his wifes room while her maids Jinchuan, Caiyun, Caixia, Xiuluan and Xiufeng were standing outside under the eaves. At sight of Baoyu they smiled knowingly, and Jinchuan caught hold of his sleeve. Ive just put some scented rouge on my lips, she whispered. Do you want to taste it? Caiyun pushed her away. Dont tease him when hes feeling low, she scolded. Go in quickly, while the masters in a good mood. Baoyu sidled fearfully in. His parents were in the inner room. The concubine Zhao raised the portiere, and with a bow he entered. His father and mother sat facing each other on the kang talking, while on a row of chairs below sat Yingchun, Tanchun, Xichun and Jia Huan, all of whom except Yingchun rose to their feet at his entrance. Jia Zheng glanced up and saw Baoyu standing before him. The boys striking charm and air of distinction contrasted so strongly with Jia Huans vulgar, common appearance that he was reminded of his dead son Zhu. He glanced at Lady Wang.
She had on a tight-fitting bodice with a gold border and rows of long buttons and loops in front, over which she had tied a none too new dark green sash. As she was not wearing a skirt, he could see her pomegranate-red trousers with floral designs and her new embroidered red slippers. She had evidently not yet made her toilet but come early to fetch the hamper to avoid being seen. Her appearance in such a costume dismayed Xue Ke. You are up early, he faltered, forcing a smile. She blushed but did not answer, simply putting the sweetmeats back into the hamper, which she then took away. Supposing that she was vexed by his behaviour the previous night, he thought, Just as well. If theyre annoyed, theyll give up and leave me in peace. Feeling easier in his mind he called for water to wash in and decided to stay quietly at home for a couple of days, partly to rest, partly to avoid outside contacts. For Xue Pans old associates were trying to cash in on the situation, now that there was only young Xue Ke to manage the familys affairs. Some officiously offered to run errands for him others who could write legal plaints or knew a few clerks in government offices proffered their services to bribe the court yet others urged him to appropriate family funds or tried to blackmail him. Each used a different approach. He steered clear of these hangers-on as far as he could, but dared not refuse them outright for fear of future trouble. So he felt constrained to lie low at home till orders came down from above. But no more of this. Let us revert to Jingui, who had sent Baochan with refreshments to sound out Xue Ke. Baochan on her return reported in full what had happened. As the young man had not risen to the bait, Jingui feared Baochan might despise her for this fiasco and therefore tried to cover up, changing her tune. However, not wanting to relinquish Xue Ke, she sat there in silence wondering what to do. Baochan did not expect Xue Pan back and was casting about for a lover, but had not disclosed this to Jingui for fear of the consequences. Now that her mistress had made the first move, she saw it as a good chance to pre-empt Xue Ke herself, for then Jingui could hardly raise any objection. That was why she had spoken provocatively to him. When he seemed neither entirely unresponsive nor very forthcoming either, she had hesitated to do anything more rash. Later, when he blew out the light and lay down to sleep, she went back, very disappointed, to tell Jingui and see what she would do. Now that her mistress kept silent as if at a loss, she had to help her to bed and retire herself. But that night how could she sleep? She tossed and turned until she hit on a plan. She would get up first thing the next morning to fetch the hamper, alluringly dressed and with her hair uncombed to reveal her drowsy charms. While watching Xue Kes reaction she would put on a show of anger and ignore him but if he showed regret, naturally she would smooth his way and then she could get him first she was sure of that. Such was her plan. However, when she tried to execute it, he behaved just as properly as the previous night. All she could do was act as if really affronted and take the dishes back. She deliberately left the wine-pot, though, to provide an excuse for returning. Jingui asked her, Did anyone see you fetch those things? No, madam. Did Master Ke ask you anything? No. Since Jingui had lain awake all night unable to think of a plan she now decided, If I go ahead with this affair, I may be able to keep it a secret from others, but how can I hide it from her? Id better go shares with her, to keep her quiet. Besides, I cant seek out Xue Ke myself, Ill need her as go-between. So I may as well work out a sound plan with her. She therefore asked with a smile, What is your honest opinion of Master Ke? He strikes me as a fool. Jingui laughed. How can you run down a gentleman like that? His ingratitude for your kindness gives me the right to, madam, Baoehan sniggered. His ingratitude? What do you mean? You sent him goodies but he didnt eat them. Wasnt that ungrateful? She winked with a knowing smile. Dont go imagining things, scolded Jingui. I sent him those things to express my appreciation for all hes done for the master. And I asked if anyone saw you because I was afraid there might be talk.
"I'll tear up some more tomorrow." "You know the ancient saying," put in Baoyu. "'A thousand pieces of gold can hardly purchase a smile.' And what are a few fans worth?" He called for Xiren, who came out having just changed into clean clothes and got little Jia Hui to clear away the broken fans. Then they sat outside for a while enjoying the cool. At noon the next day Lady Wang and the girls were gathered in the Lady Dowager's room when the arrival of Shi Xiangyun was announced. She entered the courtyard presently with a troop of maids and nurses, to be greeted by her cousins at the foot of the steps. As the girls had not seen each other for a month they naturally had a most affectionate reunion, after which Xiangyun went in to pay her respects to the others. "It's hot," said the Lady Dowager. "Do take off your outer garments." As Xiangyun did so Lady Wang remarked, "What a lot you're wearing, child." "My second aunt made me," she replied. "I didn't want to put on so much." "If you only knew, aunt, she loves dressing up in other people's clothes," said Baochai with a smile. "During her visit here in the third or fourth month last year, she put on Cousin Bao's gown and boots, as well as his chaplet, and stood behind that chair. At a casual glance she looked so like him -- except for two extra earrings -- that the old lady was quite taken in. "'Baoyu, come here,' she cried. 'Don't let the dust from the lantern tassels over your head get in your eyes. "The little wretch just smiled and didn't stir. Then we all burst out laughing and the old lady had to laugh too. "'Well, you look even better dressed up as a boy,' she said." "You don't know the half of it," put in Daiyu. "The year before last she was fetched in the first month, and she'd only been here a couple of days when it started to snow. I believe my grandmother and aunt had just come back from bowing to the ancestral portraits, and the old lady's new red woollen cape was lying there. Cousin Shi put it on without anyone noticing, tying it at the waist with a handkerchief because it was too big and long for her. Then she went with the maids to the back yard to make a snow-man and fell flat on her face by the drain, covering herself with mud." At the recollection of this everybody laughed. "Nanny Zhou," asked Baochai, "does your young lady still get up to pranks like that?" Xiangyun's nanny only smiled. "I don't mind her pranks," said Yingchun, "But she chatters too much for me. Even in her sleep she rattles away, laughing and chattering. All the nonsense she talks - I don't know where she gets it from!" "I expect she's better now," remarked Lady Wang. "The other day a match was proposed for her, and she'll soon be going to live with her mother-in-law. Then she'll have to change her ways. "Are you staying here or going back today?" asked the Lady Dowager. "Your Ladyship hasn't seen all the clothes we've brought," replied Nanny Zhou with a smile. "Oh yes, we mean to stay for a couple of days." "Isn't Cousin Bao at home?" Xiangyun now asked. "Cousin Bao's the only one she thinks of." Baochai laughed. "It's because they're both fond of pranks. That shows she hasn't changed her mischievous ways. " "You're getting too big to go on calling each other by your pet names, said the Lady Dowager. Just then Baoyu walked in. "So Cousin Yun's here!" he exclaimed. "Why didn't you come last time we sent to invite you?" "The old lady said you must stop that," Lady Wang told him. "But there you go using pet names again." Daiyu told Xiangyun, "He has something nice for you." "Something nice for me?" "Don't believe her." Baoyu laughed. "How tall you've grown in the short time you've been away. "And how is Sister Xiren?" she asked him. "Very well, thank you." "I've brought her a little present." With that she produced a handkerchief tied in a knot. "What is it?" he asked. "Why didn't you bring her a couple of red cornelian rings like those you sent over the other day?" "What do you think these are?" Xiangyun unwrapped the handkerchief with a smile, disclosing four more rings of the same sort.
This emboldened her from that time on to undertake countless similar transactions but we need not recount these here. Now it was Jia Zhengs birthday and both households had gathered to congratulate him. At the height of the festivities the gateman suddenly rushed in to announce His Excellency Xia, Chief Eunuch of the Six Palaces, has come with a Decree from the Emperor! This startled Jia She, Jia Zheng and the rest, who did not know what it could mean. They at once called a halt to the theatricals and had the feast cleared away. A table was set out with incense. Then, throwing open the central gate they knelt down to receive the Decree. Soon Xia Shouzhong the Chief Eunuch arrived on horseback, followed by a considerable retinue of eunuchs. He was not carrying an Imperial Edict, however. Having alighted in front of the main hall, he mounted the steps with a beaming smile and, facing south, announced By special order of the Emperor, Jia Zheng is to present himself at once for an audience in the Hall of Respectful Approach. This said, without even taking a sip of tea, he remounted his horse and rode off. Jia She and the others could not guess what this portended. Jia Zheng lost no time in putting on his court robes and going to the Palace, leaving the whole family in dire suspense. The Lady Dowager sent one mounted messenger after another in search of news but it was four hours before Lai Da and a few other stewards came panting through the inner gate, crying Good news! His Lordship asks the old lady to go at once to the Palace with the other ladies to thank His Majesty. The Lady Dowager had been waiting anxiously in the corridor outside the great hail with Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Madam You, Li Wan, Xifeng and the Jia girls, as well as Aunt Xue. On hearing this, they called Lai Da over and demanded more details. We had to wait in the outer court, Lai Da told them. So we had no idea what was going on inside. But then Chief Eunuch Xia came out. He congratulated us on the promotion of our eldest young lady. Shes to be Chief Secretary of the Phoenix Palace with the title of Worthy and Virtuous Consort. And then His Lordship came out and confirmed this. Now he has gone to the East Palace and he begs Your Ladyship and the other ladies to go at once to offer thanks. They were all so relieved that their faces shone with delight as each dressed in the ceremonial robes appropriate to her rank. And presently four large sedan-chairs, with the Lady Dowagers at the head, followed by Lady Xings, Lady Wangs and Madam Yous, were making their way to the Palace. They were escorted by Jia She and Jia Zhen, also in court robes, as well as Jia Rong and Jia Qiang. Then high and low alike in both mansions were filled with joy. Their faces radiant with pride, they broke into a tumult of talk and laughter. Now, a few days previously, Zhineng had stolen away from Water Moon Convent and come to town to look for Qin Zhong in his home. She had been caught by his father, who drove her away and gave his son a beating. The old mans rage had brought on an attack of his chronic disorder, and within a few days he was dead. Qin Zhong had never been strong nor had he fully recovered from his illness when he received this beating. His fathers death filled him with such remorse that his condition was now serious. All this was preying so much on Baoyus mind that the honour conferred on Yuanchun failed to raise his spirits. He alone remained utterly indifferent to the trip made by the Lady Dowager and the rest to offer thanks for the Imperial favour, the visits of congratulations paid by relatives and friends, the excitement which filled both mansions. The general delight left him completely unmoved, just as if these things had never happened. His apathy made everyone declare that he was growing more and more eccentric. Luckily a messenger arrived at this time from Jia Lian to announce that he and Daiyu were on their way back and would be home the following day. A little cheered, Baoyu questioned the man and learned that Jia Yucun was also coming to the capital to pay homage. For thanks to Wang Zitengs recommendations he had been summoned to wait for a metropolitan appointment and being a distant cousin of Jia Lians and Daiyus former tutor, he was travelling with them. Lin Ruhai had been buried in the ancestral graveyard and, his obsequies completed, Jia Lian was able to start back for the capital.
Bring the silver in at once. And see that the messengers have some tea before they go. With a cheerful assent the maids brought in two packets of silver, including the shares of Baochai and Daiyu. Whose is still missing? asked Madam You. The old ladys, Lady Xings and the shares of the young ladies and their maids, replied Mrs. Lin. How about Madam Zhu? Youll get hers from Madam Lian when you go over there, madam. Its all there. Madam You, having finished her toilet, ordered her carriage and drove to the Rong Mansion. She called first on Xifeng, who had already wrapped the silver up ready to be delivered. Is it all here? asked Madam You. Yes. Xifeng smiled. Hurry up and take it away. I wont be responsible if anythings lost. I dont quite believe you. Madam You laughed. I must count it here in your presence. She did so, and found that Li Wans share was missing. I knew you were up to one of your tricks, she scolded. Wheres your elder sister-in-laws contribution? Havent you got enough with all the rest? What does it matter if youre one share short? Ill make it up later if your funds run out. Yesterday in front of everyone you played the Lady Bountiful now you want to get out of it, but I wont let you. Ill have to apply to the old lady now for the money. What a terror you are, protested Xifeng, smiling. Dont complain next time youre in trouble if I put on the screws. So you can be frightened too! I wouldnt let you off if you werent usually so dutiful to me. She took out Pingers share then, saying, Here, Pinger, take this back. Ill make it up for you if we havent enough. Pinger understood and replied, Do keep it, madam. If theres any left over, you can give it back to me later just the same. So your mistress is allowed to cheat, but Im not allowed to bribe you, teased Madam You. Then Pinger had to take the money back. Your mistress is so thrifty, continued Madam You, I wonder what she does with all her money. If she cant spend it all, shell have to take it and spend it when shes in her coffin. With this she set off to pay her respects to the Lady Dowager, and after a little conversation with her adjourned to Yuanyangs room to ask her advice about the party and how best to please the old lady. When their plans were made and she was ready to leave, Madam You returned Yuanyangs two taels with the explanation I shant be needing these. She went on then to Lady Wangs apartments to chat, and when Lady Wang withdrew to her Buddhist shrine she gave Caiyun her share back too. Next she took advantage of Xifengs absence to reimburse the two concubines Zhou and Zhao as well. When they dared not take the silver she insisted Youre not well off enough to afford this. If Xifeng hears about it, Ill take the blame. Then the two women accepted with effusive thanks. In no time it was the second of the ninth month. All the inmates of the Garden knew that Madam You had arranged for a grand party with not only operas but acrobatics and blind story-tellers too, both men and women. They were looking forward to a delightful time. Li Wan reminded the girls again, Dont forget, today is the day for our club meeting. I suppose Baoyus not here because hes forgotten this refined gathering in his eagerness to join in the fun. She sent a maid to see what he was doing and ask him over. The maid returned after some time to report, Sister Xiren says he went out first thing this morning. Surely not! they exclaimed in surprise. This girls muddled up the message. So Cuimo was sent to ask again, but on her return she confirmed that Baoyu had gone out, saying that a friend of his had died and he must go to offer condolences. Impossible, cried Tanchun. Nothing could have induced him to go out today. Fetch Xiren and let me ask her. But even as she was speaking, Xiren walked in. Whatever business he had, he shouldnt have gone out today, said Li Wan and the others. In the first place, how could he run off on Madam Lians birthday, when the old ladys in such good spirits and high and low in both mansions are going to join in the fun? In the second, this is the day for our first club meeting, yet he sneaks off alone without even asking leave.
But after her initial fright Xifeng put on a bold face. If shes dead, shes dead, she retorted. Whats all the fuss about? Presently, however, Lin Zhixiaos wife came in and whispered to her, Bao Ers wife has hanged herself, madam. And her people are threatening to sue you. Thats fine. Xifeng gave a scornful laugh. Ive been waiting for a chance to go to court. Weve all been trying to talk or frighten them out of it, said Mrs. Lin. Theyre willing to drop the matter if youll give them a few strings of cash. I havent a cent, and I wouldnt give it to them if I had. Let them go ahead and arraign me. Dont try to talk them round or scare them away. Just let them go ahead. But if they lose their case I shall sue them for blackmail. Mrs. Lin was in a quandary when Jia Lian glanced at her significantly and, catching on, she withdrew to wait outside. Ill go and see what can be done, he told Xifeng. Youre not to pay them anything, she warned. He went to talk the business over with Lin Zhixiao, then sent people to negotiate and finally hushed the matter up by paying two hundred taels. To give them no chance to change their minds, however, Jia Lian also sent stewards to ask Wang Ziteng for some runners and sergeants to help with the funeral. When the dead womans family knew this, they dared make no further move but simply had to swallow their resentment. Jia Lian also told Lin Zhixiao to deduct the two hundred taels from their housekeeping funds, under cover of various items in their daily expenditure. In addition he gave Bao Er some money too, and promised to find him a good wife later on. Bao Er raised no objection, naturally, having received both money and consideration. He continued in Jia Lians service as before. As for Xifeng, although inwardly uneasy she pretended outwardly to be unconcerned. When no one else was about she took Pingers hand and said gently Yesterday I was drunk. You mustnt hold it against me. Where did I hurt you? Let me have a look. Its nothing, Pinger answered. You didnt hit hard. Then someone outside announced, Madam Zhu and the young ladies have come. To know the reason for their visit, read on. Chapter 45 Two Girls Pledge Friendship After a Heart-to-Heart Talk A Plaintive Poem Is Written One Windy, Rainy Evening As Xifeng was comforting Pinger the young people called. They were offered seats and Pinger handed round tea. Well, youve come in force, chuckled Xifeng. Anyone would think wed issued invitations. Weve come about two things, Tanchun announced. One is Xichuns business and weve also brought you a message from the old lady. What is it thats so urgent? demanded Xifeng. Weve started a poetry club, Tanchun explained, but not even the first meeting was fully attended all because were too soft to keep order. So it occurred to me that we must rope you in too as our supervisor we need someone strict and impartial. Then Xichun needs more materials of every kind for her painting of the Garden. We told the old lady, and she says there may be some left-over materials in the downstairs store-room at the back, which we can have if we can find them. If not, we can send out to buy more. Im no hand at versifying, Xifeng answered. All I can do is come and join in the eating. You wouldnt have to write anything, said Tanchun. Your job would simply be to watch out for truants or slackers and punish the offenders as you think fit. Dont try to fool me. Xifeng laughed. I can guess what youre after. Its obviously not a supervisor you want but a mint-master to supply you with cash. You must take it in turns to play host in this club of yours, and because your monthly allowances arent enough youve thought up this scheme to rope me in so that you can milk me. Isnt that the idea? The others laughed. Theres true perspicacity for you! cried Li Wan. What an elder sister-in-law you are! scolded Xifeng. Youre supposed to be in charge of these girls studies and of teaching them good manners and needlework. If they do wrong you ought to remonstrate with them. Now theyve started this poetry club which shouldnt cost much, but you refuse to take charge. The old lady and Lady Wang have their titled status of course, but your ten taels a month is twice as much as we get, and yet the old lady and mistress still pity you as a poor widow with no means of support.
As there was no knowing when Jia She would be pardoned, and he did not like to leave the old lady's coffin in the temple for too long, he decided to escort it back to the south for burial and called in Jia Lian to consult him. "Your decision is quite correct, sir," said Jia Lian. "Not being in office now you are free to see to this important business, whereas once you take off your mourning you will probably have other demands on your time. In my father's absence I couldn't presume to suggest this but although your decision is excellent, this is going to cost several thousand taels and it's useless to expect the police to recover our stolen property." "I have made up my mind," said Jia Zheng, "but since the Elder Master is away I wanted to consult you on how to handle this. You can't leave home or there would be no one in charge here. In my opinion all those coffins should be conveyed to the ancestral graveyard, and as I can't cope single-handed I'm thinking of taking Jia Rong along, the more 50 as his wife's is one of the coffins. Then there is your cousin Lin's. The old lady left instructions that it should go south with hers. I suppose -400 we shall have to borrow a few thousand taels to covef these expenses. "Nowadays we can't count on others helpng us out," replied Jia Lian. "As you are not in office, sir, and my father is away, we're in no position to raise a loan at present. All we can do is moitgage some properties." "How can we, when this mansion of ours was built by the government?" "I don't mean this mansion we live in, but there are houses outside which can be mortgaged and redeemed again after you resume office, sir. If in future my father returns and is given a post, that will make it easier. My one regret is that you should have to exert yourself in this way at your advanced age, sir." "I'm simply doing my duty by the old lady. But you must be more prudent in running the household!" "You can rest assured about that, sir. I shall certainly do my best, incompetent as I am. Besides, you will need to take quite a few servants south, and as that will leave fewer here I can cut down on expenses and get by. If you should find yourself short of funds on the' way, sir, since you will be passing Lai Shangrong's place you can enlist his help." "It's my own mother's funeral. Why should I asIC other families to help?" "Yes, sir," muttered Jia Lian, then withdrew to raise the money. Jia Zheng told Lady Wang his plans and asked her to take charge of -400 domestic affairs, then chose an auspicious day to start this long journey. By now Baoyu had completely recovered his health, while Jia Huan and Jia Lan were studying hard. Jia Zheng entrusted all three to the care of Jia Lian. "This is a year for the triennial examination," he told him. "Huan can't sit for it while in mourning for his mother. Lan is only a grandson, so after the mourning is over he's still entitled to take the examination and you must send Baoyu there too with his nephew. If he is a successful candidate, it will help to atone for our faults." Jia Lian and the boys assented. After giving furthef instrutions to other members of the family, Jia Zheng bade farewell to tbe ancestral shrine, had sutras chanted for a few days at the temple outside the city, then -400 boarded a boat with Lin Zhixiao and others. He did not take leave of his friends and relatives, not wanting to put them out thus only family members saw him off. Lady Wang reminded Baoyu from time to time of his father's instructions, and checked up on his studies. Baochai and Xiren too, it goes without saying, encouraged him to work hard. Though he was in better spirjts after his illness, he took more fantastic notions into his head not only was he averse to rank and an official career, he had lost much of his former interest in girls. But this was not too apparent to other people as he did not voice these views. One day, after returning from seeing off Daiyu's coffin, Zijuan stayed disconsolately in her room to weep. "How unfeeling Baoyu is!" She thought. "When he saw Miss Lin's coffin taken south he showed no sadness, shed not a tear, and instead of consoling me when I sobbed he actually laughed at me. So all this heartless fellow's honeyed talk before was to fool us!
How could I be so muddle-headed! These are things I bought specially for you, mother and sister, but as I forgot to bring them home theyve had to send them. Baochai teased, You say these were bought specially, yet you left them lying there for over a fortnight. If they had been something not specially bought, I suppose you wouldnt have given them to us until the end of the year. Youre altogether too casual. I guess those brigands on the road scared the wits out of me, and they havent come back to my noddle yet, he said, raising a laugh. Then turning to the servants, he ordered, Go and tell the messengers Ive received these cases and they can go back now. Aunt Xue and Baochai now asked, What good things are these, so carefully packed and crated? Xue Pan called servants to unfasten the ropes and remove the spars, then he unlocked the cases. They saw that one was filled with silks, satins, brocades, foreign imports and articles of daily use. The other, meant for Baochai, in addition to writing-brushes, ink-tablets, inkstones, stationery, perfume-sachets, scented beads, fans, fan-sheaths, powder, rouge and pomade, had in it all sorts of toys from Huqiu in Soochow. Among them were figurines with movable limbs, lots for drinking-games, toy tumblers weighted with quicksilver, earthenware lanterns, whole sets of clay opera figures in blue gauze boxes, and even a clay sculpture of Xue Pan done to the life by one of the Huqiu craftsmen. Baochai was not interested in the other things, but she picked up the figurine of Xue Pan to examine it carefully and comparing it with her brother, she burst out laughing. She told her maids, Take this case to the Garden, so that itll be easier to distribute these presents to the different apartments there. With that she stood up to ask leave from her mother, then went back to the Garden. Aunt Xue, for her part, when she had unpacked her case, divided the things into different lots which she told her young maid Tongxi to take to the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and others. Baochai, who had followed her case back to her own rooms, looked through the things in it one by one. Some she kept for herself the rest she divided into appropriate lots. To some people she would just give toys to others, stationery or sachets, fans and pendants rouge and pomade. She gave careful thought to what was a fair share for each, only making an exception in Daiyus case she was to have twice as much as anyone else. After she had allotted all the shares, she sent Yinger with an old maid-servant to deliver them to the different apartments. Li Wan, Baoyu and the rest, on receiving these presents, tipped the messengers and told them that they would thank Baochai when next they saw her. Only Daiyu was grief-stricken at the sight of these toys from her home in the south which reminded her of her parents. Gazing at them through tears she sighed I come from south of the Yangzi, but my parents are dead and Im all on my own, with no brothers so I have to put up in my grandmothers house. My health is poor too, and though Im well looked after by my grandmother, aunt and cousins, none of the Lin family ever calls to see me or brings me local products which I could gain face by distributing as presents. This shows how lonely it is, how utterly wretched, to have no family of ones own. These reflections made her feel her heart would break. Zijuan, having waited on Daiyu for so long, knew just how her mind worked and that it was the sight of these gifts from her old home in the south that had upset her, making her feel homesick. But not daring to say so outright, she just tried to comfort her. Youre so delicate, miss, she said, that youre always taking medicine. These last few days youve just begun to recover your appetite and have a little more energy but youre not completely well yet. Miss Baochais gift of these things today shows how fond she is of you. They ought to make you happy instead of upsetting you. Doesnt it look as if her presents, which she hoped would please you, have vexed you instead? Wouldnt she feel bad if she knew this? And just think, miss, Their Ladyships are doing all they can to find good doctors to diagnose your illness and prescribe medicine, so that youll be cured as soon as possible.
Give us a couple of examples. When questioned like this, Mrs. Wu could not remember. It doesnt matter, she answered with a smile. Whatever sums given, who would dare to complain? Nonsense! retorted Tanchun pleasantly. I would just as soon give a hundred taels but if I didnt go by the rules, not only would you laugh at me but I shouldnt be able to face the Second Mistress. In that case Ill go and look up the old accounts, offered Mrs. Wu. I cant for the moment remember. Youre an old hand at this, Tanchun pointed out. Yet you claim to have forgotten, so as to make things awkward for us. Do you have to go and look up the accounts when you report to the Second Mistress? If so, Xifeng would count as lenient, not as exacting. Fetch those accounts at once. One more days delay, and instead of blaming you for negligence people will accuse us of incompetence. Mrs. Wu flushed scarlet and hurried out, while the other stewards wives stuck out their tongues in dismay. Then other matters were reported. Soon Mrs. Wu came back with the old accounts. Tanchun, taking them, found that two concubines who had been family servants had received twenty taels apiece, and two from outside forty. Two others from outside had received a hundred taels and sixty taels respectively but it was recorded that this was because the first was allowed an extra sixty to have her parents coffins moved to another province the second was allowed an extra twenty to buy a burial ground. Tanchun showed these items to Li Wan. Give her twenty taels. she ordered Mrs. Wu. And leave these accounts here for us to go through carefully. Mrs. Wu assented and withdrew. Suddenly Concubine Zhao burst in. Li Wan and Tanchun at once asked her to be seated. Everyone in this house tramples on my head. she stormed. I should think you at least, miss, should take my side! She began to sob and snivel as she was speaking. Whom are you accusing, madam? asked Tanchun. I dont understand. Whos trampling on your head? If youll tell me, Ill take your side. Youre the one so whom can I complain to? Tanchun hastily rose to protest, I wouldnt dare. Li Wan also stood up to act as a peacemaker. Sit down, please, and listen to me! cried the concubine. Ive been treated like dirt in this house all these years, though Ive borne you and your brother, and now I rank even lower than Xiren. What face have I got left? Not only me this makes you lose face too. So thats it. Tanchun smiled. As if I dared take the law into my own hands! Sitting down again, she showed Concubine Zhao the account books and read out the items to her. These are the rules handed down by our ancestors, she declared. We all have to abide by them how could I change them? Xiren isnt a special case. If Huan takes a concubine from outside later on, shell naturally rank the same as Xiren. This isnt a question of competing for status, it has nothing to do with face. If someones in our mistress service, I can only go by the rules. The sums given thanks to the kindness of our ancestors and our mistress. If that someone thinks it unfair and is too stupid to know when shes well off, I cant stop her complaining. If our mistress were to give away the whole house, Id get no face from it. If she didnt give a cent, it wouldnt make me lose face either. Take my advice and have a quiet rest while the mistress is out. Why work yourself up? The mistress is kindness itself to me, but youve grieved her more than once by the way you make trouble. If I were a boy, able to leave this house, Id have gone long ago to make my own way in the world, for then of course Id know what to do. Its too bad that Im only a girl and mustnt say a word out of turn. The mistress fully understands, and thinks well enough of me to put me in charge but before Ive managed to be of any use you come and start picking on me. If she found out and relieved me of the job so as not to embarrass me, then Id really lose face. And so would you as well. By this time she was sobbing bitterly. The concubine having no other answer to this retorted, If the mistress is partial to you, thats all the more reason to lend us a helping hand. But youve quite forgotten us in your eagerness to curry favour with her. Who says Ive forgotten you?
She has to remind us from time to time to be on our guard and not overstep the limits. We dont need that high table, put in Xiren. Lets put that round low pear-wood one on the kang. Theres room for all of us at it, and its more convenient. So they carried the table over, after which Sheyue and Sier fetched the dishes, making four or five trips with two big trays while two old women squatting outside by the brazier warmed the wine. Its so hot, lets take off our outer clothes, Baoyu suggested. You can if you want to, said the girls, but we have to take it in turns to offer toasts. If you do that itll take all night, he objected. You know how much I dislike those vulgar conventions. We may have to observe them in front of outsiders, but if you provoke me like that it wont be nice. Well do as you say, they agreed. So before taking seats they first divested themselves of their outer things and had soon laid aside their formal gowns and trinkets, leaving their hair to hang free and wearing only long skirts and bodices. Baoyu himself stripped down to a scarlet linen jacket and green dotted satin trousers, letting the ends of the trouser legs hang loose. Leaning on a jade-colored gauze cushion filed with all sorts of fresh rose and peony petals, he started playing the finger-guessing game with Fangguan. Fangguan, who had also been complaining of the heat, had on only a short lined satin jacket a patchwork of red, blue and jade-coloured squares, a green sash, and pink trousers with a floral design left untied at her ankles. Her hair, woven in small plaits, was gathered on the crown of her head into a thick braid hanging down at the back. In her right ear she wore a jade stop no bigger than a grain of rice, in her left a ruby-ear-ring set in gold the size of a gingko nut, making her face seem whiter than the full moon, her eyes clearer than water in autumn. The two of them look like twin brothers! chuckled the others. Xiren and the rest poured wine for each. Wait a bit before you start the finger-guessing game, they said. Though were dispensing with the usual toasts, you must each take a sip from our cups. Xiren held the first cup to her lips and took a sip, to be followed by the others, after which all sat down in a circle. As there was insufficient room on the kang, Xiaoyan and Sier set two chairs beside it. The forty white Ding ware dishes no bigger than saucers held all manner of sweet-meats and delicacies of land and sea, fresh or preserved, from every part of the country and from abroad. And now Baoyu proposed playing some drinking games. Something quiet, not too rowdy, advised Xiren. We dont want people to hear us. And nothing too literary either, as were no scholars. How about the dice game Grabbing the Red? said Sheyue. Thats no fun, objected Baoyu. Better play the Flower Game. Yes, do lets! cried Qingwen. Ive always wanted to play that. Its a good game, agreed Xiren, but no fun for just a few people. Ive an idea, put in Xiaoyan. Lets quietly invite Miss Baochai and Miss Daiyu over to play for a short time. It wont matter if we go on till the second watch. If we go around knocking different people up, we may run into some night-watchers, Xiren pointed out. Dont be afraid, said Baoyu. My Third Sister likes drinking too we should count her in. And Miss Baoqin as well. Not Miss Baoqin, the others demurred. Shes with Madam Zhu, so that would make too much of a stir. Never mind, insisted Baoyu. Hurry up and invite them. Xiaoyan and Sier, who had been awaiting this order, immediately called for the gate to be unlocked and went off to the different apartments. They may not be able to get Miss Baochai and Miss Daiyu, predicted the senior maids. Well have to go and drag them here by main force. So, telling an old woman to bring a lantern, Xiren and Qingwen went off as well. Sure enough, Baochai objected that it was too late while Daiyu pleaded poor health, but the two maids begged them Do give us a little face. Just go and sit there for a while. As for Tanchun, she was eager to come but felt that if Li Wan were left out and came to hear of it later that wouldnt be good so she told Zuimo and Xiaoyan to insist that Li Wan and Baoqin should both be invited.
All I'm afraid of is that you haven't the guts." "Of course I have! Do you think I'm scared of that godfather of mine? I only put up with him for my godmother's sake. He doesn't count. As for your idea, I'm afraid it may be a flop and land us in trouble instead. They have connections, you know, in all the yamens. So quite apart from the fact that we may not pull it off, even if we do they'll raise a hullabaloo." "If that's all that's worrying you, you're in luck! I've palled up with some men from the coast, who are on the look-out here for some opening. If we get the loot, there's no point in staying here we'd better go to sea to have a good time, eh? If you don't want to ditch your godmother, we can take her along as well to share the fun. How about it?" "You must be drunk, old man, to talk such rubbish!" With that He San pulled him to a quiet spot to discuss the matter further. Then they went their different ways, and there we will leave them. Let us now revert to Bao Yong, who had been berated by Jia Zheng and sent to keep watch in the Garden. After the Lady Dowager's death, although the whole household was busy while he was assigned no job that did not disturb him. He cooked his own meals, went to sleep when bored, and in his waking hours would exercise with a sword or staff in the Garden, left to his own devices. That morning he knew that the funeral cortege had left, but as no assignment had been given him he rambled round as his custom was till he saw a nun with an old deaconess go up to the side-gate and start knocking on it. Bao Yong went over and asked, "Where are you going, reverend sister?" The deaconess said, "We heard today that the services for the old lady have ended, but didn't see Miss Xichun with the cortege, so we think she must be at home minding the house. For fear she may feel lonely, my mistress has come to call on her." "The family are all away and I'm the gateman here," was Bao Yong's reply. "I must ask you to go back. If you want to call, wait till the masters are back." "What upstart scavenger are you," she asked, "that you try to interfere with our coming or going?" "I've no use for the likes of you," was his retort. "I won't let you in, so you'll just have to lump it." "The impertinence!" she screeched. "Even when the old lady was alive, no one ever stopped us from coming. Who are you, you lawless brigand? We're going this way, so there!" With that she beat a tattoo with the door-rapper. Miaoyu, speechless with anger, was about to turn back when the woman in charge of the inner gate heard them quarrelling and hastily opened the gate. Seeing Miaoyu turning away, she guessed that Bao Yong must have offended her. As all the women-servants knew how fond their mistresses and Xichun were of Miaoyu, she feared that if they came to learn that she had been refused admittance there would be trouble. She hurried over calling, "We didn't know you were here, sister, and were late in opening the gate. Miss Xichun is at home, longing to see you. Please come back. This caretaker is new here and doesn't know our ways. We'll report him later to Her Ladyship and see that he's given a whipping and thrown out." When Miaoyu pretended not to hear, the woman chased after her and pleaded with her. Finally she voiced her own fear of punishment, all but going down on her knees, she was so frantic. So Miaoyu had to follow her through the gate. BaoYong glared but, unable to bar the way, went off fuming. Miaoyu, attended by the old deaconess, called on Xichun and after expressing her condolences they started chatting. Xichun told her, "I'm to stay and look after the house, and shall have to manage as best I can for a few nights but Madam Lian is ill and I find it boring and scaring all on my own. If I had company I'd feel easier, for there isn't a single man in the house now. As you've done me the honour of calling today, won't you spend the night with me? We can play draughts and chat." Miaoyu had no wish to stay but gave her consent because Xichun looked so pathetic, and a game of draughts appealed to her too.
Lady Wang could not make head or tail of this either, but Baochai's eyes widened in alarm and she could not get a word out. They were about to send to fetch Baoyu back, when in he came grinning and saying to himsell, "Fine, fine!" Baochai remained speechless while his mother asked, "What is this crazy talk?" "I'm in earnest," protested Baoyu, "yet you call me crazy! That monk and I knew each other before and he simply wished to see me. He never really wanted a reward but was just doing a good deed. After he'd explained that, he vanished. Isn't that fine?" His mother, not believing him, sent the page to question the gateman. "The monk has really gone," he came back to report. "He left word that Your Ladyships needn't worry. He wants no silver, simply wants Master Bao to pay him occasional visits. 'Just submit to fate and things -400 will take their natural course', "he said. "So he was a good monk after all! Did you ask where he lives?" "The gateman said he told Master Bao, so he knows." But Baoyu when questioned answered with a smile, "That place is far or near, depending on how you look at it.... "Wake up!" cut in Baochai, "Stop dreaming! The master and the mistress dote on you, and the master told you to study hard to advance yourself." "What I have in mind will advance us all, won't it? Don't you know the saying. 'When one son renounces the world, seven of his ancestors will go to heaven'?" Lady Wang lamented, "What's to become of us? First Xichun insists on renouncing the world, and now here's another. How can I live on like this?" She broke down and wept. Baochai tried hard to console her and Baoyu said, "I was joking, madam. Don't take it seriously." His mother stopped weeping to retort, "Is this ajoking matter?" Just then a maid came in to announce, "Master Lian is back, quite unlike his usual self. He hopes you'll go back, madam, so that he can report something to you." "Tell him to come in here," ordered Lady Wang in fresh alarm. "He's known his sister-in-law since they were children, so he doesn't have to avoid her." When Jia Lian had entered and paid his respects to her, Baochai stepped forward to greet him. He reported, "I have just had word from my father that he's seriously ill. He's sent for me. Any delay and I may never see him again!" Tears coursed down his cheeks. "What illness did he say he had?" asked Lady Wang. "It started as influenza but turned into consumption, and now he's dying. He sent a messenger posthaste with the news, warning that if I delay for so mucb as two days I shall be too late to see him. So I've come to ask your permission to leave at once, madam. But there's no one at home to see to things unless we rope in Qiang and Yun. Though they aren't much good at least they are men, and if business crops up -400 outside they can report it. "My own household is no problem. Because Qiutong kept weeping and wailing that she didn't want to stay. I told her family to fetch her back and that has saved Pinger a good deal of vexation. Though Qiaojie has no one to look after her, Pinger is kind to her and shes an intelligent gid though even more wilful than her mother, madam, so I hope you will discipline her from time to time." The rims of his eyes were red now and he dabbed at them with the silk handkerchief attached to the sachet at his waist. "The child has her grandmother here," demurred Lady Wang. "Why should you entrust her to me?" 'If you bring that up, madam," he muttered, "I may say something outrageous. I can only beg you any way to be kind, as you always are, to your nephew." He fell on his knees. "Get up quickly!" she said, her own eyes reddening. "We are all one family, of course I'll help. Only one thing the child is growing up, and if anything should happen to your father her marriage would be delayed. If some suitable family makes a proposal, should we wait for your return or let her grandmother decide what to do?" "Since Your Lady ships are at home, naturally you can decide without waiting for me." 'Before you go, write to the Second Master telling him there is no one responsible at home and you don't know whether your father will recover, so we hope he will have the old lady buried quickly and come back as fast as he can." Jia Lian assented and started out, then turned back.
He gave Jia Rui thirty or forty strokes with a bamboo, would not let him have any food, and made him kneel in the courtyard to study ten days lessons. This thrashing on an empty stomach and kneeling in the wind to read essays completed the wretched youths misery after his freezing night. But still too blinded by infatuation to realize that Xifeng was playing with him, he seized his first chance a couple of days later to call. She reproached him for his breach of faith, earnestly as he protested his innocence and since he had delivered himself into her hands she could not but devise further means to cure him. Tonight you can wait for me in another place that vacant room off the passage behind this apartment. But mind you dont make any mistake this time. Do you really mean it? Of course I do. If you dont believe me, dont come. Ill come, Ill come, even if I should die for it. Now, youd better go. Assuming that this time all would go well, Jia Rui went off. Having got rid of him, Xifeng held a council of war and baited her trap while the young man waited at home impatiently, for to his annoyance one of their relatives called and stayed to supper. By the time he left the lamps were being lit, and Jia Rui had to wait for his grandfather to retire before he could slip over to the Rong Mansion and wait in the place appointed. He paced the room frantic as an ant on a hot griddle, but there was no sight or sound of anyone. Is she really coming? he wondered. Or shall I be left to freeze for another whole night? Just then a dark figure appeared. Sure that it was Xifeng, he threw caution to the winds and barely had the figure stepped through the door than he flung himself on it like a ravenous tiger, or a cat pouncing on a mouse. Dearest! he cried. I nearly died of longing. He carried her to the kang, where he showered kisses on her and fumbled with her clothes, pouring out incoherent endearments. Not a sound came from the figure in his arms. Jia Rui had just pulled down his pants and prepared to set to work when a sudden flash of light made him look up. There stood Jia Qiang, a taper in his hand. Whats going on in here? he demanded. The figure on the kang said with a chuckle, Uncle Rui was trying to bugger me. When Jia Rui saw that it was Jia Rong, he wished he could sink through the ground. In utter confusion he turned to run away. Oh, no you dont! Jia Qiang grabbed him. Aunt Xifeng has told Lady Wang that without any reason you tried to make love to her. To escape your attentions she played this trick to trap you. Lady Wangs fainted from shock. I was sent here to catch you. I found you on top of him, you cant deny it. So come along with me to Lady Wang! Jia Rui nearly gave up the ghost. Dear nephew, he pleaded, do tell her you couldnt find me. Ill pay you well for it tomorrow. I might do that. Depends how much youre willing to pay. I cant just take your word for it, I must have it down in writing. How can I put a thing like this down in writing? Thats no problem. Just write that you borrowed so much silver from the bank to pay a gambling debt. All right. But Ive no paper or brush. Thats easy. Jia Qiang disappeared for a moment and promptly returned with writing materials, where upon the two of them forced Jia Rui to write and sign an I. O. U. for fifty taels which Jia Qiang pocketed. When he urged Jia Rong to leave, however, the latter at first absolutely refused and threatened to lay the matter before the whole clan the next morning, Jia Rui kowtowed to him in desperation. However, with Jia Qiang mediating between them, he was forced to write another I. O. U. for fifty taels of silver. Ill get the blame if youre seen leaving, said Jia Qiang. The Lady Dowagers gate is closed, and the Second Master is in the hall looking over the things which have arrived from Jinling, so you cant get out that way. Youll have to go through the back gate. But if anyone meets you Ill be finished too. Let me see if the coast is clear. You cant hide here, theyll be bringing stuff in presently. Ill find you somewhere to wait. He blew out the light and dragged Jia Rui out to the foot of some steps in the yard. Heres a good place, he whispered.
By rights, I shouldnt bring this up at our first meeting, madam. But as Ive come all this way to ask your help, Id better speak up. . Just then pages by the second gate called out, The young master from the East Mansion is here. Cutting Granny Liu short Xifeng asked, Where is Master Rong? Booted footsteps sounded and in walked a handsome youth of seventeen or eighteen. Slender and graceful in light furs, he wore a jewelled girdle, fine clothes and a gorgeous hat. Granny Liu didnt know whether to sit or stand and longed for some hiding-place. Sit down, said Xifeng with a twinkle. Its only my nephew. Granny Liu perched gingerly on the edge of the kang. Jia Rong announced cheerfully, My fathers sent me to ask a favour, aunt. Hes expecting an important guest tomorrow, and hed like to borrow that glass screen for the kang that our Grand-Aunt Wang gave you. Hell return it promptly. Youre too late, replied Xifeng. I gave it to somebody only yesterday. Chuckling, Jia Rong half knelt by the foot of the kang. If you wont lend it, aunt, Ill be given another sound thrashing for not asking properly. Have pity on your nephew! You seem to imagine all the Wangs things are special. Havent you plenty of stuff of your own over there? Nothing half as good. He laughed. Please, aunt, be kind! Then look out for your skin if you chip it! She ordered Pinger to fetch the keys to the upstairs rooms and find trustworthy people to deliver the screen. Ive brought men to carry it. Jia Rongs face lit up, his eyes twinkled. Ill see that theyre careful. He had barely left when she suddenly called him back. Servants outside echoed, Master Rong, youre asked to go back. The young man hurried in again and stood at attention to hear his aunts instructions. Xifeng sipped her tea slowly and thoughtfully for a while, then said with a laugh Never mind. Come back again after supper. Ive company now and dont feel in the mood to tell you at the moment. So Jia Rong slowly withdrew. Granny Liu felt easy enough at last to say, The reason I brought your nephew here today is that his parents havent a bite to eat. And winters coming on, making things worse. So I brought your nephew here to ask for your help. She nudged Baner. Well, what did your dad tell you? What did he send us here for? Was it just to eat sweets? Xifeng smiled at this blunt way of talking. Dont say any more. I understand. She asked Mrs. Zhou, Has granny eaten yet? We set out first thing in such a rush, wed no time to eat anything, said Granny Liu. At once Xifeng ordered a meal for the visitors. Mrs. Zhou passed on the order and a table was set for them in the east room. Sister Zhou, see that they have all they want, said Xifeng. I cant keep them company. When Mrs. Zhou had taken them to the east room, Xifeng called her back to hear what Lady Wang had said. Her ladyship says they dont really belong to our family, Mrs. Zhou told her. They joined families because they have the same surname and their grandfather was an official in the same place as our old master. We havent seen much of them these last few years, but whenever they came we didnt let them go away empty-handed. Since they mean well, coming to see us, we shouldnt slight them. If they need help, madam should use her own discretion. I was thinking, if we were really relatives it was funny I didnt know the first thing about them. As Xifeng was speaking Granny Liu came back from her meal with Baner, loud in her thanks. Sit down now and listen to me, dear old lady, said Xifeng cheerfully. I know what you were hinting at just now. We shouldnt wait for relatives to come to our door before we take care of them. But weve plenty of troublesome business here, and now that Her Ladyships growing old she sometimes forgets things. Besides, when I took charge recently I didnt really know all our family connections. Then again, although we look prosperous you must realize that a big household has big difficulties of its own, though few may believe it. But since youve come so far today and this is the first time youve asked me for help, I cant send you away empty-handed. Luckily Her Ladyship gave me twenty taels of silver yesterday to make clothes for the maids, and I havent yet touched it.
Suppers ready, Xiren announced. Would you like it now, or a bit later? I dont want any, Im not feeling well, he answered. You go ahead and have yours. In that case, youd better take your cape off. Youll spoil it if you crumple it like that. Never mind. Its not just that its flimsy, but look at that stitching on it you shouldnt spoil it. Touched to the quick by this he sighed, All right then, wrap it up carefully for me and put it away. Ill never wear it again! He stood up to take off the cape and folded it up himself before Xiren could take it. Well, Master Bao! she exclaimed. Why are you putting yourself out like this today? Instead of answering he asked, Where is the wrapper? Sheyue quickly passed it to him and while he wrapped the cape up turned to wink at Xiren. Baoyu sat down by himself then, in low spirits, ignoring them. When the clock on the shelf struck, he looked down at his watch and saw it was half past five. By and by a young maid came in to light the lamp. If you dont want supper, said Xiren, at least have half a bowl of hot congee. If you go without food that may arouse hot humours then we shall have more trouble. He shook his head. Im not hungry. If I force myself to eat, I shall feel worse. Then youd better go to bed early. She and Sheyue prepared the bed, and Baoyu lay down. He tossed and turned but could not sleep, only dozing off when it was nearly dawn. But after no more than the time it takes for a meal, he was awake again. By now Xiren and Sheyue were up. Xiren said, I heard you tossing about last night till the fifth watch, but I didnt like to disturb you. And then I dropped off myself. Did you get any sleep or not? A little, but then somehow I woke up again. Arent you feeling well? Im all right, just rather edgy. Are you going to school today? No, yesterday I asked for a days leave. Id like to amuse myself in the Garden today, but just now I feel cold. Get them to clean up a room for me, and put ready some incense, paper, ink and a brush then you can get on with your work while I sit there quietly for a bit. I dont want to be disturbed. If you want to study quietly, Sheyue said, whod dream of disturbing you? Thats a good idea, agreed Xiren. You wont catch cold, and sitting quietly by yourself you wont be distracted either. But what will you eat today, if youve lost your appetite? Let us know in good time so that we can tell the kitchen. Anything will do dont fuss. But Id like some fruit put in that room to scent it. Which room would be best? Xiren wondered. The only clean one, really, is Qingwens old room. As no one goes there nowadays, its quite tidy. Only it may be chilly. Thats all right, he said. Just put a brazier in there. She readily agreed to this. While they were talking a young maid had brought in a saucer, bowl and pair of chopsticks, which she handed to Sheyue saying Just now Miss Xiren asked for these, and the old woman from the kitchen has brought them. Sheyue saw that it was a bowl of birds-nest soup. Did you order this? she asked Xiren. He had no supper yesterday evening and passed a sleepless night, Xiren explained. I thought he must be feeling hollow inside this morning so I got the girls to ask the kitchen for this. She told the younger maids to bring a table, and Sheyue waited on Baoyu while he finished the soup and rinsed his mouth. Then Qiuwen came in. The rooms been tidied, she said. But Master Bao had better wait till the charcoal is red before going there. Baoyu nodded, too preoccupied by his own thoughts to talk. Soon a young maid came to announce, The writing things have been put ready. Good, he said. Yet another girl announced, Breakfast is ready. Where will you have it, sir? Just bring it here thats simplest. She assented and went out to fetch the food. Baoyu remarked with a smile to Xiren and Sheyue, Im feeling so depressed, I doubt if I can eat anything alone. Why dont you have breakfast with me? If I see you enjoying it, I may eat more. You may like the idea, Master Bao, chuckled Sheyue. But that would never do! Actually it doesnt matter, countered Xiren.
But this small room is even better furnished than that big one, with all these fine things -- whatever they're called -- in it. The more I see of it, the less I want to leave." "I'll show you better places than this," promised Xifeng. Upon leaving Bamboo Lodge they saw a punting party out on the lake. "Since they've got the boats ready, we may as well go aboard," suggested the Lady Dowager. They were on their way to Purple Caltrop Isle and Smartweed Bank when they met several matrons carrying multicoloured lacquered hampers inlaid with gilt designs. Xifeng at once asked Lady Wang where they should breakfast. "Wherever the old lady chooses," was the reply. The Lady Dowager, hearing this, called over her shoulder to Xifeng, "Your third cousin's place is pleasant. Take some people there to get it ready while we go by boat." Then Xifeng turned back with Li Wan, Tanchun, Yuanyang and Hupo, accompanied by the attendants with the food. Having taken a short cut to the Studio of Autumn Freshness, they arranged the tables in Morning Emerald Hall. Yuanyang remarked with a chuckle, "We often say that when the gentlemen feast outside they've someone who can raise a laugh to entertain them. Today we've a female entertainer too." Li Wan was too good-natured to catch on, but Xifeng knew that Granny Liu was meant. "Yes, she should be good for some laughs today," she agreed. Then the two of them began to lay their plans. "You're up to no good," protested Li Wan, smiling. "As bad as children. Mind the old lady doesn't scold you!" "You won't be involved. Just leave the old lady to me," Yuanyang giggled. As they were talking the rest of the party arrived. They sat where they pleased and were first served tea by the maids. Then Xifeng placed before each the ebony chopsticks inlaid with silver which she had brought wrapped in a cambric napkin. "Bring that small cedar table over here," directed the Lady Dowager. "I want our kinswoman to sit next to me. " As her order was carried out Xifeng cast Yuanyang a meaning glance, and the maid led Granny Liu aside to give her some whispered instructions. "This is the custom of our house," she concluded. "If you disregard it people will laugh at you." When all was ready they took seats at the tables. All but Aunt Xue who, having breakfasted already, did not eat anything but sat on one side sipping tea. The old lady had Baoyu, Xiangyun, Daiyu and Baochai at her table Lady Wang had Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun while Granny Liu sat at the table next to the Lady Dowager's. Usually Yuanyang left the younger maids to wait on the old lady during meals, holding ready her rinse bowl, whisk and handkerchief. Today, however, she held the whisk herself and the other maids kept out of the way, realizing that she meant to bait Granny Liu. Yuanyang, standing there, now whispered to the old woman, "Don't forget!" "Don't worry, miss," was the answer. Having taken her seat Granny Liu picked up the chopsticks, but found them too awkward to manage. For Xifeng and Yuanyang had decided to give her an old-fashioned pair of square-edged ivory chopsticks inlaid with gold. "Why, these prongs are heavier than our iron shovels," the old woman complained. "How can I handle them?" As everyone laughed, a matron brought in a box and stood holding it while a maid removed the cover, revealing two bowls. Li Wan put one on the Lady Dowager's table and Xifeng set the other, containing pigeon's eggs, before Granny Liu. The Lady Dowager urged her to make a start. Granny Liu stood up then and declaimed at the top of her voice -800 "Old woman Liu, I vow, Eats more than any cow, And down she settles now To gobble an enormous sow. " Then she dried up abruptly, puffing out her cheeks and staring down at her bowl. The others had been staggered at first but now everyone, high and low, started roaring with laughter. Xiangyun shook so uncontrollably that she sputtered out the rice she had in her mouth, while Daiyu nearly choked and collapsed over the table gasping, "Mercy!" Baoyu fell convulsively into his grand mother's arms and she chuckled as she hugged him to her crying, "My precious!" Lady Wang wagged one finger at Xifeng but was laughing too much to speak.
As for Xiangyun's marriage, that was her uncle's idea and all went well to start with, but now her husband's died of consumption and she's made up her mind never to marry again, poor thing. How can I have the heart to let Qiaojie marry into the wrong family?" As she was talking, Pinger called on Baochai to find out Lady Xing's intentions, and Lady Wang told her what the latter had said. Pinger, speech- -400 less at first, fell on her knees then implored, "Qiaojie's whole future is in your hands, madam! If we trust them, not only will the girl have a wretched life, but how are we to account for it to Master Lian when he comes home?" "You're a sensible girl," Lady Wang replied. "Get up and listen to me. The Elder Mistress, after all, is Qiaojie's grandmother. If she decides on this, how am I to stop her?" Baoyu insisted, "It doesn't matter, if only you're clear-headed." For fear that in his madness he might disclose her appeal to Lady Wang, Pinger did not remonstrate with him but left soon afterwards. Lady Wang's anxiety made her heart palpitate. She told maids to help her to her room to lie down but would not let Baoyu and Baochai attend her, saying, "A little rest will set me right." However, she was so troubled in her mind that when word was brought that Li Wan's aunt had called she did not feel up to entertaining her. Jia Lan came in then to pay his respects and reported, "This morning a letter came from my grandfather, which the servants at the gate brought in to my mother. She wanted to bring it to you, but then my grand-aunt arrived, so she told me to deliver it instead, madam. My mother will be coming presently and so will my grand-aunt, she says." He presented the letter. "What has your grand-aunt come for?" asked Lady Wang. "I don't know," he answered. "I only heard her mention some letter from my aunt Li Qi's future in-laws." Lady Wang realized that since a match had been arranged and betrothal gifts exchanged between Zhen Baoyu and Li Wan's cousin Li Qi, the Zhen family must be wanting to go ahead with the marriage and Aunt Li had come to discuss this. She nodded and opened the letter, in which she read -720 My journey has been delayed by the ships all along the river returning from their successful coastal campaign. I hear that Tanchun is coming to the capital with her father-in-law and husband, and wonder if you have any news of her. I received Lian's letter about the Elder Master's illness, but do not know if there is more definite news. Baoyu and Lan will shortly be taking the examination they must study hard and not slack. It will be some time before the old lady's coffin can be conveyed to our native place. My health is good have no worry on that score. Tell Baoyu and the others what I have written. Rong will write separately. -400 To this were appended the date and Jia Zheng's signature. Lady Wang returned the letter to Lan saying. "Take this to show your Uncle Bao, then give it back to your mother." Just then, however, Li Wan brought over her aunt to pay their respects, and Lady Wang offered them seats. Aunt Li told her of the Zhen family's wish to expedite Li Qi's wedding, and they talked this over. Then Li Wan asked Lady Wang, "Have you read the master's letter, madam?" "Yes, I have." Jia Lan showed it to his mother, whose comment was, "Tanchun hasn't been back once in all these years since her marriage. Now that she's coming to the capital you can feel much easier in your mind, madam." "Yes," said Lady Wang. "I had palpitations of the heart just now but this news has made me feel better. I only wonder when she will arrive." When Aunt Li had asked whether Jia Zheng had had a good journey, Li Wan said to her son, "Did you read the letter? It's nearly time for the examination and your grandfather has it very much on his mind. You must take his letter to show Uncle Bao." "They haven't passed the first degree how can they sit for the provincial examination?" Aunt Li inquired. Lady Wang explained, "When his grandfather was Grain Commissioner he bought him and Baoyu the rank of Imperial College Student." Aunt Li nodded and Jia Lan went off with the letter to find Baoyu. After seeing his mother to her room, Baoyu had gone back to amuse himself by reading the chapter "Autumn Water" in Zhuang Zi.
Continuing to saunter along, she asked how many items had been performed. The answer was Eight or nine. They had now reached the back door of the Pavilion of Heavenly Fragrance, where Baoyu was amusing himself with some maids. No silly tricks now, Cousin Baoyu, she warned him. The ladies are all in the gallery, one of the girls told her. Just up those stairs, madam. Xifeng gathered up her skirts to mount the stairs and found Madam You waiting for her on the landing. You and your niece are so thick, I thought youd never tear yourself away, teased Madam You. Youd better move over tomorrow and stay with her. Sit down now and let me give you a toast. Xifeng asked Lady Xing and Lady Wangs permission to be seated and exchanged a few polite remarks with Madam Yous mother, then she sat down beside her hostess to sip wine and watch the performance. Madam You sent for the list of their repertoire and asked her to choose a few items. How can I presume when Their Ladyships are present? demurred Xifeng. Old Mrs. You has chosen several already, replied Lady Xing and Lady Wang. Its your turn to pick a couple of good ones for us. Xifeng rose to signify obedience. Taking the list she read through it and marked The Resurrection 1 and The Rhapsody 2 Handing it back she observed, When theyve finished this Double Promotion 3 therell be just time enough for these two. Yes, said Lady Wang. We must let our hosts have some rest soon. Especially as this is a worrying time for them. You come over so seldom, protested Madam You, I do hope youll stay a bit longer. Its early yet. Xifeng stood up to look below and asked, Where are the gentlemen? Theyve gone to drink in the Pavilion of Lingering Dawn, replied one of the matrons. They took the musicians with them. Our presence cramps their style, remarked Xifeng. I wonder what theyre up to behind our backs? How can you expect everybody to be as proper as you? said Madam You jokingly. So they laughed and chatted till the plays came to an end, when the wine was taken away and rice brought in. After the meal they returned to the drawing-room for tea, then ordered their carriages and took their leave of old Mrs. You. They were seen to their carriages by Madam You, attended by all the concubines and maids, and there they found the young men waiting with Jia Zhen. The latter urged Lady Xing and Lady Wang to come back again the next day, but Lady Wang declined. Weve spent the whole day here and were tired. We shall have to rest tomorrow. Jia Rui kept his eyes on Xifeng as the visitors got into their carriages and drove off. After Jia Zhen and the others had gone indoors, Li Gui led round Baoyus horse and the boy mounted it and followed his mother home. When Jia Zhen and all the young men had dined, the party broke up and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day. Xifeng dropped in more often now to see Keqing, who seemed slightly better on some days although in general her health did not improve, to the great dismay of her husband and his parents. And ha Rui, calling several times on Xifeng, invariably found she had gone to the Ning Mansion. The thirtieth day of the eleventh month would be the winter solstice. As it approached, the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and Xifeng sent daily to inquire after Keqing and were told each time that she was neither better nor worse. Its a hopeful sign, Lady Wang told the Lady Dowager, if an illness grows no worse at a season like this. Yes, of course, replied the old lady. If anything were to happen to the dear child, Im sure it would break my heart. In her distress she sent for Xifeng and said, You and she have always been good friends. Tomorrows the first of the twelfth month, but the day after that I want you to call on her and see just how she is. If shes any better, come and tell me. That would take a great weight off my mind. And you must have the things she used to like to eat made and sent round. Xifeng promised to do this and after breakfast on the second she went to the Ning Mansion to see Keqing. Although the invalid appeared no worse, she had grown very thin and wasted. Xifeng sat and chatted with her for some time, assuring her that she had no cause for alarm. Whether Ill ever recover or not well know when spring comes, said Keqing.
Very important. I must say! Go back quickly and tell Xiren from me not to try to settle any business today. Every single request you make will be refused. Qiuwen asked the reason and all of them promptly told her. Theyre looking for some big issues and someone who counts to make an example of as a warning to everyone, Pinger explained. Why should you bump your head against this brick wall? If you go in now, they can hardly make an example of you, out of deference to Their Ladyships but if they dont they may be accused of bias, of not daring to touch those backed by Their Ladyships and just picking on the weak instead. Wait and see. Theyre even countermanding a few of the Second Mistress rulings too thats their only way to stop gossip. Qiuwen stuck out her tongue in dismay. Thank goodness you came here. Sister Pinger! she cried. Youve saved me from a snubbing. Ill go straight back and tell them. With that she left. At this point Baochais meal arrived and Pinger sent in to seve her. Concubine Zhao had now left and the three others were eating on the couch, Baochai facing south, Tanchun west and Li Wan east. The matrons waited quietly outside on the verandah, none but personal serving-maids venturing to go in. Wed better watch our step and not try anything on, said the matrons softly. Mrs. Wu was went off with a flea in her ear, and do we have more face than she does? They decided not to go in until lunch was over. All was quiet now inside, with no clatter of bowls or chopsticks. Presently a maid raised the portiere and two others carried out the table. Three girls from the boiler house had brought three basins of water, and as soon as the table was removed they went in, reappearing before long with the basins and rinse-bowls. Then Daishu, Suyun and Yinger took in three covered bowls of tea on trays. When these three came out again Daishu instructed the younger maids, You must see to things here till we come back from our meal. Dont sneak off to have a rest. Then, slowly, the matrons made their reports in turn, not presuming to behave with their previous impertinence. Tanchun, somewhat mollified, remarked to Pinger. Ive just happened to remember something important Ive been meaning to discuss with your mistress. Come back straight after your meal, will you? As Miss Baochai is here too, the four of us can talk it over before asking your mistress whether she agrees or not. Pinger assented and left. Why were you away so long? asked Xifeng on her return. Pinger gave her a detailed account of all that had happened. Splendid! Good for Tanchun! Xifeng smiled. What did I always say? Its too bad she wasnt fated to be the mistress own daughter. So you, too, talk nonsense, dear madam! retorted Pinger. She may not be the mistress own child, but everyone has to show her the same respect as the other daughters of the house. You dont understand. Xifeng sighed. Though we may say theyre the same, a girl cant compare with a boy. When the time comes to arrange her marriage, some foolish people will first ask whether shes the daughter of the wife or of a concubine, and most likely refuse her in the second case. Although, not to mention a concubines child, even one of the maids in our family is better than the daughters of other households. Some unlucky family may lose an excellent daughter-in-law by insisting on the wifes daughter, and some lucky one may do well by not being so choosy. She changed the subject then, continuing, You know how hard Ive tried to save money these last few years, which must have made the whole household secretly curse me. Im riding on a tigers back, and though Im not clamping down too strictly at present I cant let everything slide. Besides, our expenses have increased while our incomes dwindled yet we still have to manage all affairs large and small according to the ancestors old rules, in spite of less money coming in every year. If I economize too much, outsiders may jeer and Their Ladyships will feel the pinch, while the rest of the household complain of my stinginess. On the other hand, if I dont devise ways to save money in good time, another few years may see us bankrupted. Thats very true, agreed Pinger. And theres big expenditure still to come with the marriages of three or four young ladies and two or three young masters, as well as the Old Ancestress funeral.
There were so many visitors about that day that, fearing Qin Zhong might be slighted, he urged him to go with him to see Xifeng. Qin Zhong objected that she would be too busy to welcome visitors and might think them a nuisance. Us, a nuisance? retorted Baoyu. Not a bit of it. Come on. He took Qin Zhong to the annex where Xifeng was having a meal. At sight of them she smiled. You do have long legs, dont you? Come and join me. Weve eaten already, Baoyu told her. Here? Or over in the other house? Why should we eat here with these dolts? We had a meal over there with the old lady. He and Qin Zhong sat down. As soon as the meal was finished, a woman from the Ning Mansion arrived with an indent for incense and lamps. I knew it was time for you to come today but thought youd forgotten, observed Xifeng, smiling. If you had, youd have had to pay for them yourself. And so much the better for me. It quite slipped my mind, replied the maid cheerfully. I only remembered a moment ago and hurried here just in time. She took the tally and went off. Soon the tally was returned and the amount entered. You use the same tallies in both your mansions, remarked Qin Zhong with a smile. What if someone faked one and ran off with your money? Do you think us such a lawless lot? Xifeng asked, laughing. How is it that no one has come from our house to ask for things? put in Baoyu. When they came you were still fast asleep. But tell me, when are you two going to start your evening lessons? Wed like to start right away. Only we cant because theyre so slow getting the study ready. If youll treat me, Ill speed things up. How can you? Theyre doing it in their own good time. They need materials for the job. They cant do a thing if I withhold the tally. Baoyu cuddled up to her at that and coaxed, Dear cousin, do give them the tally so that they can get what they need. Im so tired, my bones are aching, protested Xifeng. Must you jostle me like that? Dont worry, theyve just taken the wall-paper for your study. You must be crazy if you think they need telling when to ask. When Baoyu refused to believe this she made Caiming show him the record. Just then someone announced that Zhaoer was back from Suzhou and Xifeng promptly ordered him to be brought in. Zhaoer fell on one knee to greet her. Why have you come back? she asked. The master sent me, madam. Lord Lin died on the third of the ninth month, at nine in the morning. The master and Miss Lin are escorting his coffin to Suzhou and should be home about the end of the year. He sent me to bring the news with his greetings and to ask for the old ladys instructions. I was to see, too, if you were well at home, madam, and to take back some of his fur-lined gowns. Have you reported to the other ladies? Yes, madam. Everyone. With that he withdrew. Xifeng turned to Baoyu with a smile. Now your cousin Daiyu can stay with us a good long time. Poor thing! exclaimed Baoyu. Think how much she must have been crying the last few days. He knit his brows and sighed. Xifeng was anxious for news of her husband but had not liked to question Zhaoer too closely in the presence of others. Tempted to go home but kept by unfinished business and afraid of making herself look ridiculous, she had to restrain her impatience until the evening, when she summoned Zhaoer to give her all the particulars of their journey. That same night she got Pinger to help her select some fur-lined clothes and carefully thought out what else her husband might need. Having packed these things together she handed them to Zhaoer and cautioned him Mind you look after your master properly outside and dont make him angry. Try to keep him from drinking too much, and dont pander to him by finding him loose women if you do, Ill break your legs when you get back. By then it was well after the fourth watch and though she went to bed she had lost all desire to sleep. Soon it was dawn. She made a hasty toilet and went over to the Ning Mansion. Now that the day for the funeral was approaching, ha Zhen drove in person with a geomancer to Iron Threshold Temple to inspect the repository for the coffin and enjoin on Abbot Sekong, who was in charge, the need for the finest furnishings and the help of the most noted monks for the coffins reception.
One evening after drinking, Xue Pan ordered Baochan to bring him some tea. Before taking the cup he squeezed her hand and Baochan, pretending to shrink away, let the cup fall with a clatter to her ground, splashing her clothes as well as the floor with tea. To cover his confusion, Xue Pan accused the maid of carelessness. She retorted, You didnt take it properly sir. Jingui smiled sarcastically. Youre both pretty obvious. Do you take me for a fool? Xue Pan lowered his head with a sheepish smile and said nothing as Baochan left the room, blushing. Later, at bedtime, Jingui deliberately urged her husband to sleep elsewhere. I dont want to see you eating your heart out, she said. He simply grinned. If you want something, tell me, she continued. Acting on the sly is no good. Emboldened by wine, Xue Pan knelt on the quilt and nuzzled her. Good sister, just give me Baochan and Ill do whatever you say! If you want someones brains, Ill get them for you! What senseless talk! she retorted. If youve taken a fancy to someone, say so outright, and we can make her your concubine to avoid any hint of scandal. Why should I care? Xue Pan was so delighted with this assurance that he thanked her most profusely and did his best to pleasure her as a husband should that night. The next day he stayed indoors killing time at home, feeling increasingly randy. After lunch, Jingui deliberately went out to clear the coast for them both, and Xue Pan started making advances to Baochan. Well aware of what he wanted, she only made a show of resisting. And he was about to have his way with her when Jingui who had waited till she reckoned that they would be locked together, called for young Sheer, a maid she had brought from her home. Being an orphan with no one to care for her, this girl had been given the name She meaning waif and assigned rough jobs to do. Now, according to her plan, Jingui summoned her. Go and get Qiuling to fetch my handkerchief from my room, she ordered. No need to tell her that these are my instructions. Sheer went straight to find Xiangling. Miss Qiuling, our mistress has left her handkerchief in her room, she said. Wouldnt you like to fetch it and take it to her? Now Xiangling, upset by all Jinguis recent unkindness to her, had been trying in every way to placate her so on hearing this she hurried to her mistress room. All unwittingly she burst in just as the two of them were setting to work. Flushing crimson up to her ears, she promptly fled. As Xue Pan felt he had cleared himself with his wife, and apart from her there was no one he need be afraid of, he had not even bothered to bolt the door. Thus when Xiangling burst in, although a little put out he did not much care. Baochan, however, had a sharp tongue and a strong sense of self-importance. Xianglings sudden intrusion made her wish the earth would swallow her up. At once she pushed Xue Pan away and rushed out of the room crying rape. Xue Pan had been to great pains getting hold of Baochan. Now his frustration, owing to Xiangling, naturally turned his excitement into savage hatred for her. He ran out and spat at her. You damn bitch! he swore. Why come barging in here now? Xiangling, knowing that she was in trouble, darted away. Then Xue Pan looked for Baochan and, failing to find her, loosed off more abuse at Xiangling. After dinner that evening, befuddled with wine, he happened to scald his feet because the bath water was rather hot. Blaming this on Xiangling he ran out, stark naked as he was, to kick and beat her. The poor girl had never been treated so badly before, but there was nothing she could do except to slip away nursing her grievance. By now Jingui had told Baochan in confidence to spend the night with Xue Pan in Xianglings room and become his concubine. When Xiangling, ordered to sleep with her, demurred, she accused her of thinking her bed too dirty or of being too lazy to wait on her mistress at night. That oaf of a master of yours falls for every girl he sees, she swore. Hes grabbed my maid, yet doesnt send you to attend me. Whats his idea? Is he trying to hound me to death? Xue Pan, hearing this, feared he might be thwarted again and therefore joined in too. You ungrateful bitch! he roared at Xiangling.
She can hardly last more than a day or two now. Just then Zijuan lifted the portiere and stepped in. Whats all this? she exclaimed softly. If you want to talk, talk outside instead of here. Youll be the death of her! This is so extraordinary, cried Daishu, I simply cant believe it! Good sister, dont take offence, retorted Zijuan, but really you have no sense! You should have known better than to spread such gossip. 2733 As they were talking they heard Daiyu cough. Zijuan ran to the kang to attend to her while the two other girls fell silent. Bending over Daiyu, Zijuan asked her softly, Do you want some water, miss? Yes, was the faint reply. Xueyan at once poured half a cup of boiled water which Zijuan took from her. Daishu stepped forward too, but Zijuan shook her head to make her keep quiet. They stood there until Daiyu coughed again. Do you want some water, miss? Zijuan asked again. Once again Daiyu murmured her assent and tried to raise her head, but this was beyond her. Zijuan clambered on to the kang beside her, the cup in her hand. First she made sure that the water was neither too hot nor too cold, then held it to Daiyus lips, supporting her head while she sipped. As she looked eager for more, instead of removing the cup Zijuan held it there while she took another sip. Then Daiyu shook her head, declining more, and lay down again with a sigh. After a while, half opening her eyes, she asked Was that Daishu talking? Yes, miss, said Zijuan. Daishu, who had not yet left, came over to greet her. Daiyu opened her eyes to look at her and nodded. After a pause she said, When you go back, give my regards to your mistress. Guessing that she wanted to be left in peace, Daishu quietly slipped away. Now Daiyu though so gravely ill had been clear in her mind. She had caught a sentence here and there of the conversation between Daishu and Xueyan, but she lay as if unconscious, owing partly to sheer weakness. From what she overheard she realized that the match proposed had not been agreed to. And then Daishu had quoted Xifeng as saying that the old lady had decided on choosing some relative from the girls in the Garden. Who could this mean if not her? At this thought, her despair gave way to joy and her mind became clearer too. That was why she had drunk some water and why she had wanted to question Daishu. Just then the old lady arrived with Lady Wang, Li Wan and Xifeng 2735 who had hurried over after hearing Zijuans report. Daiyu, her fears set at rest now, naturally no longer wanted to die. Though still weak and lacking in energy, she managed to answer their inquiries briefly. Seeing this, Xifeng called Zijuan over. What do you mean by frightening us like that? she demanded Your young ladys not in such a bad way after all. She really looked bad, replied Zijuan. Otherwise I wouldnt have presumed to disturb you. Now, coming back, Im quite amazed to find her so much better. Dont listen to her. What does she know? said the old lady with a smile . When somethings wrong, it shows good sense to report it. I like a girl whos not too lazy to use her tongue and feet. They stayed talking a little longer, then believing Daiyu to be in no danger they left, Truly -732 The cure for a broken heart is heartening news The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. So by degrees Daiyu recovered, and her two maids secretly gave thanks to Buddha. Xueyan remarked to Zijuan, Thank goodness shes better now! Her falling ill was odd, and so was her recovery. Her falling ill wasnt odd, replied Zijuan, but her recovery is. I suppose she and Baoyu must be destined for each other. As people say, The way to happiness is never smooth and Nothing can prevent a match made in Heaven. So it seems human wishes are willed by Providence, and they are fated to marry. Another thing remember that year when I told Baoyu Miss Lin would be going back south? He flew into such a frenzy, he nearly turned the whole household upside down! This time another casual remark nearly cost our young lady her life. What is this if not a case of predestined fate? They had a good laugh in secret, after which Xueyan said again, Well, thank goodness shes better.
"Just now the Second Master sent for me and said, 'Of course we must do things in style for the old lady. People in the know are aware that she provided for her own funeral those not in the know may think that we kept some money tucked away and are still well-off. But if this silver of hers isn't used, who wants it? It should still all be spent on her. The old lady's from the south, where there is a graveyard but no houses for offering sacrifices. As her coffin's to go back to the south, we should keep some money to build houses in the ancestral graveyard and use the remainder to buy a few acres of fields to provide for sacrifices. Even if we don't return south ourselves we can let some poor relations live there, to sacrifice to her during festivals and to see to the upkeep of the grave.' Don't you agree that that's a sound idea? So how can we spend the whole sum on the funeral?" "Have they issued the silver yet?" 'Who's seen any silver? All I know is that after my mother heard this she thoroughly approved, telling the Second Master and Mistress that it was a good idea. So what can I do? Now the men putting up the funeral sheds outside want several hundred taels, but no silver has been issued. When I went to draw some, they said they had the money but we should get the workmen to finish the job before settling accounts with them. Just think, all those servants with money have skedaddled. When we call the roll, some are said to be on sick leave, others 10 have gone to the farm. Those few left here, unable to leave, are just out to make money. Who's going to advance us any?" Xifeng was struck speechless. Eventually she asked, "Then how are We to manage?" Just then a maid came in and said, "The Elder Mistress wants to ask you, madam, why everything's still topsy-turvy though today is the third day. After the sacrifice, why keep relatives waiting around? She called several times for the meal before the dishes came without any rice. What way is this to manage?" Xifeng at once went to expedite the servants and manage to get a meal of sorts served to the guests. As ill luck would have it, many guests had come, but all the servants were so apathetic that Xifeng had to see to things herself. Then in her concern she burned out and made Lai Wang's wife summon all the serving-women to assign them different tasks. The women accepted these but made no move. "What time is it?" Xifeng demanded. "Why haven't you prepared the sacrificial offerings?" "That's easily done," they answered. "But first we have to be issued with supplies." "You stupid creatures!" fumed Xifeng. "Of course you'll get what you need for the jobs you're given." The women went off then reluctantly, while Xifeng hurried to the main apartment to ask Their Ladyships' permission to fetch what would be needed. She could hardly do this, however, in front of so many guests. As it was nearing sunset, she had to find Yuanyang and tell her which of the old lady's things she wanted. "Why ask me?" replied Yuanyang. "Didn't Master Lian pawn them that year? Has he ever redeemed them?" "We don't need gold or silver, just an ordinary dinner service." "Hasn't that gone to Lady Xing and Madam You?" Xifeng realized that this was so and went to Lady Wang's quarters to find Yuchuan and Caiyun. Having got what she required from them she hastily made Caiming list these things, then handed them over to the serving-women. Xifeng had looked so flustered that Yuanyang did not like to call her back. She wondered, "Why is she bungling things like this now when she used to be such a good manager? In the last few days things have been at Sixes and sevens. The old lady's love for her was thrown away!" She was unaware that Lady Xing had concurred with Jia Zheng's proposal because she had been worrying about her family's future and was eager to put something by. Besides, as the old lady's funeral should have been superintended by the senior branch of the family, although Jia She was away, each time there was some decision to make punctilious Jia Zheng would say, "Ask the Elder Mistress." Lady Xing had always considered Xifeng extravagant and Jia Lian unreliable and would therefore not let any money out of her hands. Yuanyang, assuming that the funeral expenses had already been issued, suspected Xifeng of floundering because she did not take the business seriously.
Give me a little time, dear sister, countered Xifeng. Why should you, who are usually so good to me, be so hard on me today just because of Pinger? You used to say, However busy you are, you must take good care of your health and find time to rest. Yet now you want to kill me with overwork! Besides, it doesnt matter if other peoples clothes are late, but youre responsible for these young ladies being ready on time. If theyre not, the old lady will scold you for not seeing to it or at least reminding me. Id rather take the blame myself than get you into trouble. Listen, the rest of you, to this fine talk! Li Wan smiled. What a clever tongue! Tell me, are you going to take charge of our club or not? What do you think? If I dont join your club and fork out some money, Ill be looked on as a traitor to Grand View Garden. How could I go on living here then? First thing tomorrow I shall proceed to my post, respectfully accept the seal of office, and then straightway give you fifty silver taels to spread over for several months for your clubs refreshments. And as I cant write poems or essays being just completely vulgar whether you call me supervisor or not, a few days after Ive paid up you can still drive me away. Amid general laughter she went on, Ill open the storeroom presently and tell them to fetch out all the painting materials for your inspection. If theres anything of use to you, you can have it and if youll make out a list of whats still missing, Ill send people to buy it. Ill supply you with the silk for the painting too. The drawing of the Garden isnt with the mistress, Lord Zhen still has it. Im telling you this to save you a trip for nothing. Ill have it fetched and sent with the silk for the secretaries to work on. How about that? Li Wan nodded. Thank you. If youll really do that Ill let bygones be bygones. All right, lets go. If she doesnt send the things, we can come and pester her again. As she started off with the girls Xifeng remarked, Theres only one person who could have put you up to all this, and thats Baoyu. Li Wan turned back with a smile. Oh yes! Id forgotten. It was Baoyu we came about. He was the one who didnt turn up at our first meeting but we were too soft with him. What should his punishment be? After a seconds thought, Xifeng replied, The only thing I can think of is to make him sweep all your floors for you. They approved laughingly and were on the point of leaving when Granny Lai came in, leaning on a young maids arm. Xifeng and the others hastily rose, urged her to sit down and offered her congratulations. Seating herself on the edge of the kang she said Our masters and mistresses are rejoicing over our good fortune, and we owe it all to your kindness. Yesterday when you sent Caiming over with presents too, madam, my grandson kowtowed his thanks at the gate. Li Wan asked, When will he be leaving to take up his post? Granny Lai sighed. I pay no attention to their affairs, they do just as they please. When he kowtowed to me at home the other day, I gave him apiece of my mind. I said, Child, dont start throwing your weight about now that youre an official. Youre thirty this year and, though you were born in bondage, our masters were kind enough to give you your freedom the moment you came out of your mothers womb. Thanks to the generosity of your masters above as well as your parents below, you were able to study like a young gentleman, cossetted by maids and nurses as if you were a phoenix. Though youve reached this age I doubt if you even know how the word slave is written. All you know is how to enjoy yourself. It doesnt occur to you, I said, that you owe your present position to the generations of hardship your grandfather and father had to go through. Youve had one trouble after another since you were a boy, and the money weve spent on you would make a silver statue bigger than you are. When you were twenty our masters were kind enough to help you purchase an official post, although plenty of real gentlefolk go hungry. You were born a slave, so watch out dont tempt fortune too far. After having an easy life of it for ten years you managed somehow -- Heaven only know how -- to get our masters to have you selected for this post. A district magistrate may not rank too high yet he has a lot of work to do as the father and mother of everyone in the district.
Let me go to the Ancestral Temple and weep for my old master, he fumed. Little did he expect to beget such degenerates, a houseful of rutting dogs and bitches in heat, day in and day out scratching in the ashes 5 and carrying on with younger brothers-in-law. Dont think you can fool me. I only tried to hide the broken arm in your sleeve.... These obscenities frightened the servants half out of their wits. Hurriedly trussing him up, they stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung. Xifeng and Jia Rong pretended not to have heard, whereas Baoyu in the carriage was rather entertained by this drunken outburst. Did you hear that, sister? he asked. Whats meant by scratching in the ashes? Dont talk nonsense, snapped Xifeng, glowering. Whats come over you? You not only listen to drunken raving but have to ask questions too. Just wait until we get back and I tell your mother youll pay for this with a thrashing. Dear sister, apologized Baoyu fearfully, I promise not to do it again. Thats more like it, brother. The important thing, once were home, is to talk to the old lady about sending you and your nephew Qin Zhong to school. They were back now in the Rong Mansion. To know what followed, turn to the next chapter. Good looks pave the way to friendship, A mutual attraction starts boys studying. Chapter 70 Daiyu Starts Another Poetry Club Peach-Blossom Society Xiangyun Dashes Off a Poem on Willow Catkins Jia Lian attended the funeral ceremonies at Pear Fragrance Court for seven days and seven nights, during which monks and priests chanted sutras. Then the Lady Dowager summoned him and forbade him to send the coffin to the family temple, so all he could do was choose a spot near Third Sisters grave and arrange with of the temple to have Second Sister buried there. Only members of the clan, Wang Xin and his wife, Madam You and her daughter-in-law were present at the interment. Xifeng did not lift a finger to help, leaving Jia Lian to manage everything himself. New Year was now approaching and, on top of the host of things that had to be seen to, Lin Zhixiao brought a list of eight men-servants who had reached the age of twenty-five and not yet married, to ask whether there were any maids due to leave who would make them suitable wives. Xifeng having read the list went to consult the old lady and Lady Wang, but although there were several maids in that category they found objections in the case of each. First, Yuanyang since vowing never to leave their service had neither spoken to Baoyu nor put on fine clothes or make up and in view of her determination, they could hardly force her to marry. Then Hupo was disqualified by illness. And Caiyun, since breaking with ha Huan recently, had also contracted some unknown disease. Apart from them, only the older maid-servants doing rough work for Xifeng and Li Wan were due to leave. The others were too young. So the men had to look for wives outside. While Xifeng was unwell, Li Wan and Tanchun had been too occupied with domestic affairs to have time for anything else and what with celebrating New Year and the Lantern Festival and miscellaneous business, the poetry club had been forgotten. Now, although there was a lull and it was midspring, a whole series of misfortunes Baoyus loss of his friend Liu Xianglian, the suicides of Third Sister and Second Sister, and Liu Wuers illness brought on by mortification had reduced Baoyu to such a state of dejection that he appeared dazed and often raved like a madman. Xiren and his other maids were alarmed but not daring to report this to the old lady they just did their best in every way to divert him. One morning, as soon as he woke he heard giggling and muffled cries from the outer room. Go and rescue her, quick! said Xiren with a smile. Qingwen and Sheyue have pinned Venturina down and are ticking her. Baoyu draped his squirrel-fur jacket over his shoulders and went out to have a look. The three girls had not folded their quilts or put on their outer clothes. Qingwen in a leek- green silk bodice, red silk pants and red slippers, her hair tousled, was sitting astride Fangguan who was being tickled in the ribs by Sheyue in a red silk chemise, an old jacket over her shoulders. Fangguan lying on her back in a flowered bodice, red pants and green socks was thrashing her legs wildly, quite out of breath from laughing.
Autumn is a capricious season of many showers and as dusk fell it grew very dark, while the rain pattering on the bamboo leaves made the place seem unusually lonely. Knowing that Baochai would not come out in this weather, Daiyu picked up a book at random under the lamp. It was an anthology of Yue-fu, containing lyrics such as Autumn Sorrow in a Girl - Chamber and The Pain of Parting. Daiyu was moved to write a poem about separation herself entitled A Windy Rainy Evening by the Autumn Window in the style of A Night of Flowers and Moonlight by the Spring River. This was her poem -718 Sad the autumn flowers, sear the autumn grass, Autumn lamps flicker through the long autumn night Unendurably desolate by the autumn window, In the wind and rain autumn seems infinite. The wind and rain speed autumn on its way, By the window shattering her autumn dream And the girl with autumn in her heart cannot sleep But trims the candle by her autumn screen. Guttering on its stick, the candle sheds tears of wax, Evoking the grief of separation, its pain, As through each autumn courtyard gusts the wind And on each autumn window beats the rain. The autumn wind, through silken quilts strikes chill, Her water-clock the autumn rain spurs on. All night the pelting rain and soughing wind Accompany her tears for one now gone. Chill mist enwraps the court in loneliness, Bamboos drip by the lattice without pause None can tell when the wind and rain will cease, But already tears have soaked her windows gauze. Having read this through, she had just put down her brush and was about to go to bed when Baoyu was announced. And in he walked, in a large hat of plaited bamboo leaves and a coir cape. Where does this fisherman come from? she greet him laughing. Do you feel better today? Have you taken your medicine? How is your appetite? As he made these inquiries he took off his cape and hat and picked up the lamp, shading it with one hand, to examine her face intently. You look a little better today, was his verdict. She saw that he was wearing a red silk coat, no longer new, with a green girdle, green silk trousers embroidered with flowers, cotton socks embroidered with gold thread, and slippers with butterfly and flower designs. Why did you only protect your head and clothes from the rain, not your footwear? she asked. Not that your shoes and socks are dirty either. Ive got a complete set of rain-wear, he told her gaily. I came here in pyrus-wood pattens, which I left outside on the verandah. She noticed then that his cape and hat were not the usual sort sold in the market, but extremely finely made. What plant are they woven of? she asked. You dont look like a hedgehog in that cape, for a wonder. These three things are all presents from the Prince of Beijing. When its raining he wears a similar outfit at home. If you like them, Ill get you a set. The best thing is the hat as its adjustable the crown can be detached. So men or women alike can wear it in winter in the snow. Ill get you one for when it snows this winter. No thank you, Daiyu chuckled. If I wore one of those, I should look like the fishermans wife in paintings and operas. As these words left her lips she remembered with dismay that she had just greeted Baoyu as a fisherman. She flushed scarlet and leaned forward over the table, coughing as if she could never stop. Baoyu, however, appeared not to have noticed. Catching sight of the poem on the table, he picked it up, read it through, and exclaimed in involuntary admiration. Daiyu hearing this instantly snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp. Too late! I know it by heart, he said cheerfully. Im better now. Thank you for coming so often to see me, even in the rain, she said. Now its late and Id like to sleep. Please go now. Come again tomorrow. At this he took from his pocket a golden watch the size of a walnut. Its hands, he saw, showed that it was after nine. Replacing the watch he agreed Yes, its time to turn in. Ive disturbed you too long again. He put on the cape and hat and took his leave, turning back at the door to ask, What would you like to eat? Let me know and Ill tell the old lady first thing in the morning. Im a better messenger than those old women. Ill think about it during the night, and let you know early tomorrow. Listen, how its pouring outside. Youd better go quickly.
And even after Im better I mean to take things easy leave all responsibility to them and have a good time myself. So Im paying no attention, as I said, to that report. If you take that line madam, so much the better for us, Pinger approved. Just then ha Lian came in. With a clap of his hands he sighed. Heres fresh trouble out of the blue ! How did my mother come to hear of Yuanyangs loan to me the other day? Just now she sent for me and asked me to raise two hundred taels no matter where for her Moon Festival expenses. When I told her Id nowhere to raise it she retorted, When youre short yourself you can get a loan, but when I ask your help you fob me off saying youve nowhere to turn. Where did you get stuff the other day to pawn for a thousand taels? You can even spirit away the old ladys things, yet you boggle now at a mere two hundred taels. Its lucky for you I havent told anyone else. I cant believe shes really short of money. Why should she pick on me like this for nothing? There were no outsiders here that day. How did the news leak out? wondered Xifeng. Pinger thought back carefully, then cried, I know! That evening the things were brought over, the mother of the old ladys girl Numskull came to deliver the laundry and stayed chatting for a while in the servants quarters. She must have asked what was in the big case, and one of our maids, not knowing any better, told her. She called in the maids and asked which of them had blabbed to Numskulls mother. In fright the girls dropped to their knees, swearing that none of them dared say a word out of turn whenever questioned about anything they denied all knowledge of it, so how could they have let this secret out? Xifeng saw they were telling the truth. No, they wouldnt dare, she agreed. We mustnt wrong them. Lets not worry about this now but find a way to satisfy Her Ladyship. However short we are ourselves, we mustnt get into her bad books again. She told Pinger to pawn her gold necklace for two hundred taels and have the money sent to Lady Xing. Lets pawn it for four while were at it, suggested Jia Lian. We need money ourselves as well. No, I dont need any, she answered. And we dont know yet how to raise two hundred to redeem it. Pinger sent Lai Wangs wife with the necklace to the pawnshop. And on her return, Jia Lian himself took the money to Lady Xing while Xifeng and Pinger went on trying to guess who had let the cat out of the bag. Her Ladyship knowing doesnt matter much, Xifeng observed. The danger is that her servants may take this chance to gossip and stir up fresh trouble. Those greedy gluttons in the other house, who are always throwing dirt, bear Yuanyang a grudge. If they hear that shes secretly lent things to Master Lian, they may make a commotion and spread outrageous talk. Master Lian can take it, but Yuanyangs a good girl and if shes involved in trouble it will be our fault. Dont worry, Pinger laughed. Yuanyang lent us those things for your sake, not for our masters. Though it sounds like a secret favour, in fact shell have got the old ladys permission first. The old lady only pretends not to know because she has so many grandchildren, and if all of them borrow her things to pawn but then make a scene saying that they cant replace them, how is she to cope? So even if this gets out it wont hurt Yuanyang. Even so, we know Yuanyangs all right, but those who dont know her are bound to think the worst. Just then Lady Wang was announced. Surprised by this unexpected visit, they hurried out to welcome her. They saw that her face was stern and she was accompanied by her confidential maid only. Without a word she went into the inner room and sat down, while Xifeng poured her some tea. You must be in good spirits, Xifeng remarked, to stroll over here today, madam. Lady Wang sharply ordered Pinger to leave the room. Hastily assenting she withdrew with all the other maids, wondering what this foreboded. Having closed the door behind her, she sat on the steps to stop anyone else going in. Xifeng was flustered too and quite bewildered. Then Lady Wang with tears in her eyes produced a sachet from her sleeve. Look at this! Xifeng took it and saw the indecent embroidery on it.
He was running on like this when Miaoyu glanced up at him, then lowered her head again, blushing furiously. Baoyu, cold-shouldered like this, sat down sheepishly at one side. Xichun wanted to finish the game, but after a while Miaoyu said, Lets play some other time. She stood up to smooth down her clothes, but then sat down again and asked Baoyu fatuously, Where did you come from? He had been waiting for her to address him so that he could make up for his earlier tactlessness. However, it occurred to him that she might be testing his understanding. He reddened and could not answer. With a faint smile Miaoyu turned to talk to Xichun. Is that so hard to answer, Second Brother? chuckled Xichun. Have you never heard the saying, I came from where Ive been? Why blush like that as if she were a stranger? Miaoyu took this dig personally. Her heart misgave her and her cheeks burned she knew she must be red in the face too. In her embarrassment she stood up and said, Ive been here so long, I must be getting back to my nunnery. As Xichun knew her ways, instead of pressing her to stay she saw her to the door. Its so long since last I was here, said Miaoyu, I may not be able to find my way back with all those twists and turns. Why not let me show you the way? Baoyu volunteered. Thank you, sir. Please lead on! Taking their leave of Xichun, they left Smartweed Breeze Cot and followed a winding path which took them near Bamboo Lodge. Suddenly they heard a twanging. Where does that luting come from? Miaoyu asked. It must be Cousin Lin playing the lute. Can she play too? Why did she never mention it? Baoyu repeated what Daiyu had said to him. Lets call on her, he proposed. One can only listen to luting, not look at it thats always been the rule, she objected. Im a vulgar person, I know, he said with a grin. Being outside Bamboo Lodge now, they seated themselves on an artificial hill to listen quietly to the clear music. Daiyu was chanting softly The wind is soughing, the days drawing in, Far away, lost in thought, the lovely maid I gaze towards my homewhere is it? Tears stain my dress beside the balustrade. After a pause she continued Far-stretching hills, long rivers, Bright moonlight shining on my window-sill Sleepless I lie beneath faint Milky Way, Clad in thin silk the wind and dew are chill. As she paused again, Miaoyu remarked, The first stanza used the qin rhyme, the second the yang rhyme. Lets hear what follows. Then they heard fresh chanting inside Your lot is not of your choosing, And mine is filled with care You and I are kindred spirits, Revering the ancients that we may not err. Miaoyu commented, Another stanza, but how mournful! Though I dont understand music, it does sound too sad, Baoyu agreed. Inside, they heard the strings being returned. The main string is too high! Miaoyu exclaimed. It may not fit that scale. Inside, Daiyu resumed Life in this world is but a speck of dust, Karma ordains all mortals destiny If Karma rules, then why repine? Would that my heart were pure as the moon in the sky! The colour draining from her face Miaoyu exclaimed, Why did she suddenly play such a high note? Its enough to crack metal or stone! This is too extreme. What do you mean? I doubt if she can keep it up. Even as she said this, they heard the main string snap. Miaoyu stood up and hastily started off. Whats the matter? Baoyu asked. Youll know later dont talk about it. With that she left, and Baoyu went back to Happy Red Court feeling puzzled and depressed. Miaoyu returned to the nunnery, and the old deaconess waiting for her there closed the gate. She sat down for a while to chant the sutra for the day, and after supper burned incense and worshipped Buddha. This done, she dismissed the deaconess for the night. As her couch and back-rest were ready, she quietly let down the curtain and sat cross-legged to meditate, banishing all frivolous thoughts to concentrate on the truth. Some time after midnight, she heard a thud on the roof. Suspecting a thief, she left her couch and went out to the veranda. She saw cloud streamers in the sky and moonlight limpid as water.
The pain continued after she was in bed and made her groan in her sleep. Though Baoyu had not kicked her deliberately, Xiren's obvious discomfort disturbed him. And hearing her cry out during the night he realized how badly he must have hurt her. He slipped out of bed, took the lamp, and went over to have a look. Just as he reached her bedside she coughed, then brought up some phlegm and opened her eyes with a gasp. "What are you doing?" she asked in surprise when she saw him. "You were groaning in your sleep. I must have hurt you badly. Let me have a look." "I feel dizzy and there's a bitter-sweet taste in my throat. Throw the light on the floor, will you?" Baoyu did as she asked and saw that she had coughed blood. "How dreadful!" he exclaimed. Xiren's heart failed her at the sight of the blood. But to know what followed, you must read the next chapter. Chapter 31 A Torn Fan Wins a Smile from a Maid A Pair of Unicorns Suggest a Match When Xiren saw the blood on the floor her heart failed her, for she had often heard tell Spitting blood while young means an early death or infirmity for life. So her dreams of future honour and splendour had gone up in smoke! She could not help shedding tears. Baoyu's heart ached too. "Row are you feeling?" he asked. She forced a smile. "All right." He would have called someone at once to heat Shaoxing wine and fetch pills compounded with goat's blood, but Xiren restrained him. "If you make such a fuss that people come flocking in, they'll blame me for getting above myself," she explained. "At present not a soul knows, but to noise it abroad would be damaging for us both. Just send a boy tomorrow to ask Doctor Wang for some medicine, and that will set me right. Far better keep the whole business quiet." Since this made sense Baoyu had to agree. He fetched tea for Xiren to rinse her mouth and, knowing how worried he was, she lay there quietly letting him wait on her, for otherwise he would have roused the others. Next day, at the crack of dawn, Baoyu scrambled into his clothes. Not stopping to wash or comb his hair, he went off to find Wang Jiren whom he plied with questions. When the doctor heard what had happened, he assured him it was simply a contusion and prescribed some pills, giving directions as to their use which Baoyu carried out on his return to the Garden. But no more of this. This was the day of the Double Fifth Festival. The doors were hung with mugwort and rushes, everyone wore tiger-charms, and Lady Wang gave a family feast at midday to which Aunt Xue and her daughter were invited. Baoyu noticed that Baochai was cold-shouldering him because of what had happened the previous day. His own low spirits were ascribed by his mother to embarrassment over yesterdays episode with Jinchuan, and therefore she deliberately ignored him. Daiyu, for her part, assumed that his dejection was the result of having offended Baochai, and that displeased her too. As for Xifeng, she had heard the evening before from Lady Wang about Baoyu and Jinchuan, and in deference to her aunt's displeasure was not her usual cheerful, laughing self, making the atmosphere even more constrained. As Yingchun and the other Jia girls were affected by the general lack of spirits, the company soon dispersed. Now Daiyu naturally preferred solitude to society. She reasoned, "Coming together can only be followed by parting. The more pleasure people find in parties, the more lonely and unhappy they must feel when the parties break up. So better not forgather in the first place. The same is true of flowers they delight people when in bloom, but it's so heartrending to see them fade that it would be better if they never blossomed." For this reason she grieved over what others enjoyed. Baoyu, on the other hand, wished that parties need never break up, flowers never fade and although he could neither stop a feast from ending nor flowers from withering, he grieved every time this happened. So whereas Daiyu did not care when the feasters parted in low spirits today, Baoyu went back to his room feeling so gloomy that he did nothing but sigh. When Qingwen, who was helping him change, dropped his fan and broke it he sighed "How stupid you are! What's to become of you when in future you have a home of your own? Surely you can't go on being so careless then." "How bad-tempered you've grown lately," she retorted with a snigger.
asked Fangguan. I wouldnt let her, said Mrs. Liu. The young ladies dont know her. If someone who has it in for us were to see her, that would lead to another row. If in future, with your help, she gets a job, shell have so many chances to stroll around she may even get tired of the place. Dont worry, replied Fangguan. You can count on me. Aiya, miss! exclaimed Mrs. Liu. Were of no account, not like you. With that she served tea. But as it was not to Fangguans taste, after just one sip she rose to take her leave. I have my hands full here, said Mrs. Liu. Wuer will see you off. So Wuer went out with Fangguan, and seeing there was nobody about she tugged at her sleeve. Did you really put in a word for me? she asked. Fangguan laughed. Why should I fool you? Ive heard there are definitely two vacancies in our compound. One is Hongyus place Madam Lian took her away but hasnt yet sent anyone to replace her. The other is Zhuiers, which is still vacant too. So merely taking you on wouldnt count as too many. Its just that Pinger keeps telling Xiren that any new requests for people or money shouldnt be raised yet awhile if possible, because Miss Tanchuns looking for someone to make an example of. Even in her own quarters shes turned down two or three requests. Right now shes on the look-out for something in our place to make an issue of so why should we jump into her trap? And if we were turned down now, it would be hard to get the decision changed later. Better wait for things to cool down. When the old lady and the mistress are free, if we approach them first, no matter how big a favour we ask theyre bound to agree to it. Even so, Im feeling too impatient to wait, said Wuer. If I were to be chosen now, in the first place my mother d be able to hold up her head and feel she hadnt brought me up for nothing in the second, my monthly allowance would make things easier for our family in the third, Id feel happier myself and my health might well improve. Even if I still had to see doctors and buy medicine, I neednt spend the familys money on it. I understand, said Fangguan. Just dont worry. Then the two of them went their different ways. Wuer, back home, told her mother how very grateful she was to Fangguan. I never thought wed get all that juice, said Mrs. Liu. Though this is expensive stuff, if you take too much it will increase the hot humours, so why not give some away? That would make a very handsome gift. Give it to whom? To your cousin. Hes been having a fever and was wanting something like this. Ill take him half a cup. Wuer remained silent while her mother poured out half a cup and put the bottle with what was left in the cupboard. Then she said with a faint smile If I were you, I wouldnt send it. If people asked where it came from thered be more trouble. Why should we be afraid of that? After all our hard work, if our masters give us something its only right. We didnt steal this, did we? So ignoring her daughters advice, she went straight off to the house of her elder brother outside, where her nephew was lying in bed. When they saw what she had brought, her brother, sister-in-law and nephew were all delighted. Cold water was drawn from the well to mix with the tonic, and the invalid drinking a bowl of it found it extremely refreshing. What was left in the cup was covered with a piece of paper and put on the table. Now it happened that a few of the Jia family pages who were friendly with the young patient called to see how he was. Among them was Qian Huai, a nephew of Concubine Zhao, both of whose parents worked in the counting-house, and whose own job was escorting Jia Huan to school. No wife had yet been found for him and as he had taken a fancy to pretty Wuer he told his parents he would like to marry her. Time and again they had sent a go-between to propose the match and as they were in easy circumstances and fairly well connected, Liu and his wife were quite willing, but they could not get Wuers consent. Though she did not say so outright, her attitude was so clear that her parents could not accept the offer for her. Recently, moreover, since they hoped she would get a job in the Garden they had let the matter drop, assuming that after a few years when she was released from service she would choose someone else outside.
Then with a smile to Aunt Xue the old lady said, "Let's go. These girls don't really welcome visitors for fear their rooms may be dirtied. We mustn't impose on them. So let's go boating and then have a few drinks." As everyone rose to leave Tanchun protested, "What a thing to say! We only wish you'd come more often." "Yes, my third grand-daughter's good that way," said the old lady. "It's Daiyu and Baoyu who are so pernickety. On our way back, when we're tipsy, we must go there just to annoy them." They trooped out, laughing, and soon reached Watercress Isle where some boatwomen from Suzhou had punted two pyrus-wood boats. Into one of these they helped the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Granny Liu, Yuanyang and Yuchuan. Li Wan followed them and so did Xifeng, who took her stand in the prow meaning to punt. "It's not as easy as it looks!" warned the Lady Dowager from the cabin. "We're not on the river, it's true, but it's fairly deep here. So don't try, and come inside at once." "It's quite safe," cried Xifeng. "Don't worry, Old Ancestress." She pushed off with a shove for the middle of the lake, but when the small overloaded boat started rocking she thrust the pole into the hands of a boatwoman and hastily squatted down. Yingchun and the other girls followed in the second boat with Baoyu, while the rest of the attendants walked along the bank. "How disgusting those withered lotus leaves look," remarked Baoyu. "Why not get people to pull them out?" "What time has there been for that?" countered Baochai with a smile. "We've been out here enjoying ourselves every day recently." Daiyu put in, "I don't like Li Shangyin's 2 verses except for that single line -800 'Leave the withered lotus to hear the patter of rain. But now you two don't want to leave them." "That's a good line," agreed Baoyu. "All right, we won't have them pulled out." They had now reached Reed Creek by Flowery Harbour. In the shade here chill penetrated their very bones, while their awareness of autumn was heightened by the withered grass and caltrops on both sides. The Lady Dowager fixed her eyes on the airy lodge on the bank. "Isn't that where Baochai lives?" she asked. They told her it was. At once she ordered the boats to go alongside and, climbing the stone steps to Alpinia Park, they were greeted by a strange fragrance. The advance of autumn had deepened the green of the rare plants and creepers there, from each of which hung charming clusters of berries like coral beads. The room which they now entered was spotless as a snow cave, with hardly an ornament in the whole place. The desk was bare except for a rough crackleware vase with some chrysanthemums in it, two sets of books and a tea-service. The blue gauze bed-curtains and bedding were also of the simplest. "What a goose this child is!" cried the Lady Dowager. "Why not ask your aunt for some knick-knacks? It didn't occur to me, I just didn't think. Of course you left all your own things at home." Having told Yuanyang to be sure to fetch some curios, she called Xifeng to task. "Why didn't you send over some pretty things for your cousin? How very stingy!" "She wouldn't have them," explained Lady Wang and Xifeng. "She returned all the ones we sent." "She doesn't care for such things at home either," put in Aunt Xue. "This will never do." The old lady shook her head. "She may have simple tastes, but this wouldn't look well if relatives were to call. Besides, it'll bring bad luck for girls, this austerity. Why, in that case we old women ought to live in stables! You've all heard those descriptions in ballads and operas of the elegance of young ladies' boudoirs. Maybe these girls of ours can't compare with those young ladies, but they shouldn't go to the other extreme either. When we've knick-knacks ready at hand why not display them? Of course, if your tastes are simple you can have less. "I used to have a flair for decorating rooms, but now that I'm old I haven't the energy. These girls should learn how to fix up their rooms too. The only trouble is if you've a vulgar taste, for then you'll make even handsome things look frightful but I wouldn't call our girls vulgar.
There was a certain Prince Heng who governed Qingzhou, Jia Zheng told them. What he loved most was feminine beauty, and when at leisure he liked to practise the military arts. So he selected a number of beautiful girls and made them train for battle every day. When at a loose end, he would feast his beauties for days and ask them to display their swordsmanship or to seize or defend a bastion. One of these girls named Lin, the fourth child of her family, was a surpassing beauty and expert too in military arts. She was known as Fourth Mistress Lin. The prince, delighted with her, put her in command of all the other girls and called her his Lovely General. The secretaries all exclaimed in wonder. Lovely followed by General what a very gallant and romantic title! This is really miraculous. Prince Heng himself must have been the most romantic figure of all time! Jia Zheng smiled. Quite so. But what followed is even more amazing and heart-rending. His protgs all asked eagerly, What was that? The next year the Yellow Turbans, Red Brows 2 and other rebels joined forces to raid the region east of the Taihang Mountains. The prince, 2391 thinking them rabble who did not need to be taken seriously, led a light force to wipe them out. However, those rebels were crafty. His forces lost two battles, and the prince was killed by the rebels. Then all the civil and military officers in the provincial capital said to each other If even the prince could not beat them, what can we do? They wanted to surrender. But Fourth Mistress Lin hearing this bad news assembled her women soldiers and announced We were shown such favour by the prince in the past that we shall never be able to repay a fraction of it. Now that he has fallen in defence of the royal cause, I want to die for him too. Any of you who wish to follow me may the rest are free to leave. When the other women saw how determined she was, they all volunteered to join her. So that same night Fourth Mistress Lin led them out of the city to attack the rebels camp. The rebels were caught unawares and several of their chieftains were killed. Then seeing that their opponents were only a few women whom they reckoned couldnt amount to much, they counter-attacked and after some hard fighting killed them all, including Fourth Mistress Lin. And so she succeeded in proving her loyalty. When this was reported to the capital the Emperor and all his ministers were shocked and moved and naturally sent troops to crush the rebels. As soon as the Imperial troops arrived, the rebellion was suppressed we need not go into that. But, gentlemen, after hearing this story of Fourth Mistress Lin, dont you think it admirable! Truly admirable and amazing! exclaimed his secretaries. This is really a wonderful subject. We should all write something to commemorate her. One of them had already picked up a brush and written a short preface based on ha Zhengs account simply changing a few words. He now handed this to his patron to read. Thats the idea, said Jia Zheng. Actually, a short account has already been written. The other day an Imperial Decree was issued ordering a search to be made for all those who should have been commended but were left out of past records, whether monks, nuns, beggars or women, as long as they had performed some worthy deed. The ac- 2393 counts were to be sent to the Board of Rites for the Emperors approval. So this account was sent to the Board of Rites. And after hearing this story, you should all write a poem on the Lovely Generals loyalty and sense of honour. So we should, they all agreed, laughing. And whats still more admirable is the fact that our dynasty is showing such unprecedented kindness, unmatched in earlier times. The men of Tang said, Our sagacious court overlooks nothing, and this has come true today. Our dynasty lives up to this prediction. Jia Zheng nodded. Exactly. As they were speaking, Huan and Lan arrived, and Jia Zheng told them to look at the subject. Though both of them, like Baoyu, could write poetry, this was not their special line. When it came to writing examination papers, Huan and Lan might surpass Baoyu but when it came to literature in general, they were much inferior. Besides, they lacked Baoyus literary brilliance and poetic flair. Thus the poems they wrote were like eight-section essays, inevitably stereotyped and pedantic. Baoyu, though not to be reckoned a good scholar, had innate intelligence and loved to browse on literature of all kinds. He believed that some ancient classics were apocryphal and contained errors too, thus they should not be taken for gospel moreover, if one had too many scruples and just stuck together phrases from old books, such writing would be most uninteresting.
Since Ive been falsely accused, why shouldnt I at least have this satisfaction? While she was still speaking her cousins wife lifted the portiere and burst in, smirking. Fine, I heard all you two said! She turned to Baoyu. What is a young master doing in a servants room? Have you come to seduce me, thinking me young and pretty? Hush, good sister! Not so loud! he begged. Shes worked for me all these years, so I slipped in to see her. Miss Deng hustled him into the inner room. You dont want me to shout, she chortled. All right if youll be nice to me. She plumped down on the edge of the kang hugging Baoyu to her. He had never seen such behaviour as this before. His heart beating fast he blushed all over his face. Good sister, dont tease me! he pleaded. Miss Deng laughed tipsily. Bah! Ive always heard that you were a ladys man. What makes you so bashful today? Flushing crimson he implored, Do let go of me, then we can talk properly. If the old woman outside hears how awful ! I came back long ago and sent her to wait for you at the Garden gate, she laughed. Ive been waiting and waiting for a chance like this, but now that youre here Ive discovered youre a fraud. For all youre so handsome, youre nothing but a fire-cracker without powder good only for show. Why, youre much shyer than I am. This shows its no use listening to gossip. For instance, when my cousin came home I was sure you two must have been up to some monkey business thats why I came back to listen outside the window. If theres been some goings-on between you, as you were alone you would have talked about it but to my surprise thered been nothing of the sort. So its clear lots of people get wrongly accused in this world. Im sorry I misjudged you. Well, as this is the case, youve nothing to worry about. You can come whenever you like and I wont pester you. Feeling very relieved he got up and straightened his clothes. Good sister, please take good care of her for a couple of days, he urged her. I must be off now. He went out then to say goodbye to Qingwen. Both were reluctant to part, but part they must and knowing how hard he found it, she covered her face with the quilt and ignored him until he left. Baoyu had wanted to call on Fangguan and Sier too, but as it was dark and he had been out for some time he was afraid he would be missed and a search might be made for him, leading to more trouble. He had better return to the Garden and go out again the next day. When he reached the back gate, pages were bringing out bedding while nurses inside were checking up on people. A minute later and he would have been locked out. Luckily he was able to slip in unobserved. Home again, he simply told Xiren that he had been with Aunt Xue and left it at that. Presently when preparing his bed, she had to ask him how they should sleep that night. Any way you like, was his answer. Now for the last couple of years, since Xiren got into the good books of Lady Wang, she had begun to stand on her dignity and broken off her intimacy with Baoyu even in private or at night, behaving more distantly than when they were young. And though she had no major business to attend to, all the needlework of the household, as well as the accounts and seeing to the clothing and shoes of Baoyu and the young maids kept her fully occupied. Moreover, though she no longer suffered from flux-ions, when she was tired or caught cold she sometimes coughed blood and for this reason she had avoided sleeping in the same room as Baoyu. However, he often woke up in the night and being very timid would always call for someone so Qingwen, who was a light sleeper and soft-footed, had been given the task of pouring him tea and attending him at night and had slept on a bed near his. Now Xiren had to ask who should sleep on the bed near his, as she considered this work at night more important than any daytime tasks. Told to do as she thought fit, she could only move in her own bedding to sleep in Baoyus room as in the old days. That evening he was lost in thought. Finally she persuaded him to go to bed, but after she and the others had turned in she heard him groaning and tossing about in bed till after midnight, when finally he calmed down and started snoring. In relief she dozed off herself, but in less time than it takes to drink half a cup of tea he called for Qingwen.
"Yet here you come up with two. How can you have so much to say, unless you're repeating us?" As they said this they read the poems -800 A fairy flew down last night to the capital And planted in a pot these flowers of rare jade, Like the goddess of frost who loves the cold, But not the wandering spirit of some chaste maid. -774 Whence comes this snow on a dull autumn day? -800 A night's rain stains its loveliness But poets will never tire of singing it, That it may not pass the day in loneliness. The others all applauded this, then went on to read the next. -800 Steps through alpinia lead to an ivy-clad gate -774 Fit place, the wall's comer, for this pot set apart -800 Love of purity makes the flower hold aloof, Grief for the autumn breaks its owner's heart Wind dries the tears on jade candles. Crystal screens break up its shadow cast by the moon. I long to tell the moon goodess its secret, But in the corridor night fades too soon. The others exclaimed in delight after each line. "See what a good idea it was to write poems on the begonia," they said. "How right we were to start our Begonia Club." "Tomorrow let me pay my penalty by standing treat and calling the first meeting. All right?" proposed Xiangyun. "Perfect!" they cried. Then they asked her opinion of the poems written the previous day. That evening Baochai invited Xiangyun to stay with her, and by lamplight Xiangyun outlined her plans for entertaining the others and setting subjects for poems. But Baochai thought all her proposals unsuitable. "Since you've called a meeting, you're the hostess," she pointed out. "Although it's just fun, you must make proper provision. Do the thing cheaply but give no grounds for complaints then everyone can have a good time. "You're not in charge at home, and the few strings of cash you get each month hardly cover your own expenses yet you took this on yourself quite needlessly. When your aunt hears of it she's bound to scold you. Why, your whole allowance isn't enough to stand treat. Are you going home to ask for more? Or will you ask them here for money?" This set Xiangyun worrying. "Actually, I have an idea," continued Baochai. "One of the assistants in our pawnshop has a farm which produces fine crabs, and the other day he sent us several catties. Most of the people here, from the old lady down to those in the Garden, are very partial to crabs. Only the other day aunt talked of inviting the old lady to the Garden to enjoy the fragrant osmanthus and eat some crabs but she's been too busy to ask her. So don't mention the poetry club but just issue a general invitation, and after the older people have left we can write all the poems we please. "I'll get my brother to send us a few crates of the biggest crabs with some vats of good wine from our shop, in addition to which we'll prepare four or five tables of other refreshments. That's easily done and we'll all have a good time." Xiangyun was extremely grateful. "You've thought it all out!" she exclaimed admiringly. "I'm only thinking of you," replied Baochai. "You mustn't be touchy or imagine I look down on you, because this is between friends. If you've no objection, I'll tell them to go ahead." "My dear cousin, you're being touchy instead if you talk like that," said Xiangyun. "However scatter-brained I may be, I know when someone's being good to me. At least I've that much sense. If I didn't look on you as my own elder sister, I wouldn't have confided to you last time all the troubles I have at home." Accordingly Baochai ordered a serving-woman, "Go and ask my brother to get us several crates of big crabs like those we had the other day. Tomorrow after lunch we're inviting the old lady and my aunt to see the fragrant osmanthus in the Garden. Tell him to be sure not to forget, as I've already issued the invitations." The old woman went off to do as she was told. Then Baochai advised Xiangyun, "The themes for verses shouldn't be too outlandish. You can see that the poets of old times didn't go in for far-fetched subjects or freakish rhymes. Such things don't make for good poems and seem rather lowclass. Of course, poetry shouldn't be stereotyped, but we mustn't overdo the emphasis on originality either. So long as our ideas are fresh, the language can't be vulgar.
-800 Some whiteness from the pear-blossom is stolen, Some of its spirit winter-plum allots. "Splendid!" cried the others. "She's really original." They read on -800 The goddess of the moon sews a white gown, The maid's weeping in autumn chamber never ends Silently, shyly, with never a word of complaint, She reclines in the autumn breeze as night descends. "This is the best!" cried the young people. "It's certainly the most charming and unusual," said Li Wan. "But our Lady Alpinia's has deeper significance and real substance." "Quite right," put in Tanchun. "The Queen of Bamboos should come second." "And the Happy Red Prince last," said Li Wan. "Agreed?" "Mine was no good, that's quite fair," said Baoyu with a smile. "But you should reconsider which is the better, Lady Alpinia's or Queen Bamboo's." "I'm the arbiter," insisted Li Wan. "You've no say in the matter. Any more argument will be penalized." So Baoyu said no more. "I've decided that from now on we should meet on the second and sixteenth of each month," continued Li Wan. "And you'll have to accept the subjects and rhymes I choose. You can have extra meetings on other days if you like -- I don't care if you meet every day. But mind you come to my place on the second and sixteenth." "We must choose a name for this club," declared Baoyu. "Nothing too common," said Tanchun. "Nothing too new-fangled either. As we happened to start with poems on begonia, why not call it Begonia Club? Even if this sounds a little commonplace, as it's based on fact that doesn't matter." After some further discussion and some refreshments they parted, some going back to their own rooms, others calling on the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. But no more of this. Now Xiren had wondered what Baoyu was up to when he hurried off with Cuimo after reading the note. When two women from the back gate brought in two pots of begonia some time later, she asked where these were from and was told what had happened. Xiren made them put the plants down and take seats in the servants' room while she went inside, weighed out sixty cents of silver and fetched another three hundred cash which she handed to the two women. "This silver is for the boys who brought the flowers," she explained. "And the cash is for you to buy drinks." The two women stood up, beaming, to thank her profusely and make a show of declining but on Xiren's insistence they accepted the tip. "Are there any pages on duty outside the back gate?" she asked them. "Yes, there are four of them there every day," they answered. "If there's anything you want done, miss, we can tell them." "There's nothing I want," answered Xiren, smiling. "But Master Bao wanted to send something today to Miss Shi in the house of the young marquis. It's lucky you came. When you go out, please tell those boys at the back gate to hire a carriage. As soon as it arrives you can come here to get the money. Don't let them knock around in the front." When the women had left to see to this, Xiren went back inside to look for a plate on which to put the gifts for Xiangyun but the plate she wanted was missing from the carved cabinet. Turning round, she saw Qingwen, Qiuwen and Sheyue busy with their needlework. "What's become of that white agate plate with spiral designs?" she asked them. The girls looked at each other but could not remember. "It was used to send lichees to Miss Tanchun," said Qingwen after some thought. "They've not sent it back yet." "There are plenty of everyday dishes you could have used. Why choose that particular one?" Xiren inquired. "Just what I said. But he insisted that plate looked best with the fresh lichees. And when I took it over, Miss Tanchun liked it so much she told me to leave the fruit on it so I didn't bring it back. Look, that pair of vases from the top shelf hasn't come back either." "Speaking of those vases reminds me of something funny," put in Qiuwen. "When our Master Bao takes it into his head to be filial, he really goes the whole hog. When he saw the fragrant osmanthus in bloom in the Garden he picked two sprays for himself, but all of a sudden he thought better of it.
"Now you've come up against someone with a sharper tongue than mine. Not everyone's as simple and tongue-tied as I am, so easy to tease." Baoyu was already put out by Baochai's annoyance, and this fresh provocation added to his ill humour. But not wanting to annoy Daiyu too, he kept his temper and sulkily left the room. It was now mid-summer. The days were so long that after lunch masters and servants alike were exhausted. His hands behind his back, Baoyu strolled through the grounds and did not hear a sound. From the Lady Dowager's quarters he wandered west through the passage hall to Xifeng's compound but the gate there was closed and he knew he had better not call as she usually took a nap after lunch in the summer. So he sauntered through a side gate to his mother's apartments, where some maids were dozing with needlework in their hands while Lady Wang slept on a couch in the inner room. Jinchuan, sitting by her to massage her legs, was nodding drowsily too. Baoyu tiptoed up to her and flicked one of her earrings, whereupon she opened her eyes. "You sleepy-head!" he whispered. She pouted, smiled and motioned him away, then closed her eyes again but Baoyu was reluctant to leave her. He stole a glance at his mother. Her eyes were closed. Then he took a peppermint pastille from his pouch and slipped it between Jinchuan's lips. She accepted it without opening her eyes. At that Baoyu pressed closer and took her hand. "I'll ask your mistress for you tomorrow," he said softly. "Then we can be together." Jinchuan made no reply. "Or rather I'll ask her as soon as she wakes." The girl opened her eyes then and pushed him away. "What's the hurry? 'A gold pin may fall into the well, but if it's yours it remains yours.' Can't you understand that proverb? I'll tell you some-thing amusing to do. Go to the small east courtyard and see what your brother Huan and Caiyun are up to." "I don't care what they're up to. It's you I'm interested in." At this point Lady Wang sat up and slapped Jinchuan's face. "Shameless slut!" she scolded. "It's low creatures like you who lead the young masters astray." Baoyu had vanished like smoke as soon as his mother sat up. Jinchuan's cheek was tingling but she dared say nothing and the other maids, hearing their mistress's voice, hurried in. "Jinchuan!" ordered Lady Wang. "Go and tell your mother to come at once and take your sister away." At these words Jinchuan fell on her knees and burst into tears. "I shan't let it happen again, madam," she cried. "Whip me, scold me or punish me as you please, but for pity's sake don't send me away! I've been with Your Ladyship more than ten years. If you dismiss me now, how can I look anyone in the face again?" Lady Wang was generally speaking too good-natured and easy-going to beat the maids but the shameless way in which Jinchuan had behaved was the one thing she could not abide. That was why, flaring up, she had slapped and cursed her. Although the maid pleaded hard she refused to keep her, and her mother, old Mrs. Bai, had to take her away. So Jinchuan went home in disgrace. Meanwhile Baoyu had scuttled back to Grand View Garden. The sun was high in the sky, trees cast ample shade and the air was full of the shrilling of cicadas, but no human voice could be heard. However, as he approached a trellis of roses, he heard sobbing and stopped in his surprise to listen, Yes, there was someone on the other side of the trellis. As it was now the fifth month, the roses were in full bloom. Peeping through the lattice-work, he saw a girl crouching below the flowers and weeping all alone as she scratched the ground with a hairpin. "Can this be another absurd maid come to bury flowers like Daiyu?" he wondered in some amusement. "If so, she's 'Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi,' 3 which isn't original but rather tiresome." He was on the point of calling out to the girl, "It's no use your trying to copy Miss Lin!" when he realized she was not one of the maids but looked like one of the twelve actresses, although he could not remember which role she played. He grimaced then hastily covered his mouth.
Miss Lin is still breathing and wants me from time to time. Li Wan helped her out by explaining, Its true. The affinity between Miss Lin and this girl must have been predestined. Though Xueyans the one she brought with her from the south, she doesnt care for her much. I can see that Zijuan is the only one who cant leave her for a second. Mrs. Lin had been put out by Zijuans reply, but she was unable to rebut Li Wan. Seeing Zijuan dissolved in tears, she smiled at her faintly. Its all very well for Miss Zijuan to talk like that, she rejoined. But what am Ito say to the old lady? And how can I repeat this to Madam Lian? At these words, Pinger came out wiping her eyes. Repeat what to Madam Lian? she wanted to know. Mrs. Lin explained the situation, and Pinger lowered her head to think it over. In that case, she suggested, let Xueyan go instead. Will she be suitable? Li Wan inquired. Pinger stepped closer to whisper something to her, at which she nodded. Very well, then. Sending Xueyan will do just as well. Mrs. Lin asked Pinger if she agreed, and the answer was Yes, its the same. Then please tell her to come with me immediately. Ill report to the old lady and Madam Lian that this was your idea, madam, and Miss Pingers too. Later you can explain to Madam Lian yourself, miss. All right, said Li Wan. But why should someone of your seniority be scared to answer for such a little thing? Its not that. Mrs. Lin smiled. But we cant be sure what plan the old lady and Madam Lian have and besides you and Miss Pinger are here, madam. Pinger had already called out Xueyan, who had been holding aloof these last few days as the others had been taunting her as a careless child and in any case she would never dream of ignoring a summons from the Lady Dowager and Madam Lian. She hastily smoothed her hair and on Pingers instructions changed into colourful clothes, then went off with Mrs. Lin. Li Wan, after a brief discussion with Pinger, sent her to tell Mrs. Lin to urge her husband to get a coffin ready without delay. Pinger left to attend to this and, rounding a bend, saw Mrs. Lin walking ahead of her with Xueyan. She called to them to stop. Ill take her there, she said. You go first to tell your husband to get Miss Lins things ready. Ill report this for you to my mistress. Mrs. Lin agreed and went off, while Pinger took Xueyan to the bridal chambers and, having made her report, left to see to her own business. Now that things had come to such a pass, Xueyan could not but grieve for Daiyu, though she dared not show her feelings to the old lady and Xifeng. What do they want me for? she wondered. Ill wait and see. Baoyu used to be so devoted to our young lady, why doesnt he come out? Is he really ill or just shamming? He may be trying to put her off by pretending to have lost his jade and to be out of his mind, so that shell lose interest in him and he can marry Miss Baochai. Ill slip in and see whether hes really crazy or not. He can hardly be shamming today. She tiptoed to the door of the inner room and peeped in. Now though the loss of his jade had deranged Baoyu, the news that he was to marry Daiyu seemed to him the most wonderful thing that had ever happened, and at once his health had improved, though he seemed less quick in the uptake than before. So Xifengs cunning scheme had succeeded completely. He could hardly wait to see Daiyu and go through with his wedding today. Beside himself with joy, although he sometimes talked nonsense he behaved quite differently from when he was demented. Xueyan saw this with indignation and distress, not knowing what was in his heart, then she slipped away. Baoyu, seated in Lady Wangs room, was pressing Xiren to help him into his wedding clothes and watching busy Xifeng and Madam You as he longed for the auspicious hour to arrive. Cousin Lins only coming from the Garden, he said to Xiren. Why should it take so long? Suppressing a smile she answered, She has to wait for the appointed hour. Then he heard Xifeng say to Lady Wang, Although were in mourning and wont have musicians outside, according to us southerners rule they must bow to each other and utter silence wont do.
"I've asked to have them cooked at once. I've been longing for some freshly picked things of this kind. Those we buy outside aren't as good as yours, straight from the fields." "This is rough country fare but at least it's fresh," Granny Liu answered. "We'd rather eat meat and fish ourselves, only we can't afford it." "Now that we relatives have met, you mustn't leave with nothing to show for your visit. If you don't dislike our place, do stay for a couple of days. We have a garden too with fruit in it. Tomorrow you must try some and take some home, to show you've visited your relatives here." Xifeng also pressed Granny Lin to stay, seeing what a liking the old lady had taken to her. "Though our place here isn't as large as your farm we have a couple of empty rooms," she said. "Do stay for a day or two, and tell our old lady some of your village news and stories." "You're not to make fun of her, you baggage," warned the Lady Dowager. "She's an honest village woman, how can she stand up to your teasing?" She told the maids to offer Baner some fruit, but with so many people about the boy dared not eat. So she ordered them to give him some cash and sent him off to play with the pages outside. Then Granny Liu, after sipping a cup of tea, regaled the Lady Dowager with some village gossip which quite delighted her. Granny Liu was still holding forth when Xifeng told a maid to invite her to dinner, and the Lady Dowager sent her some of her own dishes. Knowing how pleased the old lady was with her, Xifeng sent Granny Liu back again after her meal and Yuanyang deputed an old nurse to take her to have a bath while she picked a simple change of clothing for her. Granny Lin, who was having the time of her life, changed quickly. Then, seated in front of the Lady Dowager's couch, she found some more gossip to tell her. Baoyu and the girls were there too and never having heard such talk before they found it more diverting than the ballads of blind folk-singers. Now Granny Lin though a countrywoman was no fool. Besides, being old and experienced she could see how delighted the old lady was and how eagerly the young people were listening. So when she ran out of gossip she drew on her imagination. "In our village we grow grain and vegetables year in, year out," she said. "Spring, summer, autumn and winter, in wind and rain, what time have we to sit idle? We just knock off for a rest each day in the fields, and I can assure you we see all kinds of queer doings. "Last winter, for example, the snow fell for several days on end and piled up on the ground three of four feet deep. I got up early one day and hadn't yet left the house when I heard a noise from the woodpile. I peeped through the window, thinking it must be someone filching our firewood. But it wasn't anybody from our village." "I suppose it was some passer-by who felt cold," put in the Lady Dowager. "Seeing fuel ready at hand he took some to make a fire. That might well be." "It wasn't a passer-by either," Granny Liu chortled. "That's what was so strange. Who d'you think it was, my lady? A slip of a girl of seventeen or eighteen, pretty as a picture, with hair as glossy as oil, wearing a red tunic and a white silk skirt . Just then a sudden commotion broke out outside. "It's not serious," someone shouted. "Don't alarm the old lady." At once they asked what had happened. A maid explained that a fire had broken out in the stables in the south court, but there was no danger as it was now under control. The Lady Dowager, being very easily frightened, got up quickly and made them help her out to the verandah. At sight of flames in the southeast part of the grounds she invoked Buddha in her terror, then ordered incense to be burned to the God of Fire. Lady Wang and the others hurried over to the Lady Dowager's apartments to comfort her. "It'll soon be put out," they assured her. "Do go back inside, madam." But the old lady waited till all the flames had died down before leading the whole company indoors again. At once Baoyu asked Granny Liu "Why was that girl taking firewood when the snow lay so deep? Did she catch cold?" "It was this talk about firewood that caused the fire," put in his grandmother.
Chunyan asked Ouguan. Before she could report you, Baoyu gave her such a dressing-down that she went off in a huff and told my mother all about it. What feud did you have with them those few years in the troupe outside the Garden that youre still at loggerheads? What feud? Ouguan snorted. Theres just no satisfying them theyre for ever nagging at us. Not to mention anything else, goodness knows how much they made the last two years out of our daily food allowance outside more than enough to feed their own families in addition to their rake off on purchases. Yet any job we give them, they complain to high heaven. What sort of behaviour is that? Chunyan smiled. Shes my aunt, so I cant run her down to outsiders. But no wonder Baoyu says A girl before marriage is a precious pearl after marriage, she somehow picks up all sorts of bad habits so that the pearl loses its lustre -- its a dead pearl and as she grows still older, the pearl changes into a fish-eye. What a metamorphosis! Thats silly talk maybe, still theres something in it. I dont know about other people, but as for my mother and her sister, my aunt, its true that the older they grow the madder they get for money. First, at home, the two of them groused that they had no fat jobs then luckily there was this Garden and I happened to be assigned to Happy Red Court so apart from saving my keep, the family got four or five hundred cash extra a month. But they still said that wasnt enough. Later both were assigned to Pear Fragrance Court to look after the actresses. My aunt had Ouguan as her foster-daughter my mother, Fangguan so for the last few years they were in clover. Since the actresses have moved into the Garden, theyve been living separately, but theyre still just as greedy. Ridiculous, isnt it? The other day my aunt scolded Ouguan then my mother squabbled with Fangguan wouldnt even let her wash her hair. Yesterday being pay-day, my mother got Fangguans monthly allowance. As she couldnt get out of buying her some things, she told me I could wash first. I thought Ive my own monthly allowance, and even if I hadnt I could wash my hair any time simply by asking Xiren, Qingwen or Sheyue. Why should I accept this as a favour? How futile! When I refused, she made my younger sister Xiaojiu wash before Fangguan. Then naturally there was a row. And next she wanted to blow on Baoyus soup its enough to make you split your sides laughing. As soon as she came in here I told her the rules but she didnt believe me, insisted she knew better. Shes simply been asking for a snub. Its a good thing there are so many people in the Garden that no one remembers different relationships clearly. If they did, and it appeared that ours was the only quarrelsome family, Id feel bad about these squabbles. Now youre playing about here where everythings in the charge of my paternal aunt, whos stricter about it, ever since it was put in her care, than about her own property. Apart from getting up early and turning in late so as to watch over it, she makes us keep an eye on things too for fear any damage is done, interfering, Im afraid, with my own work. Now that theyve both moved in here, the two sisters-in-law keep such a careful watch, they wont allow a single blade of grass to be touched yet youve plucked all these flowers and twigs! Theyll be here any minute now youd better watch out! Others may not be allowed to pick what they like, but I am, retorted Yinger. After the different places were allotted, each household was assigned its share of the produce. Not counting edibles, just take flowers for example. Those in charge have to send some over every day for the young ladies and maids to wear, as well as to put in their vases. My young lady was the only one who told them not to send any. She said shed ask for what she needed, but in fact she never once has. So how can they scold me for picking a few flowers now? While she was still speaking, sure enough, along came Chunyans aunt leaning on her cane. Yinger and Chunyan at once urged her to be seated. The sight of all the willow twigs and flowers which Ouguan and the others had picked vexed the woman, but not liking to say anything against Yinger, who was making a basket, she rounded on her niece. I told you to keep an eye on things, but you take that as a chance to play around and not go back to your apartments.
Well, for Miss Xings sake then, Ill overlook it this time, conceded Xifeng. The woman kowtowed her thanks to them both and went off, whereupon they sat down. What have you lost? asked Xifeng with a smile. Nothing much, just a red jacket, an old one. When I told them to look for it and they couldnt find it, I said it didnt matter. But my maid is so silly she asked that woman about it, and of course that put her back up. Its all this silly girls fault, and Ive given her a scolding, so thats that. We may as well forget about it. Xifeng looked her up and down and saw that though she had on some fur-lined and padded clothes, they were rather worn and could not be too warm. Her quilts too were on the thin side. But the knick-knacks in the room and on the desk, all provided by the Lady Dowager, were neatly set out and spotless. Impressed by this and drawn to her, Xifeng said Of course a jacket isnt all that important, but now that its cold you need something snug to wear. Naturally you should try to trace it. The insolence of that old slave, talking back! After a little more chat Xifeng took her leave, and having paid various other calls she went home. There she told Pinger to fetch a red crepe inner jacket, a deep green satin jacket lined with sheepskin, a sapphire blue embroidered padded skirt and a bright green gown lined with white squirrel. When these had been wrapped up she had them sent to Xiuyan. Xiuyan was still upset after the old scolds tirade, even though Xifeng had put a stop to it. She thought, No one dares to offend any of the other girls here except me. With me, though, they keep making snide remarks and now Xifeng knows about it. The more she brooded the more wretched she felt, but there was nobody in whom to confide. She was choking back her sobs when Fenger brought in the clothes sent by Xifeng. Xiuyan most resolutely declined the gift. 2743 My mistress says that if you think these too worn, shell send new ones later, said Fenger. Its very kind of your mistress. Xiuyan smiled. Shes sent me these because I lost a jacket, but I really cant accept them. So take them back and be sure to thank her for me. I do appreciate her thoughtfulness. She gave Fenger a pouch, and with that the girl had to leave. Before long, Fenger came back again with Pinger. Xiuyan welcomed them and asked them to sit down. Pinger told her with a smile, Our mistress says youre treating us like strangers. Oh no! exclaimed Xiuyan. But I really cant accept such a handsome gift. Our mistress says that if you wont accept, it must be either because you think these clothes too shabby or because you look down on her. Just now our mistress insisted that if I were to bring back the clothes the way Fenger did, shed be really angry with me. Blushing, Xiuyan said gratefully, Well then, I dare not refuse. Then she urged them to have some tea. On their way back, Pinger and Fenger were accosted by one of the old women who worked for Aunt Xue. Where have you been? Pinger asked her. Our mistress and young lady sent me to give their regards to all the ladies here, the woman replied. Just now I asked Madam Lian where you were, and she said youd gone to the Garden. Have you come from Miss Xings place? How did you know? I just heard about it. And, truly, no one can help admiring your mistress and you, the way you both behave! Pinger laughed and invited her back to rest for a while. I have something else to do now, said the woman. Ill call some other day. She went off, and Pinger returned to report on her errand to Xifeng. No more of this. 2745 Now Aunt Xues household had been turned upside-down by Jingui. When the woman went back and told them about Xiuyan, Baochai and her mother shed tears. Its all because brothers away that Xiuyan has to go on putting up with these slights, said Baochai. Im glad Cousin Xifeng is so considerate. In future we must see what we can do too as, after all, shell be marrying into our family. Just then Xue Ke came in. The friends Brother Pan has been making these years! he fumed. Theres not a single decent sort among the whole foxy lot.
But let us return to Jia Yun, who had gone in to see Jia Lian. He asked him "Have you any job for me yet?" "Something did turn up the other day, but your aunt begged me to let Jia Qin have it. However, she said there's soon to be a lot of planting of flowers and trees in the Garden. As soon as that job comes up, she promises you can have it." After a short silence Jia Yun said "I'll just have to wait in that case. Please don't tell my aunt that I came today to ask. I'll mention it to her myself next time I see her. " "Why should I mention it? What time do I have to gossip? Tomorrow I've got to set off at the fifth watch to make the trip to Xingyi and back on the same day. Wait until the day after to come back for news---but not before the first watch, I shan't be free till then." With that Jia Lian went inside to change his clothes. On his way home from the Rong Mansion a scheme occurred to Jia Yun. He called on his maternal uncle Bu Shiren, 1 who kept a perfumery from which he had just returned. "What brings you here at such a late hour?" asked Bu after exchanging greetings with his nephew. "I've a favour to ask you, uncle. I need some Borneo camphor and musk. Could you possibly let me have four ounces of each on credit? I'll pay you by the Moon Festival without fail." "Don't talk to me about credit." His uncle smiled coldly. "Some time ago one of my assistants gave goods worth several taels of silver on credit to a relative, who stilt hasn't paid up. We had to make good the loss between us. So we agreed never again to give credit to relatives or friends under pain of a twenty taels' fine. "In any case, those spices are in short supply. Even if you brought ready cash, a little shop like ours couldn't let you have so much. We'd have to try to get you some elsewhere. That's one thing. "In the second place, you're obviously up to no good but want these things to do something foolish with them. Now don't go complaining that your uncle finds fault with you each time we meet! You young people have simply no sense. If you'd just think up some way to earn a few cash to keep yourself well fed and decently dressed, how pleased I should be!" "You're quite right," uncle replied Jia Yun amiably. "When my father died I was too small to understand, but later my mother told me how grateful we should be to you for coming over to take things in hand and managing the funeral. And you know better than anyone else, uncle, that I didn't have any property or land left after my father's death which I squandered. Even the cleverest housewife can't cook a meal without rice. What do you expect me to do? You're lucky I'm not one of those thick-skinned people, for then I'd keep pestering you for three pecks of rice today, two pecks of beans tomorrow. What could you have done then, uncle?" "Whatever your uncle has is yours for the asking, my boy. But as I keep telling your aunt, what worries me is that you won't use your head. Your best bet is to go to the big mansion. If you can't get to see the masters, pocket your pride and get on good terms with their stewards, and they may put some business in your way. The other day, out of town, I ran into the fourth son of your third uncle riding on a donkey with five carts behind him, taking forty of fifty novices to your family temple. His head is screwed on the right way, to get such a job." This lecture was too much for Jia Yun, who rose to leave. "What's the hurry?" asked his uncle. "Have a bite with us before you go. "Are you crazy?" put in his wife before he had half finished. "I told you we've no rice left. All I've got for you is half a catty of noodles which I'm cooking for you now. Why pretend to be rich? If he stays he'll only go hungry." "Just buy another half catty then," said Bu. "Yinjie!" his wife called to her daughter "Go and ask Mrs. Wang across the road to lend us twenty or thirty cash---we'll pay her back tomorrow." But by this time Jia Yun, murmuring. "Don't trouble," had already made himself scarce. He left his uncle's house in a temper and was trudging home with lowered head, fuming over such shabby treatment, when he bumped into a drunkard.
Then there were the fashionable eight-section essays which he had always loathed, taking the view that as these were not written by sages or worthies they could not expound the wisdom of sages or worthies and were simply ladders by which later examination candidates climbed up to bureaucratic advancement. Jia Zheng before his departure had set him over a hundred essays of this kind to study. Baoyu had skipped through these, noting here and there a well-written paragraph or argument or certain digressions, amusing anecdotes or poignant sentiments. But this again was only when the mood took him. He had never given his mind to studying whole essays. If he prepared one now, tomorrow he might be examined on quite another and it was out of the question to revise the whole lot in one night. These reflections made him more and more frantic. While Baoyu was dilly-dallying over his studies, none of the girls in his place could go to bed either. It goes without saying that his chief maids Xiren, Sheyue and Qingwen trimmed candles and poured tea for him. The younger ones, however, were all so sleepy that they kept dozing off. Little bitches! Qingwen scolded. You all sleep like the dead every day are you so short of sleep that you cant even sit up late for once? If you drowse off again Ill jab you with a needle. Just then they heard a thump in the outer room and rushing out to look found that one young maid, falling asleep in her chair, had banged her head on the wall. She woke up with a start to hear this scolding and in her dazed state imagined that Qingwen had struck her. Good sister, she cried tearfully, I promise not to do it again! The others burst out laughing. Dont punish her, put in Baoyu hastily. You should have sent them all to bed. And you must be tired yourselves. Youd better take it in turns to get some sleep. Just get on with your work, Little Ancestor, urged Xiren. Youve only this one night so give your mind to those books for the time being. Youll have plenty of time once youve passed this test to attend to other things. As she spoke in such earnest Baoyu had to comply. He went on reading. But presently when Sheyue poured him more tea to moisten his throat, he noticed that she was wearing a short jacket but had taken off her skirt. Its cold so late at night, he warned. You should put on a gown. With a smile she pointed at his books. Just forget us for the moment and concentrate on those. At this point Venturina dashed in through the back door declaring excitedly that someone had just jumped down from the top of the wall. Gracious! Where? cried the others. At once they called people out to search everywhere. Qingwen saw how wearisome Baoyu found this cramming, and knew that if he wore himself out tonight he was likely to make a poor showing the next day. She had been wanting to find some way out for him and this alarm provided her with a pretext. Take this chance to sham ill, she advised him. Just pretend youve had a fright. Baoyu snatched eagerly at this suggestion. The matrons on night duty were summoned to search everywhere with lanterns. When they failed to find anyone they said, The girls, going out half asleep, must have taken some branches tossed by the wind for a man. Stop farting! retorted Qingwen. Youre trying to shift the blame for not making a proper search. More than one person saw someone break in. Some of us had gone out with Baoyu, and we all saw it. It gave him such a fright that he turned white and now hes feverish. Im going to the mistress to get a sedative for him, and when she asks whats happened Ill have to report it in full. So how can you give up searching? At this the matrons dared not raise any further objections. They made a more thorough search while Qingwen and Venturina went off to fetch medicine, loudly spreading the news that Baoyu had fallen ill as a result of a shock. At once Lady Wang sent some of her own attendants to give him medicine, besides ordering those on night duty to search every nook and cranny of the Garden and check on the men on duty at the inner gate outside it. So they ransacked the Garden all night with lanterns and torches, and when dawn came the stewards were instructed to make careful investigations. They questioned all the matrons and men-servants who had been on night duty. When the Lady Dowager heard of Baoyus fright and asked the reason they dared not hide it from her. I guessed as much, said the old lady.
She overtook her crying, "Wait for me, Madam Rong!" "I am not Madam Rong," was the reply, "but the sister of the Goddess of Disenchantment." "I can see quite clearly that you're Madam Rong why should you deny it?" "Let me tell you the reason, then you'll understand. I was the Arbiter of True Love in the palace of the goddess, and all romantic affairs were in my charge then I descended to the dusty world as the most amorous of mortals, to lead all lovesick maidens back betimes to the Board of Love. This is why it was my Tot to hang myself. Now that I have seen through earthly love, passed over the sea of love and returned to heaven, there is no one in charge of the Board of Infatuation in the Illusory Land of Great Void. The Goddess of Disenchantment has appointed you in my Place to head this Board, and has therefore ordered me to lead you there." "I have never known passion," replied Yuanyang's spirit. "How can I count as amorous?" "You don't understand. Mortals mistake carnal appetite for love, and at at at at at at at at justify their immorality by calling themselves romantics and passing it off lightly. In fact, before the expression of joy or anger, grief or happiness, love is latent in each one's nature once these feelings are expressed then we have passion. Our love is as yet unexpressed like a flower in bud. If once expressed, it would cease to be true love." Yuanyang's wraith nodded agreement, then followed Keqing's spirit. After Hupo had bid farewell to the dead and heard Their Ladyships designate caretakers, she decided to go and ask Yuanyang what carriage they would be taking the next day. Unable to find her in the old lady's room, she approached the smaller room which opened off it. The door was closed, but peeping through a crack she was startled by the dim lamplight and flickering shadows, though she could hear not a sound. She went away exclaiming, "Where can the wretch have run off to?" Bumping into Zhenzhu she asked, "Have you seen Sister Yuanyang?" "I'm looking for her too," was the answer. "Their Ladyships want her. Is she asleep in the annex?" "I had a peep and didn't see anyone. The lamp hasn't been trimmed, and it was too dark and scary to go in. But now we can go in together, to make sure there's no one inside." As they went in to trim the lamp Zhenzhu exclaimed, "Who put the stool here? It nearly tripped me up!" Happening to look up, she let out a little scream and fell backward, knocking hard against Hupo, who by then had also seen the fearful sight. She shrieked, rooted to the spot. People outside hearing their cries rushed in and, after exclaiming in horror, went to report this to Their Ladyships. At this news, Lady Wang, Baochai and the rest shed tears and went to take a look. Lady Xing remarked, "I never imagined Yuanyang had it in her! We must send word of this at once to the master." Baoyu kept silent, gaping in consternation, till Xiren anxiously took his arm and urged him, "Cry if you want to, but don't suppress your feelings." Then Baoyu burst out wailing. "Only someone like Yuanyang would Choose this way to die!" he thought. "The subtlest elements in the uni verse are truly concentrated in such girls! She died a splendid death. Which of the old lady's sons or grandsons can compare with her, filthy creatures that we are?" This reflection raised his spirits. Baochai had heard Baoyu wailing, but by the time she reached his side he was smiling. 'This is a bad sign!" cried Xiren. "He's losing his mind again." "Don't worry," said Baochai. "He has his reason." This delighted Baoyu, who thought, "After all she understands me. The others don't." As Baoyu was letting his fancy run wild, Jia Zheng and some others came in. "What a good girl!" declared Jia Zheng approvingly. "The old lady's love for her wasn't thrown away." He told Jia Lian, "Go and send to buy a coffin immediately and give her a good funeral. Tomorrow her coffin can go in the old lady's cortege and be left in the temple behind the old lady's coffin. This is what she wished for." Jia Lian withdrew to attend to this, while orders were given to cut down Yuanyang's corpse and lay it out in the inner room.
Then the palanquin was borne inside and the eunuchs withdrew, leaving Yuanchuns ladies-in-waiting to help her alight. She observed that the courtyard was brightly lit with ornamental lanterns of every kind, all exquisitely made of finest gauze. The highest, a rectangular lantern, bore the inscription Fraught with Favour, Basking in Kindness. Yuanchun entered the robing room and changed, then remounted her palanquin which was carried into the Garden. She found it wreathed with the perfumed smoke of incense, splendid with flowers, brilliant with countless lanterns, melodious with strains of soft music. Words fail to describe that scene of peaceful magnificence and noble refinement. Here, Readers, recalling the scene of desolation at the foot of Blue Ridge Peak in the Great Waste Mountain, I cannot but thank the scabby Buddhist and lame Taoist for bringing me to this place. For how otherwise could I have seen such a sight? I was tempted to write a lantern-poem or a eulogy on family reunion to pay tribute to it, but feared slipping into the vulgar vein of other books. Besides, even writing an ode or eulogy could not do justice to the scenes enchantment. If, on the other hand, I omit to write one my worthy readers can imagine its magnificence for themselves. So I had better save both time and paper and return from this digression to our story. Now, as she gazed from her palanquin at the dazzling display both within and without the Garden, the Imperial Consort sighed softly This is too extravagant! Then a eunuch with a whisk knelt down by the palanquin and invited her to proceed by boat. As she alighted she saw before her a clear waterway winding like a dragon. From the marble balustrades on either bank lanterns of crystal and glass of every description shed a silvery light, clear as snow. The wintry boughs of the willows and apricot trees above them were festooned with artificial flowers and leaves made of rice-paper and silk, and from every tree hung lanterns. Lovely too on the water were the lotus flowers, duckweed and water-fowl made out of shells and feathers. Lanterns high and low seemed trying to outshine each other. It was truly a world of crystal and precious stones! The boats were magnificent too, with lanterns, rare miniature gardens, pearl portieres, embroidered curtains, rudders of cassia and oars of aromatic wood, which we need not describe in detail. By now they had reached a marble landing-stage. The lantern-sign above it bore the words, Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour. Regarding this name, Reader, and others such as Where the Phoenix Alights from the last chapter in which Jia Zheng tested Baoyus literary talent, you may wonder to find them actually used as inscriptions. For the Jias, after all, were a scholarly family all of whose friends and protgs were men of parts. Moreover they could easily find well-known writers to compose inscriptions. Why then make shift with phrases tossed off by a boy? Were they like newly rich upstarts who throw money about like dirt and, having painted their mansion crimson, put up huge inscriptions such as Green willows with golden locks before the gate, Blue hills like embroidered screens behind the house, fancying these the height of elegance? Could that be the way of the Jia family described in this Tale of the Stone? This is surely a contradiction? Let me, stupid as I am, explain this to you. The Imperial Consort, before she entered the Palace, had been brought up from childhood by the Lady Dowager. And after Baoyu was born, as Yuanchun was his elder sister and Baoyu her younger brother, bearing in mind that their mother had given birth to him late in life, she loved him more than her other brothers and lavished all her care on him. They both stayed with their grandmother and were inseparable. Even before Baoyu started school, when he was hardly four years old, she taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters. she was more like a mother to him than an elder sister. After she entered the Palace she often wrote letters home reminding her parents to educate him well, for unless strictly disciplined he would not amount to much, but if treated too sternly he might also give them cause for anxiety. Her loving concern for him had never ceased. Jia Zheng, earlier on, had scarcely believed the tutors report that Baoyu had a flair for literary composition. As the Garden happened then to be ready for inspection, he had called on his son for inscriptions in order to test him.
Then the silk was burnt and wine poured. At the end of this ceremony the music stopped and all withdrew, following the Lady Dowager to the main hall, in front of the portraits. In the middle of the shrine hung with long silk curtains, surrounded by brilliant screens and blazing censers, were portraits of the Duke of Rongguo and the Duke of Ningguo in dragon robes with jade belts. On both sides were portraits of other ancestors. Jia Xing, Jia Zhi and some others had ranged themselves in due order all the way from the inner ceremonial gate to the terrace by the verandah of the main hall, where stood Jia Jing and Jia She outside the palisade, while the ladies stood inside. The family servants and pages remained outside the ceremonial gate. Each time they brought a plate of offerings to this gate, it was taken by Jia Xing or bia Zhi and passed from hand to hand until it reached Jia Jing on the terrace. Jia Rong, as the eldest grandson of the senior branch, was the only one to accompany the ladies inside. When Jia bing passed him an offering he handed it to his wife, who passed it on to Xifeng and Madam You until it reached Lady Wang in front of the altar. She in turn passed it to the Lady Dowager, who set it on the altar. Lady Xing, posted west of the altar facing east, helped the Lady Dowager. When all the dishes, rice, soup, cakes, wine and tea had been presented, Jia Rong withdrew to join Jia Jings group below the steps. Places were assigned according to generations, Jia Jing heading the senior group, Jia Zhen the second, and Jia Rong the third and now they ranged themselves on the two sides, the men on the east and the women on the west. When the Lady Dowager offered incense and bowed, the whole clan knelt down together. Every square foot of the five sections of the hall, the three annexes, the inner and outer corridors, terrace and courtyard, was a mass of rich silks and brocades. And the only sounds to break the solemn silence were the tinkling of gold bells and jade pendants, the rustling of silks and the shuffling of boots and slippers as the worshippers rose or knelt down. After this ceremony, ha Jing, bia She and the other men hurried to the Rong Mansion, where they waited to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager. She, however, now went to Madam Yous sitting-room, the floor of which was covered with a red carpet where stood a large gilded cloisonne brazier, its three legs in the form of elephant trunks. On the kang by the north wall were a new crimson rug and red silk back-rests and bolsters embroidered with Dragons in the Clouds designs and the character Longevity. On it, too, were spread a black fox-skin and a big white fox-skin mattress. When the Lady Dowager had been ensconced here, more furs were spread on both sides and the few other ladies of her generation were invited to sit down. Then fur rugs were spread on the smaller kang behind the partition for Lady Xings generation, and twelve carved lacquer chairs covered with grey squirrel-skins and with a large bronze foot-warmer under each were placed in a row on either side for Baoqin and the other girls. Madam You ceremoniously presented tea to the Lady Dowager while Jia Rongs wife served the other elderly ladies, after which Madam You served Lady Xings group and Jia Rongs wife the girls. Xifeng and Li Wan stood by all this time in attendance. After sipping some tea, Lady Xing and the rest rose to wait upon the Lady Dowager, and after a few words to the other old ladies she asked for her sedan-chair. At once Xifeng stepped up to her and took her arm. Weve prepared dinner for you, madam, demurred Madam You with a smile. Why will you never honour us with your company at dinner on this day of the year before you leave? Arent we as good as Xifeng? Xifeng, supporting the old lady, urged her, Come on, Old Ancestress. Pay no attention to her. Lets go home to eat. You have your hands full here with the ancestral sacrifice, said the Lady Dowager. How could you put up with more trouble from me? Besides, even though I dont dine here, you send dishes over every year. Its better that way. If theres more than I can eat today, I can save it for tomorrow. That way, dont I get more of your food than by eating here?
The nurse smiled and apologized, My eyes are so dim I didnt see who it was, miss. When Baoyu had washed his hands, the girl with the flask poured some ointment over them which he rubbed in. Then Qiuwen and Sheyue, having rinsed their hands in the hot water and rubbed on ointment too, escorted him back to the hail. Baoyu now called for a pot of warm wine to toast Aunt Li and Aunt Xue, who both begged him to be seated. Let the boy fill your cups, said the Lady Dowager. And mind you empty them. She drained her own cup then. And when Lady Xing and Lady Wang followed suit, Aunt Xue and Aunt Li had to drink up too. Fill your cousins cups, the old lady told Baoyu. See that you do it properly and make them all drink up. Baoyu assented and filled every cup in turn. When he came to Daiyu she refused to drink but held the cup up to his lips, thanking him with a smile when he tossed it off. He poured her another cup. Dont drink cold wine, Baoyu, warned Xifeng. If you do, your hands will tremble too much to write or draw your bow later on. I havent drunk any cold wine, he protested. I know. Im just warning you. Having filled all the cups except that of Jia Rongs wife, whose cup was filled by a maid, he went out to the corridor to toast Jia Zhen and the other men and kept them company for a while before returning to his seat inside. Presently soup was served, followed by New-Year dumplings. Tell the actresses to rest now, said the Lady Dowager. Those poor children must have some hot soup and hot food before they go on. She ordered sweetmeats of every kind to be taken to the actresses. Now that the performance had stopped, one of the matrons brought in two women story-tellers who often visited the house, putting stools for them at one side. They were told to sit down and handed a fiddle and a lute. Then the Lady Dowager asked Aunt Li and Aunt Xue what they would like to hear. Anything will do, they answered. She asked the two women what new stories they had. One about the end of the Tang Dynasty and the Five dynasties, they replied. What is its name? -378 The Phoenix Seeks Its Mate. Thats a good title, she remarked. Why is it called that? Lets hear what its about, and if it sounds good you can tell it. Its about a country gentleman named Wang Zhong at the end of the Tang Dynasty, said one of the women. His family came from Jinling. After serving as a minister under two emperors, he retired in his old age. He had an only son called Wang Xifeng. The whole party laughed at that. -386 The same name as our minx Xifeng, chuckled the old lady. Some serving-women nudged the story-tellers. Thats our Second Mistress name. Be careful, they warned. Never mind. Go on, said the Lady Dowager. The story-tellers rose to apologize. We deserve to drop dead. We didnt know it was Her Ladyships honourable name. 2 What does that matter? asked Xifeng cheerfully. Plenty of people have the same name. Go on. Then one of the women continued, One year, old Mr. Wang sent his son to take the examination in the capital. Running into heavy rain on the way he took shelter in a village where, as it happened, there lived a gentleman named Li, an old family friend of Mr. Wangs, who put the young man up in his study. This Mr. Li had no son, only one daughter Chuluan 3 who was thoroughly accomplished in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting. I understand the title now, interposed the old lady. You neednt go on. I can guess the rest. Naturally Wang Xifeng wants to marry this Miss Chuluan. So youve heard this story before, Old Ancestress. The story-teller smiled. The others explained, The old lady can guess the ending, even if she hasnt heard the story before. Theres a sameness about all these tales, complained the old lady. And theyre so stereotyped all about talented scholars and lovely ladies. Fancy describing girls who behave so badly as fine young ladies! Why, theyre nothing of the sort. Theyre always introduced as girls from cultured families whose fathers are invariably high officials or prime ministers. In that case, an only daughter would be treasured and brought up as a real fine young lady, well-versed in literature and a model of propriety yet her first glimpse of a handsome man, whether a relative or family friend, sets her thoughts running on marriage.
"But please, miss, get someone to take me to pay my respects to Her Ladyship and to weep at the old lady's shrine." "There's no hurry," Pinger replied. "You can't leave town today anyway. Just now I was afraid you might say something tactless and set our mistress weeping again that's why I hustled you out. I hope you don't mind." "Amida Buddha! I know how thoughtful you are, miss. But what's to be done about madam's illness?" "Does it look serious to you?" "Maybe it's wrong to say so, but it does." Just then they heard Xifeng calling, yet when Pinger went to her bed- side she remained silent. As Pinger was questioning Fenger, Jia Lian came in. After a cursory glance at the kang he entered the inner room without a word and plumped himself down, glowering. Qiutong alone went in to serve him tea and wait on him, but the others could not hear what they were saying. Then Jia Lian called for Pinger. "Isn't your mistress taking medicine?" he asked. -384 "What if she isn't?" "How should I know?" he retorted. "Bring me the key of the chest." As he was in a temper she did not venture to question him but went out and whispered something to Xifeng. When the latter said nothing, Pinger brought in a casket and put it before Jia Lian, then turned to go. "What the devil's your hurry?" he demanded. "Who's going to give me the key?" Suppressing her annoyance she took it out of the casket and opened the chest. "What do you want taken out?" she asked. 'What is there?" 'Say plainly what you want," she sobbed angrily. "Then we can die content!" "What is there to say? You were the ones who brought all the trouble on us. Now we're four or five thousand taels short for the old lady's funeral, and the master told me to raise some money from the title-deeds of the family land but what is there left? Do you want us to default? I should never have taken on this job! All I can do is sell the things the old lady left me. Are you against that?" Pinger was sulkily turning out the chest when Hongyn darted in. "Quick, sister!" she cried. "Madam's in a bad way!" Ignoring Jia Lian, Pinger burned out to discover Xifeng clawing the air with both hands. Restraining her, she wept and cried for help. Jia Lian coming out to have a look stamped his foot. "Now this!" he groaned with tears. "I'm finished!" Just then Fenger announced, "They're asking for you outside, sir." And Jia Lian had to leave. Xifeng was now so delirious that her maids set up a great wailing which drew Qiaojie to the room. Granny Liu also hastened to the kang, to invoke Buddha and mutter incantations till Xifeng grew slightly calmer. Then Lady Wang arrived, alerted by one of the maids, and was relieved -384 to find Xifeng quieter. Greeting Granny Liu, she asked when she had come but after paying her respects the old woman could talk of nothing except Xifeng's illness. -384 Then Caiyun came in to report, "The master wants you, madam." So after giving Pinger a few instructions Lady Wang went away. Xifeng had come to her senses now. At the sight of Granny Liu, whose prayers she had faith in, she sent her maids away and asked the old woman to sit beside her. Told of her qualms and the ghosts she had seen, Granny Liu assured her that the Buddhist deities in her village temple could work miracles. 'Please offer prayers for me!" begged Xifeng. "If you need money for a sacrifice, I have some." She slipped off a golden bracelet and held it out to her. 'There's no call for this, madam. When we villagers recover after making pledges, we just spend a few hundred coppers. What need is there for all this? I shall pray for you and make some pledge, and once you're better you can spend as much as you like." Aware that she was in earnest, Xifeng could not insist. "Granny, my life is in your hands!" she said. "And my little Qiaojie is always ailing too I entrust her to you as well." Granny Liu assented readily and proposed, "In this case, as it's still early, I'll go back now.
I never thought Id be able to be there when she breathed her last. And the mistress gave me forty taels too, which was a very handsome reward to her for having brought me up, and more than I dared hope for. Baoyu turned to whisper to Sheyue, I didnt know Yuanyang was here too. If I go in, shell leave again in a huff. Wed better go back and leave them to chat in peace. Im glad she came, Xiren was lonely all on her own. So they slipped out quietly. Then Baoyu, stepping behind some rocks, lifted his gown. Sheyue and Qiuwen had stopped and averted their faces. Dont undo your pants till youve squatted down, they cried, or you may catch a chill on your stomach! When the two younger maids behind knew what he was up to, they hurried to the room where tea was made to get hot water. As Baoyu was about to rejoin the others, two of the servants wives approached. Whos that? they called. Its Baoyu, replied Qiuwen. Dont shout like that or you may startle him. Sorry, we didnt know, said the women with a smile. So weve caused you trouble on this festival. You must all be very busy, miss, these days. As they had drawn level now, Sheyue asked them what they were carrying. Some cakes and fruit from the old lady for Miss Jin and Miss Hua. Theyre playing The Eight Gallants over there, not The Magic Box, quipped Qiuwen. So where does this Goddess Jinhua come from? 1 Baoyu made Qiuwen and Sheyue open the hampers, and as they did so the two women squatted down. Seeing some of the choicest fruits, sweetmeats, cakes and dishes from the feast there, he nodded and moved on. The two girls hastily closed the hampers and followed. Those are friendly, tactful women, remarked Baoyu cheerfully. Theyll be tired out themselves these days, but they said how busy you must be. Theyre not boastful show-offs. Those two are all right, rejoined Sheyue. Some of the others really have no manners. Youre intelligent girls, he said. You should make allowances for those poor coarse creatures. By now he had approached the Garden gate. The nurses, who had been looking out for him while drinking and gaming, tagged after him as soon as he reappeared and followed him to the corridor behind the feasting hall in the small garden. There the two young maids had been waiting for some time, one holding a basin, the other a towel and a small flask of ointment. Qiuwen dipped her fingers in the basin. How careless youre growing, she scolded. Fancy bringing such cold water! Its the fault of the weather, miss, explained the girl. I took boiling water for fear it might get cold but its cooled off all the same. Just then, as luck would have it, up came a nurse with a kettle of boiling water. Please give me some of that, granny, begged the girl. This is to make tea for the old lady, retorted the nurse. Fetch some for yourself, lass. It wont hurt you to walk a few steps. Never mind who its for, put in Qiuwen. If you wont give us any, Ill pour water from the old ladys teapot to wash in. When the woman saw it was Qiuwen, she hastily poured them some water. Thats enough, said Qiuwen. At your age you should have more sense. As if we didnt know this was for the old lady! But why do you think we asked? The nurse smiled and apologized, My eyes are so dim I didnt see who it was, miss. When Baoyu had washed his hands, the girl with the flask poured some ointment over them which he rubbed in. Then Qiuwen and Sheyue, having rinsed their hands in the hot water and rubbed on ointment too, escorted him back to the hail. Baoyu now called for a pot of warm wine to toast Aunt Li and Aunt Xue, who both begged him to be seated. Let the boy fill your cups, said the Lady Dowager. And mind you empty them. She drained her own cup then. And when Lady Xing and Lady Wang followed suit, Aunt Xue and Aunt Li had to drink up too. Fill your cousins cups, the old lady told Baoyu. See that you do it properly and make them all drink up. Baoyu assented and filled every cup in turn. When he came to Daiyu she refused to drink but held the cup up to his lips, thanking him with a smile when he tossed it off.
I didnt want to, but my master insisted. He said, You wouldnt agree to going anywhere else, but serving the Jia family will be like serving us. So I came, sir. Your master should never have got into such trouble, reducing him to these straits. If I may make bold to say so, its because my masters too good. He always treats people honestly, and that landed him in trouble. Surely its good to be honest. But because he was too honest, sir, nobody liked him and he offended some people. Well, in that case Heaven will give him his due deserts, Jia Zheng laughed. Before Bao Yong could reply he went on to ask, Is it true, as I heard, that your younger masters name is also Baoyu? Yes, sir. Is he doing well? As for our Master Bao, sir, thats a strange story. Hes like his father too honest. As a child, what he liked best was playing about with girls, and though his parents gave him several good beatings he wouldnt mend his ways. That year our mistress came to the capital, Master Bao fell very ill. He lost consciousness for so long that his father was frantic and had all the funeral preparations made. Then, luckily, he came round. But he started raving that hed met a girl by an archway who took him into a temple, inside which were many cabinets filled with albums. Then going into a room he saw countless girls whod all turned into ghosts or skeletons. That set him screaming with fright. As soon as our master saw that hed come to he gave him good medical treatment, and gradually he recovered. After that, when our master sent him off to amuse himself with the girls, as he always used to, we discovered that hed changed he no longer enjoyed his old pleasures but much preferred to study. Even when they tried to coax him away from his books, he took no interest at all. So now, little by little, hes learning to help his father manage the household. Jia Zheng digested this in thoughtful silence. Go off and rest now, he said presently. When a task comes up that you can do, of course well assign you some duties. Bao Yong thanked him and withdrew, going out with the gateman to rest. But no more of this. One morning, Jia Zheng rose early and was setting off to his yamen when he noticed the servants at the gate whispering and muttering among themselves as if they had some news for him which they dared not report outright. He called them over. What is this hole-and-corner business? he demanded. We hardly dare tell you, sir, one of them answered. Why not? Out with it! This morning when we got up and opened the gate, we found a sheet of paper pasted on it, covered with scurrilous writing. The idea! exclaimed Jia Zheng. What was it? Dirty talk about Water Moon Convent, sir. Bring me the paper, he ordered. We tried to take it down, but it was glued on too firmly so we copied it out, then soaked the .paper to get it off. Just now Li De brought another sheet to show us the same as the one on the gate. We dare not hide it from you, sir. They presented the paper, and he read -748 Jia Qin, a young supervisor, To Water Moon Convent came. One male among so many females, Hes free to drink, whore and game. This worthless young master set in charge Is giving the Rong Mansion a bad name! So enraged by this that his mind reeled, Jia Zheng ordered the servants to say nothing about it but to make a quiet search of the walls of the alleys in the vicinity. He then sent for Jia Lian, who came hurrying over. Without any preliminaries Jia Zheng asked him, Have you ever checked up on those novices in Water Moon Convent? No, said ha Lian. Qins always been in charge of them. Do you think him capable of such a trust? Since you ask, sir, I suppose he must have fallen down on the job. Jia Zheng sighed. Look whats written on this poster! Jia Lian read it and exclaimed, Could this be true? Just then along came Jia Rong with an envelope marked Confidential addressed to Jia Zheng. When they opened it, they found another copy of the same anonymous lampoon as that pasted on the gate. Jia Zheng said, Tell Lai Da to go at once with three or four carriages to the convent, to bring back all those novices. Dont let word of this get out. Just tell them that theyre wanted in the Palace. Lai Da went off to carry out these orders. Now the young Buddhist and Taoist novices when first they went to the convent had been in the charge of an old abbess who daily taught them litanies and invocations.
They did so, giggling, while she pleaded to be let off. "Anybody who speaks out of turn again will be made to drink a whole pot of wine," warned Yuanyang. At this the old woman held her peace. "I shall use three dominoes," announced Yuanyang. "We'll start with the old lady and go round in turn, ending with Granny Liu. For example, I'll take a set of three dominoes and read out what's on each of the three in turn, ending with the name of the set. You must say either a line of classical poetry, a proverb or an adage after each and they must rhyme. A cup of wine is the forfeit for any mistake." Laughingly they all approved and begged her to start. "Here's a set," said Yuanyang. "On the left is the 'sky'" "The sky is blue on high," responded the Lady Dowager. "Bravo!" applauded the others. "In the centre's a 'five and six,'" Yuanyang continued. "Six bridges with the scent of plum admix." "The last piece is 'six and one."' "From fleecy clouds rises a round red sun." "Together they make a 'ghost distraught. '" "By his leg the ghost-catcher he's caught." While the whole party laughed and cheered, the Lady Dowager tossed off a cup of wine. Then Yuanyang resumed, "Here's another set. The one on the left is a 'double five. '" Aunt Xue responded "Plum blossom dances when soft winds arrive." "A 'double five' again here on the right." -400 "In the tenth month plum blossom scents the height." "In the middle 'two and five' make seven." "The Weaving Maid and Cowherd 3 meet in Heaven." "The whole O'er the Five Peaks the young god wends his way." "Immortal joys are barred to mortal clay." All applauded Aunt Xue's performance and she drank a cup. "Here's another set," said Yuanyang. "On the left 'two aces' combine." Xiangyun capped this "The sun and moon on earth and heaven shine." Yuanyang continued, "On the right 'double aces' are found." -400 "The idle flowers fall, noiseless, to the ground." "In the middle, a 'four and a one. '" "Red apricot leans on clouds beside the sun." "Together The cherries ripen nine times in all." "Birds in the Palace orchard make them fall." Her turn finished, Xiangyun drained her cup. "Next one," said Yuanyang. "On the left is a 'double three. '" Baochai responded, "Pairs of swallows chirp merrily." "Another 'double three' upon the right." -400 "The wind-trailed weeds seem belts of malachite." "In the middle, 'three and six' make nine." "Three hills across the azure sky incline." "Together A lonely boat moored by a chain." "The wind and waves bring sorrow in their train." In conclusion Baochai drank her wine. Yuanyang resumed, "The sign of 'heaven' on the left." Daiyu answered, "A fair season, a season bereft." 4 Baochai turned to dart her a glance, but for fear of a penalty Daiyu ignored her. Yuanyang continued, "In the middle a 'screen' finely wrought." "No maid a message to the gauze window has brought." 5 "That leaves only eight, by 'two and six' shown." "Together they pay homage at the jade throne." "Combined A basket in which to gather posies." "On her fairy wand she carries peonies." Having finished her turn Daiyu took a sip of wine. Yuanyang went on, "On the left, 'four and five' make nine." Yingchun responded, "The peach blossom is heavy with rain." "Fine her! Fine her!" cried the others. "That doesn't rhyme. Besides, why peach blossom?" Yingchun smiled and took a sip. The fact is that Xifeng and Yuanyang were so eager to hear Granny Liu make a fool of herself that they had urged the others to give wrong answers, so that all were fined. When it came to Lady Wang's turn, Yuanyang answered for her. Then it was Granny Liu's turn. "We country folk sometimes get together and play this when we've nothing better to do," said the old woman. "Mind you, our answers aren't so fine-sounding as yours. Still, I suppose I must try." "It's easy," they assured her.
Having sent his family home first, he was making his way there with a baggage-cart and a page when, by the Ford of Awakening in the Stream of Rapid Reversal, he saw a Taoist priest emerge from a thatched shed to greet him. Recognizing his old friend Zhen Shiyin, he promptly returned the greeting. "How have you been, worthy Mr. ha?" asked Shiyin. "So you are Master Zhen, Immortal One!" replied Yucun. "How is it that last time we met you refused to recognize me? Later I was very worried to hear that your temple had been burned down. Now that I am lucky enough to meet you again, I am sure your virtue must be even greater. As for me, owing to my own inveterate folly, I've now been reduced to this." "Last time you were a high official, so how could a poor priest claim acquaintance with you? As an old friend I ventured to offer you some advice, but you ignored it. However, wealth and poverty, success and failure are predestined. How amazing that we should meet again today! My humble temple is not far from here. Would you care to come for a chat?" Yucun agreed willingly. They walked off hand in hand, followed by the page with the cart till they reached a thatched temple. Shiyin invited Yucun in to sit down, and a boy served tea. Asked how he had come to renounce the world, Shiyin said with a smile, "It's easily done, with the speed of thought. Coming from the great world, sir, don't you know of a certain Baoyu who used to live in the lap of luxury?" "Of course I do! Recently it has been rumoured that he has entered Buddhist orders too. I met him several times, but never dreamed he would take such a decision." "That's where you were wrong! I knew his strange story in advance, and had already met him at the time when the two of us talked before the gate of my old house in Renqing Lane." "How could that be?" exclaimed Yucun in surprise. "With the capital so far from your honourable district!" "I met him in spirit a long time ago." "Then you know, no doubt, where he is now?" "Baoyu means 'divine jade.' Before the raid on the Rong and Ning Mansions, on the day when Baochai and Daiyu separated, that jade had already left the world of men to escape from calamity and effect a reunion. Then, former ties of affection severed, form and essence once more became one. It further showed its miraculous origin by passing the examination with distinction and begetting a noble son, proving that this jade is a treasure tempered by the divine powers of nature, not to be compared with ordinary objects. It was taken to the mortal worla by me Buddhist of Infinite Space and the Taoist of Boundless Time. Now that its mortal course is run, they have carried it back to its original place: this is what has happened to Baoyu." Yucun, though he understood barely half of this, nodded and mar- velled, "So that's the way it was! I'was too ignorant to know. But why, with such a spiritual origin, was Baoyu so enamoured of girls before he became so enlightened? Would you explain that?" "This may be hard for you to grasp fully, sir. The Illusory Land of Great Void is the Blessed Land of Truth. By reading the registers twice, he saw the beginning and the ending too all set down there in detail. How could that fail to enlighten him? Since the fairy herb has reverted to her true form, shouldn't the jade of 'spiritual understanding' do the same?" Yucun was mystified, but knowing that this was some divine secret he did not press for a fuller explanation. "You have told me about Baoyu," he said. "But there are many ladies in our humble clan; how is it that apart from the Imperial Consort all the others came to such undistinguished ends?" "You must allow me to speak bluntly, sir. All noble ladies come from the realm of love and retribution. From time immemorial, carnal desire has been their cardinal sin, and they must not even immerse themselves in ~ove. Thus Cui Yingying and Su Xiaoxiao 2 were immortals with earthly desires, while Song Yu and Sima Xiangru 3 were writers of genius whose works were wicked. Anyone ensnared by love can come to no good end!" Yucun absently stroked his beard and sighed. "I have one more question, Reverend Immortal," he ventured. "Will the Rong and Ning Mansions be restored to their former prosperity?" "It is an immutable law that the good are favoured by fortune while the dissolute meet with calamity.
How could I stick up for my mother at the expense of my elder uncle and aunt? he countered. Anyway, someones done wrong and if mother here wont take the blame, who will? I could have said it was my fault but Im sure you wouldnt have believed me. Yes, thats right, chuckled the Lady Dowager, Now kneel to your mother and ask her not to feel hurt, but to forgive me for your sake on account of my old age. Baoyu stepped forward and knelt to do as he was told, but his mother instantly stopped him. Get up, she cried with a smile. This is absurd. How can you apologize for your grandmother? As Baoyu rose to his feet the old lady said, And Xifeng didnt pull me up either. I havent said a word against you, madam, retorted Xifeng laughingly, but now youre trying to put the blame on me. All the others laughed and the old lady cried, This is strange! Lets hear what you have to say against me. Who told you, madam, to train your girls so well? If you bring one up as fresh as a sprig of young parsley, you cant blame people for wanting her. Its lucky Im a grandsons wife. If I were a grandson Id have grabbed her long ago. I shouldnt have waited till now. So its all my fault, is it? the old lady chortled. Of course it is, agreed Xifeng. In that case I wont keep her. You can take her away. Wait till Ive done enough good deeds in this life to be reborn as a man. Then Ill marry her. You can take her and give her to Lian. See if that shameless father-in-law of yours still wants her then or not. Lian doesnt deserve her, said Xifeng. Hell have to make do with scarecrows like Pinger and me. They were all laughing at this when Lady Xing was announced, and Lady Wang went out to greet her. If you want to know what followed, read the next chapter. Chapter 47 A Stupid Bully Is Beaten Up for His Amorous Advances A Cool Young Gentleman Leaves Home for Fear of Reprisals Lady Wang hurried out to greet Lady Xing who had come in the hope of news, unaware that the Lady Dowager knew all about her proposal to Yuanyang. Only as she stepped into the courtyard was she quietly apprised of this by some serving-women but it was too late to retreat now that her arrival had been announced and Lady Wang had come out to meet her. She had no choice but to go in and pay her respects. The old lady received her without a word, to her great mortification. Xifeng had already left on the pretext of some business, while Yuanyang had retired to her room to sulk. Now Aunt Xue, Lady Wang and the others withdrew one by one to spare Lady Xing embarrassment. She herself dared not leave, however. Once they were alone the Lady Dowager sneered, I hear youve been doing some matchmaking for you husband. Quite a model of wifely submission and virtue, arent you? Only you carry this obedience too far. You have children and grand children now, yet youre still afraid of him. Instead of giving him a little good advice you let him carry on just as he pleases. Blushing all over her face Lady Xing replied, I have reasoned with him several times, but he pays no attention. You know how it is, madam. I had no choice. Would you commit murder too if he insisted? Have some sense! Your sister-in-law is a simple soul and, for all her poor health, she has to worry about high and low in this household. Though your daughter-in-law helps her, her work is never done. So I dont make too many demands on them, and when the two of them overlook certain things, that child Yuanyang is thoughtful enough to attend to my wants. She sees I get what I need, and tells them in time what wants replenishing. If not for her, in all their press of business the pair of them would be bound to forget this or that. Do you expect me to see to everything? To work out every day what I need to ask for? Shes the only maid left me whos not just a child and knows something of my ways and temperament. In the second place she gets on well with the older and younger mistresses alike here, and never tries in my name to ask this mistress for clothes or that for money. So during the last few years the whole household old and young, starting with your sister-in-law and daughter-in-law, all trust her. Its not just that I rely on her, she saves them trouble too.
Now as this was the eve of the Double Fifth Festival, the twelve young actresses had been given a holiday and were amusing themselves in different parts of the Garden. Baoguan who played young scholars and Yuguan who played young ladies were enjoying themselves in Happy Red Court with Xiren, when it came on to rain. They stopped up the drain to make water collect in the yard and caught some water-fowl- green -headed ducks, speckled mallards and mandarin ducks. Having tied their wings they let these loose in the yard, after which they bolted the gate. While they stood on the verandah enjoying the fun, Baoyu arrived back only to find the gate closed. The girls were laughing too much to hear his knock, so that he shouted and pounded for a long time before they finally heard. And of course they were not expecting him back at this time. "Who's that at the gate?" asked Xiren. "Who'll go and see?" "It's I!" cried Baoyu. "Sounds like Miss Baochai," said Sheyue. "Nonsense!" exclaimed Qingwen. "Miss Baochai wouldn't come at this hour." "I'll peep through a crack," offered Xiren, "to see if it's somebody we should let in. If it's not, we'll let whoever it is get a soaking." She went along the covered corridor to the gate and discovered Baoyu there, drenched as a drowned cock. Torn between concern and amusement she hastily opened the gate, then doubled up with laughter, clapping her hands. "How were we to know you were back?" she spluttered. "Where have you been, running about in such a downpour?" Baoyu, in a foul temper, had decided to punish whoever opened the gate. Without waiting to see who it was, and assuming that this was one of the younger girls, he kicked Xiren so hard in the side that she let out a cry. "You low creatures!" he stormed. "I treat you so well that you've lost all sense of respect. Now you dare make fun of me!" At this point he lowered his head and heard Xiren's cry. He realized then what a blunder he had made. "Oh, is it you?" He smiled apologetically. "Where did I kick you?" Xiren had never had so much as a harsh word from Baoyu. Now that he had lost his temper and kicked her in public too -- she felt overwhelmed with shame, resentment and pain. But sure that he hadn't done this deliberately, she did her best to control herself. "It's all right," she answered. "Go in and change your clothes." Once inside he said contritely, "This is the first time in my life I've lashed out in a temper -- and it had to be at you." Still wincing she helped him out of his wet clothes. "I'm your number one maid," she answered jokingly, "So I should have first share of everything big or small, good or bad. I just hope you won't make a habit of kicking people." "I didn't mean to do it." "I'm not saying you did. Usually it's the younger ones who go to the gate. They're all so spoilt that nobody can stand them, and they're not afraid of anyone either. It would have served them right if you'd kicked one of them to frighten them. Today Im to blame for not letting them open the gate." By now the rain had stopped. Both Baoguan and Yuguan had left. What with the pain in her side and her vexation, Xiren ate nothing that evening. And when she undressed to have her bath she was frightened by the bruise, the size of a bowl, below her ribs, but could hardly remark on it. The pain continued after she was in bed and made her groan in her sleep. Though Baoyu had not kicked her deliberately, Xiren's obvious discomfort disturbed him. And hearing her cry out during the night he realized how badly he must have hurt her. He slipped out of bed, took the lamp, and went over to have a look. Just as he reached her bedside she coughed, then brought up some phlegm and opened her eyes with a gasp. "What are you doing?" she asked in surprise when she saw him. "You were groaning in your sleep. I must have hurt you badly. Let me have a look." "I feel dizzy and there's a bitter-sweet taste in my throat. Throw the light on the floor, will you?" Baoyu did as she asked and saw that she had coughed blood. "How dreadful!" he exclaimed. Xiren's heart failed her at the sight of the blood. But to know what followed, you must read the next chapter.
And though Madam You came over every day she dealt only with routine matters, careful not to overstep her authority. In any case she was too busy, for besides being in sole charge of the Ning Mansion she had to see to the daily food and supplies for the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang in the hostel where they were staying. While those in charge of the two mansions had their hands full in this way, all the chief stewards were busy too those who had not left earlier to look for lodgings for their masters and mistresses during the funeral ceremonies, either accompanied their masters to court or were busy handling jobs in their hostel outside. And in the absence of proper supervision, the servants of both mansions slacked or ganged up under the provisory chief stewards to abuse their power. The only stewards left in the Rong Mansion were Lai Da and a few in charge of outside business. Deprived of his usual assistants, Lai Da delegated authority to some ignorant rogues who proved far from satisfactory, cheating him and sending in false accusations or recommendations. But we need not dwell here on all the trouble they caused. As other official families were now disbanding their private opera troupes, Madam You and the others decided that when Lady Wang came home they would suggest dispensing with the services of their twelve child-actresses too. We bought those girls, they told her, so even if we stop training them we can keep them on as maids, just dismissing their instructors. We cant treat them as servants, objected Lady Wang. Theyre the daughters of respectable families, whose parents being unable to make a living sold them into this low trade to dress up as ghosts and demons for several years. Heres our chance to give them a few taels of silver as travelling-expenses would be unkind, and niggardly too. We still have a few old actresses here, its true, but they had their own reasons for not wanting to leave, which is why we kept them on as attendants and eventually married them to our own servants. Lets find out which of these twelve girls want to go home, proposed Madam You. Then we can send word to their parents to come and fetch them and give them a few taels of silver as travelling-expenses. But we must make sure that its their parents who come for them, not some scoundrels who pretend to be their kinsmen and take them off merely to sell them all over again. For in that case, wouldnt our kindness come to nothing? Anyone who doesnt want to leave can stay. When Lady Wang approved, Madam You sent to inform Xifeng and ordered the steward in charge to give each of the instructors an eight-tael gratuity with free permission to leave. Everything in Pear Fragrance Court was inventoried and put away, and some servants were appointed to guard the place at night. More than half the twelve young actresses, when summoned and questioned, proved reluctant to go home. Some said that their parents were only out to make money, and if they went back they would be sold again others that their parents were dead, and they had been sold by their uncles or their brothers others that they had nowhere to go yet others that they had no wish to leave this family which had been so good to them. In all, only four or five elected to leave. When Lady Wang heard this she had to keep them. The few who chose to leave were instructed to stay with their foster-mothers until their own parents should come for them. Of those who chose to remain, Wenguan was kept by the Lady Dowager, most of the rest being sent to different apartments in the Garden. Fangguan who played the part of young ladies was assigned to Baoyu Ruiguan who played pert maids to Baochai Ouguan who played young gentlemen to Daiyu Kuiguan who played the chief warriors to Xiangyun Douguan who played lesser warriors to Baoqin and Aiguan who played old men to Tanchun. Madam You then took Jiaguan whose role was old women. Once places had been found for them, they were as merry the whole day long in the Garden as caged birds newly set free for everyone showed them indulgence, knowing that they had never learned to sew or wait on other people. One or two of the more intelligent, however, were worried by their lack of useful skills now that they had given up acting so they began to learn sewing, weaving and other tasks expected of girls. Soon the day came for the great sacrifice at court. The Lady Dowager and her party went at dawn to the hostel, where they had some refreshments before proceeding to court. After breakfast they retired to the hostel for a short rest, returning to court after lunch and a nap for the noon and evening sacrifices, then going back for another rest and not returning home until after dinner.
As she stepped over the threshold in the dim lamplight, she saw the shadowy figure of a woman who appeared to be about to hang herself with the scarf in her hand. Yuanyang felt no fear but wondered, "Who is she? She has the same idea as mine, but is a step ahead of me." "Who are you?" she asked. "Since we're both of the same mind, let's die together." The other made no reply, and Yuanyang approaching her saw that it Was not one of their household. When she tried to look closer, the air struck chill and the apparition vanished. In stupefaction she left the room and sat down on the kang. "Ah, I know," she murmured after a moment's reflection. "That was Master Rong's first wife from the East Mansion. She died so long ago, what brought her here? She must have come to summon me. But why should she hang herself?" She thought it over and decided, "That's it. She's showing me the way." This train of thought enabled an evil spirit to take possession of her and standing up, weeping, she opened her dressing-case to take out the lock of hair which she had cut off when she swore never to leave the old lady's service. Having tucked it inside her tunic, she undid her sash and looped it over the beam indicated by Qin Keqing. Then she wept again until the sound of guests dispersing outside made her afraid that someone might come in. She made haste to close ffie door, moved over a footstool and stood on it, tied the sash into a noose, slipped it round her throat and kicked the stool away. Then, alas, strangled to death, her sweet spirit took flight! Her wraith was wondering where to go when she saw Qin Keqing's shadowy form in front. She overtook her crying, "Wait for me, Madam Rong!" "I am not Madam Rong," was the reply, "but the sister of the Goddess of Disenchantment." "I can see quite clearly that you're Madam Rong why should you deny it?" "Let me tell you the reason, then you'll understand. I was the Arbiter of True Love in the palace of the goddess, and all romantic affairs were in my charge then I descended to the dusty world as the most amorous of mortals, to lead all lovesick maidens back betimes to the Board of Love. This is why it was my Tot to hang myself. Now that I have seen through earthly love, passed over the sea of love and returned to heaven, there is no one in charge of the Board of Infatuation in the Illusory Land of Great Void. The Goddess of Disenchantment has appointed you in my Place to head this Board, and has therefore ordered me to lead you there." "I have never known passion," replied Yuanyang's spirit. "How can I count as amorous?" "You don't understand. Mortals mistake carnal appetite for love, and at at at at at at at at justify their immorality by calling themselves romantics and passing it off lightly. In fact, before the expression of joy or anger, grief or happiness, love is latent in each one's nature once these feelings are expressed then we have passion. Our love is as yet unexpressed like a flower in bud. If once expressed, it would cease to be true love." Yuanyang's wraith nodded agreement, then followed Keqing's spirit. After Hupo had bid farewell to the dead and heard Their Ladyships designate caretakers, she decided to go and ask Yuanyang what carriage they would be taking the next day. Unable to find her in the old lady's room, she approached the smaller room which opened off it. The door was closed, but peeping through a crack she was startled by the dim lamplight and flickering shadows, though she could hear not a sound. She went away exclaiming, "Where can the wretch have run off to?" Bumping into Zhenzhu she asked, "Have you seen Sister Yuanyang?" "I'm looking for her too," was the answer. "Their Ladyships want her. Is she asleep in the annex?" "I had a peep and didn't see anyone. The lamp hasn't been trimmed, and it was too dark and scary to go in. But now we can go in together, to make sure there's no one inside." As they went in to trim the lamp Zhenzhu exclaimed, "Who put the stool here? It nearly tripped me up!" Happening to look up, she let out a little scream and fell backward, knocking hard against Hupo, who by then had also seen the fearful sight.
When the master was promoted, second uncle sent an opera troupe to perform here, and I told the family in confidence, 'Second uncle's very tight-fisted, not like our elder uncle. The two families keep bickering over money. When our elder uncle died, didn't his younger brother try to grab his property?' That's why I advised them, when his birthday came round, to pay back the opera so that we wouldn't be beholden to him. But what's the idea, celebrating his birthday in advance this year?" "You're still in the dark," said Jia Lian. "As soon as your brother came to the capital, he held a requiem for your elder uncle. For fear that we might stop him, he didn't tell us and he made thousands of taels out of the donations. Later, your second uncle bawled him out for grabbing the whole lot. Then, under pressure, he thought up another trick. He's invited guests on the pretext that it's second uncle's birthday, fishing for more money from them to pacify him. What does he care whether it's summer or winter, or whether relatives and friends know the date of the birthday or not? That's how shameless he is! "Do you know why I got up so early? The censors have investigated the business by the coast and discovered a deficit during your elder uncle's term of office. As he's dead, his younger brother Wang Zisheng and his nephew Wang Ren have to make it good. In desperation, the two of them come to enlist my help and because they looked scared stiff, and because they're related to you and our mistress, I agreed. I wanted to get Old Qiu who's in charge of the inner court to fix it up by transferring the deficit to some earlier or later account. Unfortunately I got there too late, after he'd gone to the Palace. So I went to all that trouble for nothing. But your brother's still ordering operas and giving feasts. Isn't that maddening?" Although Xifeng knew that Wang Ren was in the wrong, it was not her way to admit it. "Whatever he's like, he's your brother-in-law," she said. "Besides, both the elder uncle who's dead and the second uncle who's alive should be grateful for what you're doing. It goes without saying that as this is our Wang family business, I must beg you humbly to help otherwise other people will get blamed on my account and curse me behind my back." In tears, she threw back her bedding and sat up, gathering her hair into a loose knot and slipping on some clothes. "You don't have to take on like that," said Jia Lian. "It's your brother who' 5 so disgusting. I didn't blame you. When I was out and you were poorly, these maids were still sleeping even after I was up -- since when has that been the rule in our family? You let it go, to show how kindhearted you are. When I say a word against someone, you get up. If I find fault with them tomorrow, will you take all the blame on yourself? This is so pointless!" "It's high time for me to get up now," answered Xifeng, drying her eyes. "If that's how you feel, I'll be grateful if you'll fix things up for them. Not only for my sake either. When the mistress hears about it, she'll be pleased too." "All right. I know. You don't have to teach me that." "Why get up so early, madam?" asked Pinger. "Don't you have a fixed time for getting up every day? Master Lian's in a bad temper over something and taking it out on u That's just too bad!" She turned to challenge him, "Madam's done enough for you, hasn't she, always bearing the brunt for you? It's not my place to say this, sir, but you've taken advantage of her all this time, and it's not much you're doing for her now -- not just for her sake either yet you make such a song and dance about it. Don't you mind hurting her feelings? "Besides, you can't pin this on her. If we get up late, you've a right to be angry with us -- after all, we're only slaves. But madam's ruined her health by wearing herself out. Why treat her so unkindly?" She was on the verge of tears. Jia Lian had been bursting with rage, but he was floored by these sharp yet gentle reproaches from his lovely wife and beautiful concubine. "All right, all right!" he laughed. "She's quite enough for me to cope with, without your taking her side. Anyway I'm not wanted here the sooner I die the better off you'll be." "Don't talk like that," Xifeng retorted.
Inwardly fuming, she had not known how to retaliate until Yinger made this joke. Now, presuming on her seniority, she raised her cane and struck her niece several blows. Little bitch! she swore. Ill teach you to talk back! Your mothers grinding her teeth, itching to tear you to pieces and chew you up. Yet you still answer me back in that pert way! Hurt and humiliated, Chunyan sobbed, Sister Yinger was only joking, yet you believed her and beat me. Why should my mother be angry? Ive not boiled away her water or burned her pan. What have I done wrong? Yinger, seeing that her teasing had really angered the woman, now caught her by the arm. I was only joking, she said soothingly. By beating her you make me feel bad too. Dont meddle with our affairs, miss, snapped the other. Cant we punish our own children just because youre here? This stupid gibe made Yinger flush with anger. She let go of the woman with a scornful laugh. You can punish her any time you please. Why do it just after I make a joke? All right go ahead. With that she sat down again and was going on making her basket when who should appear but Chunyans mother in search of her daughter. Why havent you fetched water yet? she called. What are you doing there? Come and look at this minx! her sister-in-law chimed in. She wont obey even me. She keeps answering back. Mother He came over to them. Now whats the girl up to? she demanded. You may have no respect for your own mother, but you should at least show some respect to your aunt. Yinger tried to explain what had happened, but Chunyans aunt would not let her get a word in. Pointing to the flower basket on the rock she fumed See! Your girls not a child any more, yet she still fools about. When she brings people here to wreck the place, how can I tell them off? Mother Hes tiff with Fangguan still rankled, and Chunyans waywardness made her even angrier. Stepping forward she boxed her ears. You bitch! she cried. A few years in high society and you imitate the ways of those loose women. Ill have to teach you a lesson. I may not be able to control my foster-child but youre my own spawn. Im not afraid of you! Even if I cant go where you young bitches go, why dont you stay put there, waiting on your mistress? Why gad about outside so shamelessly? Grabbing the osiers she brandished them in Chunyans face. Whats this youre making? Your mothers arse? We made that, cut in Yinger. Dont scold the locust while pointing at the mulberry. Mother He was eaten up with jealousy of senior maids such as Xiren and Qingwen, who had more prestige and authority in the different compounds than she. Fearing them and forced to defer to them, she could only work off her rage and resentment on others. Now the sight of Ouguan, to whom her sister had such an aversion, added fuel to the fire of the anger. Chunyan set off in tears to Happy Red Court. Afraid that if questioned she would explain why she was crying and make Qingwen angry again, her mother shouted frantically Come back! Ive something to tell you. But Chunyan kept right on. Her mother in desperation chased after her. When the girl turned and saw her, she broke into a run then Mother He, in hot pursuit, slipped on the moss and fell at which the other three girls burst out laughing. In disgust, Yinger tossed all her flowers and twigs into the stream and went back to her room, while Chunyans aunt crossly invoked the aid of Buddha. May a thunderbolt strike the wicked little bitch, spoiling all those flowers! she swore. She then picked more flowers to take to the various apartments. Meanwhile Chunyan, running into Happy Red Court, bumped into Xiren setting off to call on Daiyu. She caught hold of her, begging Save me, miss! My mothers beating me again. Annoyed to see Mother He close behind, Xiren said, You beat your foster-daughter one day, your own daughter the next. Are you showing off how many daughters you have? Or do you really not know the rules here? The woman, although only recently come to the Garden, had sized up Xiren as quiet and good-tempered. You dont understand, miss, so dont meddle in our affairs, she retorted. Youre the ones who spoil them. Just mind your own business. She chased after Chunyan then to beat her again. While Xiren indignantly turned back into the courtyard.
You ignorant lot! retorted the little mouse, resuming her original form. You only know what sweet taros are, but dont know that the daughter of Salt Commissioner Lin is sweeter than any taro. 2 Daiyu scrambled over and pinned Baoyu down. You scoundrel! she cried laughing. I knew you were making fun of me. She pinched Baoyu until he begged for mecry. Dear cousin, let me off. I wont do it again, he pleaded. It was smelling that sweet scent of yours that reminded me of this allusion. You make fun of me and dare pretend its an allusion.... Just then in walked Baochai with a radiant face. Whos talking about allusions? she asked. I must hear this. Daiyu hastily offered her a seat. Cant you see? She laughed. He mocks me, then pretends its an allusion. Cousin Bao, is it? No wonder. Baochai smiled. He knows so many allusions. The only trouble is that he forgets them just when he needs them most. If his memory is so good today, why didnt he remember that allusion about the plantain the other night? He actually forgot the most obvious one. Everyone else was freezing, but he was so frantic that he was perspiring. So now his memory has come back again. Amida Buddha! cried Daiyu laughing outright. Shes my good sister after all. Youve met your match now. This just shows that no one can escape retribution. At that moment the sound of squabbling and angry shouting broke out in Baoyus apartments. What it was will be disclosed in the next chapter. Chapter 2 Lady Jia Dies in the City of Yangzhou Leng Zixing Describes the Rong Mansion A verse says: Who can guess the outcome of a game of chess? Incense burned out, tea drunk - its still in doubt. To interpret the signs of prosperity or decline An impartial onlooker must be sought out. Rearing the hubbub at his gate, Feng Su hurried out so see what the messengers wanted. Ask Mr. Zhen to come out, they bawled. Be quick about it. My name is Feng, not Zhen, he answered with an ingratiating smile. My son-in-laws name is Zhen, but he left home a year or two ago to become a priest. Is he the man you want? How would we know? Were here on the prefects orders. If youre his father-in-law, you must come and clear this up with His Honour to save us another trip. Giving Feng Su no chance to protest they dragged him off, while his whole household trembled, not knowing what this portended. Towards the end of the second watch he returned in the highest of spirits. Asked what had happened, he told them This new prefect, Jia Hua, is a native of Huzhou and an old friend of my son-in-law. When he passed our gate and saw our Jiaoxing buying thread, he supposed that Shiyin had moved his household here. He seemed very upset when I explained all that had happened. He asked after my granddaughter too and I told him she was lost on the Feast of Lanterns. Never mind, said His Honour. Ill have a search made and Im certain we shall find her. At the end of our conversation, as I was leaving, he gave me two taels of silver. Zhens wife was very moved by this. And so the night passed. Early the next morning a messenger arrived from Jia Yucun with two packets of silver and four lengths of brocade for Mrs. Zhen as a token of gratitude. There was also a confidential letter for Feng Su asking him to persuade Mrs. Zhen to let the prefect have Jiaoxing as his secondary wife. Feng Su could hardly contain himself for joy. Eager to please the prefect, he prevailed on his daughter to agree and that very same night put Jiaoxing in a small sedan-chair and escorted her to the yamen. We need not dwell on Yucuns satisfaction. He gave Feng Su a hundred pieces of silver and sent Mrs. Zhen many gifts, urging her to take good care of her health while he ascertained her daughters whereabouts. Feng Su went home and there we can leave him. Now Jiaoxing was the maid who had looked back at Yucun that year in Gusu, little dreaming that one casual glance could have such an extraordinary outcome. And so doubly kind was fate that within a year of marriage she bore a son while after another half year Yucuns wife contracted a disease and died, and then he made Jiaoxing his wife, further improving her position.
To tease him they said they dared not take anything with the mistress away so when they werent looking he went in and took the things. Those silly creatures didnt know, thats why they got scared. Now that Baoyu knows this has involved other people, hes told me the whole story and shown me the things he took theres nothing missing. He got that pachyma flour outside as well, and shared it out to a whole lot of people, not just the girls in the Garden. Even the nannies got some to take out for their relatives, some of whom passed it on to other people. Xiren gave some to Fangguan and others too. This was just doing friends a favour, nothing unusual. As for those two baskets brought the other day, theyre still in the hall and the seals on them havent been broken so how can we accuse people of pilfering them? Wait till Ive reported this to my mistress and then well see. She went into the bedroom to tell Xifeng the same story. Thats all very well, said Xifeng, but we know Baoyu. He sticks up for those girls even if theyre in the wrong. And if people appeal to him or flatter him crowning him with a charcoal basket hell agree to anything. If we take his word for it and theres worse trouble of this kind in future, how are we to control these servants? We must go on making detailed investigations. My plan is to fetch all the maids from the mistress house here. No need to torture or beat them we can just make them kneel in the sun on shards of porcelain with nothing to eat or drink. If they dont come clean, theyll have to kneel all day. Then even if theyre made of iron, in a day theyre bound to confess. She added, Flies go for cracked eggs. Even if this Liu woman didnt steal anything, she must have been up to something or people wouldnt have accused her. Even if we dont punish her, we should dismiss her thats the usual court procedure. It wouldnt be doing her an injustice. Why trouble yourself over this? countered Pinger. We should be lenient whenever we can. This isnt anything so important that you cant overlook it. What I feel is this however hard you work over here, youll be going back eventually to the other house so why make enemies of the servants here, making them bear you a grudge? Its not as if you havent troubles enough of your own. You managed after years to conceive a son but lost him in the seventh month through a miscarriage brought on, for all we know, by overworking and getting too upset and worked up over things. Wouldnt it be better, while its not too late, to shut your eyes to half of whats going on? This advice made Xifeng smile. All right, you little bitch, she said. Do whatever you like. Im just feeling slightly better I dont want to lose my temper. Thats the right way to talk! chuckled Pinger. With that she went out to deal with the women outside one by one. To know what happened later, read the next chapter. Chapter 62 Sweet Xiangyun Sleep Tipsily Among Peonies Silly Xiangling Coyly Takes Off Her Pomegranate Skirt Pinger, going out as we saw, told Lin Zhixiaos wife, A prosperous family ought to minimize big scandals and overlook minor ones. It wouldnt look good if we were to ring bells, beat drums and raise a rumpus over a trifle. So take mother and daughter back now theyre to keep their jobs. And send Qin Xians wife back as well. Theres no need to say any more about this business. Just make a careful inspection every day. With that she left. Mrs. Liu and Wuer hastily stepped forward to kowtow their thanks, after which Mrs. Lin took them back to the Garden and reported the matter to Li Wan and Tanchun, both of whom approved of the way it had been settled. So Siqi and the rest had worked themselves up for nothing. And Qin Xians wife, after this stroke of luck came her way, was able to gloat for no more than half a day. She had busily taken over and checked up on the utensils, rice, grain, charcoal and so forth in the kitchen, where she discovered serious shortages. Theres two piculs of good rice short, she observed. An extra months supply of ordinary rice has been drawn in advance, and theres charcoal missing as well. At the same time she prepared presents for Mrs. Lin, secretly getting ready a load of charcoal, five hundred catties of firewood and one picul of good rice outside the Garden for her nephew to take to the Lins house.
"Nothing too common," said Tanchun. "Nothing too new-fangled either. As we happened to start with poems on begonia, why not call it Begonia Club? Even if this sounds a little commonplace, as it's based on fact that doesn't matter." After some further discussion and some refreshments they parted, some going back to their own rooms, others calling on the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. But no more of this. Now Xiren had wondered what Baoyu was up to when he hurried off with Cuimo after reading the note. When two women from the back gate brought in two pots of begonia some time later, she asked where these were from and was told what had happened. Xiren made them put the plants down and take seats in the servants' room while she went inside, weighed out sixty cents of silver and fetched another three hundred cash which she handed to the two women. "This silver is for the boys who brought the flowers," she explained. "And the cash is for you to buy drinks." The two women stood up, beaming, to thank her profusely and make a show of declining but on Xiren's insistence they accepted the tip. "Are there any pages on duty outside the back gate?" she asked them. "Yes, there are four of them there every day," they answered. "If there's anything you want done, miss, we can tell them." "There's nothing I want," answered Xiren, smiling. "But Master Bao wanted to send something today to Miss Shi in the house of the young marquis. It's lucky you came. When you go out, please tell those boys at the back gate to hire a carriage. As soon as it arrives you can come here to get the money. Don't let them knock around in the front." When the women had left to see to this, Xiren went back inside to look for a plate on which to put the gifts for Xiangyun but the plate she wanted was missing from the carved cabinet. Turning round, she saw Qingwen, Qiuwen and Sheyue busy with their needlework. "What's become of that white agate plate with spiral designs?" she asked them. The girls looked at each other but could not remember. "It was used to send lichees to Miss Tanchun," said Qingwen after some thought. "They've not sent it back yet." "There are plenty of everyday dishes you could have used. Why choose that particular one?" Xiren inquired. "Just what I said. But he insisted that plate looked best with the fresh lichees. And when I took it over, Miss Tanchun liked it so much she told me to leave the fruit on it so I didn't bring it back. Look, that pair of vases from the top shelf hasn't come back either." "Speaking of those vases reminds me of something funny," put in Qiuwen. "When our Master Bao takes it into his head to be filial, he really goes the whole hog. When he saw the fragrant osmanthus in bloom in the Garden he picked two sprays for himself, but all of a sudden he thought better of it. He said, 'These flowers have just bloomed in our own garden, I shouldn't be the first to enjoy them.' He promptly took down those two vases, filled them with water and put the sprays in himself, then having them carried over, he went personally to deliver on to his grandmother, another to his mother. "This sudden filial piety on his part brought good luck to his messenger too. I happened to be the one who went that day, and the old lady was as pleased as pleased could be. She told everyone "'What a good grandson Baoyu is after all, even sending me flowers like this! Yet other people blame me for spoiling him.' "You know how little the old lady usually has to say to me. I've never been a favourite of hers. But that day she told them to give me a few strings of cash, saying I was a 'poor, delicate little thing.' What an unexpected stroke of luck! A few strings of cash mayn't be much, but it was a rare honour. "Then I went to Her Ladyship's place just as she was looking through some cases with Madam Lian and the concubines Zhao and Zhou, sorting out the bright clothes she'd worn in her young days to give away. When I went in she stopped looking at the clothes to admire the flowers. And to please her Madam Lian started praising Baoyu for being such a considerate, filial son -- she came out with two cartloads of compliments. Her Ladyship felt that in front of everyone she had gained credit because of him, and this should silence those who had gossiped about him.
Thats very true, agreed Pinger. And theres big expenditure still to come with the marriages of three or four young ladies and two or three young masters, as well as the Old Ancestress funeral. Ive taken those into account. Weve enough for that. The marriages of Baoyu and Daiyu wont cost the estate anything, as the old lady will pay for them herself. We can count Yingchun out too, as she belongs to the Elder Masters side. That leaves Tanchun and Xichun, who will require ten thousand taels each at the most. Huans marriage shouldnt cost more than three thousand, which we can raise easily by cutting down on other expenses. As for the old ladys funeral, all the preparations have already been made, and sundry minor expenses will amount at most to another four or five thousand. So if we economize now we should do all right. Its only the possibility of some unforeseen expenses that makes me anxious, for then wed really be in serious trouble. Still, its no use worrying now. Hurry up and have your meal, then go back to hear what theyre discussing. This is just the chance I wanted it worried me that I had no assistant. Although theres Baoyu, hes not cut out for the job even if I win him to my side hes not much use. Madam Zhus too saintly to be of any use either. And Yingchuns even worse, apart from the fact that she doesnt belong to our house. Xiehuns still too young Lans even younger. As for Huan, hes like a kitten half perished with cold, always looking for a stove or heated kang to creep under and get his hair singed. It really and truly passes my understanding how one mother could bear two such utterly different children! Daiyu and Baochai, now, are both good girls but not being daughters of our family they cant very well mind our affairs. Besides, ones a lovely paper lantern which a puff of wind will blow out and its no use asking the other anything, as shes made up her mind not to open her mouth about matters that dont concern her, but to shake her head in answer to all questions. That leaves only Tanchun, whos quick in the uptake with a ready tongue, a daughter of the house and a favourite with the mistress she just doesnt show it because of the trouble made by that old bitch Concubine Zhao, but at heart shes as fond of her as of Baoyu. Tanchuns totally different from Huan, whom nobody could like. If I had my way, hed have been thrown out long ago. Now that shes made this proposal, we should co-operate and help each other then I wont be on my own any longer. From the point of view of whats fair and right, a helper like her will save us worry and make the mistress task so much easier. From a selfish point of view, Ive made myself so unpopular that its time for me to back down and look about me because if I go on being so strict I shall get myself thoroughly hated, and everybodys smiles will hide daggers! You and I have only four eyes and two brains between us if they once catch us off guard they can do for us. We must make the most of this chance. So long as shes in charge, theyll forget their past grudges against us for the time being. And theres another thing I must tell you, as you may not have spotted it for all youre so smart. Young as Tanchun is shes no fool, only careful how she talks. In fact, with her book-learning, shes smarter than I am. She must know the saying To catch rebels first catch the chief. So to set an example shes bound to start with me. If she reverses any of my decision, dont argue with her but back her up, the more respectfully the better. On no account protest for feat I lose face. Long before the end of this speech Pinger was smiling. What do you take me for a fool? she retorted. Thats what Ive been doing, and here you are warning me. I was afraid youd forget other people in your concern for me, thats why. If thats what youve been doing, it shows youve more sense than I have. Dont get so worked up, though, that you forget yourself and whom youre talking to. Thats my way, countered Pinger. If you dont like it you can slap my face again. It wont be the first time. You bitch! Xifeng laughed. How many times do you have to harp on that? Why be so provoking when you can see Im ill? Come and sit down. As were all on our own lets have our meal together. Fenger and three or four other young maids came in then with a small table, which they set on the kang.
Take this to Zijuan, she instructed her. Just tell her Im giving her this for sundries, and she mustnt hesitate to ask for things that are their due, but lets have no more talk of advancing the monthly allowance. Shes quite clever enough to catch on. When Ive time, I shall call to see Miss Lin. Mrs. Zhou, assenting, took the silver and left. No more of this. Now as Jia Lian was on his way out a page had approached and reported, The Elder Master wants you, sir. He hurried over and Jia She informed him, Weve just had word that an Imperial Physician and two assistants were summoned to the Palace to attend a patient it can hardly be one of the maids-of-honour or attendants. Has there been any news from the Imperial Consorts palace these last few days? None, sir. Go and ask the Second Master and your brother Jia Zhen, or send to find out from the Academy of Imperial Physicians. Accordingly, Jia Lian dispatched a man to the Academy of Imperial Physicians, then went over to see Jia Zheng. Where did you hear that? asked Jia Zheng when he had explained his errand. From the Elder Master just now. You and your brother Zhen had better go to the Palace to find out. Ive already sent to the Academy of Imperial Physicians. Jia Lian then withdrew to find Jia Zhen and, meeting him, told him about this. I heard the same news, said Jia Zhen. I was on my way to tell Their Lordships. Both went together to Jia Zheng, who said, If its our Imperial Consort, were bound to be sent some word. Jia She joined them then and they waited till the afternoon, but the messengers sent out had still not returned. Then in came a gatekeeper. Two Imperial eunuchs have come, asking to see Your Lordships, he announced. Invite them in, said Jia She. Servants led in the eunuchs, who were met by ha She and Jia Zheng at the inner gate. Their Lordships first inquired after the health of Her Highness, then ushered the eunuchs into the hail and invited them to sit down. The other day the Imperial Consort from your house became indisposed, the eunuchs informed them. Yesterday we received the order to summon four of her female relatives to the Palace to see her. Each may bring one maid, no more. As for male relatives, they may send in their cards at the gate to pay their respects and await further orders there but they must not enter the Palace. You are to go between eight and ten tomorrow morning and leave between four and six in the afternoon. Jia Zheng and Jia She had risen respectfully to hear these injunctions. When they had resumed their seats tea was offered to the eunuchs, who then took their leave. Their Lordships escorted them out of the main gate, returning to report this to the Lady Dowager. Four female relatives, she said. Naturally theres myself and your wives, but whos to be the fourth? No one venturing to answer her, she thought it over. It will have to be Xifeng, she concluded. She always knows how to cope. You menfolk go and discuss which of you will go. Their Lordships assented and withdrew. They decided that apart from Jia Lian and Jia Rong, who would be left in charge at home, all the other men of the family should go. They ordered four green sedan-chairs and some dozen carriages to be made ready by dawn, and servants went to carry out these instructions. Then Jia She and Jia Zheng went in again to report You are to enter the Palace between eight and ten in the morning and leave between four and six in the afternoon so youd better retire early, madam, in order to make an early start tomorrow. I know, she said. You may go. After their withdrawal Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xifeng stayed behind a little longer to talk of Yuanchuns illness and other things, then went back to their own quarters. The next day at dawn, the maids in the different houses lit the lamps, their mistresses washed and dressed, and the masters made ready too. It was about six when Lin Zhixiao and Lai Da came to the inner gate to announce The sedan-chairs and carriages are ready outside the gate. Presently Jia She and Lady Xing came over. When all had breakfasted Xifeng escorted the old lady out first, followed by the other ladies, each supported by one maid, advancing slowly. Li Gui and another steward were ordered to ride ahead, followed by their wives, to the outer gate of the Palace.
So after coming home I got together a few hundred cash and went out three days later with two men Id hired to repair it. That explains it, said Baoyu. Last month when the lotus seedpods in our pool in Grand View Garden ripened, I picked ten and sent Mingyan out to offer them at his grave. When he came back, I also asked if the grave had been damaged by the rain but he said that on the contrary it looked in better condition than before. I guessed, then, that some friends must recently have restored it. My trouble is that Im cooped up at home all the time and am not my own master. Every move I make is known, and theres always someone trying to stop me or dissuade me, so whatever I say, I cant do a thing. Though Ive money, I cant spend it as I want. You dont have to worry about that, Xiangiian assured him. Ill see to anything that you cant do outside. So long as you remember him, thats what counts. It will soon be the first of the tenth month, and Ive put by some money to sacrifice at his grave. You know how hard up I am, with no property of my own, and any money I get slips straight through my fingers. It seemed better to set this sum aside so as not to be caught empty-handed when the time comes. Thats why I was meaning to send Mingyan to look for you but youre so seldom at home, floating about free as duckweed every day, one never knows where to find you. There was no need to look for me. Each of us must simply do what he can. But soon I shall be setting out on a long journey. I dont expect to be back for three or four years. Why should you stay away so long? You dont know whats been on my mind. Xianglian gave a bitter smile. Youll find out all in good time. Now I must take my leave. Its so rarely we have a chance to meet, cant you stay until the party breaks up this evening? That honourable maternal cousin of yours is up to his old tricks again. If I stay, there may be trouble. Id better keep out of his way. I see, said Baoyu after a thoughtful pause. Well, you may be right to keep out of his way, but you mustnt really go off on a long journey without letting me know beforehand. Whatever happens, dont just slip away. He was shedding tears as he spoke. Of course Ill say goodbye to you, promised Xianglian. Only dont tell anyone else. As he stood up to leave he added, Go on in, theres no need to see me out. He left the study and had just reached the main gate when he saw Xue Pan there bawling, Who let that lad Liu get away? Liu Xiangiians eyes flashed with anger. He longed to strike Xue Pan dead with one blow of his fist. Only the thought that a drunken brawl would embarrass Lai Shangrong made him control himself. Xue Pan catching sight of him was as overjoyed as if he had found some treasure. Where are you going, brother? he chortled, staggering forward to catch him by the arm. Ill be back soon, said Xianglian. If you go, dear fellow, it wont be any fun. Do stay a bit longer to show you care for me. Any pressing business you have, just leave it to me your elder brother only dont hurry off. Do you want an official post? Want to make money? Your elder brother can easily fix it for you. Angered and humiliated by this outrageous talk, Xianglian hit on a plan. He pulled Xue Pan aside. Do you mean that, about wanting to be my friend? Xue Pan could hardly contain himself for excitement. How can you ask such a question, dear brother? he leered. If Im not in earnest may I drop dead! Very well, but we cant talk here. After staying a little longer Ill leave first, and you can follow me presently to my place. We may as well make a night of it. Ive two marvellous boys there, absolutely virgin so theres no need for you to bring a single servant. Ive people to wait on you. Xue Pan was so overjoyed that he half sobered up. Do you really mean it? Now, come, come! Xianglian chuckled. Why turn sceptical when someones sincere with you? Im no fool. Xue Pan grinned. I trust you. But I dont know where you live. If you go on ahead, how am Ito find you? I live outside the North Gate. Do you mind spending a night outside, away from your family? If Ive got you, I shant miss my family.
She thought it was another slip of the tongue, but he sobbed Qingwen is dead! What a thing to say! How could you know? Dont let other people hear you talk such nonsense. Baoyu insisted that he was right and could hardly wait till dawn to send to find out. Just at daybreak, however, a young maid sent by Lady Wang came to the Garden and called out asking to have the front side gate opened, as the mistress had instructions to be passed on. Baoyu must wash and dress quickly! she cried. The master has been invited out to enjoy the autumn scenery and the osmanthus in bloom. He is pleased with Baoyu because he wrote a good poem the other day, so he means to take him along. Thats what Her Ladyship said, so dont get a word wrong. Hrry up and tell him to come as fast as he can. The masters waiting in the principal apartments for the boys to come and have breakfast. Master Huan has already arrived, and someones been sent to fetch Master Lan as hes to go as well. As she delivered this message, the serving-woman inside assented sentence by sentence while buttoning her clothes, then opened the gate. Several other maids, hastily dressing themselves, had run to pass on these instructions. When Xiren heard knocking at the gate, she got up at once and sent to ask what was so pressing. This summons relayed to her, she quickly called for hot water and urged Baoyu to get up and wash while she fetched his clothes. Since he was going out with his father, instead of choosing his most splendid new clothes she selected a less conspicuous outfit. Baoyu had.no choice but to go as fast as he could. He found his father drinking tea, obviously in a good humour. Having paid his morning respects he was greeted by Jia Huan and Jia Lan in turn, and then Jia Zheng ordered him to sit down to breakfast. Baoyu doesnt study as hard as you, he told the other boys. But when it comes to writing inscriptions or capping verses you havent got his flair. Today our hosts are bound to make you write poems, and Baoyu must help you both out. Lady Wang, who had never heard such praise from him, was both surprised and pleased. After father and sons had left, she was thinking of going over to see the old lady when the foster-mothers of Fangguan, Ouguan and Ruiguan were announced. Ever since Your Ladyship kindly allowed Fangguan to come home shes behaved like a crazy creature, one of them reported. Shell neither eat nor drink. And now the three of them shes got Ouguan and Ruiguan to do the same insist on cutting their hair and becoming nuns. They threaten to kill themselves if we wont let them. At first I thought the child was just unused to the way we live outside, and would get over this whim in a couple of days. But theyre carrying on worse and worse. Weve scolded and beaten them, but its no use. Were really at our wits end thats why weve come to beg Your Ladyships help. Well either have to allow them to become nuns or give them a good talking to and let other families take them. We havent the fortune to keep them! Nonsense! exclaimed Lady Wang. How can you let them have their own way? How can anyone enter a nunnery for fun? Give them a thrashing and theyll show more sense. Now as this was just after the mid-autumn sacrifices, nuns from various nunneries had come to present sacrificial offerings, and Lady Wang had kept Abbess Zhitong of Water Moon Convent and Abbess Yuanxin of Ksitigarbha Nunnery to stay for a couple of days. When they heard this news, they thought it a chance to get two girls for nothing to work for them. After all, they told Lady Wang, its because your house is a virtuous one and you yourself do so many good deeds that these young girls have been influenced in this way. Though the house of Buddha isnt easy to enter, we should remember that the law of Buddha extends to all alike. Our Buddhas wish is to save all living creatures, yes, even chickens and dogs but, alas, those who are deluded are hard to awaken. Anyone who has the root of goodness in her and can attain enlightenment can transcend transmigration. Why, even a number of tigers, wolves, snakes and insects have now entered Nirvana. These three orphan girls far from their native places lived here amid wealth and splendour but now they remember their early poverty which forced them to take to a despised profession, and they have no idea what will become of them in future. So turning away from this sea of sufferings they have decided to renounce the world and cultivate virtue, in the hope of doing better in their next life.
And as if paying up werent bad enough, Ive got to go to so much trouble too. How are you going to thank me? Dont talk rubbish, chuckled Xifeng. I didnt ask you to help, why should I thank you? If you think it too much trouble, go and ask the old lady to give someone else the job. See how this has gone to your head! Madam You laughed. Take my advice and be a bit more modest. If youre so full of yourself youll spill over! After some further conversation she left. The next morning Madam You was still making her toilet when some silver was delivered to the Ning Mansion. Who brought this? she asked. Her maids told her the wife of the steward Lin Zhixiao. She sent to have her fetched from the maids room. Madam You offered her a stool and still combing her hair inquired How much is there in this packet? Its the money from the staff which weve brought over first, was the answer. The old ladys and the mistresses isnt here yet. At this point the maids announced, People have come with chips from Madam Xue and the mistress in the other mansion. You wretches, scolded Madam You, smiling. You only remember words of no consequence. Yesterday, for fun, the old lady decided to copy the way poor families chip in to raise money but you keep solemnly repeating the word. Bring the silver in at once. And see that the messengers have some tea before they go. With a cheerful assent the maids brought in two packets of silver, including the shares of Baochai and Daiyu. Whose is still missing? asked Madam You. The old ladys, Lady Xings and the shares of the young ladies and their maids, replied Mrs. Lin. How about Madam Zhu? Youll get hers from Madam Lian when you go over there, madam. Its all there. Madam You, having finished her toilet, ordered her carriage and drove to the Rong Mansion. She called first on Xifeng, who had already wrapped the silver up ready to be delivered. Is it all here? asked Madam You. Yes. Xifeng smiled. Hurry up and take it away. I wont be responsible if anythings lost. I dont quite believe you. Madam You laughed. I must count it here in your presence. She did so, and found that Li Wans share was missing. I knew you were up to one of your tricks, she scolded. Wheres your elder sister-in-laws contribution? Havent you got enough with all the rest? What does it matter if youre one share short? Ill make it up later if your funds run out. Yesterday in front of everyone you played the Lady Bountiful now you want to get out of it, but I wont let you. Ill have to apply to the old lady now for the money. What a terror you are, protested Xifeng, smiling. Dont complain next time youre in trouble if I put on the screws. So you can be frightened too! I wouldnt let you off if you werent usually so dutiful to me. She took out Pingers share then, saying, Here, Pinger, take this back. Ill make it up for you if we havent enough. Pinger understood and replied, Do keep it, madam. If theres any left over, you can give it back to me later just the same. So your mistress is allowed to cheat, but Im not allowed to bribe you, teased Madam You. Then Pinger had to take the money back. Your mistress is so thrifty, continued Madam You, I wonder what she does with all her money. If she cant spend it all, shell have to take it and spend it when shes in her coffin. With this she set off to pay her respects to the Lady Dowager, and after a little conversation with her adjourned to Yuanyangs room to ask her advice about the party and how best to please the old lady. When their plans were made and she was ready to leave, Madam You returned Yuanyangs two taels with the explanation I shant be needing these. She went on then to Lady Wangs apartments to chat, and when Lady Wang withdrew to her Buddhist shrine she gave Caiyun her share back too. Next she took advantage of Xifengs absence to reimburse the two concubines Zhou and Zhao as well. When they dared not take the silver she insisted Youre not well off enough to afford this. If Xifeng hears about it, Ill take the blame. Then the two women accepted with effusive thanks. In no time it was the second of the ninth month. All the inmates of the Garden knew that Madam You had arranged for a grand party with not only operas but acrobatics and blind story-tellers too, both men and women.
She herself brought out a brush, inkstone, paper and ink and asked the girls to recite their composition, which she wrote down from start to finish. Finding her in such a good mood Daiyu said, Ive never seen you before in such high spirits. If not for that I wouldnt presume to ask for your opinion. Is this poem worth polishing? If you think not, well burn it but if it is, will you please make some corrections? I wont venture to make rash comments, but as youve already used twenty-two rhymes I expect you ye produced your most striking images and if you go on you may tire yourselves out. Id like to round it off, only Im afraid I may spoil it. Daiyu had never read any poems by Miaoyu, and as the young nun was so eager she urged her, Please do! That may make out feeble attempts seem passable. We must wind up the poem by reverting to the present situation. If we pass over true feelings and incidents and simply search for striking images and expressions, well be losing our identity and departing from the main theme. Quite right, they concurred. Miaoyu picked up her brush and wrote her addition straight off, then showed it to the other two, saying Dont laugh at me! I feel this is the only way to get back to the theme. Then a few sad lines earlier on wont matter. They took what she had written and read -786 The incense in gold tripods has burnt out, And ice-white oil in the jade basin forms Fluting recalls a widows lamentations As a small serving-maid the silk quilt warms. On empty curtains a bright phoenix hangs. The idle screens gay ducks and drakes enfold Thick dew has made the moss more slippery, And heavy frost makes bamboo hard to hold. Strolling again beside the winding lake, Climbing once more the solitary hill, The rugged boulders seem contending ghosts. The gnarled trees wolves and tigers crouching still. Dawn lights the tortoise pedestal of stone, On outer trellis now the thick dew falls. A thousand woodland birds begin to stir, In vales below a single gibbon calls. How can we stray on a familiar road? Why ask the way to fountain-heads we know? The bells chime in Green Lattice Nunnery, The cocks in Paddy-Sweet Cottage start to crow. With cause for joy why grieve excessively, Or needlessly display anxiety? A maidens feelings none but she can vent To whom can she confide her nicety? Speak not of weariness though night is done, Over fresh tea let us talk on and on. She then appended the title A Poem Written Collectively with Thirty-five Rhymes While Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival in Grand View Garden. Daiyu and Xiangyun heaped praise on this ending. Weve been ignoring a talent right under our eyes, yet trying to seek what is far away! they exclaimed. We have such a superior poetess here, yet every day we pretend to be able to write. We can polish it tomorrow, suggested Miaoyu. Itll soon be light, and after all we must get some rest. Then the other two took their leave and went off with their maids. Miaoyu saw them out of the gate and watched until they were out of sight before closing the gate and returning to her room. Meanwhile Cuilu had told Xiangyun, Theyre sitting up waiting for us in Madam Zhus place. Lets go back now. You can call in there on the way and tell them to go to bed, replied Xiangyun. If I go, Ill only disturb them. Id better raise a rumpus in Miss Lins place instead. In Bamboo Lodge half the maids were already asleep. Having undressed and washed, Daiyu and Xiangyun went to bed Zijuan put down the gauze bed-curtain and took away the lamp, closing the door behind her. However, Xiangyun could not sleep in a strange bed. As for Daiyu, being anaemic she often suffered from insomnia too, and having stayed up past her usual hour she now felt wide-awake. So the two of them tossed and turned. Daiyu asked, Why arent you asleep yet? I cant sleep well in a strange bed thats my trouble. And Im no longer sleepy, so Im just resting. What about you? Ive had insomnia a long time now, Daiyu sighed. In a whole year I probably have only ten nights of good sleep. No wonder youre unwell then! If you want to know what followed, read the next chapter. Chapter 77 A Pretty Maid Wrongly Accused Dies an Untimely Death Lovely Actresses Sever Worldly Ties and Join a Nunnery After the Moon Festival, as Xifeng though well enough to leave her bed was not yet fully recovered, Lady Wang continued to summon the doctor to attend her every day as before.
Someone sent four pots of orchids to Her Ladyship. she announced. Theyre too busy to enjoy them, so Her Ladyship told us to take one pot to Master Bao, one to Miss Lin. Daiyu saw that a few sprays had double blooms. The sight stirred her, but whether with joy or with grief she did not know as she stared at them blankly. Baoyus mind, however, was still set on the lute. Now that you have these orchids, cousin, he said, you can play that tune The Orchid. 2 This remark upset Daiyu. Going back to her room she gazed at the orchids, reflecting, In spring, plants put out fresh blooms and luxuriant leaves. Im still young, yet already Im like a plant in late autumn. If my wish comes true, I may gradually grow stronger. If not, I fear Ill be like a fading flower how can I stand buffeting by rain and wind? She could not hold back her tears. Zijuan seeing this could not understand the reason. She thought, Just now with Baoyu here she was so happy. Why has looking at orchids made her sad again? She was anxiously wondering how to comfort her mistress when a maid arrived with a message from Baochai. To know what it was, read on. Chapter 87 Moved by an Autumn Poem, a Lutist Mourns the Past One Practicing Yoga Is Possessed Through Lust Baochais maid, called in by Daiyu, presented her young ladys greetings and letter, then was sent off to have some tea. Opening the letter, Daiyu found written there Born on an unlucky day in an ill-fated family, I have no sister and my mother is failing. Day and night there is bickering and brawling here, on top of which fearful disasters have assailed us thick and fast. At dead of night I toss and turn, overwhelmed by anxiety. Surely you who understand me must sympathize with me? I recall the Begonia Club we formed in autumn and how we enjoyed chrysanthemums and crabs in happy harmony. When I remember those lines Proud recluse, with what hermit are you taking refuge? All flowers must bloom, what makes you bloom so late? I cannot but feel that the chrysanthemums old fragrance is like the two of us! Moved by these thoughts I have scribbled out four stanzas. Though simply an empty lament, they voice my distress. 1 -2290 Sad to see the passing of seasons, Cool autumn is here once more My family is ill-fated, Alone I dwell, my heart sore. Day-lilies in the northern hall Cannot make me forget my cares. With no means to banish grief, My heart despairs. 2 -2290 Low hang the clouds, The autumn wind makes moan I pace the court Through withered leaves turned roan. Where can I go? Lost, my past happiness. Remembered joys But fill me with distress. -3431 3 -2290 The sturgeon has its tarn, The crane its nest, One lurking within scales, One with long plumage dressed! At my wits end I ask infinity High heaven, vast earth, Who knows my misery? -3431 4 -2290 The Milky Way is twinkling, The atmosphere strikes chill The moon is sloping down the sky, The jade clepsydras still. There is no sleep for aching hearts. My grief I must impart Chanting again and yet again For one who knows my heart. Daiyu after reading these lines was plunged in grief. She reflected, The fact that Cousin Baochai didnt send these to anyone else, only to me, shows that we are kindred spirits. She was lost in thought when someone outside called out, Is Cousin Lin at home? Putting Baochais letter away she asked who was there, even as Tanchun, Xiangyun, Li Wen and Li Qi trooped in. They exchanged greetings while Xueyan brought them tea, after which they chatted. Remembering the poems they had written that year on chrysanthemums, Daiyu remarked Baochai came over twice after moving out, yet these days even when something happens she doesnt come. Isnt that odd? I wonder whether shell ever come back or not! Why shouldnt she? asked Tanchun with a smile. Shes bound to eventually.... Just now, of course, she has too much to see to, what with her sister-in-laws cranky ways, aunty getting on in years, and on top of everything this trouble of Cousin Pans. She hasnt the time to spare that she used to have. Just then a gust of wind sprang up, dashing fallen leaves against the window paper.
You ought to investigate before flying into a temper like this. You can shut me out today, but shall we not see each other still tomorrow?" The more she thought, the more distressed she felt. Oblivious of the cold dew on the green moss and the chill wind on the path, standing under the blossom by tile corner of the wall she gave way to sobs. And the sound of this beauty's weeping -- for Daiyu was the loveliest creature ever seen -- made the birds fly away from their roosts on the willows and flowering trees, unable to bear her distress. Truly -694 The hearts of the flowers were broken, The birds were woken from their senseless dreams. The reason is told in these lines -694 Peerless the beauty and talent of this girl Wrapped in scent from embroidered curtains come alone Before her first sob dies away Flowers strew the ground, the affrighted birds have flown. As Daiyu was sobbing to herself the gate creaked open. If you want to know who came out, read the next chapter. Chapter 27 Baochai Chases a Butterfly to Dripping Emerald Pavillon Daiyu Weeps over Fallen Blossom by the Tomb of Flowers As Daiyu was weeping, the gate creaked open and out came Baochai escorted by Baoyu, Xiren and other maids. Daiyu was tempted to accost Baoyu, but not wanting to embarrass him in public she stepped aside until Baochai had left and the others had gone in, when she came back and shed more tears before the closed gate. Then she went back in low spirits to her room and prepared listlessly for bed. Zijuan and Xueyan knew their young mistress' ways. She would often sit moodily frowning or sighing over nothing or, for no apparent reason, would give way to tong spells of weeping. At first they had tried to comfort her, imagining that she missed her parents and home or that someone had been unkind but as time went by and they found this was her habit they paid little further attention. So tonight they withdrew to bed, leaving her to brood by herself. Daiyu leaned against her bed-rail, clasping her knees. Her eyes were brimming with tears. There she stayed motionless as a statue, not lying down until after the second watch. The next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month, the Festival of Grain in Ear. It was the time-honoured custom on this day to offer all manner of gifts and a farewell feast to the God of Flowers, for this festival was said to mark the beginning of summer when all the blossom had withered and the God of flowers had to resign his throne and be seen off. As this custom is most faithfully observed by women, all the inmates of Grand View Garden rose early that day. The girls used flowers and osiers to weave small sedan-chairs and horses, or made pennants and flags of silk and gauze which they tied with gay ribbons to every tree and flower, turning the whole Garden into a blaze of colour. They decked themselves out so prettily, too, as to put the very flowers and birds to shame. But time forbids us to dwell on that splendid scene. Now Baochai, the three Jia girls, Li Wan and Xifeng were enjoying themselves in the Garden with Xifeng's little daughter as well as Xiangling and the other maids. Only one person was missing, and that was Daiyu. "Why isn't Cousin Lin here?" asked Yingchun. "Surely the lazy creature isn't still sleeping?" "I'll go and rouse her," volunteered Baochai. "The rest of you wait here and I'll soon bring her." She set off instantly for Bamboo Lodge. On the way she met the twelve young actresses headed by Wenguan, who greeted her and chatted for a while. Then Baochai told them how to find the others and, having explained her own errand, followed the winding path towards Daiyu's quarters. As she approached Bamboo Lodge she saw Baoyu enter the courtyard. That made her pause and lower her head in thought. "Baoyu and Daiyu grew up under one roof," she reflected. "They're so free and easy together, they don't care how they tease each other or show their feelings. And Daiyu's rather jealous and petty-minded. If I follow Baoyu in, he may not like it and she may resent it. I'd better go back." She had started back to rejoin the other girls when a pair of jade-coloured butterflies the size of a circular fan appeared before her. They fluttered up and down most bewitchingly in the breeze. What fun it would be to catch them! Baochai drew her fan from her sleeve and ran after them over the grass.
asked Xiangyun. Last night her illness flared up again, and she coughed all night, Cuilu answered. We heard from Xueyan that she spat out a whole lot of blood. Is that true? exclaimed Tanchun in consternation. Of course its true, Cuilu insisted. Just now when we went in to see her, Cuimo added, she looked in a very bad way, hardly able to talk. If shes in a bad way, of course she cant talk, said Xiangyun. How can you be so dense? cried Tanchun. If she cant speak, that means... Her voice trailed away. Xichun said, Cousin Lin is very intelligent but I think she takes things too much to heart shes so serious about even the least little thing. How can one take everything so seriously? Well, if thats the case, said Tanchun, we should all go and see her. If shes so very ill, we must get our sister-in-law to report in to the old lady and send for a doctor, so that well know how to cope. Thats right, agreed Xiangyun. -370 The two of you go on ahead, said Xichun. Ill go over later on. Then Tanchun and Xiangyun, helped along by some young maids, went to Bamboo Lodge. Their arrival upset Daiyu, reminding her of her dream. What can I expect of them, when even my grandmother cold-shouldered me like that? she wondered. Besides, they wouldnt have come unless Id invited them. But instead of showing what was in her mind, she made Zijuan help her to sit up and offered them seats. Tanchun and Xiangyun sat down, one on either side of her on the edge of the bed, distressed to see her so ill. What brought on this relapse, cousin? Tanchun asked. Its nothing serious. I just feel very limp. Zijuan standing behind her pointed surreptitiously at the spittoon. And Xiangyun, being young and straightforward, picked it up to have a look. What she saw horrified her. Did you bring this up, cousin? she exclaimed. Heaven help us! Daiyu had been too dazed before to look carefully at her sputum. At Xiangyuns ejaculation she turned to look, her heart already sinking. To cover up Xiangyuns tactlessness, Tanchun hastily put in, This is nothing out of the usual its just that a hot humour in the lungs made her bring up a drop or two. But Xiangyun is so silly, the least little thing always makes her fly off the handle. Xiangyun, regretting her blunder, blushed at this. Seeing how listless and tired Daiyu seemed, Tanchun got up and said, You must rest well, cousin. Well call again later on. Thank you both for your concern. Tanchun urged Zijuan, Look after your young lady well ! As Zijuan assented Tanchun turned to leave but just then somebody outside started shouting. To know who it was, read on. Chapter 83 The Imperial Consort Falls 111 and Her Relatives Call at the Palace Jingui Makes a Scene and Baochai Has to Swallow Her Anger Tanchun and Xiangyun, on the point of leaving, heard an old woman shouting outside, You good-for-nothing little bitch! Who are you to come and fool around in our Garden? At this Daiyu pointed outside. Showing the whites of her eyes she exclaimed, I shall have to leave here! For ever since moving into Grand View Garden, though able to rely on her grandmothers partiality Daiyu had always watched her step with other people. When she heard this abuse shouted outside her window, she was sure it must be aimed at nobody else but her. Reflecting that she was a finely brought up young lady but now had lost her parents, she wondered who had sent this old creature to insult her. This was too much to bear! With a heart-rending cry she fainted away. Whats come over you, miss? wailed Zijuan. Wake up, quick! Tanchun called her too, and after a while Daiyu regained consciousness. Still she could not speak, just kept pointing out of the window. Tanchun caught her meaning and opening the door went out. She saw an old woman with a stick chasing after a grubby little girl. Im here to look after the flowers and fruit trees, the old crone was shouting. Why should you come too? Wait till we get home and Ill give you a good thrashing. The child looked round, sucking one finger, and laughed at her. Tanchun scolded, You people are getting too out of hand!
Jiao Da stamped his foot and wailed, "I warned those degenerate masters of ours all along, but they treated me as their sworn enemy' Even you don't know, sir, what hardships I endured serving the old duke. Now things have come to a pretty pass with Sir Zhen and Rong arrested by some princes' officers! The ladies' trinkets were looted by the officers and runners and they were shut up in an empty room! And those .t t t .t t t useless slaves cooped up like pigs and dogs! Everything has been confiscated, furniture broken in pieces, porcelain smashed they even want to put me in chains too! I've lived eighty to ninety years and trussed people up for the old duke how can I let myself be trussed up instead? I told them I belonged to the West Mansion and broke out, but those fellows wouldn't let me go. They hauled me here, where I find things are just as bad. I'm sick of life I'll have it out with them!" With that he butted the runners. As he was so old and their orders were not to make trouble, the runners simply said, "Pipe down, old man. This is done by Imperial decree. You'd better take it easy and wait for news. Although Jia Zheng tried to ignore this, he felt as if a knife had been plunged in his heart. "We're done for, done for!" he sighed. "To think that we should be reduced to this!" As he was waiting impatiently for news from court, Xue Ke came running in. "What a time I had getting in here!" he panted. "Where is uncle?" "Thank Heaven you've come!" Jia Zheng exclaimed. "How did you gain admittance?" "By pleading hard and promising them money. Jia Zheng described the raid to him and asked him to make inquiries. "I can't very well send messages to other relatives and friends now that we're under fire," he explained. "But you can deliver messages for me." "It never occurred to me that you'd have trouble here, sir but I've heard something about the East Mansion's business." "What exactly are the charges against them?" "Today I went to the yamen to find out what Cousin Pan's sentence is, and I heard that two censors have accused Cousin Zhen of corrupting young nobles by getting them to gamble that isn't so serious. The more serious charge is of abducting the wife of an honest citizen, who Was forced to kill herself rather than submit. To bring this charge home, the censors got our man Bao Er and a fellow called Zhang as witnesses. Thi 5 may involve the Court of Censors too, as that fellow Zhang had brought a suit before." Jia zheng stamped his foot. "Terrible! We're done for!" he sighed, tears 5 eaming down his cheeks. Xue Ke tried to reassure him then went off to find out more news, returning a few hours later. "It looks bad," he informed him. "When I asked at the Board of Punishments, I didn't hear the result of the two princes' report but was told that this morning Censor Li brought another charge against the prefect of Pingan, accusing him of pandering to an official in the capital and oppressing the people to please his superior there were several serious charges." "Never mind about other people," said Jia Zheng impatiently. "What did you hear about us?" "That charge against the prefect of Ping an involves us too, sir. The official in the capital referred to by the censor was Lord She, who's accused of tampering with lawsuits. This adds fuel to the flames! All your colleagues are trying hard to keep out of this, so who would send you word? Even those relatives and friends at your feast either went home or are keeping well away until they know the upshot. Some clansmen of yours confound them! - have been saying openly, "Their ancestors left them property and titles. Now that they're in trouble who knows whom the title may go to. We all ought to take steps.... Without hearing him out Jia Zheng stamped his foot again. "What a fool my brother is!" he groaned. "It's a scandal, too, the way they've carried on in the East Mansion! For all we know this may be the death of the old lady and Lian's wife! Go and see what more you can find out while I look in on the old lady. If there's any news, the sooner we know it the better." Just then a great commotion broke out inside and they heard cries of "The old lady's dying!" Jia Zheng hurried anxiously in. To know whether she lived or died, you must read the next chapter.
At this point Qianxue brought in tea and Baoyu said, Do have some tea, Cousin Lin. The maids burst out giggling. Shes gone long ago. Yet you offer her tea. After drinking half a cup himself he remembered something else and asked Qianxue, Why did you bring me this tea? This morning we brewed some maple-dew tea, and I told you its flavour doesnt really come out until after three or four steepings. I did save that other tea, she replied. But Nanny Li insisted on trying it and she drank it all. This was too much for Baoyu. He dashed the cup to pieces on the floor, spattering the maids skirt with tea. Then springing to his feet he stormed Is she your grandmother, that all of you treat her so respectfully? Just because she suckled me for a few days when I was small, she carries on as if she were more important than our own ancestors. I dont need a wet-nurse any more, why should I keep an ancestress like this? Send her packing and well all have some peace and quiet. He wanted to go straight to his grandmother to have the old woman dismissed. Now Xiren had only been shamming sleep, in the hope that Baoyu would come in to tease her. She hadnt troubled to get up when he asked about the dumplings but now that he had smashed a cup and flown into a passion she jumped up and came out to smooth things over, just as a maid arrived from his grandmother to ask the reason for the noise. Id just poured out some tea, said Xiren. I slipped because of snow on my shoes and the cup was smashed. Then she turned to calm Baoyu. So youve decided to dismiss her. Good. Wed all like to leave. Why not take this chance to get rid of the lot of us? That would suit us, and youd get better attendants too. Thus silenced, Baoyu let them help him to the kang and take off his clothes. He was still mumbling to himself but could hardly keep his eyes open, so they put him straight to bed. Xiren took the precious jade off his neck, wrapped it up in her own handkerchief and tucked it under his mattress, so that it should not be cold to the touch when he put it on the next day. Baoyu fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Meantime Nanny Li had come in. Hearing that he was drunk she dared not risk further trouble, and having quietly made sure that he was asleep she left easier in her mind. Upon waking the next morning, Baoyu was told that Jia Rong from the other mansion had brought Qin Zhong over to pay his respects. He hastened to greet his new friend and presented him to the Lady Dowager, who was delighted by his handsome looks and pleasing manner. Convinced that he would make an excellent schoolmate for Baoyu, she kept him to tea and a meal, then ordered servants to take him to meet Lady Wang and the rest of the family. Qin Keqing was a general favourite, and they liked her brother for himself as well. All gave him presents on parting. The Lady Dowagers gift was a purse containing a small golden effigy of the God of Learning symbolizing literary talent and harmony. You live so far away, she said, in hot or cold weather you may find the journey too much. You are welcome to stay here and must make yourself at home. Stay with your Uncle Baoyu, and dont get into mischief with those lazy young rascals. Qin Zhong agreed readily, then went home to report what had happened. His father Qin Ye, a secretary in the Board of Works, was nearly seventy and had lost his wife early. Having no children of his own he had adopted a son and daughter from an orphanage, but the boy had died leaving only the little girl, Keqing. She grew up to be a graceful, charming young woman. Because Qin was remotely connected with the Jia family, they arranged a match and she became Jia Rongs wife. Qin Zhong was born when his father was over fifty. His tutor had died the previous year and Qin Ye had not yet found another thus the boy had been revising his lessons at home. His father was thinking of approaching the Jias about sending his son to their school in order not to waste the boys time, when as luck would have it Qin Zhong met Baoyu. The old man was also overjoyed to learn that the school was now run by Jia Dairu, a venerable Confucian scholar under whose instruction Qin Zhong was bound to make progress and might even win a name for himself. Qin Ye was a poor official, but the whole Jia household, high and low alike, thought so much of riches and rank that in the interest of his sons career he had to pinch and scrape to get together twenty-four taels of silver as a handsome entrance gift.
She rose to meet him and said with a smile, Sit down. Im copying a sutra, and have only two lines left. Let me finish it and then we can talk. She told Xueyan to bring tea. Dont trouble, said Baoyu. Just go on with your copying. He noticed in the middle of the wall a scroll painting of the Moon Goddess Change and another goddess, each with an attendant, the second one carrying what looked like a long clothing bag. There were only a few clouds surrounding them, with no other decorations. It was done in the style of Li Longmians 2 outline drawings. The inscription Contending in the Cold was written in the old official script. Have you just put this painting up, cousin? he asked. Thats right, said Daiyu. Yesterday when they were tidying up, I thought of it and took it out for them to hang. Whats its story? Surely everybody knows it, she said with a smile, Why ask? I cant for the moment remember. Do tell me, cousin. You must know the lines -763 The Green Nymph and Change, both able to stand cold, Are vying in beauty in the frosty moon. 3 Of course! he exclaimed. How original and cultured! And this is the right season, too, to hang this up. He strolled around looking at this and that till Xueyan brought him some tea. And soon Daiyu, her copying finished, stood up. Excuse me for neglecting you, she said. Always so polite, cousin! he chuckled. He noticed now that Daiyu was wearing a pale- blue embroidered fur-lined jacket under a short white squirrel tunic, and a pink embroidered silk padded skirt of the kind worn by Lady Yang. With no flowers in her cloudy tresses, which were loosely knotted and clasped with a flat gold pin, she was truly like -763 A jade tree standing gracefully in the breeze. Or sweet dewy lotus in bloom. Have you been playing the lute these days, cousin? he asked. Not for the last two days, because I found copying made my fingers too cold. Its just as well not to play. Though the lute is a refined instrument, I dont think much of it. No one ever won wealth, nobility or long life from playing it, only grief and longing. Besides, to play, you have to memorize the score which is rather an effort. As youre so delicate, cousin, it seems to me you shouldnt waste energy on it. Daiyu simply smiled and said nothing. Then, pointing at a lute on the wall, he asked, Is this yours? Why is it so short? Because when I first learned to play, being small I couldnt reach the strings of regular lutes, so this was specially made for me. Though its not anything exceptional, its parts are well fitted and its well proportioned. See the grain of the wood. Isnt it as fine as yak hair? So it has quite a clear timbre. Have you written any poems these days? Hardly any since the last poetry club. Baoyu smiled and said, Dont try to hide it from me! I heard you chanting something like Why repine? Would that my heart were pure as the moon in the sky. You accompanied it on the lute, and the sound seemed exceptionally clear. Can you deny that? How did you happen to hear? I heard it the other day on my way back from Smartweed Breeze Cot, and not wanting to disturb you I just listened quietly then went away. Ive been meaning to ask you Why did you start with level rhymes, then at the end change suddenly to an oblique one? 4 What was the reason for that? Music comes naturally from the heart, she answered. There are no set rules you just play as you feel. So thats the reason. Its too bad I dont understand music and so it was wasted on me. How many understanding people have there been since of old? she replied. At that, Baoyu realized that he had been tactless, and feared he had hurt her feelings. He sat there with so much he longed to say, yet not knowing how to word it. Daiyu also felt that her last remark had been thoughtless, and must have sounded cold so she too was silent. This convinced Baoyu that she took this personally, and he rose sheepishly to say Ill leave you to rest now, cousin. Im off to see Tanchun. When you see her, give her my regards. He agreed to this and went out. After seeing him off, Daiyu came back and sat down dejectedly. Nowadays Baoyu talks in such an ambiguous way, blowing hot and cold by turns, I cant tell what he means, she thought.
Xiren went to her room to change into new clothes, then picked up the mirror to tidy her hair and dust her face with powder. Coming out, she gave Qingwen and Sheyue some further instructions before leaving Happy Red Court. At Seeping Fragrance Bridge, she paused to look round and enjoy the early autumn scene. Cicadas were shrilling in the trees, insects chirping in the undergrowth the pomegranate flowers were fading, the lotus leaves withering, but the hibiscus on the river bank had put out clusters of red buds which looked enchanting against the vivid green leaves. Crossing the bridge then she soon saw Li Wans maid Suyun approaching, followed by an old serving-woman with a lacquer hamper. Xiren asked where they were taking the hamper and what was in it. These are caltrops and lotus seeds our mistress is sending Miss Tanchun, Suyun told her. Were they picked in the stream in our Garden or bought outside? Mother Liu who works in our house asked leave to go and visit some relatives, then brought these back as a present for our mistress, and Miss Tanchun saw them as she happened to be in our place. Our mistress had some peeled for her to taste, but she refused as shed just been drinking hot tea and said shed try some later. So now were taking these to her house. Then they went their different ways. In the distance Xiren now saw someone flicking a whisk under a trellis of grapes, but as the sun was in her eyes she could not make out who it was. Drawing nearer she discovered it was old Mrs. Zhu, who came forward, beaming, to greet her. How is it you have time to come out for a stroll today, miss? she asked. Where are you going? Ive no time to stroll about, Im on my way to call on Madam ian. What are you doing here? Im chasing away the wasps. This has been such a dry summer, all the trees are infested by insects whove been boring into the fruit so that lots of it has dropped what a wretched waste! Look at the grapes, just forming such pretty clusters, but the wasps and bees keeping swarming round to bite them. Worse still, magpies and sparrows come to steal grapes too. The trouble is that once a sparrow or insect has made a hole in three of four grapes in one cluster, the juice dripping on to the good ones rots them too. These sparrows and wasps are such a pest, Im here to shoo them away. Just look, miss, because I stopped for one minute to talk, another swarm of wasps has come. Even if you keep waving that whisk youll never keep them all away. As soon as you drive one lot away from here, another will come over there. Better tell the purveyors to have a whole lot of small gauze bags made. If you put one bag over each cluster of grapes, the birds and insects wont be able to spoil them and as gauze lets through the air, that wont hurt the grapes. Thats a good idea, agreed the old woman. This is my first year at this job, so I dont know these clever dodges. We have many different kinds of fruit in the Garden, remarked Xiren. Which kind ripens first? This is the start of the seventh month. The grapes are only just turning red. They wont be really ripe and good to eat until the end of the month. If you dont believe me, miss Ill pick one for you to taste. Even if they were ripe, the first fruits have to be sacrificed to Buddha and the next sent to the mistresses. How can we taste them first? As an old hand here, surely you know this rule? The old woman smiled sheepishly. Youre right, miss. I only said that because of the question you asked. But while saying this she was thinking, Drat it all! Its lucky I was chasing wasps just now. If Id happened to pick a grape to taste and been spotted, what a to-do thered have been! Put in a request to Madam Lian for those bags I told you about, Xiren advised her. Shell get the stewards to have them made. This said she left by the Garden gate and went straight to Xifengs place. Xifeng and Pinger were discussing Jia Lians secret marriage. As Xiren was a rare visitor and they did not know her errand, they broke off their conversation on her arrival. With a forced smile Xifeng asked, What winds blown such a noble visitor to our humble place? Xiren replied with a smile, I knew youd tease me when I came, madam, but never mind.
either But if you're afraid you'll be lowering yourself, I won't presume to lend it. We can just go our different ways. " With that he produced a packet of silver from his pouch. Jia Yun thought, "Ni Er may be a rascal but he's open-handed and has the name of standing up boldly for his friends. It would be a mistake to annoy him by refusing. I'll take his silver and later pay him back double." He said, "I know you're a real sport, old chap. I did think of approaching you, but was afraid you might ignore someone so useless, as all your friends are such bold and capable people. I thought if I asked for a loan you'd be bound to turn me down. But now since you're so generous I can't refuse. I'll send you an I. 0. U. when I get home." Ni Er bellowed with laughter "How you talk! But I won't hear of it," he declared. "You spoke of 'friends.' Well then, how can I charge you interest? If I did, that wouldn't be the act of a friend. Let's cut the cackle. As you don't look down on me and this is only a paltry sum---a mere fifteen taels thirty cents -take it to buy what you need. If you insist on writing an I. O. U. I won't give you the silver but lend it to others whom I expect to pay interest." "All right," said Jia Yun, accepting the sliver. "I'll not write any I.O.U. So don't blaze up!" "What you'd just said wasn't right," Ni Er chuckled. "It's dark now so I won't invite you to have a drink. I have some business to see to. You'd better go back. I'll trouble you to tell my family to lock up early and turn in, as I shan't be home tonight. If they want me for anything urgent, our daughter can come and fetch me tomorrow morning. They'll find me with the horse-dealer, Short-Legged Wang." So saying, he reeled away. Marvelling at this stroke of luck Jia Yun reflected, "Ni Er is certainly a character! But what if he's only generous in his cups? Suppose he asks for a hundred per cent interest tomorrow?" This worried him for a while. Then he decided, "Never mind, once that job comes my way I can pay him back double." He took the silver to a money shop to be weighed and was delighted to find that Ni Er was honest and it was indeed fifteen taels and 34.2 cents. He first went next-door and gave Ni Er's message to his wife before going home. His mother, who was rolling thread on the kang , asked where he had been all day. For fear of vexing her he made no mention of going to see her brother. "I was waiting for Uncle Lian in the west mansion," he said. "Have you had your meal?" "Yes, and I've kept you yours. " She told the maid to fetch it. It was already time to light the lamp, and after supper Jia Yun went straight to bed. As soon as he was up and dressed the next morning, he went to a large perfumery outside the South Gate and bought camphor and musk, which he took to the Rong Mansion. Having first made sure that Jia Lian had indeed left, he went to the gate of his courtyard at the back. Some pages were sweeping the yard with tong-handled brooms. Presently Zhou Rui's wife came out. "Stop sweeping," she told them. "The mistress is coming out." Jia Yun swiftly stepped forward to ask "Where is Second Aunt going?" "The old lady has sent for her," said Mrs. Zhou. "To cut out some clothes, I fancy." That same moment Xifeng emerged with a throng of attendants. Knowing her weakness for flattery and ceremonial, Jia Yun stepped forward respectfully, saluted her with great deference, and inquired after her health. Xifeng hardly glanced at him, however, merely asking as she walked on how his mother was and why she never called. "She is not too well, aunt," he replied. "She often thinks of you and would like to come, but she can't get away. Xifeng laughed. "What a liar you are! You wouldn't have said that if I hadn't asked about her." "May lightning strike me if I dare to tie to my seniors!" protested Jia Yun. "Only last night she was speaking of you, aunt. She said, 'Your aunt's delicate yet look at all she has on her hands. I don't know where she finds the energy to manage everything so well.
By the time they were joined by Lady Wang, Xifengs eyes were red from weeping. Jia Lian, when he had paid his respects, described his trip to Shilitun to help arrange for Wang Zitengs funeral. An Imperial decree has conferred on him the rank of Grand Secretary and the posthumous title of Duke Wenqin, he announced. The family has been ordered to take the coffin back to his native district, and officials along the way are to render assistance. They set off on the journey back south yesterday. My aunt told me to convey her respects and say how sorry she is to have been unable to come to the capital there was so much she wanted to tell you. When she heard that Xifengs brother was on his way to the capital too, she promised if she met him on the road to send him here to give us all her news. Lady Wang was naturally so upset by this account that Xifeng had to comfort her. Please have a rest now, madam, she urged. This evening well come back to discuss Baoyus business. Going home with Jia Lian she told him what had happened, and asked him to send servants to prepare the bridal chambers. One morning after breakfast, Daiyu set off to call on her grandmother to pay her respects and also by way of diversion. They had not gone far from Bamboo Lodge when she found that she had forgotten her handkerchief. She told Zijuan to go back for one then catch her up she would be walking on slowly. She had passed Seeping Fragrance Bridge and reached the rocks behind which she and Baoyu had buried blossom, when she suddenly heard sobbing. She stopped to listen, but could not tell who was lamenting there or hear what she was saying. Very puzzled, she strolled over and found that the one crying there was an under-maid with thick eyebrows and big eyes. Daiyu had expected to see one of the upper-maids come here to vent some grief which she could not confide to others. But when she saw this girl she thought with amusement, A stupid creature like this cant have been crossed in love. Shes one of those doing rough work who must have got scolded by the senior maids. She looked hard at the girl but could not recognize her. When Daiyu appeared, the maid dared not go on crying but stood up and wiped her eyes. Why are you weeping here? Whats come over you? Daiyu asked. That set the maid off again. Judge for yourself, Miss Lin! she sobbed. They knew something, but I wasnt in on it so even if I made a slip of the tongue, sister had no call to slap me. Daiyu could not make head or tail of this. Which sister do you mean? she asked with a smile. Sister Zhenzhu. Knowing from this that she worked for the old lady, Daiyu asked again, Whats your name? They call me Numskull. Why did she slap you? What did you say wrong? Why? Just because of the marriage of our Master Bao to Miss Baochai. Daiyu felt thunderstruck. Her heart beat wildly. Composing herself a little she said. Come with me. Numskull accompanied her to the quiet spot where she had buried the peach-blossom. Then Daiyu asked, Why should she slap you because Master Bao is marrying Miss Baochai? Their Ladyships have settled it with Madam Lian. Because His Lordships going to leave so soon, theyre fixing up hurriedly with Aunt Xue to have Miss Baochai brought over before he goes. This will counter Master Baos bad luck with good. And after that... she beamed at Daiyu after his wedding theyll fix up a match for you, miss. Daiyu listened, half stupefied, as the maid rattled on, I dont know how they settled this, but they wont let anybody talk about it for fear of embarrassing Miss Baochai if she heard. All I did was to remark to sister Xiren the one who works for Master Bao, Things are going to be livelier here with Miss Baochai becoming Second Mistress Bao how ought we to address her? Tell me, Miss Lin, why should that annoy Sister Zhenzhu? Yet she marched over and slapped my face, saying I was talking nonsense and should be thrown out for not obeying orders! How was I to know the mistresses didnt want this talked about? They never tell me anything, yet slap me! She started sobbing again. Daiyu felt as if her heart were filled with a mixture of oil, soy, sugar and vinegar so sweet, bitter, painful and sharp that she could not put her sensations into words. After a pause, in a trembling voice she said, Dont talk such nonsense.
Things are too out of hand. Along came Lai Wangs wife just then with a tally and a receipt for the amount required, to fetch sacrificial paper and paper for supplications and prayers. They made her take a seat and have some tea while someone went for the amount required and carried it for her to the inner gate, where he handed it over to her to take inside. Then Xifeng ordered Caiming to prepare a register and sent for Lai Shengs wife to bring her a list of the staff. She announced that all the men-servants wives were to come to her early the next morning for instructions. After checking quickly through the list and asking Lai Sheng 5 wife a couple of questions, she went home in her carriage. She was back at half past six the next morning to find all the old servingwomen and stewards wives assembled. They did not venture into the antechamber when they saw that she and Lai Shengs wife were busy assigning tasks, but from outside the window they heard her tell the latter Since Ive been put in charge here I daresay I shall make myself unpopular. Im not as easy-going as your own mistress who lets you do as you please so dont tell me how things used to be managed here, but just do as I say. The least disobedience will be dealt with publicly, no matter how much face the offender may have. She made Caiming call the roll and the servants entered one by one for inspection. After this she ordered These twenty, divided into two shifts often, will be solely responsible for serving tea to the guests on their arrival and before their departure. They will have no other duties. These twenty, also in two shifts of ten, will see to the familys meals and tea every day. They will have no other duties either. These forty, divided into two shifts, will have the job of burning incense, keeping the lamps filled with oil, hanging up curtains, watching by the coffin, offering sacrificial rice and tea, and mourning with the mourners. Nothing else. These four will be responsible for the cups, plates and tea things in the pantry, and will have to replace anything that is missing. These four will take charge of the dinner-sets and wine vessels, and likewise make good any loss. These eight will receive the presents of sacrificial offerings. These eight will look after the distribution of lamps, oil, candles and sacrificial paper to various places according to a list which I shall issue. These thirty will take night duty in turns, seeing that the gates are locked and keeping a look-out for fires, as well as sweeping the grounds. The rest of you will be assigned to different apartments and must stick to your posts. You will be responsible for everything there, from furniture and antiques to spittoons and dusters and each blade of grass and will have to make good any loss or damage. Lai Shengs wife will make a general inspection every day and report to me instantly any slackness, gambling, drinking, fighting or quarrelling. If I find you being too soft, I shall make no allowances for you, even though your family has been in service here for three or four generations. Now you all have your duties, and if anything goes wrong I shall deal with the group concerned. My own servants have clocks and watches, because everything large or small must be done on time. Well, at least you have clocks here in your masters rooms. I shall call the roll at half past six, you will have your meal at ten, and applications for stores or reports should be handed in punctually before half past eleven. At seven in the evening, after the burning of sacrificial paper, I shall make a tour of inspection, then issue those on night duty with their keys. I shall be back again at half past six the next morning. I neednt remind you that we must all do our best during this period. When its over, no doubt your master will reward you. She then ordered the distribution of supplies of tea, oil, candles, feather whisks, brooms and so forth, and had tablecloths, antimacassars, cushions, rugs, spittoons, stools and other furnishings issued. While this was being done, the servants in charge of each place and the articles taken by each were carefully recorded. Now that all the servants had their respective duties, they were no longer able to pick the easy jobs and leave the hard ones undone. Nor were things mislaid any more on account of confusion. However many guests came and went, everything ran smoothly, unlike the previous disorder when a maid serving tea had to fetch in rice as well, or one accompanying the mourners was sent to welcome new arrivals. That day saw the end, too, of disorder, negligence and pilfering. And Xifeng was thoroughly gratified by the authority she now wielded.
The more so, as she has already returned to the Illusory Land of Great Void. If you want to find her, you must cultivate virtue and you will have occasion to meet again. If you chafe at your lot and commit the crime of cutting short your life, you may see your parents again but never Daiyu!" This said, he took a stone from his sleeve and aimed it at Baoyu's heart. Terrified by this warning and a pain in the region of his heart, Baoyu longed to go home but did not know the way. He was hesitating when he heard his name and turned to find that the old lady, Lady Wang, Baochai and Xiren had gathered round, tearfully calling him, and he himself was still lying in his bed. The red lamp on his desk, the bright moon outside the window showed that he was still in this vain world, in the lap of luxury. Calming down, he realized that he had been dreaming. Though drenched with cold sweat he felt refreshed and clear-headed. Reflecting that there was in truth no way out for him, he heaved sigh after sigh. Now Baochai had known from the start of Daiyu's death, but the Lady Dowager forbade any mention of it to Baoyu for fear of making his illness worse, though she herself knew that his breakdown was due to his longing for Daiyu, the loss of his jade being only secondary. She had taken her opportunity to tell him to end his torment and bring him back to his senses, so that he could be cured. The old lady and Lady Wang not knowing her motive, blamed her for her impetuosity but when Baoyu came to they felt relieved and at once summoned Doctor Bi from the outer study to examine him. "Strange!" observed the physician after feeling his pulse. "His pulse is steady and there is no sign now of melancholia. We'll give him a restorative tomorrow, and can hope for a cure." Then he left and the others dispersed, much easier in their minds. Xiren, too, had been shocked by Baochai's disclosure, though she could not very well say so. But Yin ger in confidence has taken her to task for her indiscretion. "You don't understand," said Baochai. "Come what may, I'll take the responsibility." She paid no attention to ill-natured gossip, but carefully probed Baoyu's psychology and quietly needled him for his own good. And little by little he was growing more lucid, only lapsing into senselessness when he remembered Daiyu. It was Xiren who reasoned with him most frequently. "The master chose Miss Baochai for you because she's so affable and good," she told him patiently. "He thought Miss Lin eccentric and suspected that she hadn't long to live. As for the old lady, she was afraid you might get worked up as you'd taken leave of your senses, so she had Xueyan brought over here to trick you." Still Baoyu's heart ached and he often shed tears, tempted to kill himself. But he checked this impulse, remembering the warning in his dream and reluctant to hurt his grandmother and his mother. He took comfort too from the thought that, although Daiyu was dead, Baochai was a girl in a thousand and there might be something in the prophecy of a "match between gold and jade." As he seemed unlikely to do anything drastic, Baochai felt easy enough in her mind to wait dutifully on Their Ladyships, devoting the rest of her time to amusing him. Though Baoyu was too weak to sit up for long, the sight of Baochai sitting by his bed rekindled his amorous proclivity. But she would urge him gravely "That can wait. We're already husband and wife, but the main thing now is to recover your health." Reluctantly, he had to fall in with her wishes, for during the day his grandmother, mother and Aunt Xue took it in turns to keep him company, and at night Baochai slipped away to sleep elsewhere, leaving nannies sent by the old lady to wait on him. So he had to convalesce quietly. Moreover, Baochai's gentle ways made him gradually transfer to her some of the love he had felt for Daiyu. But this is anticipating. On the day of Baoyu's wedding Daiyu lay in a coma, her life hanging by a thread, while Li Wan and Zijuan wept as if their hearts would break. That evening she recovered consciousness and feebly opened her eyes. She seemed to want something to drink. As Xueyan had gone, leaving only Li Wan and Zijuan there, the latter brought her a bowl of pear juice and dried-longan syrup and gave her two or three sips with a small silver spoon, after which Daiyu closed her eyes to rest again.
Soon they came to the bed-chamber of Imperial Consort Yuanchun, its walls dazzling with gleaming glazed tiles. Two young maids-of-honour told them You need only pay your respects. Other formalities can be dispensed with. The Lady Dowagers party, having thanked the Imperial Consort, went over to the bed and paid their respects. The Imperial Consort told them to sit down, which they did with murmured thanks. How has your health been recently? she asked her grandmother. The old lady stood up, leaning on her maids arm. By grace of Your Highness, my health is still good. Lady Xing and Lady Wang were questioned next, and they rose to answer too. Then Xifeng was asked, How are you managing at home? Rising she replied, We are managing all right. Its not been easy for you all these years working so hard. Before Xifeng could answer, a maid-of-honour brought in a list for Her Highness to inspect. When she saw on it the names of Jia She, Jia Zheng and others, her heart ached and she could not hold back her tears. The maid passed her a handkerchief. Im a little better today, she said wiping her eyes. Tell them to rest outside. Her relatives rose to their feet again to give thanks for her graciousness. With tears in her eyes she told them, We are less fortunate than humble folk whose daughters can keep close to their fathers and brothers. Suppressing their own grief they answered, Dont grieve, Your Highness. Our family has benefited so much from your grace! How is Baoyu these days? Working much harder at his books, said the old lady. Because his father makes strict demands on him, he can write essays now. Thats good. She ordered a feast to be served to them outside. Then two maids-of-honour and four young eunuchs led them to another palace where the feast was already laid, and they sat down in due order. But we need not dwell on this. After dining, the old lady led the three others back to thank the Imperial Consort for the feast, and they kept her company until nearly five when, not daring to stay any longer, they took their leave. The Imperial Consort ordered her maids-of-honour to show them to the inner gate, outside which the same four young eunuchs escorted them. When the ladies had seated themselves once more in their chairs, Jia She and the other gentlemen followed them home, where similar arrangements were made for visiting the Palace on the two following days. No more of this. Let us turn back now to Jingui in the Xue family. After driving Xue Pan away she had no one to squabble with as Qiuling had gone to stay with Baochai, leaving only Baochan with her. And Baochan since becoming Xue Pans concubine showed more spirit than before, so that Jingui found in her an even worse rival and repented too late of having made her a secondary wife. One day after drinking a few cups alone Jingui, lying on the kang, decided to work off her spleen on Baochan. Where did the master go when he left home the other day? she asked. You must of course know. How should I? answered Baochan. If he wouldnt tell even you, madam, who can possibly know what hes up to? Jingui laughed scornfully. Are you still calling me madam? You two have it all your own way. She s untouchable because she has a protectress, and I dare not catch the lice on a tigers head, but you are still my maid. Yet when I ask you a question you scowl at me and snap back! If youre so powerful, why not strangle me? Then either you or Qiuling could be the mistress wouldnt you like that better? Its too bad that Im not dead yet, blocking your path! Unable to stomach this, Baochan glared at her. Save that talk for someone else, madam! she retorted. I havent said anything wrong. Why should you work off your anger on someone weaker because you darent challenge her? If someone really offends you, you pretend not to hear so as to keep out of harms way. She burst out crying. More enraged than ever, Jingui scrambled down from the kang to beat her. But Baochan had also acquired the Xia family ways, and she would not give an inch. While Jingui smashed cups and saucers and overturned tables and chairs, Baochan paid no attention, just bewailing her unjust fate at the top of her voice. Aunt Xue in Baochais room heard this commotion.
But the other people fell in love with them too and grabbed them as if they were treasures." Baoyu laughed. "If that's what you want, those things are dirt cheap. Just give five hundred cash to the pages and they'll fetch you two cartloads." "Those fellows have no taste. Please choose some things which are simple without being vulgar, and genuine instead of artificial. Do get me a whole lot more, and I'll make you another pair of slippers. I'll put even more work into them than last time. How's that?" "That reminds me." Baoyu grinned. "I was wearing your slippers one day when I met father He asked mc disapprovingly who'd made them. It wouldnt have dune to tell him it was you, sister so I said they were a present from Aunt Wang on my last birthday. There wasn't much he could say to that, but after an awful silence he commented, 'What a waste of time and energy and good silk.' When I told Xiren she said 'Never mind that, but the concubine Zhao's been complaining bitterly, Her own younger brother Huan's shoes and socks are in holes yet she doesn't care. Instead she embroiders slippers for Baoyu. Tanchun frowned. "Did you ever hear such nonsense?" she fumed. "Is it my job to make shoes? Doesn't Huan have his fair share of clothes, shoes and socks, not to mention a whole roomful of maids and servants? What has she got to complain of? Who's she trying to impress? If I make a pair of slippers in my spare time, I can give them to any brother I choose and no one has any right to interfere. She's crazy, carrying on like that." Baoyu nodded and smiled. "Still, it's natural, you know, for her to see things rather differently." This only enraged Tanchun more. She tossed her head. "Now you're talking nonsense too. Of course she sees things differently with that sly, low, dirty mind of hers. Who cares what she thinks? I don't owe any duty to anyone except our parents. If my sisters, brothers and cousins are nice to me, I'll be nice to them too, regardless of which is the child of a wife or the child of a concubine. Properly speaking, I shouldn't say such things, but really that woman's the limit! "Let me tell you another ridiculous thing too. Two days after I gave you that money to buy knick-knacks, she complained to me she was hard up. I paid no attention, of course. But after my maids left the room, she started scolding me for giving my savings to you instead of to Huan. I didn't know whether to laugh or lose my temper. So I left her and went to Her Ladyship." But now Baochai called to them laughingly "Haven't you talked long enough? It's clear you're brother and sister, the way you leave other people out in the cold to discuss your private affairs. Aren't we allowed to hear a single word?" They smiled at that and joined her. Meanwhile Daiyu had disappeared, and Baoyu knew she was avoiding him. He decided to wait a couple of days for the storm to blow over before approaching her again. Then, towering his head, he noticed that the ground was strewn with balsam and pomegranate petals. "She's too angry even to gather up the blossom," he sighed. "I'IJ take these over and try to speak to her tomorrow. At this point Baochai urged them to take a stroll. "I'll join you later," he said. As soon as the other two had gone, he gathered up the fallen flowers in the skirt of his gown and made his way over a small hill, across a stream and through an orchard towards the mound where Daiyu had buried the peach-blossom. Just before rounding the hill by the flower's grave he caught the sound of sobs on the other side. Someone was lamenting and weeping there in a heart-rending fashion. "Some maid's been badly treated and come here to cry," he thought. "I wonder which of them it is." He halted to listen. And this is what he heard As blossoms fade and fly across the sky, Who pities the faded red, the scent that has been? Softly the gossamer floats over spring pavilions, Gently the willow fluff wafts to the embroidered screen. A girl in her chamber mourns the passing of spring, No relief from anxiety her poor heart knows Hoe in hand she steps through her portal, Loath to tread on the blossom as she comes and goes.
"I've lost." "Doesn't this count as anything?" asked the old lady. -480 "Well, it has a name, but I can't think what melody goes with it." "Tell me its name and I'll think up something for you." "It's 'Water-weeds Swept by Waves.' "That's not difficult. Here you are Autumn Fish Amid Caltrops." Xiangyun who came next recited -827 "I sang white water-weeds on the southern river in autumn." -480 "Very apt," approved the others. "This game's finished. Let's drink a few cups, then have rice," proposed the Lady Dowager, then noticed that the place beside her was empty. "Where has Baoyu gone? Why isn't he back yet?" she asked. Yuanyang told her he had gone to change his clothes. "Who went with him?" Yinger stepped forward to report, "When I saw Master Bao going out I told Sister Xiren to go with him." Their Ladyships felt reassured, but after waiting for a while Lady Wang sent a young maid in search of him. She went to the bridal chamber where Wuer was setting out candles. "Where is Master Bao?" asked the maid. "Over with the old lady, drinking." "I've just come from there, sent by Her Ladyship to find him. If he were there, why should she send me?" "In that case I don't know where he is," said Wuer. "You'd better try somewhere else." On her way back the maid met Qiuwen. "Have you seen Master Bao?" she asked her. "I'm looking for him too," was the reply. "The mistresses are waiting for him to start dinner. Wherever can he have got to? Hurry back and tell the old lady, not that he's not at home but that he's feeling out of Sorts after drinking and doesn't want any food. After resting for a little he'll rejoin them. He hopes Their Ladyships will start without him." The young maid ran meekly off to give this message to Zhenzhu, who reported it to the Lady Dowager. "He never eats much," the old lady said. "So missing a meal doesn't matter. Tell him to have a good rest and not to trouble to come back today as we have his wife here instead." Zhenzhu asked the younger maid, "Did you hear that?" Replying in the affirmative and not liking to tell them the truth, the girl went out for a stroll then came back to report that she had delivered this message. The others paid no attention and after their meal broke up into groups to chat. But enough of this. Baoyu who had left the feast in a fit of distress was at a loss what to do. Xiren overtook him to ask what was amiss. "Nothing," he answered. "I'm just bored. While they're drinking, suppose we stroll over to Madam You's place." "She's with the old lady," Xiren pointed out. "How can you call on her?" "I'm not thinking of calling on anyone, just of seeing what her place is like." Xiren had to follow him, chatting as they made their way to Madam You's lodge, near which they saw a small gate left ajar. Instead of going in, Baoyu accosted two matrons in charge of the Garden who were sitting on the threshold gossiping. "Is this small gate always open?" he asked. "No, it's usually kept shut," they answered. "Today, hearing that the old lady might be wanting fruit from the Garden, we opened it in readiness." He strolled over and looked at the half open gate. Before he could step through it Xiren stopped him. "Don't go in there," she warned. "The Garden's unclean after being deserted for so long, and you might see another apparition." Rather tipsily he boasted, "I'm not afraid of such things!" Xiren tried hard to restrain him, but the old women butted in, "This Garden's been quiet ever since the priests haled off the evil spirits that day, and we often go in alone to pick flowers or fruit. If Master Bao wants to go in we'll keep him company. There's safety in numbers!" Baoyu was pleased and Xiren, unable to stop him, had to go along with them. When Baoyu stepped into the Garden, it struck him as a scene of desolation. The plants were withering, and the paint was flaking off the lodges in various places. In the distance, however, he saw a clump of bamboo which was still luxuriant. After a second's thought he said, "Since moving out of the Garden because of my illness, I've been living in the hack and haven't been allowed to come here for months.
I planned today as a treat for you girls, said the Lady Dowager, So make your choice and never mind your aunts. I didnt lay on this show and feast for them. Theyre lucky to be here at all, able to watch and eat free of charge, but I wont let them choose any items. All laughed at that, and then Daiyu suggested one piece. She was followed by Baoyu, Xiangyun, the three Jia girls and Li Wan, and their choices were put on in turn. When the feast was ready the Lady Dowager told Baochai to select another opera, and she asked for The Drunken Monk. You always choose something rowdy, objected Baoyu. Youve been watching operas all these years for nothing if you dont know how good this is, retorted Baochai. Besides being spectacular it has some magnificent lines. I never could stand noisy shows, he persisted. If you call this noisy that just shows how little you know about opera, she rejoined. Come over here and let me explain. This opera has most stirring arias sung in the northern mode Dian Jiang Chun, which needless to say is an excellent melody and the verses set to Ji Sheng Cao are quite superb, did you but know it. Baoyu edged closer then and begged her to recite them to him. Baochai declaimed -763 Dried are the heros tears. My patrons house left behind By grace divine Tonsured below the Lotus Throne. Not destined to stay, I leave the monastery in a flash, Naked I go without impediment My sole wish now To roam alone in coir cape and bamboo hat, And in straw sandals with a broken aims bow! To wander where I will. Baoyu pounded his lap to the rhythm of the verse and nodded appreciatively, loud in his praise of these words as well as of her erudition. Do be quiet and watch, said Daiyu. Before weve seen The Drunken Monk youre playing The General Feigns Madness. This set Xiangyun giggling. They went on watching operas until dusk. By then the Lady Dowager had taken a special fancy to the girl who played the part of the heroines and the one who took the clowns role. She had them brought to her and on closer inspection found them even sweeter. All marvelled when it was disclosed that the heroine was only eleven, the clown only nine. The old lady rewarded them with some extra delicacies and two additional strings of cash. When that childs made up shes the living image of someone here, remarked Xifeng. Have none of you noticed? Baochai knew whom she meant but she just smiled. Baoyu too had guessed but did not dare to speak out. Xiangyun, however, blurted out, I know! She looks just like Cousin Daiyu. Too late Baoyu shot her a warning glance, for by now everyone had noticed the resemblance and laughingly declared that it was most striking. Soon afterwards they scattered. That evening while undressing, Xiangyun ordered Cuilu to pack her things. Whats the hurry? asked the maid. We can start packing when its time to leave. Were leaving tomorrow morning. Why should we stay here and put up with dirty looks? Baoyu overheard this exchange and hurried in to take Xiangyun by the hand. Dear cousin, youve got me wrong, he said. Daiyu is so terribly sensitive that the others didnt name her for fear of upsetting her. How could she help being annoyed, the way you blurted it out? I looked at you warningly because I didnt want you to hurt her feelings. Its ungrateful as well as unfair of you to be angry with me. If it had been anybody else but you, I wouldnt care how many people she offended. Xiangyun waved him crossly away. Dont try to get round me with your flattering talk. Im not in the same class as your Cousin Daiyu. Its all right for other people to make fun of her, but Im not even allowed to mention her. Shes a grand young lady, Im a slave how dare I offend her? I was only thinking of you, yet now you put me in the wrong. Baoyu was desperate. If I meant any harm, may I turn into dust this instant and be trampled on by ten thousand feet! Stop talking such nonsense just after the New Year. Or go and rave if you must to those petty-minded creatures who are so quick to take offence, and who know how to manage you. Dont make me spit at you! She flounced off to the Lady Dowagers s inner room and threw her- self down angrily on a couch. After this snub Baoyu went to look for Daiyu, but scarcely had he set foot in her room than she pushed him out and closed the door in his face.
asked Xiuju when Yingchun came back from seeing off Lady Xing. The other day I told you, miss, that gold filigree phoenix tiara inlaid with pearls was missing, but you wouldnt even ask what had happened to it. When I said nanny must have pawned it to raise money for gambling, you didnt believe me and told us to ask Siqi where she had put it. I did. And though she was ill she remembered quite distinctly that it hadnt been put away but left in a case on the bookshelf for you to wear during the Moon Festival. You should have asked nanny about it, only youre too soft and afraid of offending people. Now its missing, wont it look odd if youre the only young lady not wearing one tomorrow? There was no need to ask, said Yingchun. Of course she took it to tide her over. I thought shed smuggled it out and would smuggle it back again in a day or two, but apparently she forgot. Its no use asking her now that shes in trouble. How could she have forgotten? She knows you too well and was simply taking advantage of you, miss. Ive just had an idea. Why not let me go and report this to Madam Lian? She can either send to demand it back or just get it out of hock for her with a few strings of cash. What do you think? Dont do that, demurred Yingchun hastily. Lets not make any fuss. Id rather lose it than stir up more trouble. How can you be so soft, miss? protested Xiuju. If youll never stand up for your rights, some day youll be spirited away yourself! Better let me go. She started off and Yingchun had no way to stop her. Now the wife of Wang Zhu the old nurses son had come to beg Yingchun to intercede for her mother-in-law, but she stayed outside when she heard this talk about the gold phoenix tiara. Yingchun was so weak that none of the servants were afraid of her. If Xiuju reported this to Xifeng, however, it would be serious. So Mrs. Wang came in, with an ingratiating smile, to make her appeal. First she begged Xiuju,Please dont go, miss, to stir up trouble. My mother-in-law, being old and muddle-headed, borrowed your young ladys phoenix tiara because shed lost some money and had no means of winning it back. She meant to redeem it in a day or two, but she didnt recoup her losses and that delayed her. Then, as ill luck would have it, someone told tales and landed her in trouble. Still, we cant keep something belonging to your mistress. Well redeem it without fail. She turned to Yingchun. Do us a favour, miss. As she nursed you at her breast when you were small, go and ask the old lady to let your old nanny off. Its out of the question, sister, replied Yingchun. Even if I pleaded for a year it wouldnt be any use. Just now Cousin Baochai, Cousin Daiyu and the other girls tried to beg her off, but the old lady wouldnt hear of it. How much more could I do alone? Besides Ive been humiliated enough. Why should I go asking for another snub? Xiuju put in, Redeeming the tiara and asking a favour are two quite different things. Dont mix them up. Or do you mean you wont give it back if our young lady doesnt get her off? Go and fetch the tiara first. Yingchuns refusal and Xiujus taunt left Wang Zhus wife at a momentary loss. Then, in her mortification, she took advantage of Yingchuns good temper to round on her maid. Dont be so smug, miss! she cried. In all the different young masters and mistresses households, which nurse or nanny doesnt get certain perks. Why expect us to be so scrupulous? Are you maids the only ones allowed to filch things on the sly? After Lady Xings niece came here, Her Ladyship ordered us to save one tael of silver a month for her sister-in-law so here we are spending more on Miss Xiuyan while getting one tael less. And when youre short of this or that we have to provide it. Who goes to ask for more money? We just make do somehow. Were out of pocket by at least thirty taels. Now it seems weve been spending our money all for nothing... Not waiting for her to finish, Xiuju spat in disgust. On what have you spent thirty taels for us?
Qin Zhong agreed readily, then went home to report what had happened. His father Qin Ye, a secretary in the Board of Works, was nearly seventy and had lost his wife early. Having no children of his own he had adopted a son and daughter from an orphanage, but the boy had died leaving only the little girl, Keqing. She grew up to be a graceful, charming young woman. Because Qin was remotely connected with the Jia family, they arranged a match and she became Jia Rongs wife. Qin Zhong was born when his father was over fifty. His tutor had died the previous year and Qin Ye had not yet found another thus the boy had been revising his lessons at home. His father was thinking of approaching the Jias about sending his son to their school in order not to waste the boys time, when as luck would have it Qin Zhong met Baoyu. The old man was also overjoyed to learn that the school was now run by Jia Dairu, a venerable Confucian scholar under whose instruction Qin Zhong was bound to make progress and might even win a name for himself. Qin Ye was a poor official, but the whole Jia household, high and low alike, thought so much of riches and rank that in the interest of his sons career he had to pinch and scrape to get together twenty-four taels of silver as a handsome entrance gift. Then he took Qin Zhong to pay his respects to Jia Dairu, after which they waited for Baoyu to fix a day on which both boys could enter school. Truly -1012 If one knew that in time to come there would be trouble, Who would send his son to study today? Chapter 80 Lovely Xiangling Is Unjustly Thrashed by Her Lecherous Husband The Taoist Priest Wang Prascribes a Cure for a Shrew Jingui turned away her head, pursed her lips and snorted. Striking the palms of both hands together she sneered What scent has the caltrop, pray? If caltrops count as fragrant, how can we describe those truly fragrant flowers? This name is certainly senseless! Not only the caltrop, but even lotus leaves and lotus seed pods have a subtle scent, Xiangling assured her. But of course it cant compare with the fragrance of flowers. On a quiet day or night, or at dawn or midnight, if you inhale that scent carefully it smells even better than flowers. In the breeze or dew, caltrops, euryale seeds, reeds and rushes too, have a subtle fragrance which is very refreshing. Do you mean to say you dislike the fragrance of orchids and osmanthus? demanded Jingui. Xiangling, in the heat of argument, completely forgot the taboo as she answered quickly The fragrance of orchids and osmanthus is unique.... Before she could finish, Jinguis maid Baochan wagged a warning finger at her. Do you want to die? Mentioning the mistress name! I slipped up, apologized Xiangling, embarrassed by her gaffe. Please dont be offended, madam. Jingui laughed. It doesnt matter. Youre over-scrupulous. Still, I dont think that Xiang for sweetness in your name is right, Id like to change it for another word, if you agree. What a thing to say, madam! cried Xiangling gaily. I belong to you completely, so why consult me about changing my name? This is doing me too much honour. Just use whatever word you think best, madam. You may agree, but suppose my sister-in-law takes offence? She may not like the name I choose and say, Shes only been here a few days, but already shes refuting me. Let me tell you how it is, madam. When I was bought, it was to serve the old lady thats why Miss Baochai gave me this name. Later, when I started waiting on our master, that had nothing to do with her. And now that Im serving you, Miss Baochai has even less to do with me. Besides, shes such an understanding young lady, how could she take offence? In that case, lets substitute the Qiu meaning autumn for Xiang. The caltrop flourishes and flowers in autumn, so that is surely more appropriate. Just as you say, madam, agreed Xiangling cheerfully. Thereafter her name was changed to Qiuling, and Baochai raised no objection. Now Xue Pan was a living example of the saying To cover the land of Shu after getting the region of Long. After marrying Jingui, he was struck by her maid Baochans charms. As she seemed approachable as well as alluring, he often flirted with her when asking her to fetch him tea or water.
She assumed he was thinking of Daiyu, but could not tell whether he had dreamed of her or not. Put out by his stare she asked "Did you meet a goddess last night?" Imagining that she must have overheard them he faltered, "What do you mean?" Wuer, too conscience-stricken to speak, waited for Baochai to go on. "Did you hear Master Bao talk with someone in his sleep?" Baochai asked her with a smile, making Baoyu beat a discomfited retreat. Red in the face, Wuer mumbled, "He did say something I couldn't catch it clearly in the first part of the night. Something about 'getting a bad name' and 'not committing herself.' I couldn't made it out and begged Master Bao to sleep. Then I fell asleep myself, so I don't know whether he said anything more. Baochai lowered her head and thought, "He obviously had Daiyu in mind. If we let him stay outside, he may get more deranged and some flower fairy or tree spirit may take possession of him. Besides, his illness was brought on by his strong feeling for her. If only there were some way to divert his affection to me, he'd get over it." At this idea, she blushed up to her ears and went sheepishly back to her room to do her hair. The old lady's improved spirits these last two days had made her overeat, and that evening she was out of sorts. The next day her chest felt constricted however, she would not let Yuanyang report this to Jia Zheng. "I've been rather greedy these two days and had too much to eat," she said. "Missing a meal will set me right. Don't make a fuss about it." So Yuanyang and the others kept quiet. When Baoyu went home that evening, Baochai had just come back from paying her respects to the old lady and Lady Wang. The sight of her reminded him of her remarks that morning, making him rather ashamed. Seeing how put out he looked and knowing what a sentimentalist he was, she decided to use his infatuation to cure him. "Are you going to sleep outside again tonight?" she asked. "Outside or inside it's all the same to me," he answered glumly. She wanted to say more but could not get the words out. "Well, just what does that mean?" asked Xiren. "I don't believe you slept so well outside." Wuer seized this chance to add, "When Master Bao sleeps outside, the only snag is that he talks in his sleep in a way we can't understand, yet we dare not talk back." "I'll move my bed outside tonight to see whether I talk in my sleep or not," said Xiren. "You two move Master Bao's bedding back to the inner room." Baochai said nothing. Baoyu, too ashamed to argue, let them move his bedding inside. Now Baoyu in his contrition wanted to set Baochai's mind at rest, while she, for fear lest longing might drive him distracted, thought it best to show affection to win him over to take Daiyu's place in his heart. So that evening when Xiren moved out, he made abject advances which Baochai naturally did not reject. And thus that night at last their marriage was consummated. Later she conceived, but that need not concern us now. When next day husband and wife had got up together, after Baoyu had dressed he set off first to see his grandmother. As she was so fond of him and thought Baochai dutiful too, it suddenly occurred to her to make Yuanyang open a case and get out a Han-Dynasty jade, an heirloom of hers. Though less precious than Baoyu's jade, it was a rare pendant. Yuanyang found the jade and handing it over remarked, "I don't believe I've ever seen this before. Fancy you remembering so clearly, madam, the exact case and box it was in after all these years! By looking Where you told me I found it in a jiffy. But what do you want this for, madam?" 'I'll tell you. This jade was given by my great-grandfather to my father. Since I was my father's favourite, just before I married he sent for me and gave me this himself, saying, 'This jade is a pendant of the kind worn in the Han Dynasty it's very precious. Keep it to remind you of me.' I was young at the time I took it and didn't set much store by it, so I left it in the case. And after I came to this house and saw how many knick-knacks we had here, this seemed nothing special so I never wore it, and there it's lain for more than sixty years.
It shows the truth of the old saying The well-fed turn away from cooked meats, while the famished enjoy dregs of wine and husks of rice.And again One glutted with rice prefers thin gruel. Shedding tears he asked, Have you anything to tell me while nobodys about? What is there to say? she sobbed. Im just dragging on from day to day, from hour to hour. I shall be gone in a few days at most, I know. But I cant die content. I may have been born with more than my share of good looks, but theres been no secret understanding between us and Ive never tried to lead you astray, yet they insist Im a vamp. That I do resent! Now Ive got this bad name for nothing and Im dying. If only Id known how things would end Id have acted differently but I was fool enough to think wed always be together. How could I guess thered be this sudden scandal and Id have nowhere to plead my innocence? She burst into tears again. Baoyu took her hand. On her wrists, thin as sticks, were for silver bracelets. Better take these off, he advised. You can wear them when youre better. As he drew off the bracelets and put them under her pillow he remarked, You took such care to grow those finger-nails two inches long now your illness is going to spoil them. Qingwen dried her tears and reached for a pair of scissors to cut off the tapering nails of the last two fingers of her left hand. Then, under the quilt, she took off her worn red silk bodice and gave this to him together with the nails. Take these keepsakes to remind you of me, she said. And now take off your inner jacket and help me put it on, so that lying in my coffin I shall feel as if I were still in Happy Red Court. I shouldnt do such a thing, of course, but as Ive already got a bad name why not? At once Baoyu took off his inner jacket, put on her bodice, and concealed the finger-nails. If they see these when you go back and question you, she sobbed, theres no need to lie. Just tell them these are mine. Since Ive been falsely accused, why shouldnt I at least have this satisfaction? While she was still speaking her cousins wife lifted the portiere and burst in, smirking. Fine, I heard all you two said! She turned to Baoyu. What is a young master doing in a servants room? Have you come to seduce me, thinking me young and pretty? Hush, good sister! Not so loud! he begged. Shes worked for me all these years, so I slipped in to see her. Miss Deng hustled him into the inner room. You dont want me to shout, she chortled. All right if youll be nice to me. She plumped down on the edge of the kang hugging Baoyu to her. He had never seen such behaviour as this before. His heart beating fast he blushed all over his face. Good sister, dont tease me! he pleaded. Miss Deng laughed tipsily. Bah! Ive always heard that you were a ladys man. What makes you so bashful today? Flushing crimson he implored, Do let go of me, then we can talk properly. If the old woman outside hears how awful ! I came back long ago and sent her to wait for you at the Garden gate, she laughed. Ive been waiting and waiting for a chance like this, but now that youre here Ive discovered youre a fraud. For all youre so handsome, youre nothing but a fire-cracker without powder good only for show. Why, youre much shyer than I am. This shows its no use listening to gossip. For instance, when my cousin came home I was sure you two must have been up to some monkey business thats why I came back to listen outside the window. If theres been some goings-on between you, as you were alone you would have talked about it but to my surprise thered been nothing of the sort. So its clear lots of people get wrongly accused in this world. Im sorry I misjudged you. Well, as this is the case, youve nothing to worry about. You can come whenever you like and I wont pester you. Feeling very relieved he got up and straightened his clothes. Good sister, please take good care of her for a couple of days, he urged her. I must be off now. He went out then to say goodbye to Qingwen. Both were reluctant to part, but part they must and knowing how hard he found it, she covered her face with the quilt and ignored him until he left.
Yingchitn, Tanchun and Xichun were fetched, and Jia Lian, Baoyu and the other boys stood up to offer them seats, taking lower places themselves. Then the Lady Dowager called for a twig of osmanthus and ordered a serving-woman to beat a drum on the other side of the screen as the twig passed from hand to hand. Whoever had it when the drumming stopped had to drink a cup of wine and tell a joke as forfeit. The game started with the old lady passing the twig to Jia She, and so on in turn. After two rounds Jia Zheng was left with it in his hand and had to drink up, while his children, nephews and nieces nudged or tugged at each other meaningly as they waited, smiling, to hear what joke he would tell. As his mother was in high spirits he felt constrained to do his best to please her. If you cant make us laugh, she warned, we shall punish you by making you tell another. 1 have only the one joke, madam. If you dont find it funny Ill accept the penalty... .There was a man who was hen-pecked.... He was interrupted here by a burst of laughter, as Jia Zheng had never told jokes of this type before. This must be a good one, said the old lady, laughing. If you think it good, you must drink another cup, madam. Agreed. He went on, This hen-pecked husband never dared go anywhere without his wifes permission. But on the Moon Festival, going out to do some shopping, he met friends who dragged him home to drink with them. He got drunk and slept in their house. The next day when he woke up, quite conscience-stricken, he had to go home to apologize. It happened that his wife was washing her feet. She said to him, Well, if you lick my feet Ill forgive you. So the man had to lick her feet. But he couldnt help retching, and this so enraged his wife that she threatened to beat him. What insolence! she cried. He fell on his knees in fright and explained, Its not that your feet stink, madam, but all the rice-wine and mooncakes I had yesterday have turned my stomach today. The whole company laughed, and Jia Zheng at once poured a cup of wine for the old lady. If thats how you feel, lets replace this wine with spirits, she proposed. We dont want you to be sick. Amid general mirth the drumming started once more, stopping this time when Baoyu had the osmanthus. His fathers presence made him feel on edge, but here he was caught with the twig in his hand. If I fail to tell a good joke Ill be scolded for being too stupid even to tell a joke, he thought. If I tell an amusing one hell say Im no good at studying, only able to gab, and blame me all the more. So Id better get out of it. He stood up and pleaded, Im no good at telling jokes. Please set me some other forfeit. Well then, said Jia Zheng, write an occasional poem with autumn as the rhyme. If its good youll get a reward. If not, look out tomorrow! Were just playing a drinking game, objected the old lady. Why make him write a poem? He can do it, Jia Zheng assured her. At once she sent for paper and a brush. Jia Zheng warned, Mind you dont use ornate phrases like frozen jade, silver crystal, bright splendour or shining purity. Your poem must be original. I want to test your ability after these years of study. This was just what Baoyu had been hoping for. He promptly made up four lines and wrote them out, presenting the poem to Jia Zheng who nodded without any comment. The Lady Dowager took this as a good sign. How is it? she asked. To please her Jia Zheng answered. Quite a good effort. But because he hasnt been studying the right books the language lacks distinction. Thats good enough. After all, how old is he? Do you expect him to be a prodigy? You should encourage him, to make him pay more attention to study in future. Very well. Jia Zheng turned to order a nurse, Go and tell the pages in my study to bring two of those fans I brought back from Hainan to give him. Baoyu having bowed his thanks sat down again, and they went on with the game. This prize given to Baoyu made Lan now leave his seat to write a poem too, which he handed to his grandfather. Jia Zheng, very pleased with it, explained the contents of both poems to the old lady.
They would certainly have asked about it. This silenced Baoyu but pleased Concubine Zhao. If he lost it outside why should they accuse Huan... she began. Before she could finish Lady Wang rapped out, Were talking about the jade. Stop drivelling! With Concubine Zhao crushed, Li Wan and Tanchun told Lady Wang all that had happened, making her shed tears in dismay. She decided to report this to the old lady so that she could send people to question those members of Lady Xings household who had come with her to Happy Red Court that morning. Just then, however, along came Xifeng, having heard about the loss of Baoyus jade and Lady Wangs visit to the Garden. Although still an invalid, feeling unable to hold aloof she now arrived leaning on Fengers arm, just as Lady Wang was about to leave. How are you madam? she faltered. Baoyu and the others went over and greeted her. So youve heard too? said Lady Wang. Isnt it odd? ft just vanished all of a sudden and cant be found. Think now which of the maids from the old ladys place down to your Pinger is unreliable and a mischief-maker? I shall have to report this to the old lady and organize a thorough-going search. Otherwise, Baoyus life may be cut short! Our households so big, its a mixed lot, Xifeng answered. As the proverb says, you cant judge by appearances, madam. Who can guarantee that everyone here is honest? But if we raise a hue and cry so that this becomes public knowledge, the thief will realize that if you find him out or her, as the case may be he will have to pay for it with his life, and in desperation he may smash the jade to destroy the evidence. Then what shall we do? In my foolish opinion, wed better say that Baoyu never liked it and its loss is of no consequence, so long as we all keep this secret and dont let the old lady and the master know. At the same time, we can secretly send people to search high and low and trick the thief into producing it. Once we have the jade back, we can punish the culprit. What do you think of this, madam? After some thought Lady Wang answered, Youre right of course, but how are we to keep this from the master? She called Huan over and told him, Your brothers jade is lost. Why should you raise such a row when simply asked a question? If you spread the news and the thief smashes the jade, I cant see you living it down! In his terror Huan sobbed, I wont breathe a word about it! And Concubine Zhao was too cowed to say any more. Lady Wang now told the others, There must be places you havent searched. It was here all right, so how could it fly away? But the thing is to keep this quiet. I give you three days, Xiren, to find it for me. If you still havent recovered it by then, Im afraid we shant be able to hush it up and there will be no peace for anyone! She told Xifeng to go with her to Lady Xings house to discuss plans for a search. Li Wan and the others talked it over again, then summoned the servants in charge of the Garden and made them lock the gates. Next they sent for Lin Zhixiaos wife and told her to order the gatekeepers both at the front and the back not to let out any domestics, whether male or female, for the next three days. All were to remain in the Garden until something missing had been found again. Very well, said Mrs. Lin, adding, the other day we lost something at home of no great value. But to trace it my husband went out to consult a fortune-teller, a man called Iron-Mouth Liu, who cleared up the problem for us by analysing a character. And sure enough, when Zhixiao came back and looked where he suggested, we found the thing at once. Good Mrs. Lin, Xiren begged her, do go and get your husband to consult that fortune-teller for us now. Mrs. Lin agreed readily to this and left. Actually those fortune-tellers and diviners outside are no use, said Xiuyan. When I was down south, I heard that Miaoyu was able to divine by writing on sand. Why dont we consult her? Besides, this jade is said to be supernatural, so the oracle should disclose its whereabouts. The others rejoined in surprise, We often see her but never heard tell of this. I doubt if shell agree if we others ask her, miss, said Sheyue to Xiuyan. So let me kowtow to you .and beg you to take this errand on yourself.
We humbly invoke all divinities to show their divine compassion and display their spiritual majesty afar in these forty-nine days of grand sacrifice, that the departed may be delivered from sins and absolved from retribution.... There was more in the same vein. Now all that still troubled Jia Zhen was the fact that his wife was ill in bed again, unable to see to things. If any breach of etiquette occurred while so many nobles were calling, the family would be laughed at. Baoyu noticed his preoccupation and asked Why do you look so anxious, cousin, now that everythings settled so satisfactorily? When told the reason he said cheerfully, Thats no problem. Ill recommend someone to take charge for you. Let her see to things this month and I guarantee that everything will go smoothly. Who do you mean? Since there were many friends and relatives present, Baoyu drew closer and whispered into his ear. Excellent! Jia Zhen sprang to his feet, overjoyed. I must see to it at once. Taking leave of the others he hurried off with Baoyu to the drawing-room. As this was not one of the major days on which masses were said, only a few ladies who were close relatives had come. They were being entertained by Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Xifeng and other women of the household when Jia Zhen was announced. The ladies uttered cries of astonishment and hurriedly tried to slip into the inner room. Only Xifeng stood up composedly. Jia Zhen was not in good health himself at this time and, being weighed down with grief, he limped in with a cane. You are not well, said Lady Xing. After all your recent exertions you ought to rest. What business brings you here? Still clutching his cane, Jia Zhen made an effort to kneel to greet and thank his kinswomen. Lady Xing urged Baoyu to restrain him and had a chair placed for him, but he would not take it. Forcing a smile he announced, Your nephew has come to ask a favour of his aunts and cousin. What is it? inquired Lady Xing. You know how it is, aunt. With my daughter-in-law gone and my wife ill in bed, everything is at sixes and sevens in the inner apartments. If my cousin Xifeng would condescend to take charge here for a month, that would set my mind at rest. So thats it. Lady Xing smiled. Xifeng is part of your Aunt Wangs establishment, so youll have to ask her permission. Shes young and inexperienced in these matters, said Lady Wang. If she handled things badly people would laugh. Youd better find someone else. I can guess your real objection, aunt, he replied. Youre afraid shed find it too tiring. As for handling things badly, I know that wouldnt be the case. And any little slip would be overlooked. Ever since she was a child at play Cousin Xifeng has known her own mind, and by managing the other house since her marriage shes gained experience. Ive been thinking this over for some days and theres no one else so competent. If you wont agree for my sake or my wifes, aunt, do it for the one whos dead. His tears flowed again. Lady Wangs only concern had been lest Xifeng, having no experience of funerals, might lay herself open to ridicule by managing badly. The earnestness of Jia Zhens request softened her heart and she eyed Xifeng thoughtfully. Now Xifeng loved nothing better than displaying her administrative ability. Although she ran the household competently, as she had never been entrusted with grand affairs like weddings or funerals she was afraid others were not yet fully convinced of her efficiency and she was longing for a chance like this. Jia Zhens request delighted her. Seeing that his eagerness was overcoming Lady Wangs initial reluctance, she said Since my cousin is so earnest and pressing, wont you give your consent, madam? Are you sure you can cope? whispered Lady Wang. I dont see why not. Cousin Zhen has seen to all the important outside arrangements, its just a question of keeping an eye on the domestic side. And in case of doubt, I can consult you. Since this was reasonable, Lady Wang made no further objection. I cant see to everything, Jia Zhen said to Xifeng. I must beg you to help us, cousin. Let me express my gratitude now, and when everythings over I shall come round to your side to thank you properly. He made a low bow and, before she could return it, produced the Ning Mansion tally from his sleeve and asked Baoyu to hand it to her. You will have a free hand, cousin, he promised.
"You stay here till the fire burns out," he ordered. "Then go in to see whether the old priest was trapped or not, and come back to report to me." The man assented and remained behind while Yucun crossed the river to carry on with his inspection. After checking up on a few districts, he put up in a hostel for the night. The following day he journeyed another stage and re-entered the capital, runners before him clearing the way while others of his attendants followed behind. Then, seated in his sedan-chair, he heard the men in front shouting angrily and asked them what had happened. One of the runners dragged over a man and made him kneel down before the prefect's chair. "This drunkard didn't get out of the way but came charging at us, he reported. "When ordered to stop, he put on a drunken act and flopped down in the middle of the road, then accused me of knocking him down." "I am in charge of this district," Yucun announced. "All citizens here come under my jurisdiction. When you saw your prefect coming, you were too drunk to make way yet had the nerve to make false accusations!" 'I buy drink with my own money," retorted the fellow. "When I'm tipsy it's the Emperor's land I lie down on. Not even high officials can interfere." "Lawless scoundrel!" Yucun fumed. "Ask him his name." "I am Ni Er the Drunken Diamond." Yucun was furious. "Have this wretch beaten," he ordered. "We'll soon see whether he's hard as a diamond!" The runners pinned Ni Er down and gave him some hard lashes till, sobered up by the pain, he begged for mercy. Yucun from his chair scoffed, "So that's the rough diamond you are! I won't have you beaten now but taken to the yamen for a thorough interrogation." The runners shouted assent, tied Ni Er up and dragged him oft, ignoring his entreaties. Yucun went to court to make his report, and by the time he returned to his office this incident had slipped his mind completely. But men in the street who had witnessed it commented to one another, "Ni Er, in his cups, counts on his strength to throw his weight about but now he's fallen into Prefect Ji a's clutches he's not likely to get off lightly!" This talk reached the ears of Ni Er's wife and daughter, who waited in vain that night for him to come home. The girl went to search different gambling-houses for him, and when everyone there confirmed the report she wept. "Don't worry, "they said. "Prefect Jia is connected with the Rong Mansion, and a certain Second Master Jia of that family is one of your father's friends. If you and your mother ask him to put in a word, your father will be let off." Ni Er's daughter thought, "Yes, I've often heard father say that Mr. Jia Yun next door is his friend, so why not get him to help?" She hurried home to propose this to her mother, and together they called on Jia Yun. He happened to be in that day and promptly offered them seats while his mother ordered tea. Then Ni Er's wife and daughter told him their story. "We've come to beg you to put in a word, Second Master, to get him set free," they entreated. "That's easy," Jia Yun bragged. "As soon as I mention this to the West Mansion he'll be released. This Mr. Jia Yucun owes his high post to the help of the Rong Mansion, so once they send him a message the thing will be settled." Mother and daughter went joyfully home, then took word to Ni Er in the lock-up that he need not fret because Jia Yun had promised to see about his release. Ni Er's spirits rose again. However, since the embarrassing occasion when Xifeng had declined his presents, Jia Yun had seldom called at the Rong Mansion. For the gatemen there watched their masters' behaviour to visitors and acted accordingly. Welcome guests who were treated with favour they announced but those who were cold-shouldered they turned away, even if they were relatives, fobbing them off with excuses. Today Jia Yun went to the gate saying that he had come to pay his respects to Jia Lian. "The Second Master is out," the gatemen told him. "We'll tell him when he comes back that you called." Jia Yun thought of asking to see Xifeng instead, but for fear of another snub he refrained and went home, where Ni Er's wife and daughter importuned him again.
I may not be clean myself either. I forgot myself just now, said Xianglian with a smile. Please dont make such an issue of it. Why mention it again? retorted Baoyu. This makes it seem that you take it seriously. Xianglian took his leave then with a bow and left. He thought of going to see Xue Pan, but reflected that as the latter was unwell and so irascible at the best of times he had better go and get his pledge back instead. This decision reached, he went to find Jia Lian. Jia Lian was in the new house. When he heard that Xianglian had come he was overjoyed and hurried out to welcome him, then ushered him into the inner room and introduced him to old Mrs. You. To his astonishment, instead of kneeling to her as his future mother-in-law, Xianglian simply bowed and addressed her as aunt, referring to himself as your nephew. And as they were sipping tea he said, During my journey, as it happened, I was overhasty, not knowing that my aunt had arranged a match for me in the fourth month, making it impossible for me to retract. It wouldnt be right would it, brother, for me to accept your proposal and refuse my aunts. If Id given the usual gifts of money and silk, I wouldnt venture to ask to have them back but those swords were left me by my grandfather, so I must beg you to return them. Jia Lian was very put out when he heard this. A pledge is a pledge, he argued. And a pledge is given to stop a man from going back on his word. Can you cancel an engagement so casually? Pray reconsider the matter. In spite of what you say, replied Xianglian, Im willing to accept any penalty, but on this matter I definitely cannot obey your order. Jia Lian was about to reply when Xianglian stood up. Lets discuss this outside, he proposed. Its not convenient her. Third Sister had heard all this clearly from her room. She had been waiting and waiting for Liu Xianglians arrival, but now he had suddenly broken the engagement. It was clear to her that he must have heard some gossip in the Jia mansions which led him to believe her a shameless wanton, not fit to be his wife. If she let the two men go out now to discuss it, she foresaw that Jia Lian would fail to win him round and she would be utterly humiliated. So as soon as Jia Lian agreed to his proposal she took down the swords, concealing the duck behind her elbow, and went out to intercept them. Theres no need for you to go out to discuss this further. she told them. Heres your pledge, Im returning it. Her tears falling like rain, with her left hand she passed the sheath with one sword in it to Xianglian, and with her right cut her throat with the other blade. Alas! -740 The jade hill crumbles, never to rise again Peach-blossom, trampled, stains the ground with red. Her fragrant spirit is lost in the infinite None knows whither it has fled. All present were consternated and tried in vain to revive her. Old Mrs. You sobbing with horror cursed Xianglian, while Jia Lian seized hold of him, calling servants to tie him up and drag him to court. Second Sister dried her tears then to urge her husband, Let him be! He didnt threaten her, she took her own life. So what use would it be to take him to court? That would only cause a worse scandal. Youd better let him go, to save further trouble. Then Jia Lian, not knowing what else to do, let go of Xianglian and told him to get out. However, he did not move but burst into tears. I never knew this intended wife of mine was so chaste, such a magnificent girl. he exclaimed. Prostrating himself over her corpse he gave way to a storm of weeping. And when a coffin was brought and her body laid in it, he clasped it and lamented bitterly before finally leaving them. Once outside the gate he did not know where to go, dazed and sunk in gloom as he recalled what had just happened. So she was so lovely and chaste, he reflected, torn by remorse. He wandered aimlessly on until one of Xue Pans pages appeared and asked him to go back. The boy took him to a magnificent bridal chamber. He heard the tinkling of pendants, and in came Third Sister, in one hand the duck and drake swords, in the other a book. With tears she told him Your devoted handmaid waited five years for you, my lord, not knowing you would prove so cold-hearted.
Are they hang Yuhans lot? asked Aunt Xue. No, Jiang Yuhan hasnt come. These are some others. Xue Kes outburst had further lowered Aunt Xues spirits. Though I have a son, its as if I had none. she sighed. Even if the authorities let him off, hell be useless. Though youre my nephew, and not so close, I can see that you have more sense than Pan and will be my only prop in my old age. Its up to you to make a success of your life. Especially as the family of your betrothed isnt as well off as before. Its hard for a girl to leave home and get married, and all she hopes for is an able husband who will provide for her. If Xiuyan were like that creature.... she pointed towards the inner rooms well, enough said! But Xiuyan is truly modest, sensible too. She can put up with poverty, and wealth wouldnt spoil her either. Once this trouble blows over we must hurry up and arrange your wedding, and that will be one less thing on my mind. Theres still Sister Baoqins marriage which must be on your mind, aunt. he said. As for mine, dont worry about it. After some more talk Xue Ke went back to his room for supper. He thought to himself, Xiuyans living in the Jias Garden as a dependent, and being a poor relation she must be having a thin time of it. As we travelled here together, I know her character and what shes like. Heaven 2747 is really unjust, giving a spoilt bitch like Xia Jingui money while a girl like Xiuyan is so badly off. How does the King of Hell decide these things, I wonder? He wanted to write a poem to vent his frustration, but as he had no training in versification he could only pen the following doggerel -740 A dragon stranded, a fish high and dry Apart we think of each other, you and I. In mud and slime our bitter days are passed When will we find clear water at long last? This written, he read it through and was tempted to paste it on the wall but diffidently told himself, I dont want people seeing it to laugh at me. After a second reading he thought, Never mind! I may as well paste it up for my own amusement. Reading it once more, however, he decided it really was no good and put it between the pages of a book. Im no longer a boy, he mused, but now our familys run into this bad trouble and theres no knowing when it will blow over. Its keeping that sweet, gentle girl so sad and lonely! His reflections were cut short by the arrival of Baochan with a hamper which she put on the table, smiling. Xue Ke got up and invited her to be seated. Here are four dishes of sweetmeats and one small pot of wine, she announced archly. My mistress told me to bring them to you. Please thank my sister-in-law. But why didnt she send a young maid instead of troubling you? Thats all right. Were one family, so why stand on ceremony? Besides, youve put yourself out so much over Master Pans business, our mistress has long been wanting to show her appreciation, but she was afraid people might suspect her motives. You know how it is in our family all sweet talk hiding inward disagreement. It shouldnt matter sending you a small present, but it might give rise to a whole lot of gossip. So today she simply prepared a couple of dishes and a pot of wine and told me to bring them to you secretly. She glanced at him with a meaningful smile and added. You mustnt talk in that formal way again, sir, or youll embarrass me. Im only a servant. If I can wait on Master Pan, whats to stop me from waiting on you, sir? 2749 Xue Ke was a simple, honest young fellow. He had never been treated like this by Jingui and Baochan before yet as the latter said it was to thank him for helping Xue Pan, this seemed to him quite natural. Leave the dishes, sister, he said. But please take back the wine. I really cant drink much, just a cup occasionally when Im forced to, but ordinarily I never drink. Surely your mistress and you knew that? I can use my own discretion in other matters, she replied, but I cant obey you in this. You know what our mistress is like. If I took it back, she wouldnt think its because you dont drink but because Id been remiss. So Xue Ke had to let her leave the wine. Then Baochan went to the door and peeped outside. Turning back to smile at him, she pointed towards the inner rooms. I dare say shell be coming herself to thank you, she said.
Well, I caught him today making up to someone else, so I neednt be afraid even if the whole thing comes out. What scrape are you in now? asked his mother, ne Hu, when she heard this muttering. I had to rope in your aunt and put her to no end of trouble to beg Madam Xifeng in the West Mansion to get you this place in the family school. Where would we be if not for their help? We couldnt afford a tutor. Besides, you get free meals there, dont you? Thats meant a great saving on your board these last two years. Its fitted you out in all those smart clothes youre so fond of. It was through the school, too, that you met Mr. Xue whos helped us this last year or so to the tune of seventy or eighty taels of silver at least. If youre expelled because of this row, dont expect me to find another school like this. I can tell you, that would be harder than climbing up to heaven. Just amuse yourself quietly now before going to bed. That would be much better. Jin Rong had to swallow his anger and hold his tongue, and very soon he turned in. The next day be went back to school as if nothing had happened. Now Jin Rongs paternal aunt had married Jia Huang of that generation of the family which used the jade yu radical in personal names. Needless to say, not all members of the clan were as wealthy as those in the Ning and Rong Mansions. Jia Huang and his wife had very slender means and were only able to live as they did by keeping on good terms with both households and by making up to Xifeng and Madam You, who often helped them out. Since today was fine and she had nothing to do, Jia Huangs wife, ne Jin, accompanied by a woman-servant, came over by carriage to see her widowed sister-in-law and nephew. In the course of conversation Jin Rongs mother described the quarrel in the school the previous day, giving a detailed account of the whole affair. Aunt Huang immediately flew into a passion. Our boy Rong is just as much a relative of the Jia family as that young fool Qin Zhong, she cried. How can some people suck up like that to the rich? Especially when they behave so disgracefully. As for Baoyu, hes no call to make such a favourite of him. Im going to the East Mansion to see Madam You, then Ill tell Qin Zhongs sister about this and see what she has to say. I should never have told you, sister. Jin Rongs mother was frantic. For goodness sake dont say anything to them. Never mind whos right and whos wrong. If trouble came of it my boy would lose his place. And apart from the fact that we couldnt afford a tutor wed have to spend a lot more on his food and clothes. Never mind that! retorted Aunt Huang. Let me tell them the facts and well see what they have to say. Ignoring the widows protests, she called for her carriage and drove to the Ning Mansion, alighting at the small gate on the east side and going in on foot to see Madam You. Not daring to vent her anger, she made polite conversation for a while, then asked, Why dont I see Madam Rong today? I dont know what the matter is, said Madam You. But shes missed her periods for two months and more, yet the doctors say shes not expecting. Shes too tired to move or talk by the afternoon nowadays, and she has dizzy spells. I told her, Dont trouble to pay your respects here mornings and evenings, just have a good rest. If relatives call, Ill receive them. And if the old folk wonder at your absence, Ill make apologies for you. I told Rong not to let anyone tire or annoy her, so that she can rest quietly until shes better. If she fancies anything to eat, come to me for it, I said. If we dont have it you can ask Xifeng. If anything were to happen to her, youd never find another wife with her good looks and sweet temper, not if you were to search around with a lantern. Shes quite won the hearts of the old folk and all our relations. So Ive been most dreadfully worried the last few days. But then her brother had to come and see her this morning. Hes too young to know any better, but when he saw she was ill he shouldnt have troubled her with his affairs, not to say a trifle like this. Even if he was treated unfairly, he shouldnt have told her. They had a fight, you know, in school yesterday. Some other boy bullied him and there was dirty talk--- he repeated it all to her.
Why do you say that? she laughed. Whos been carrying on in a scandalous way? Why ask me? You may have been ill but you werent dead Before she could say more, Baochai was announced and she entered even as Li Wan was asking her in. Madam You quickly wiped her face and got up to offer her a seat. All by yourself? she asked. Where are the other girls? I havent seen them, said Baochai. Ive come because mothers unwell, and our only two reliable maids are ill in bed so I must go back to keep her company tonight. I meant to ask leave from Their Ladyships, but then I thought that as its not really serious theres no need to mention it and anyway Ill come back as soon as shes better. So Ive just come to let you know. Li Wan and Madam You exchanged smiles at this. And now that the latter had cleaned up they all had some fried-flour tea. Li Wan remarked, We must send to inquire after Aunt Xues illness, as Im not well enough to go myself. Yes, just go along home, dear cousin. Ill assign people to keep an eye on your rooms for you while youre away. But mind you come back after a day or two, otherwise Ill be held to blame. Why should you be? This is just for the time being and perfectly natural. Its not as if you were taking a bribe to let a thief escape! And I see no reason for you to send people over. Why not invite Xiangyun here to stay with you for a few days? Wouldnt that be simpler? Where is she? asked Madam You. I just sent her to find Tanchun and bring her here, so that I can let her know too. That same moment Xiangyun and Tanchun were announced, and after they had been offered seats Baochai explained why she was leaving the Garden. Very good, commented Tanchun. So youll come back when aunties better. And even if you dont, that wont matter either. Thats strange way to talk! exclaimed Madam You. Are we driving our relatives away? Thats the idea. Tanchun smiled mockingly. Better drive them out before getting thrown out by others. In any case, theres no need for relatives to live together all the time. Were a happy family of kith and kin I must say, all like game-cocks fighting to finish each other off. Im certainly out of luck today, Madam You laughed, Finding so many of you girls in a bad temper. Who told you to come and burn yourself on the stove? Tanchun retorted. And who else has offended you? She went on thoughtfully, Xichun has no reason to scold you, so who else could it be? Madam You just muttered an evasive reply. Knowing she was reluctant to speak out for fear of trouble, Tanchun teased, Dont pretend to be so simple. People dont get their heads chopped off except for crimes against the state, so what are you so afraid of? Ill tell you the truth I slapped that old wife of Wang Shanbaos yesterday, and Im quite willing to take the consequences. But apart from calling me names behind my back, nobodys likely to give me a beating for it. Asked by Baochai what had provoked her, Tanchun described in detail the search made the night before and why she had struck Mrs. Wang. Since Tanchun had come out with it, Madam You told them how Xichun had just treated her. Shes like that, observed Tanchun, so eccentric and stubborn theres just no talking her round. Then she informed them, When no action was taken this morning and I heard that our peppery Xifeng was ill again, I sent my nanny to find out what had happened to Wang Shanbaos wife. She came back to report that the old creature got a thrashing for being too meddlesome. Serves her right too, approved Madam You and Li Wan. Tanchun laughed caustically. Who cant see through that trick? Just wait and see Madam You and Li Wan made no answer to this. And presently, thinking it time for the Lady Dowagers meal, Xiangyun and Baochai went back to pack their things while Madam You took her leave of Li Wan and went straight to the old ladys place. She found her sitting on her couch listening to Lady Wangs disturbing account of how tJia Zhen family had got into trouble, had their property confiscated and been fetched to the capital for punishment. She asked Madam You where she had come from and if Xifeng and Li Wan were any better. Theyre both better today, Madam You made haste to assure her.
Better wait for the first fall of snow and then ask her to a snow party. We'll have more fun ourselves too, writing poems in the snow. "Writing poems in the snow?" put in Daiyu mockingly. "I don't think that would be half as much fun as building a woodpile and having a campfire in the snow." Baochai and the others laughed, while Baoyu flashed a glance at Daiyu but said nothing. As soon as the party broke up, he quietly took Granny Liu aside to ask her who the girl in her story was. This forced the old woman to improvise again. "In the fields just north of our village there stands a small shrine," she said. "It wasn't built for any god or Buddha, but there was once a gentleman ...." She stopped to think of a name. "Never mind," said Baoyu. "Names don't matter, just tell me the story." "This gentleman had no son, only one daughter called Mingyu," continued Granny Liu. "She could read and write and was her parent's most precious treasure, but when she reached the age of seventeen the poor girl fell ill and died...." Baoyu stamped his foot and sighed. "What happened afterwards?" he asked. "Her parents were so heartbroken that they built this shrine, had an effigy made of the girl, and kept someone there to burn incense and keep the lamp burning. That was many years ago. Those people are dead now, the temple is in ruins, and a spirit has taken possession of the effigy." "It's not that a spirit's taken possession of it," he retorted quickly. "The rule is that people of this kind are immortal." "You don't say! Gracious Buddha! If you hadn't told me, I'd have sworn it was magic. She often takes human form to roam about through the villages, farmsteads and highways, and it was she who took that firewood. In our village they're talking of smashing up this image and razing the shrine to the ground." "Don't let them do that!" urged Baoyu hastily. "It would be a great sin to destroy that shrine." "I'm glad you told me, sir," said Granny Liu. "When I go back tomorrow I'll stop them." "My grandmother and my mother are both charitable people. In fact, our whole family, old and young, like to do good deeds and give alms and they take the greatest delight in building temples and having images made. So tomorrow I'll draw up a subscription notice to collect donations for you. When enough contributions have come in, you can take charge of repairing the shrine and restoring the image, and every month I'll give you money for incense. Wouldn't that be a good thing?" "If you do that I'll have a few cash to spend too, all thanks to this young lady!" Baoyu then asked her the name of the district and village, how far it was there and back, and just where the shrine stood. She made up answers at random but he believed her, and on his return to his room he spent the whole night thinking the matter over. The next morning, as soon as it was light, he sent Mingyan with several hundred cash to find the place described by Granny Liu and bring him back a clear report so that he could make further plans. Baoyu waited hour after hour for Mingyan's return, as frantic as an ant on a hot pan. He waited and waited till sunset, when his page came back looking very pleased with himself. "Did you find it?" demanded Baoyu eagerly. "You must have got it wrong, Master Bao. You led me a fine dance," replied Mingyan, smiling. "It's not where you said, and the name's different too. So it took me a whole day to track it down. Then I found a tumbledown temple in the fields to the northeast." Baoyu beamed with joy. "Granny Liu's old," he said. "Her memory probably plays tricks with her. Well, what did you find? Go on!" "The temple gate faces south all right, and the place is tumbling down. I was fed up with hunting for it, and as soon as I saw it I said to myself, 'At last!' I marched straight in. One look at the image, though, made me take to my heels - it's so fearfully lifelike!" "She can take human form, so naturally she looks lifelike," replied Baoyu cheerfully. "But it isn't a girl." Mingyan clapped his hands together. "It's blue -faced and red-haired -- the God of Plague!" "You useless fool," swore Baoyu in disgust.
In this packet are eight taels of silver. All these are presents from our mistress. These two packets of fifty taels each, a hundred in all, are a present from Lady Wang who wants you to start a small business or buy some land with it, so that in future you dont have to appeal to friends for help. Then, smiling, she said in a low voice, These two tunics and this skirt, four headscarfs and packet of embroidery silks are from me, granny. The clothes may not be new, but they havent been worn much. Still, if you turn up your nose at them, I shant complain. Granny Liu had exclaimed Gracious Buddha! at each item mentioned, until she must have invoked Buddha hundreds of times. Now, finding Pinger so generous and so modest too, she protested with a smile How can you say such a thing, miss? Who am I to turn up my nose at such fine things? Things money wouldnt buy, even if I had any. I just feel ashamed to take so much, and yet since youre so generous, miss, I must. Dont talk as if we were strangers, chuckled Pinger. I wouldnt presume like this if we werent good friends. So dont have any scruples about accepting. Ive a favour to ask you too. Next New Year I want you to bring us some of your dried vegetables cabbage, string-beans, lentil, egg-plant and gourds. All of us here, high and low, enjoy such things. Thatll be quite enough, dont trouble to bring anything else. Granny Liu agreed to this with a thousand thanks. Off to bed with you now, Pinger urged her. Ill pack everything up for you and put it here. First thing tomorrow Ill get some boys to order a carriage and load this on for you, so that you dont have to worry about a thing. More grateful than ever, Granny Liu went back to thank Xifeng effusively and take her leave of her. She spent the night in the Lady Dowagers apartments, meaning to say goodbye to the old lady as soon as she was up the next day. But since the Lady Dowager was unwell, the whole family came the next morning to ask after her health, and a doctor was sent for. Soon a maid announced his arrival and an old nurse stepped forward to draw the bed-curtains. Im an old woman, said the Lady Dowager. Old enough to be his mother. Why should I be afraid of his laughing at me? Leave the curtains as they are, he can see me like this. The maids moved a small table up to the bed, put a tiny cushion on it and sent to invite the doctor in. Presently ha Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong led Doctor Wang over. Not presuming to walk up the central ramp, he took the side steps up the terrace behind Jia Zhen. Two serving-women had the portiere raised and two others ushered him in, while Baoyu came out to greet him. The Lady Dowager in a blue silk tunic lined with a curly sheepskin was seated on the couch. On either side stood two short-haired young maids holding whisks, rinse-bowls and the like, while ranged beside them were half a dozen old nurses and behind the green gauze screen the doctor glimpsed other figures wearing gay silks and trinkets set with precious stones and pearls. Lowering his head, he advanced to pay his respects. The Lady Dowager saw from his robes of the sixth official rank that this was one of the Imperial physicians. With a smile she greeted him, then asked Jia Zhen What is this gentlemans honourable name? Wang. In the old days, she said, the director of the Academy of Imperial Physicians. Wang Junxiao, was an excellent diagnostician. Wang bowed and, his head lowered, rejoined with a smile, He was my great-uncle. So our families are old friends. With these words she slowly placed one hand on the cushion. An old nurse put a low stool slightly to one side of the table and Doctor Wang, sitting respectfully on the edge of the stool, bent one knee to lean over the couch. He felt both her pulses in turn for some length of time, his head inclined meditatively, after which he rose with a bow, his head lowered, to take his leave. Thank you for your trouble, said the Lady Dowager. Zhen, take the doctor to the study and see that he gets some tea. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, quick to obey her instructions, conducted the doctor to the study outside. There he told them, There is nothing wrong with the old lady except a slight chill.
Lets see whether it rises to the bait, said one girl it sounded like Li Wen. Good, its gone! laughed Tanchun. I knew it wouldnt rise. Thats right, cousin. Dont move, just wait, and its bound to surface. -386 Here it comes! The last two speakers were Li Qi and Xing Xiuyan. Baoyu could not resist picking up a stone and tossing it into the pool. The splash it made startled the four girls. Whos this practical joker? they cried. Giving us such a fright! He bounded out laughingly then from behind the rockery. Youre having such a good time why didnt you let me know? I knew it couldnt be anyone else, said Tanchun. Only Second Brother would play such a trick. All right, to make up for that you must catch us some fish. One was rising to the bait just now, but before we could hook it you frightened it away. You enjoy yourselves here, leaving me out, he chuckled. By rights I should penalize you! They all laughed at that. Lets all fish to try our luck, proposed Baoyu. Whoever catches a fish will have good luck this year. Whoever doesnt will have bad luck. Wholl start? Tanchun urged Li Wen to take the lead, but she declined. In that case Ill start off. Tanchun turned to Baoyu. If you drive away my fish again, Second Brother, I shant let you off! I was trying to scare you for fun just then. But you can go ahead now, he assured her. Tanchun cast the line and, in less time than it takes to say ten sentences, a minnow swallowed the bait and the float bobbed down. With a swing of the rod she landed the little fish alive and thrashing. Shishu grabbed for it on the ground, then with both hands dropped it into a small porcelain jar filled with clear water. Tanchun passed the rod to Li Wen, who cast in turn. When the line twitched she raised the rod, but there was nothing on the hook. She cast again, but when presently the line tautened again and she pulled it in she once more drew a blank. She examined the hook then, and found it was bent inwards. No wonder I caught nothing, she said with a smile, then told Suyun to adjust the hook and bait it with another worm on which a reed had been fixed. Not long after she cast, the reed submerged, and she hastily landed a tiny carp two inches long. Now its your turn, Cousin Baoyu, she said with a smile. Let the other two girls try first, he urged. Xiuyan said nothing, but Li Qi demurred. No, Cousin Bao, you try first. Stop deferring to each other! cried Tanchun, who had just seen a bubble on the water. Look, the fish have all gone over to your side. Go on! Li Qi took the rod then and very soon made a catch. When Xiuyan had followed suit and returned the rod to Tanchun, she handed it to Baoyu. Im going to fish like hang Taigong, 1 he announced as he walked down the stone steps and sat down by the pool. But his reflection frightened the fish away. Though he waited there a long time holding the rod, the line still did not move. And when bubbles rose from one side of the pool, he swung his rod there so fast that the fish made off quickly. Im impatient but theyre slow coaches! What shall I do? Good fish, come quick to my rescue! he exclaimed so frantically that the four girls laughed. While Baoyu was still talking, the line twitched. In delight, he yanked so hard that the rod knocked against a rock and broke into two. The line snapped as well, so that the hook was lost. A roar of laughter went up. Ive never seen anyone so clumsy! teased Tanchun. Just then Sheyue hurried towards them, in a great fluster. The old ladys woken, Master Bao, she cried. She wants you to go there at once. This startled all five of them. What does she want him for? Tanchun inquired. I dont know, the maid answered. I heard say some scandals come to light and she wants to ask Baoyu about it. Shes going to question Madam Lian as well. Baoyu was petrified. Which maid is going to catch it this time? he wondered. Weve no idea what its all about, said Tanchun. Youd better go immediately, Second Brother. If theres any news, send Sheyue to let us know. Then the four girls went off.
I was puzzling over this when a few nuns turned up. I realized they must have come with an alms list, or to make their annual requests for donations or incense money. So many people apply to our Old Ancestress just before New Year, I knew youd run away to avoid being dunned. Now Ive come to report to our Old Ancestress Your duns have gone, you can come out of hiding. Ive some very tender pheasant ready. So please come back for dinner. If you leave it any later, itll be overcooked. Amid the general merriment that followed, and before the old lady could make any retort, Xifeng ordered her sedan-chair. The Lady Dowager mounted it with Xifengs help, in smiling acquiescence, and was carried through the east gate of the covered walk, chatting with the rest of the party. All about lay snow, soft as powder, bright as silver. And suddenly, at the top of a slope, they saw Baoqin in the cape of wild ducks down, with a maid behind her carrying a vase of red plum-blossom. So there she is! they cried laughingly. No wonder two people were missing. Shes got herself some plum-blossom as well. Just look! exclaimed the old lady in delight. This snowy slope matched with a girl like her, in that costume too, and with plum-blossom in the background what does it remind you of? Its like Qiu Yings t painting The Beauty in Snow which hangs in your room, madam, some of them answered. The Lady Dowager shook her head. No, the girl in that painting hasnt a costume like hers, and she isnt a patch on Baoqin for looks, either. Even as she spoke, someone in a red felt cape stepped out from behind Baoqin. Which of the girls is that? asked the old lady. All the girls are here, they told her. Thats Baoyu. My eyes are failing, she sighed. While talking they had drawn level with Baoyu and Baoqin. Smilling, Baoyu told Baochai, Daiyu and the rest, Just now I went back to Green Lattice Nunnery, and Miaoyus given you each a spray of plum-blossom. Theyve already been sent to your rooms. As they thanked him for going to such trouble, they left the Garden and made their way to the Lady Dowagers quarters. They were chatting there after dinner when Aunt Xue arrived. I havent come over to see you all day because of this heavy snow, she told the old lady. Are you in low spirits, madam? You should have gone out to enjoy the snowy landscape. What makes you think Im feeling low? I went out and amused myself for a while with the girls. Last night I was thinking of asking my sister for the use of the Garden for one day, to invite you to a simple meal so as to enjoy the snow. But I found youd gone to bed early, and as Baochai told me you werent feeling too well I didnt like to bother you. If Id known, I should have invited you. Its only the tenth month, and this is the first fall of snow this winter, rejoined the old lady. Youll have plenty of chances to treat us later on. I hope so, said Aunt Xue. That will give me an opportunity to show my respect. Mind you dont forget, aunt! cried Xifeng playfully. Why not weigh out fifty taels of silver now and give it to me to keep? Then as soon as it snows again, Ill prepare the feast. Thatll save you trouble and the danger of forgetting. The Lady Dowager chuckled. Yes, just give her fifty taels, she said to Aunt Xue, and well take half each. When it snows, Ill excuse myself on the pretext of illness, so as to save you trouble, while Xifeng and I reap all the benefit. Xifeng clapped her hands. Excellent! Just what I was thinking. General laughter greeted this sally. Bah! For shame! exclaimed the Lady Dowager. Youve always got an eye to the main chance. Aunt Xue is our guest and its we who should be inviting her, instead of neglecting her so badly. How can we let her spend money on us? Yet instead of issuing an invitation, you have the nerve to ask for fifty taels. Youve no sense of shame at all. No ones as shrewd as our Old Ancestress, commented Xifeng. She was just sounding you out, aunt. If youd really forked up fifty taels, shed have gone halves with me. Now that her scheme doesnt look like coming off, she turns around to shift the blame to me, talking in that high-minded way.
Far simpler if you left." He was so set on telling his mother that Xiren saw no way to stop him. She fell on her knees to plead. This was the signal for Bihen, Qiuwen and Sheyue, who had been listening with bated breath outside, to rush in and kneel down beside her. Baoyu pulled Xiren to her feet, sank with a sigh on to his bed, and sent the other girls out. "What am I to do?" he demanded. "I've worn my heart out, yet nobody cares." He wept and Xiren shed tears in sympathy. Qingwen beside them was trying to speak through her sobs when Daiyu's arrival made her slip away. "What's all this crying during the festival?" asked Daiyu mockingly. "Are you fighting for sticky rice dumplings?" The two of them laughed. "Since you won't tell me I'll find out from her." Daiyu patted Xiren's shoulder. "What's happened, dear sister-in-law? I suppose you two have been squabbling again. Tell me what's wrong and I'll act as peacemaker." "You're joking, miss." Xiren pushed her away. "Don't talk such nonsense to us servant-girls." "You may call yourself a servant-girl, but I regard you as my sister-in-law." "Why give her another name for people to jeer at?" protested Baoyu. "There's enough gossip already without your joining in." "You don't know how I feel, miss," said Xiren. "I'll never have any peace until I can die and be done with it!" "I can't say what others would do if you died." Daiyu smiled. "I'd die first of crying." "I'd become a monk if you died," Baoyu declared. "Do be quiet," cried Xiren. "That's no way to talk." Daiyu held out two fingers with a smile. "That's twice, so far, you've become a monk. I must keep track of how many times you do it." Baoyu knew she was referring to their conversation the other day, and with a smile he let the matter drop. Soon after that Daiyu left and Baoyu received an invitation from Xue Pan, which he could hardly decline, to a drinking party. He was unable to leave before the end. Dusk had fallen by the time he came back, slightly tipsy, and as he lurched into his courtyard he noticed someone lying on a couch there. Assuming that it was Xiren, he sat down beside her and nudged her. "Has the pain stopped?" he asked. The figure on the couch sat up. "Why are you back to plague me again?" she demanded. It was not Xiren but Qingwen. He made her sit beside him. "You're growing more and more spoilt," he teased. "When you dropped that fan and I just said a couple of words, you launched into such a tirade. I don't mind your scolding me, but was it right to drag Xiren into -400 it too when she meant so well?" "It's so hot, keep your hands to yourself," countered Qingwen. "What would people think if they saw? I'm not fit to be sitting here with you anyway. "Then why were you sleeping here?" he asked with a grin. She giggled. "It was all right before you came, but not now that you're here. Get up and let me have my bath. I'll call Xiren and Sheyue -- they've already had theirs." "After all the wine I've drunk I need a bath too. If you've not had yours, fill the tub and we'll bath together." Qingwen waved this proposal aside with a laugh. "Not I.I wouldn't dare. I remember what happened that time Bihen helped you bath. Two or three hours it took and we couldn't go in heaven knows what you were up to. When you'd finished and we had a look, the floor right up to the legs of the bed was all over water -- even the bed mat was sopping. Goodness knows what sort of bath you had! It kept us laughing for days. I haven't the time to mop up after you, and see no need for you to bath with me. Besides, it's so cool now I don't think you ought to have a bath I'll just get you a basin of water to wash your face and comb your hair. Yuanyang brought in a lot of fruit not long ago which is being chilled in that crystal bowl. I'll tell them to bring it for you." "In that case, you mustn't bath either. Just wash your hands and bring the fruit." Qingwen laughed.
Ill get Jia Lian to write an announcement to hang up by the road Baoyu took that day, offering a reward of ten thousand taels to anyone who picked up the jade and returns it, and five thousand to anyone who tells us who has it so that we can get it back. Provided it can be found, we wont stint our silver. In this way were sure to recover it. If we leave it to a few of our household to search, they could search their whole lives long without finding it. Lady Wang dared raise no objection. The old lady had these directions sent to Jia Lian with instructions to see to -this quickly. Next she ordered, Move all the things Baoyu uses every day to my apartments. Xiren and Qiuwen are to come over with him, leaving the other maids there in the Garden to keep an eye on his rooms. All this time Baoyu had said nothing, just grinning foolishly. The Lady Dowager rose then, taking his hand, and Xiren and others helped them out of the Garden. Back in her own quarters, the old lady made Lady Wang sit down to supervise the rooms arrangement. Do you know what I have in mind? she asked. It seems to me there are too few people in the Garden, and those trees in Happy Red Court have withered and blossomed suddenly in a strange way. He used to have this jade to ward off evil spirits now that hes lost it Im afraid he may succumb to some evil influence. Thats why Ive brought him here to stay with me. We wont let him out for a few days. The doctors can come here to see him. Of course youre right, madam, answered Lady Wang. Living with you, such a favourite of fortune, he cant come to any harm. Whos a favourite of fortune? But my rooms are cleaner, and weve plenty of Buddhist scriptures which we can read to calm him. Ask Baoyu if he likes being here or not. But Baoyu only grinned. Not until prompted by Xiren did he say Yes. Seeing this Lady Wang shed tears but could not sob aloud before the old lady. Understanding her anxiety the latter said, You go back now. Ill take care of him. When the master gets back this evening tell him he neednt come here. Just be sure not to complain about this. After Lady Wang had gone, the old lady made Yuanyang get out some tranquillizing medicines and give them to Baoyu according to the prescription. But no more of this. That evening Jia Zheng was coming home by carriage when he heard some passers-by talking. If anyone wants to make a pile, its easy! said one. How? his companion asked. I heard today that some young master in the Rong Mansion has lost a piece of jade, and a notice has been posted up describing its size, shape and colour. Ten thousand taels reward has been offered for its return, and five thousand for news of its whereabouts. Though Jia Zheng had not caught every word distinctly, he had heard enough to hurry home in amazement. The gateman when questioned reported, The first 1 heard of this, sir, was at noon today when Master Lian passed on the old ladys order and sent people to post up a notice. Our family must be on the decline! Jia Zheng sighed. For our sins weve been saddled with this degenerate. At the time of his birth he was the talk of the town, but after ten years and more the gossip died down. Now were raising this hue and cry again to find his jade preposterous! He hurried inside to question Lady Wang, who told him the whole story. As this had been done on his mothers instructions, Jia Zheng could not oppose it. He just vented his anger briefly on his wife before going out again to order the notice to be taken down without the old ladys knowledge. However, some idlers had already -made off with it. A few days later, a man came to the Rong Mansion claiming to have brought back the jade. In great jubilation the servants at the gate said, Hand it over and well go and report it for you. The fellow reached in his pocket for the notice, pointing at it for them to see. Wasnt this put up by your house? he asked. It says clearly here that whoever returns the jade will get a reward of ten thousand silver taels. I may look poor now to you gentlemen, but once I have that silver I shall be rich so dont be so high-handed! He spoke with such confidence that the gateman answered, Well then, just show me the jade so that I can report this for you. At first the man was unwilling, but on second thoughts he produced the jade and displayed it in the palm of-one hand.
No wonder she mistook it for cicada-wing gauze. As a matter off act, the two are so alike that those not in the know always mix them up. Its proper name is soft-mist silk." "What a charming name," cried Xifeng. "I've seen hundreds of kinds of silk, but never heard of this one." "How long have you lived?" retorted the old lady. "How many rarities have you seen? What have you to brag about? This soft-mist silk comes in four colours only light blue , russet, pine- green and pink . Used for bed-curtains or window gauze, from a distance it looks like smoke or mist -- that's how it got its name. The pink 's also called rosy-cloud gauze. Even the Imperial gauze used in the Palace today isn't so soft and fine." "I'm not surprised Xifeng hadn't seen it before," interposed Aunt Xue. "I'd never even heard of it either." By now a roll had been fetched on Xifeng's instructions. "That's it!" exclaimed the Lady Dowager. "We used it first just for windows, then found it was good for quilts and bed-curtains too. You must get some more out tomorrow and screen the windows here with some of the pink ." Xifeng promised to attend to this while the whole party admired the material. As for Granny Liu, her eyes were nearly popping out of her head. "Gracious Buddha!" she gasped. "We couldn't afford to make clothes of this. It seems a shame to use it for windows." "Clothes of this don't look well," said the Lady Dowager. Xifeng promptly showed them the lapel of the red gauze tunic she was wearing, saying, "Look at this tunic of mine." "Very nice too," said the Lady Dowager and Aunt Xue. "This is made nowadays for the Palace. Still, it can't compare with the other." "You mean to say this shoddy stuff is made for the Imperial use?" exclaimed Xifeng. "Why, it's not even up to the gauze made for officials." "We must see if there's any more of the blue ," said the Lady Dowager. "If there is, give a couple of rolls to Granny Liu to make a bed curtain. What's left can be matched with some lining and made into lined sleeveless jackets for the maids. Don't leave it there to be spoiled by the damp." Xifeng agreed, and had the stuff put away. Then the Lady Dowager rose to her feet. "Let's stroll on," she suggested. "Why should we stay cooped up here?" Invoking Buddha again, Granny Liu remarked "Everyone says 'The great live in great houses.' When I saw your room yesterday, madam, it was a grand sight with all those big cases, big wardrobes, big tables and big bed. The wardrobes alone are bigger and higher than one of our whole rooms. No wonder you keep that ladder in the back yard. I couldn't think at first what it was for, as you don't sun things on the roof. Then I saw it must be for opening the tops of wardrobes to take things out or put them in, for without a ladder how could you get up? But this small room is even better furnished than that big one, with all these fine things -- whatever they're called -- in it. The more I see of it, the less I want to leave." "I'll show you better places than this," promised Xifeng. Upon leaving Bamboo Lodge they saw a punting party out on the lake. "Since they've got the boats ready, we may as well go aboard," suggested the Lady Dowager. They were on their way to Purple Caltrop Isle and Smartweed Bank when they met several matrons carrying multicoloured lacquered hampers inlaid with gilt designs. Xifeng at once asked Lady Wang where they should breakfast. "Wherever the old lady chooses," was the reply. The Lady Dowager, hearing this, called over her shoulder to Xifeng, "Your third cousin's place is pleasant. Take some people there to get it ready while we go by boat." Then Xifeng turned back with Li Wan, Tanchun, Yuanyang and Hupo, accompanied by the attendants with the food. Having taken a short cut to the Studio of Autumn Freshness, they arranged the tables in Morning Emerald Hall. Yuanyang remarked with a chuckle, "We often say that when the gentlemen feast outside they've someone who can raise a laugh to entertain them. Today we've a female entertainer too." Li Wan was too good-natured to catch on, but Xifeng knew that Granny Liu was meant.
"What have we to boast about? I'm afraid her family may think us too poor." "Now that your husband has been entrusted with a mission, your for- tunes will not only be restored you're bound to prosper even more than before." "I only hope so," replied Lady Zhen with a smile. "In that case, I beg you to be the go-between." When they started discussing his marriage Zhen Baoyu had taken his leave, and Baoyu escorted him back to the outer study where Jia Zheng had returned. They stood talking there for a while until the Zhens' servant announced that his mother was leaving and wanted him to go home. Jia Zheng told the three boys to see him out. No more of this. To revert to Baoyu, ever since he had met Zhen Baoyu's father and learned that his son was coming to the capital, he had been longing to meet him, sure that he would prove a kindred spirit. However, their talk had shown him that they were as incompatible as ice and charcoal. He went back dejectedly to his own quarters to brood in gloomy silence. "Is that Zhen Baoyu really like you?" Baochai asked him. "In looks, yes but judging by the way he talks he doesn't have much understanding. He's just a place-seeker of the lowest sort." "There you go running people down again! How can you be sure of that?" "He talked and talked but said not a word about seeking for truth, just holding forth on scholarship and the management of affairs, as well as loyalty and filial piety. Isn't such a person a toady? It's too bad that we look alike! The thought of him makes me wish I could change my looks!" As this sounded nonsensical to Baochai, she said, "The way you talk is really laughable! How can you change your looks? Besides, he was quite right. A man should establish himself and make a name. Who else is as soft and sentimental as you? Yet instead of admitting your weak character you call other people place-seekers." Baoyu had been thoroughly exasperated by Zhen Baoyu's homily, and this rebuff from Baochai rankled still more. His dejection made his old illness flare up again, and instead of answering he grinned inanely. Baochai, not knowing the reason, thought he was scoffing at her to show disapproval and therefore paid no attention. But that day he was so distracted that when Xiren and others teased him, he said nothing. The next morning he got up looking as vacant and stupid as during his past de rangement. Since Xichun was set on cutting off her hair and becoming a nun and Madam You was unable to talk her round, it seemed that unless they let her have her way she would commit suicide. Though she was under constant watch that did not solve the problem. So one day Lady Wang reported this to Jia Zheng. Her husband stamped his foot. "What has our East Mansion done to be reduced to this?" he sighed. Sending for Jia Rong to admonish him, he told him to get his mother to have a serious talk with Xichun. "If she insists on this course, she'll no longer be a daughter of our house," he warned. However, Madam You's exhortations only made Xichun more eager to kill herself. "As a girl, I can't stay with the family all my life," she said. "If my marriage proved like Second Sister's, the master and mistress would have more cause to worry, and besides she died too in the end. So if you have any real affection for me, just count me as dead and let me become a nun to live a clean life. Especially as I don't have to leave the house. Green Lattice Nunnery is in our own grounds and I can practise my devotions there, while if I need anything you can see to it. Miaoyu's maids are still there too now. If you'll agree to this you'll be saving my life if you don't, I have no option but to die and be done with it! If I can have my wish, when my brother comes back I shall explain to him that you didn't force me to do this but if I die he's bound to think it was you who drove me to it." Madam You, who had always been on bad terms with Xichun, felt there was reason in this argument and went off to report it to Lady Wang but the latter had gone to Baochai's apartments. Horrified to find Baoyu out of his mind, Lady Wang reprimanded Xiren, "How careless you all are! Why didn't you tell me that Baoyu was ill again?" "This illness of his is chronic," replied Xiren.
She thought, No wonder Miss Baochai dared not get too close to him. I lacked her foresight. And no wonder Miss Lin keeps quarrelling with him and crying for rage. He must keep teasing her too. Id better steer clear of him. So after that she seldom went into the Garden. Xue Pans marriage kept her busy every day. She imagined his new wife would protect her and share her responsibilities, enabling her to lead a quieter life. And having heard that this young lady was talented as well as beautiful, she assumed she must be refined and gentle too. She was therefore ten times more eager even than Xue Pan for her arrival. Finally the day came when the bride arrived, and she began waiting hand and foot on her new mistress. Now this Miss Xia, who had just turned seventeen, was quite good-looking and had some education. As regards ability and craftiness, she took after Xifeng. In one respect only had she been unlucky. Because her father had died when she was a child, and she had no brothers either, her widowed mother had spoilt this only daughter, doting on her and falling in with all her whims. Inevitably, this over-indulgence had made her like the brigand Dao Zhi of old she had as high an opinion of herself as if she were a goddess, and treated others like dirt. In appearance pretty as a flower, at heart she was a termagant. At home she had vented her temper on her maids, for ever cursing them or beating them. Now that she was married, she felt it incumbent on her to behave as the mistress of the house, not with the gentle shyness befitting a girl she must show her authority to keep others under her thumb. In view, moreover, of Xue Pans pig-headed pride and extravagance, she decided she must strike while the iron was hot and tame him completely, or she would never be able to have her own way. Moreover, the presence of such a charming and talented concubine as Xiangling had filled her with the same resolve as the First Emperor of Song 2 when he decided to wipe out the Prince of Southern Tang, demanding, 3 How can I let another sleep alongside my bed? As her family owned so many osmanthus trees, she had been given 2433 the pet name Jingui Golden Osmanthus so she forebade the whole household to use these two words. Any maid careless enough to slip up and do so was severely beaten and punished. Then, realizing the impossibility of banning any reference to osmanthus, she decided to give the flower a new name and recalling the story of the osmanthus and the Moon Goddess, 4 she changed the name of the flower to moon-goddess flower to add to her own dignity in this way. Now Xue Pan was a man who would discard the old as soon as he had something new, and one who looked tough but lacked stamina. Pleased with his new wife at the start, he humoured her. And Xia Jingui observing this tried to control him more strictly step by step. For the first month they were on equal terms after two months Xue Pan began to give ground. One day after drinking he consulted her on something he wished to do and, when she would not hear of it, losing his temper he made an angry retort then went ahead and did it. Then Jingui cried as if she were demented, refused all food and pretended to be ill. The doctor summoned to see her said She has anger in her blood and should take some tranquillizing medicine. Aunt Xue berated her son. Youre a married man now and will soon have a son of your own, yet youre still such a fool! she fumed. She was brought up like a young phoenix, a daughter as delicate as a flower and her family agreed to let you have her, thinking you a gentleman. Yet instead of keeping yourself in check, behaving yourself and living peacefully, you act like an oaf and bully her in your cups. Youll have to suffer for it and spend money now on medicine. Xue Pan, filled with remorse by these reproaches, went in to comfort his wife. But Jingui, delighted to have her mother-in-law take her side, behaved still more arrogantly in her gratification at this and out-manoeuvred him by simply ignoring him. Not knowing what to do, he had to lump it. And it took him nearly a fortnight to mollify her. After that Xue Pan took greater pains not to provoke her, and inevitably this humbled him still more. Seeing that her husband was lowering his colours and her mother-in-law was good-natured, Jingui pressed her at- 2435 tack by degress. At first she simply kept Xue Pan under her thumb later she tried artfully to control Aunt Xue as well, and Baochai too.
Actually, because Baochai and Xiren had not slept the night before and today had been a busy day for them both, they had slept through the conversation. The sound in the courtyard made them wake with a start and prick up their ears, but nothing more could they hear. Baoyu in bed wondered, "Could Cousin Lin have come? Maybe hearing me talk she decided to give us a fright." He tossed and turned, giving way to foolish fancies, not falling into a troubled sleep till dawn. Because Baoyu had fooled about with her half the night and then Baochai had coughed, Wuer had a guilty conscience and was afraid her mistress had overheard them. Filled with misgivings she could not sleep all night. When she got up the next morning, as Baoyu was still dead to the world she tidied the room. "Why get up so early?" Sheyue asked. "Couldn't you sleep last night?" Suspecting from this that Sheyue knew what had happened, Wuer 5 miled sheepishly and made no reply. I'resently Baochai and Xiren got up too. When they opened the door and saw Baoyu still slumbering, they Wondered how he had managed to sleep so soundly the last two nights outside. Baoyu woke to find them all up. He sat up quickly, rubbing his eyes, and thought back. No, he had not drearned last night either. So it must be tiue that "The ways of immortals and mortals never meet." Getting slowly out of bed he recalled Wuer's remark during the night that both Baochai and Xiren were as pretty as goddesses. Indeed they were! He stared at Baochai as if stunned. She assumed he was thinking of Daiyu, but could not tell whether he had dreamed of her or not. Put out by his stare she asked "Did you meet a goddess last night?" Imagining that she must have overheard them he faltered, "What do you mean?" Wuer, too conscience-stricken to speak, waited for Baochai to go on. "Did you hear Master Bao talk with someone in his sleep?" Baochai asked her with a smile, making Baoyu beat a discomfited retreat. Red in the face, Wuer mumbled, "He did say something I couldn't catch it clearly in the first part of the night. Something about 'getting a bad name' and 'not committing herself.' I couldn't made it out and begged Master Bao to sleep. Then I fell asleep myself, so I don't know whether he said anything more. Baochai lowered her head and thought, "He obviously had Daiyu in mind. If we let him stay outside, he may get more deranged and some flower fairy or tree spirit may take possession of him. Besides, his illness was brought on by his strong feeling for her. If only there were some way to divert his affection to me, he'd get over it." At this idea, she blushed up to her ears and went sheepishly back to her room to do her hair. The old lady's improved spirits these last two days had made her overeat, and that evening she was out of sorts. The next day her chest felt constricted however, she would not let Yuanyang report this to Jia Zheng. "I've been rather greedy these two days and had too much to eat," she said. "Missing a meal will set me right. Don't make a fuss about it." So Yuanyang and the others kept quiet. When Baoyu went home that evening, Baochai had just come back from paying her respects to the old lady and Lady Wang. The sight of her reminded him of her remarks that morning, making him rather ashamed. Seeing how put out he looked and knowing what a sentimentalist he was, she decided to use his infatuation to cure him. "Are you going to sleep outside again tonight?" she asked. "Outside or inside it's all the same to me," he answered glumly. She wanted to say more but could not get the words out. "Well, just what does that mean?" asked Xiren. "I don't believe you slept so well outside." Wuer seized this chance to add, "When Master Bao sleeps outside, the only snag is that he talks in his sleep in a way we can't understand, yet we dare not talk back." "I'll move my bed outside tonight to see whether I talk in my sleep or not," said Xiren. "You two move Master Bao's bedding back to the inner room." Baochai said nothing. Baoyu, too ashamed to argue, let them move his bedding inside. Now Baoyu in his contrition wanted to set Baochai's mind at rest, while she, for fear lest longing might drive him distracted, thought it best to show affection to win him over to take Daiyu's place in his heart.
Lady Xing promptly sent for Wenxiangs wife and told her what she proposed. Young Mrs. Jin was of course only too pleased and went off jubilantly to find Yuanyang, sure that her mission would meet with instant success. Instead, she was denounced to her face by Yuanyang and snubbed by Xiren and Pinger into the bargain. She returned, angry and discomfited, to report to Lady Xing, Its no use, she just swore at me. Since Xifeng was present she dared not mention Pinger, but she added, Xiren joined in her attack on me and talked a whole lot of other nonsense too, which doesnt bear repeating. You had better persuade Lord She to buy another girl, madam. That little bitch isnt cut out for such great fortune, nor are we for such good luck. What has this to do with Xiren? asked Lady Xing. How did she come to hear of it? Who else was there? Miss Pinger was there too. Xifeng promptly interposed, Why didnt you slap her face? Every time I go out, off she goes to amuse herself. When I got home today there was no sign of her. I suppose she took Yuanyangs side too? Miss Pinger wasnt there on the spot, replied Mrs. Jin. It looked like her from a distance, but I may have been mistaken. That was just my guess. Xifeng ordered a servant, Go and fetch Pinger, quick. Tell her Im back and Her Ladyship is here too. Shes wanted for something. Fenger hastily stepped forward to put in, Miss in sent a maid with a note several times to invite her over, so finally she went. As soon as you came back, madam, I went to fetch her, but Miss Lin asked me to tell you shed like to keep her for a little, madam. Every day she seems to want her for something or other, remarked Xifeng, then let the matter drop. As there was nothing more Lady Xing could do, she went home after dinner and told her husband that evening what had happened. Jia She thought the matter over, then summoned Jia Lian. We have other caretakers besides the Jins in Nanjing, he said. Send at once to have Jin Cai recalled. According to the last letter from Nanjing, Jin Cai has had a stroke, sir, replied his son. Money for his coffin has already been issued there, and for all we know he may already be dead. Even if hes still living hell be in a coma, so it wouldnt be any use sending for him. And his old wife is deaf. Jia She swore. You scurvy scoundrel ! he fumed. Quite a know-all, arent you? Get out! In consternation Jia ian promptly withdrew. Soon he heard the order given to fetch Jin Wenxiang. He himself remained on call in the outside study, daring neither to go home nor to confront his father. Presently Wenxiang arrived and some pages ushered him through the inner gate. He was with Lord She for the space of five or six meals, and after he left Jia Lian did not venture to ask what had been said. Not until late that evening, having ascertained that his father was asleep, did he finally go home where Xifeng cleared up the whole mystery for him. As for Yuanyang, she passed a sleepless night. The next day her brother came and asked the Lady Dowagers permission to take her home for a rest. The old lady agreed and told her to go. This was not what Yuanyang wanted but she complied reluctantly in order not to arouse the old ladys suspicions. Her brother told her what Lord She had said and what dignity she would have as his secondary wife. However, Yuanyang refused to consider it. Unable to change her mind, he had to go back and report this to Jia She. Jia She flew into a rage. Tell your wife to tell her this from me, he fumed. Tell her these are my own words. From of old, young nymphs have preferred youth to age. She must think me too old for her. I daresay she has set her heart on one of the young masters, most likely Baoyu or possibly my son. If thats her scheme, tell her to forget it. For if she refuses me, who else will dare take her later? Thats the first thing. The second is this if shes counting on the old ladys partiality to her to find some decent husband outside, shed better think again. For no matter whom she marries shell still be within my reach, unless she dies or remains single all her life, in which case there is nothing I can do.
"I don't care who you are," she said crossly. "Master Bao's given orders that no one's to be admitted." Rooted indignantly to the spot and tempted to let fly at her, Daiyu reflected, "Although my aunt's house is a second home to me, I'm after all an outsider here. With both my parents dead, I've no one to turn to except this family. It would be foolish to start a real rumpus." As she thought thus, tears ran down her cheeks. She was wondering whether or not to go back when the sound of talk and laughter inside -- she distinguished the voices of Baoyu and Baochai -- upset her even more. She thought back then to the events of the morning. "Baoyu must be angry with me, thinking I told on him," she reflected. "But I never did! You ought to investigate before flying into a temper like this. You can shut me out today, but shall we not see each other still tomorrow?" The more she thought, the more distressed she felt. Oblivious of the cold dew on the green moss and the chill wind on the path, standing under the blossom by tile corner of the wall she gave way to sobs. And the sound of this beauty's weeping -- for Daiyu was the loveliest creature ever seen -- made the birds fly away from their roosts on the willows and flowering trees, unable to bear her distress. Truly -694 The hearts of the flowers were broken, The birds were woken from their senseless dreams. The reason is told in these lines -694 Peerless the beauty and talent of this girl Wrapped in scent from embroidered curtains come alone Before her first sob dies away Flowers strew the ground, the affrighted birds have flown. As Daiyu was sobbing to herself the gate creaked open. If you want to know who came out, read the next chapter. Chapter 27 Baochai Chases a Butterfly to Dripping Emerald Pavillon Daiyu Weeps over Fallen Blossom by the Tomb of Flowers As Daiyu was weeping, the gate creaked open and out came Baochai escorted by Baoyu, Xiren and other maids. Daiyu was tempted to accost Baoyu, but not wanting to embarrass him in public she stepped aside until Baochai had left and the others had gone in, when she came back and shed more tears before the closed gate. Then she went back in low spirits to her room and prepared listlessly for bed. Zijuan and Xueyan knew their young mistress' ways. She would often sit moodily frowning or sighing over nothing or, for no apparent reason, would give way to tong spells of weeping. At first they had tried to comfort her, imagining that she missed her parents and home or that someone had been unkind but as time went by and they found this was her habit they paid little further attention. So tonight they withdrew to bed, leaving her to brood by herself. Daiyu leaned against her bed-rail, clasping her knees. Her eyes were brimming with tears. There she stayed motionless as a statue, not lying down until after the second watch. The next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month, the Festival of Grain in Ear. It was the time-honoured custom on this day to offer all manner of gifts and a farewell feast to the God of Flowers, for this festival was said to mark the beginning of summer when all the blossom had withered and the God of flowers had to resign his throne and be seen off. As this custom is most faithfully observed by women, all the inmates of Grand View Garden rose early that day. The girls used flowers and osiers to weave small sedan-chairs and horses, or made pennants and flags of silk and gauze which they tied with gay ribbons to every tree and flower, turning the whole Garden into a blaze of colour. They decked themselves out so prettily, too, as to put the very flowers and birds to shame. But time forbids us to dwell on that splendid scene. Now Baochai, the three Jia girls, Li Wan and Xifeng were enjoying themselves in the Garden with Xifeng's little daughter as well as Xiangling and the other maids. Only one person was missing, and that was Daiyu. "Why isn't Cousin Lin here?" asked Yingchun. "Surely the lazy creature isn't still sleeping?" "I'll go and rouse her," volunteered Baochai. "The rest of you wait here and I'll soon bring her." She set off instantly for Bamboo Lodge. On the way she met the twelve young actresses headed by Wenguan, who greeted her and chatted for a while. Then Baochai told them how to find the others and, having explained her own errand, followed the winding path towards Daiyu's quarters.
Her dimpled smile is peach-blossom in spring, her blue -black hair a cluster of clouds. Her lips are cherries and sweet the breath from her pomegranate teeth. The curve of her slender waist is snow whirled by the wind. Dazzling her pearls and emeralds and gosling-gold the painted design on her forehead. She slips in and out of the flowers, now vexed, now radiant, and floats over the lake as if on wings. Her mothlike eyebrows are knit yet there lurks a smile, and no sound issues from her lips parted as if to speak as she glides swiftly on lotus feet and, pausing, seems poised for flight. Her flawless complexion is pure as ice, smooth as jade. Magnificent her costume with splendid designs. Sweet her face, compact of fragrance, carved in jade and she bears herself like a phoenix or dragon in flight. Her whiteness? Spring plum-blossom glimpsed through snow. Her purity? Autumn orchids coated with frost. Her tranquility? A pine in a lonely valley. Her beauty? Sunset mirrored in a limpid pool. Her grace? A dragon breasting a winding stream. Her spirit? Moonlight on a frosty flyer. She would put Xi Shi to shame and make Wang Qiang 2 blush. Where was this wonder born, whence does she come? Verily she has no peer in fairyland, no equal in the purple courts of heaven. Who can she be, this beauty? Overjoyed by the apparition of this fairy, Baoyu made haste to greet her with a bow. Sister Fairy, he begged with a smile, do tell me where you are from and whither you are going. I have lost my way. May I beg you to be my guide? My home is above the Sphere of Parting Sorrow in the Sea of Brimming Grief, she answered with a smile. I am the Goddess of Disenchantment from the Grotto of Emanating Fragrance on the Mountain of Expanding Spring in the Illusory Land of Great Void. I preside over romances and unrequited love on earth, the grief of women and the passion of men in the mundane world. The reincarnations of some former lovers have recently gathered here, and so I have come to look for a chance to mete out love and longing. It is no accident that we have met. My realm is not far from here. All I can offer you is a cup of fairy tea plucked by my own hands, a pitcher of fine wine of my own brewing, some accomplished singers and dancers, and twelve new fairy songs called A Dream of Red Mansions. But wont you come with me? Forgetting Keqing in his delight, Baoyu followed the goddess to a stone archway inscribed Illusory Land of Great Void. On either pillar was this couplet -748 When false is taken for true, true becomes false If non-being turns into being, being becomes non-being. Beyond this archway was a palace gateway with the inscription in large characters Sea of Grief and Heaven of Love. The bold couplet flanking this read -823 Firm as earth and lofty as heaven, passion from -846 time immemorial knows no end -823 Pity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to it to requite debts of breeze and moonlight. Well, we , thought Baoyu, I wonder whats meant by passion from time immemorial and debts of breeze and moonlight. From now on Id like to have a taste of these things. Little did he know that by thinking in this way he had summoned an evil spirit into his inmost heart. He followed the goddess through the second gate past two matching halls on both sides, each with its tablet and couplet. He had no time to read them all but noticed the names Board of Infatuation, Board of Jealousy, Board of Morning Tears, Board of Night Sighs, Board of Spring Longing and Board of Autumn Sorrows. May I trouble you, goddess, to show me over these different boards? he asked. They contain the records of the past and future of girls from all over the world, she told him. These may not be divulged in advance to you with your human eyes and mortal frame. But Baoyu would not take no for an answer and at last she yielded to his importunity. Very well then, she conceded. You may go in here and have a look round. Baoyu was overjoyed. He looked up and saw on the tablet the name Board of the Ill-Fated. This was flanked by the couplet -823 They brought on themselves spring grief and autumn anguish -748 Wasted, their beauty fair as flowers and moon.
Wu knew what should be done, and had she been dealing with Xifeng she would have made various suggestions to curry favour, quoting precedents for her to decide between. But as she looked down on Li Wan as a simpleton and Tanchun as only a girl, she said no more, waiting to see what the two of them would do. Tanchun consulted Li Wan, who thought for a moment. The other day when Xirens mother died, I understand she was given forty taels, she said. We can give the same amount. Mrs. Wu promptly assented, took the tally and was about to go off when Tanchun stopped her. Dont go for the money yet, said Tanchun. Ive something to ask you. Some of those old concubines in the old ladys apartments came from outside, some from families serving here. There was a distinction. If a relative of one from our household died, how much was given? How much to one from outside? Give us a couple of examples. When questioned like this, Mrs. Wu could not remember. It doesnt matter, she answered with a smile. Whatever sums given, who would dare to complain? Nonsense! retorted Tanchun pleasantly. I would just as soon give a hundred taels but if I didnt go by the rules, not only would you laugh at me but I shouldnt be able to face the Second Mistress. In that case Ill go and look up the old accounts, offered Mrs. Wu. I cant for the moment remember. Youre an old hand at this, Tanchun pointed out. Yet you claim to have forgotten, so as to make things awkward for us. Do you have to go and look up the accounts when you report to the Second Mistress? If so, Xifeng would count as lenient, not as exacting. Fetch those accounts at once. One more days delay, and instead of blaming you for negligence people will accuse us of incompetence. Mrs. Wu flushed scarlet and hurried out, while the other stewards wives stuck out their tongues in dismay. Then other matters were reported. Soon Mrs. Wu came back with the old accounts. Tanchun, taking them, found that two concubines who had been family servants had received twenty taels apiece, and two from outside forty. Two others from outside had received a hundred taels and sixty taels respectively but it was recorded that this was because the first was allowed an extra sixty to have her parents coffins moved to another province the second was allowed an extra twenty to buy a burial ground. Tanchun showed these items to Li Wan. Give her twenty taels. she ordered Mrs. Wu. And leave these accounts here for us to go through carefully. Mrs. Wu assented and withdrew. Suddenly Concubine Zhao burst in. Li Wan and Tanchun at once asked her to be seated. Everyone in this house tramples on my head. she stormed. I should think you at least, miss, should take my side! She began to sob and snivel as she was speaking. Whom are you accusing, madam? asked Tanchun. I dont understand. Whos trampling on your head? If youll tell me, Ill take your side. Youre the one so whom can I complain to? Tanchun hastily rose to protest, I wouldnt dare. Li Wan also stood up to act as a peacemaker. Sit down, please, and listen to me! cried the concubine. Ive been treated like dirt in this house all these years, though Ive borne you and your brother, and now I rank even lower than Xiren. What face have I got left? Not only me this makes you lose face too. So thats it. Tanchun smiled. As if I dared take the law into my own hands! Sitting down again, she showed Concubine Zhao the account books and read out the items to her. These are the rules handed down by our ancestors, she declared. We all have to abide by them how could I change them? Xiren isnt a special case. If Huan takes a concubine from outside later on, shell naturally rank the same as Xiren. This isnt a question of competing for status, it has nothing to do with face. If someones in our mistress service, I can only go by the rules. The sums given thanks to the kindness of our ancestors and our mistress. If that someone thinks it unfair and is too stupid to know when shes well off, I cant stop her complaining. If our mistress were to give away the whole house, Id get no face from it. If she didnt give a cent, it wouldnt make me lose face either. Take my advice and have a quiet rest while the mistress is out.
Luckily Baochais arrival and the lively conversation that followed it had woken Daiyu up. Just then, a commotion broke out in Baoyus apartments and the three of them pricked up their ears. Its your nanny scolding Xiren, announced Daiyu. Theres nothing wrong with Xiren, yet your nanny is for ever nagging at her. Old age has befuddled her. Baoyu wanted to rush straight over, but Baochai laid a restraining hand on his arm. Dont quarrel with your nurse now. She warned him. Shes a silly old thing, but you should bear with her. I know, said Baoyu, and dashed off. Back in his apartments he found Nanny Li leaning on her cane in the middle of his room and roundly abusing Xiren. Ungrateful slut! she scolded. You owe your position to me, yet there you lie giving yourself such airs on the kang, and wont even look at me when I come in. All you think about is making up to Baoyu, so that he pays no attention to me but does everything you say. A slave girl bought for a few taels of stinking silver, youve turned everything here topsyturvy. If you dont behave, youll be dragged out and married off. Well see whether you can still bewitch Baoyu then. Imagining that Nanny Li was angry with her for lying in bed, Xiren at first explained, Im ill and just starting to perspire, so Id covered up my head and didnt see you, granny. But when the old woman accused her of vamping Baoyu and threatened to have her married off, the injustice of these taunts reduced her to tears. Baoyu overheard this tirade, but there was not much he could do except explain that Xiren was unwell and had just taken medicine. If you dont believe me, he added, ask any of the maids. This only added fuel to the fire. Thats right. Stick up for those vixens of yours. Who am I, after all? his nurse stormed. Which of them am I supposed to ask? Theyll all take your side. Theyre all under Xirens thumb. I know everything that goes on here. Im going to have this out with you in the presence of the old lady and Lady Wang. I suckled you, I raised you but now that you dont need my milk any more, you push me aside and let your maids insult me. She was weeping with rage. By this time Daiyu and Baochai had come over too and they set to work to soothe her. Make some allowances for them, nanny, they urged. Let it blow over. The old woman seized on them to pour out her complaints Qianxues dismissal for drinking a cup of tea, and the business of the junket the previous day.... It was hard to make head or tail of her maundering. Xifeng happened just then to be in the Lady Dowagers apartments totting up the scores after a game. When she heard angry voices she knew that Nanny Li was on the rampage again, working off on Baoyus maids her annoyance over her gambling losses today. She hurried across and pulled the nurse aside. Dont be angry, nanny dear, she said with a smile. Its just after the festival and the old ladys had a happy day. At your age you ought to stop other people from brawling. Dont forget yourself and start a rumpus here which may upset the old lady. Tell me whos been annoying you and Ill have her beaten for you. Now Ive a broiled pheasant in my room, piping hot. Come along and have a drink with me, quick! With these words she tugged the nurse out, calling over her shoulder to her maid, Fenger, bring Nanny Lis cane for her, and a handkerchief to dry her tears. Unable to hold her ground Nanny Li was borne off, lamenting as she went, Im old enough to die and have done with it. But Id sooner forget myself and lose face making a scene like this than put up with the insolence of that dirty bitch. Baochai and Daiyu in the background had been watching how Xifeng handled the situation. Now they laughed and clapped their hands. How lucky that this hurricane sprang up and carried the old creature off! Baoyu nodded and sighed. Goodness only knows how this started. She keeps picking on people who cant defend themselves. I suppose one of the other girls annoyed her yesterday, and she tried to settle scores like this.... The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Qingwen gave a laugh. Were not off our heads, she said. Why should we annoy her? And even if we had, wed have taken the blame ourselves, not shift it to somebody else.
In fact, this combination will have freshness and distinction." "A good idea," agreed Xiangyun. "But how will you introduce the feeling? Give me an example." After a moment's thought Baochai replied, "A Dream of Chrysanthemums for instance." "Of course. I've got one too. How about The Chrysanthemum's Shadow?" "Can do, although of course it's been used before. If we have a fair number of themes we can include it. I've thought of another." "Go on!" -374 "Questioning the Chrysanthemum." "Splendid!" Xiangyun clapped one hand on the table. "I know. How d'you like Seeking Out the Chrysanthemum?" "Good. We may as well think of ten themes and write them out." They ground ink and dipped in the brush. Xiangyun wrote the themes out at Baochai's dictation, and in no time at all they had ten. After reading them through Xiangyun said "Ten doesn't make a set. Let's have twelve while we're about it, like those albums of calligraphy and painting." So Baochai thought up two more, making twelve in all. "In this case let's arrange them in the right order." she said. "Better still!" cried Xiangyun. "We shall have a chrysanthemum album." "We'll start with Thinking of the Chrysanthemum. After thinking of it we seek it out so number two will be visiting the Chrysanthemum. After finding it we plant it so the third will be Planting the Chrysanthemum. After it has been planted and flowers, we face it and enjoy it so four is Facing the Chrysanthemum. To enjoy it further we pick it to put in a vase so five is Displaying the Chrysanthemum. But to bring out its splendour once it is displayed we must write poems about it so six is Writing About the Chrysanthemum. And as a verse must be accompanied by a painting, number seven is Painting the Chrysanthemum. Even though we've been to so much trouble over it, we shan't know all its rare qualities unless we ask questions so eight is Questioning the Chrysanthemum. If the flower seems able to understand, we are so thrilled that we want to get closer to it hence nine is Wearing the Chrysanthemum. "This exhausts all that men can do but, as there still remain certain aspects of the flower which can be described, ten and eleven are The Chrysanthemum's Shadow and A Dream of Chrysanthemum. And we end with The Withered Chrysanthemum to sum up all the emotions expressed before. In this way we shall cover all the fine sights and occupations of autumn." Xiangyun copied out the themes again in this order and read them through once more. "What rhymes shall we decide on?" she asked next. "In general I'm against a hard-and-fast rhyme pattern," replied Baochai. "Why should fine lines be restricted by fixed rhymes? Let's not follow that petty rule but simply set themes. We want everyone to write some fine lines for pleasure, not to make it hard for them." "I quite agree. In this way we should write better. But there are only five of us. Will each of us have to write on all twelve of these subjects?" "No, that would be asking too much. We'll just copy out these themes and stipulate that the seven-character lushi form is to be used. We'll put the notice on the wall tomorrow, and people can choose whichever theme they like. If anyone's able to write on all twelve, well and good but it's all right, too, not to do any. The winner will be the one who writes best and fastest. Once all twelve are done, those who haven't finished must stop and submit to the penalty." Xiangyun agreed to this and, their plans made, the two girls put out the light and went to bed. If you want to know what followed, read the next chapter. Chapter 38 The Queen of Bamboos Wins First Place with Her Poems on Chrysanthemums The Lady of the Alpinia Writes a Satire upon Crabs Having laid their plans Baochai and Xiangyun slept, and the next morning the latter invited the Lady Dowager and others over to enjoy the fragrant osmanthus. "What a delightful, refined idea," said the old lady. "We should take advantage of such an invitation." At noon she took Lady Wang and Xifeng to invite Aunt Xue to accompany them to the Garden, and asked "Which would be the best spot?" "It's up to you to choose, madam," said Lady Wang.
It was so that you dont have to search for the mistresses in charge, if theyre away or too busy to be bothered when you happen to need a little money. In other words, to see that you dont go short. That money obviously isnt meant for cosmetics. But Ive noticed that at least half our sisters attending in the different apartments make these purchases with their own money. I suspect its because the stewards arent supplying them on time, or because what they buy is of a poor quality. So youve noticed that too. Tanchun and Li Wan smiled. The stewards supply us all right, they wouldnt dare stop, but always a few days late. When we hurry them they produce something inferior, goodness knows from where, which we can never use. We still have to buy our own with those two taels. We have to ask the sons of other peoples nurses or brothers to do this they get us what we want. But if we send those servants in charge, they buy the same kind, we cant imagine why. Could it be that they just buy us shop-soiled rejects? Pinger smiled. If the stewards get you that kind and they were to buy something better, of course the stewards would be annoyed and accuse them of trying to do them out of a job, she explained. Thats why they have to do this. Theyd rather offend you ladies than the stewards. But when you send your nurses, no one can complain. Its been worrying me, put in Tanchun, because we spend two lots of money but half the purchases are wasted. That means were spending twice as much as we should. So my first proposal is to stop that monthly allowance to the stewards. Ive another idea too. You went with us to Lai Das house before New Year. How did you think his small garden compared with ours? Its less than half the size and has far fewer trees and flowers. I had a chat with one of their grils, continued Tanchun. I learned to my surprise that its annual produce apart from the flowers they wear and the bamboo shoots, vegetables, fish and prawns they eat has been contracted for by people who pay them at least two hundred taels a year. That was how I first learned that even a snapped lotus leaf or a blade of withered grass is worth money. Truly spoken like a rich young dandy! laughed Baochai. Though sheltered young ladies know nothing about such things, in the course of your studies youve surely read Zhu Xis essay On Not Debasing Oneself ? Of course I have. Just a lot of exhortations and empty talk, I call it. Such things cant really happen. So even Zhu Xis writings are empty talk, are they? retorted Baochai. No, every word there is true. After just two days of managing affairs youve become so mercenary that you accuse Zhu Xi of empty talk! I suppose if you worked outside, where youd profit more by cutting down bigger expenses, youd bring the same accusation against even Confucius! Well-read as you are, countered Tanchun, havent you read Jizi ? 2 Jizi said, Those in a position to seek profit and emolument, or responsible for planning and calculating, may talk like Yao and Shun but disobey the precepts of Confucius and Mencius. Baochai smiled as Tanchun broke off and urged, Go on. Thats all I want to quote. Why should I go on to make fun of myself? Theres nothing useless in this world, and when something has a use its worth money. Id have thought, where a serious matter like this is concerned, you had sense enough to grasp such a self-evident truth. You call us here, put in Li Wan, but instead of talking business the two of you just carry on an academic discussion. This academic discussion has a bearing on our business, replied Baochai. If our small tasks arent guided by principles, theyll get out of hand and sink to the vulgar level of the market-place. After this joking they got down to business. Tanchun reverting to her earlier question said, If we consider our Garden just twice the size of theirs, it should bring in double the profit four hundred taels a year. Of course, it would be petty and unworthy of our family to concentrate solely now on making money. But if a couple of women are assigned to take charge, all the valuable things here wont be squandered its a shame to let them go to waste. Better choose a few of the most reliable old women here who know something about gardening, and let them see to things. We neednt charge them or ask for any rent if they send in some presents every year. In the first place, with people in charge of the flowers and trees, the Garden will naturally improve as time goes on and we shant be called on for sudden emergency measures.
Its not as if you were taking a bribe to let a thief escape! And I see no reason for you to send people over. Why not invite Xiangyun here to stay with you for a few days? Wouldnt that be simpler? Where is she? asked Madam You. I just sent her to find Tanchun and bring her here, so that I can let her know too. That same moment Xiangyun and Tanchun were announced, and after they had been offered seats Baochai explained why she was leaving the Garden. Very good, commented Tanchun. So youll come back when aunties better. And even if you dont, that wont matter either. Thats strange way to talk! exclaimed Madam You. Are we driving our relatives away? Thats the idea. Tanchun smiled mockingly. Better drive them out before getting thrown out by others. In any case, theres no need for relatives to live together all the time. Were a happy family of kith and kin I must say, all like game-cocks fighting to finish each other off. Im certainly out of luck today, Madam You laughed, Finding so many of you girls in a bad temper. Who told you to come and burn yourself on the stove? Tanchun retorted. And who else has offended you? She went on thoughtfully, Xichun has no reason to scold you, so who else could it be? Madam You just muttered an evasive reply. Knowing she was reluctant to speak out for fear of trouble, Tanchun teased, Dont pretend to be so simple. People dont get their heads chopped off except for crimes against the state, so what are you so afraid of? Ill tell you the truth I slapped that old wife of Wang Shanbaos yesterday, and Im quite willing to take the consequences. But apart from calling me names behind my back, nobodys likely to give me a beating for it. Asked by Baochai what had provoked her, Tanchun described in detail the search made the night before and why she had struck Mrs. Wang. Since Tanchun had come out with it, Madam You told them how Xichun had just treated her. Shes like that, observed Tanchun, so eccentric and stubborn theres just no talking her round. Then she informed them, When no action was taken this morning and I heard that our peppery Xifeng was ill again, I sent my nanny to find out what had happened to Wang Shanbaos wife. She came back to report that the old creature got a thrashing for being too meddlesome. Serves her right too, approved Madam You and Li Wan. Tanchun laughed caustically. Who cant see through that trick? Just wait and see Madam You and Li Wan made no answer to this. And presently, thinking it time for the Lady Dowagers meal, Xiangyun and Baochai went back to pack their things while Madam You took her leave of Li Wan and went straight to the old ladys place. She found her sitting on her couch listening to Lady Wangs disturbing account of how tJia Zhen family had got into trouble, had their property confiscated and been fetched to the capital for punishment. She asked Madam You where she had come from and if Xifeng and Li Wan were any better. Theyre both better today, Madam You made haste to assure her. The old lady nodded and sighed. Well, lets not trouble ourselves about other peoples affairs but consider how to celebrate the Moon Festival. Weve got everything ready, said Lady Wang. But we dont know where youd like to have the feast. Only the wind may be cold at night in the empty Garden. That doesnt matter. We can dress more warmly. Thats just the place to enjoy the moon, of course. While they were chatting tables had been brought in, and Lady Wang and Madam You at once helped to serve the food. The Lady Dowager saw that in addition to the dishes prepared for her there were two big hampers of others, it being the custom for the two mansions to present her with extra dishes every day. She asked what they were. Ive told you several times to stop this, but you never listen, she complained. Were not as well off as we used to be. Ive passed on your instructions more than once, but this goes on as usual, Yuanyang said. So I had to let it go. This is only everyday family fare, put in Lady Wang. As today is one of my fast days we havent got much, and knowing that youre not too fond of gluten of wheat and beancurd I just chose minced watermallow with pepper sauce. Thats good. Just what I fancy. At once Yuanyang set this dish before her.
I suspect his father is making a mistake as well if he thinks the boy depraved. To understand him youd need to be widely read and experienced, able to recognize the nature of things, grasp the Way and comprehend the Mystery. He spoke so seriously that Zixing asked him to expand on this. All men, apart from the very good and the very bad, are much alike, said Yucun. The very good are born at a propitious time when the world is well governed, the very bad in times of calamity when danger threatens. Examples of the first are Yao, Shun, Yu and Tang, King Wen and King Wu, Duke Zhou and Duke Shao, Confucius and Mencius, Dong Zhongshu, Han Yu, Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi. Examples of the second are Chi You, Gong Gong, Jie, Zhou, Qin Shi Huang, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan and Qin Hui. The good bring order to the world, the bad plunge it into confusion. The good embody pure intelligence, the true essence of heaven and earth the bad, cruelty and perversity, the evil essence. This is a prosperous, long-enduring reign when the world is at peace and there are many people in the court and in the countryside who are endowed with the good essences. The over-abundance of this good essence, having nowhere to go, is transformed into sweet dew and gentle breezes and scattered throughout the Four Seas. But because there is no place under the clear sky and bright sun for the essence of cruelty and perversity, it congeals in deep caverns and in the bowels of the earth. If wafted by winds or pressed upon by clouds, it is thrown into agitation and traces of it may escape. And should these meet the pure essence, good refuses to yield to evil while evil envies good --- neither can prevail over the other. This is like wind, rain, lightning and thunder which cannot vanish into thin air or give way but must battle until they are spent. So in order to find some outlet these essences permeate human beings, who come into the world embodying both. Such people fall short of sages or perfect men, but neither are they out-and-out villains. The pure intelligence with which they are endowed sets them above their myriad fellow creatures, but their perversity and unnatural behaviour sink them lower than other men too. Born into rich and noble families, such people will become romantic eccentrics born into poor but cultured families, they will become high-minded scholars or recluses. Even if born into luckless and humble homes, they will never grow up into yamen runners or servants at the beck and call of the vulgar --- theyll turn out celebrated actors or courtesans. People of this type in the past were Xu You, Tao Qian, Yuan Ji, Ji Kang and Liu Ling, the two families of Wang and Xie, Gu Kaizhi, Chen Shubao, the Tang emperor Minghuang, the Song emperor Huizong, Liu Tingzhi, Wen Tingyun, Mi Fu, Shi Yannian, Liu Yong and Qin Guan. More recent examples are Ni Zan, Tang Yin and Zhu Yunming. Then there are others like Li Guinian, Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhuo Wenjun, Hongfo, Xue Tao, Cui Yingying and Zhaoyun. All of these, in their different fields, were essentially the same. Youre saying that such people may become princes or thieves, depending on whether theyre successful or not. Exactly. You dont know yet that since my dismissal Ive spent two years travelling through different provinces and come across one or two remarkable children. Hence my guess that this Baoyu you mentioned belongs to the same category. Let me give you an example no further away than Jinling. You know Mr. Zhen, who was principal of the Jinling Provincial College? Who doesnt know him? The Zhen and Jia families are interrelated and on a very friendly footing, Ive done business with the Zhens a number of times. Last year when I was in Jinling, said Yucun, someone recommended me to the Zhens as a resident tutor. I was surprised to find their household so grand, yet it combined wealth with propriety. Posts like that are not easy to come by. But although my pupil was a beginner, he was harder to teach then a candidate for the Provincial Examination. Heres an example of the absurd things hed say I must have two girls as company while I study, or I cant learn character my brain gets muddled. He told his pages, The word girl is so honourable and pure, not even the supreme Buddhist and Taoist titles can compare with it.
And being what he is, ready to snatch money from a pan of scalding oil, hed start spending even more recklessly if he knew that you had private savings. So I took it from her double-quick and gave her a piece of my mind, not knowing youd hear. Thats why, in front of the master, I said it was Xiangling. Xifeng laughed. I was wondering why Aunt Xue should suddenly send a concubine here when she knew that your master was back. So it was just one of your tricks. Just then Jia Lian returned. Xifeng called for wine and dishes, and husband and wife took their seats opposite each other. Although Xifeng was a good drinker she didnt venture to drink much today. She was sipping her wine to keep him company when Jia Lians old wet-nurse Nanny Zhao came in. The young couple promptly invited her to join them on the kang. Nanny Zhao resolutely declined this honour. But Pinger and the others had already set a small table and stool beside the kang, and when the nurse had sat down Jia Lian gave her two dishes from their own table. Nanny cant chew those, theyre too hard for her teeth, said Xifeng. She turned to Pinger. That bowl of fresh pork stewed with ham I remarked was so tender this morning would be just the thing for her. Take it and get them to heat it up quickly, will you? She urged the nurse, Nanny, try this Hui Fountain wine your boy brought back. I will, said the nurse. But you must take a cup too. Dont be afraid! The thing is not to drink too much. I didnt come all this way for wine or food, though, but on some serious business. I hope youll lay it to heart, madam, and help me. Our Master Lian is good at making promises, but when the time comes he forgets all about them. Yes, I nursed and brought you up, and now that Im old all I have are my two sons. If youd do them a favour no one could say a word yet Ive begged you again and again and youve always agreed, but to this very day not a thing have you done. Now this wonderful stroke of luck has come out of the blue , youll be needing extra hands. So Ive come to ask your help, madam. If I relied on our Master Lian alone, Id probably have starved to death by now. Xifeng laughed. Just leave his two foster-brothers to me, nanny, she said. You who nursed your boy from babyhood know what hes like. He goes out of his way to help complete strangers, people nowhere near as deserving as his two foster-brothers. Who could possibly object if he did something for them? But he just favours outsiders. Well, perhaps I shouldnt say that. The people we consider outsiders are in with him, I suppose. That raised a general laugh. Nanny Zhao chortled as if she would never stop. Amida Buddha! she cackled. So here comes an impartial judge. Our master wouldnt be so cruel as to treat us as outsiders but hes so kindhearted he cant say no to other peoples requests. Oh yes, hes very soft and generous to those in with him. Its only to us womenfolk that hes adamant. Youve been so good, madam, and made me so happy that Ill have another cup of that excellent wine. Now that Ive got you to look after us, I neednt worry any more. Jia Lian, rather put out, smiled sheepishly. Stop talking nonsense and lets start on the rice, he said. I still have to go and see Cousin Zhen on some business. Yes, we mustnt delay you, said his wife. What did your uncle want you for just now? It was about this Imperial visitation. Has permission been granted then? she asked eagerly. Not quite, but ten to one it will be. What a great act of Imperial kindness! She beamed. I never heard of such a thing in any book or opera about the old days. Thats right, chimed in the nurse. But Im growing so stupid in my old age that although Ive heard high and low talk of nothing else for days, I cant make head or tail of it all. Just what is this Imperial visitation? Jia Lian explained. Our present Emperor is concerned for all his subjects. No duty is higher than filial piety, and he knows that all, irrespective of rank, have the same family feeling. Though he himself waits day and night upon his Imperial parents, he considers this too little to express all his filial devotion and he realizes that the secondary consorts and ladies-in-waiting in the Palace who have been away from their parents for many years must naturally be longing to see them again, for its only right for children to miss their parents.
At once she ran forward as noisily as she could, calling out laughingly "Where are you hiding, Daiyu?" Xiaohong and Zhuier, who had just opened the window, were staggered to see her before them. "Where have you hidden Miss Lin?" Baochai asked them merrily. "Miss Lin? We haven't seen her," Zhuier answered. "Just now, from the other bank, I saw her crouching here dabbling in the water. I meant to take her by surprise but she spotted me coming and dashed off to the east. And now she's disappeared. Are you sure she's not hiding in there?" She deliberately went in and made a search before going on. "She must have popped into some cave in the rocks," she muttered. "If a snake bites her, serve her right. With that she went off, laughing up her sleeve at the way she had foxed them and wondering what they were thinking. Xiaohong, in fact, had been quite taken in. As soon as Baochai was safely out of earshot she caught Zhuier by the arm. "Heaven help us!" she whispered. "If Miss Lin was here she must have overheard us." Zhuier said nothing, and a long pause followed. "What shall we do?" asked Xiaohong. "What if she did hear? This is none of her business." "It wouldn't have been so bad Miss Xue overhearing. But Miss Lin's narrow-minded and likes to make cutting remarks. If she heard, and gives us away, what shall we do?" A stop was put to this discussion by the arrival of Wenguan with Xiangling, Siqi and Daishu. The two girls chatted with them as if nothing had happened until Xiaohong saw Xifeng beckoning from the slope. Leaving the other girls, she ran over to her. "Can I do anything for Your Ladyship?" she asked, smiling sweetly. Xifeng had a close look at her and was favourably impressed by her neat good looks and pleasant way of talking. "I didn't bring my maids with me today," she said. "Hut now I've remembered something I want done. Do you think you could deliver a message correctly?" Xiaohong smiled. "Just give me your instructions, madam. If I don't get the message right and hold up your business, you can punish me." "Tell me, which of the young ladies do you work for? Then I can explain where you are if she asks for you. "I'm attached to Master Bao's apartments." Xifeng chuckled. "I see. That accounts for it. All right, if he asks, I'll let him know where you are. Now go to my house and tell your sister Pinger that she'll find a packet containing a hundred and sixty taels of silver under the stand of the ju -ware plate on the table in the outer room. That's for the embroiderers. When Zhang Cai's wife comes, she's to weigh it in her presence and let her take it. And there's another thing. I want you to bring me the pouch which is by the pillow on the bed in the inner room Xiaohong went off to carry out these orders. She returned presently to find that Xifeng had vanished. But Siqi had just emerged from a cave and stopped to fasten her skirt. Xiaohong approached her. "Know where the Second Mistress has gone?" she asked. "I didn't notice." Xiaohong looked around and went to ask Tanchun and Baochai, who were watching the fish not far off. "You'll find her with Madam Li Wan, I think," Tanchun told her. Xiaohong promptly set off to Paddy-Sweet Cottage, but on the way met Qingwen and half a dozen other maids. "Still prancing about!" exclaimed Qingwen as soon as she set eyes on her. "You haven't watered the flowers, fed the birds or lit the tea-stove in our courtyard, yet you gad about outside." "Yesterday Master Bao said the flowers needn't be watered today -- once every other day would do," Xiaohong retorted. "I fed the birds while you were still asleep. "And what about the tea-stove?" demanded Bihen. "It's not my turn today, so don't ask me whether there's any tea or not." "Just listen to the way she talks," jeered Yixian. "You'd all better keep quiet and let her fool about." "Who says I was fooling about?" snapped Xiaohong. "I've been on an errand for the Second Mistress." With that she showed them the pouch to silence them, and they patted company.
Are you the only one left? At this, Zhuier sidled in. Look at that little bitch! cried Qingwen. She wont come unless asked for. But on pay-day or when sweets are shared out, shes always the first to come running. Come over here! Am I a tiger? Are you afraid Ill eat you? Zhuier had to come closer. Then Qingwen, lunging forward, grabbed one of her hands and began jabbing it with a hairpin from under her pillow. What use is this claw? she swore. It wont hold a needle or thread, all its good for is stealing. You with your avid eyes and itching palms, youre the bane of our lives and a disgrace to us all Ill carve you up! Zhuier screamed with pain until Sheyue pulled her away and made Qingwen lie down again. Youll catch your death after that sweat you were in, she scolded. Once youre better you can beat her as much as you like. Why raise this rumpus now? But Qingwen ordered someone to fetch Nanny Song and when she arrived informed her, Master Bao has told me to tell you that Zhuiers too lazy. When he gives her a job to do she refuses to stir and when Xiren asks her to do anything, she even curses her behind her back. She must be sent packing today, and tomorrow hell report it himself to the mistress. Nanny Song knew at once that this was because of the bracelet. Even so, she said with a smile, wed better wait till Miss Xiren comes back before dismissing her. Master Bao was most emphatic, insisted Qingwen. Never mind about this Miss or that Miss, well answer to her. Just do as I say. Tell her family to come and take her away. You may as well, put in Sheyue. Shell have to go sooner or later. The sooner she goes, the sooner well have some peace. So Nanny Song had to fetch Zhuiers mother. And when they had packed up her things, the woman came in to see Qingwen and Sheyue. Whats this I hear? she protested. If my girl misbehaves, why cant you teach her a lesson instead of throwing her out? At least leave us a little face. Save that talk for Baoyu, snapped Qingwen. This has nothing to do with us. Ask him? The woman snorted. He does just what you young ladies tell him, doesnt he? Even if he were willing to keep her, you wouldnt let him. Why, just now, even though you were talking behind his back, you referred to him by name. That may be all right for the likes of you, but in our case it would be thought most ill-bred. So I called him by his name, did I? Qingwen flushed with anger. All right, go and report me to the old lady. Tell her Ive run wild and have me thrown out too. Just take your daughter and go, sister, put in Sheyue. You can have your say about it some other time. This is no place for you to bicker and wrangle. Have you ever seen anyone wrangling with us here? Even Mrs. Lai and Mrs. Lin have to treat us with some respect, not to say you. As for using his name, weve done that since he was a child, as well you know, on the old ladys orders. Didnt they have his name written out and posted up everywhere so that everybody would use it, for fear that otherwise he might die young? Why, even water-carriers, night-soil collectors and beggars use it, not to say us. Only the other day, Mrs. Lin was taken to task by the old lady for calling him young master. Thats the first point. The second is that since were always in and out reporting things to the old lady and the mistress, we obviously cant refer to him as master. We must use the name Baoyu a couple of hundred times a day so its strange that you should choose this to pick fault. Some day when you have time, you can listen to us using his name to the old lady and Lady Wang then youll understand. But of course, its not to be wondered at that you dont know the rules in the inner apartments, since you dont have any important business that would take you near the ladies of the house youre mucking about outside the gate all the time. And this is no place for you to hang about. If you do, people will be coming to ask you the reason, even if we dont say anything ourselves. So first take your girl away. If youre not satisfied, you can complain to Mrs. Lin and ask her to speak to Master Bao about it. There are nearly a thousand people in this household.
