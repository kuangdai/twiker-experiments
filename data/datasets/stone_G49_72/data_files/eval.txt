Fengjie laughed, “Very good, very good! What a wonderful idea, dear Third Sister—but pity that fate has been so unkind, as if you were not born in Madam’s womb!” Ping’er replied with a smile, “Grandmother, you speak nonsense. She was not raised by Madam; can anyone dare to treat her differently from the others?” Fengjie sighed, “You do not understand! Although, in terms of being legitimate or otherwise, they are the same—but a daughter is never as good as a son. In marriage, there are those who are overly frivolous, and they are always quick to ask whether a girl is legitimate or not—dismissing the illegitimate at once. But little does anyone realize that a child born out of wedlock, if well-born in character, is worth a hundred times more than a legitimate child. Who knows? Perhaps an unfortunat­ely born one might choose wrongly, or a fortunate one might never choose the proper match.” She then leaned toward Ping’er and said, “You know, over these past few years I’ve invented so many cost-saving schemes that not a single family member has ever secretly resented me. Yet now I find myself riding a tiger—I see clearly but cannot help it. Moreover, with so many people leaving the house and so few returning, every little matter is still handled according to our ancestors’ old rules. And yet, the family’s revenue now is nowhere near what it once was; we have trimmed expenditures, and outsiders laugh at our thriftiness; even Grandmother and Madam feel slighted, and the servants grumble about our stinginess. If we do not quickly institute a regimen of frugality, in a few years we will have lost everything!”  Ping’er replied, “That’s exactly right! In the future there will be three or four daughters and two or three young masters—if one Old Lady is left, how can there be no more major affairs?”  Fengjie laughed, “I’ve thought of that too, and that is enough. Bao Yu and Lin Mei—if they marry, then there will be no need for official funds; Grandmother will provide enough. The Second Sister belongs to the eldest family branch and isn’t even counted here. That leaves three or four others; if we lavish each with 7,000–8,000 taels, and Brother Huan spends 3,000 taels on his wedding—if that isn’t sufficient, then trimming off even a penny will do. As for Grandmother’s own matters, everything will be provided, though miscellaneous expenses may total 3–5,000 taels. If we save even more, it will all come together eventually. I only worry that if more issues arise, it will be catastrophic. Let’s not worry about future matters—just eat your meal and listen to what they are discussing. This is my opportunity; I have long fretted over lacking someone to take charge. Although Bao Yu is here, he is not really one of us. Even the eldest sister is no help. The Second Sister is not even part of this household. Only the Fourth Sister remains. Lan and Huan are but scraggly little kittens that can only hide away in a warm kitchen or near a hearth. Truly, how can one have a respectable person born from one mother’s womb who behaves so outrageously? I cannot abide it! Now that he has that mindset, he must be aligned with him. Then, with him on our side, we won’t be alone. In terms of proper rites and the dictates of Heaven and human conscience, having him help out would ease our burden with Madam’s affairs. But if you take it as selfish scheming, I must retract and reconsider—if you pursue him relentlessly, people will eventually come to hate you. They will smile while hiding their knives, and if we—just four eyes and two hearts—are not cautious, we might inadvertently ruin everything. Seize the moment while it’s still swift; if he manages to make a move, then all our old resentments may be temporarily assuaged. One more thing: I know you understand all this very well, though I fear you may not be able to keep it in your heart. Remember, even though he is a woman, she is exceedingly astute in all matters—she speaks with care. In fact, she is even more knowledgeable than I am. As the saying goes, ‘to capture a thief, one must first seize the ringleader.’ If she intends to set the rules, she will surely begin by targeting me; if she dares refute me, do not argue—simply be as respectful as possible and say that it is she who is being contradicted.
I have leisure, and it is only natural that I extend a helping hand—even to neighbors. How could I afford to be accused of neglect? If I were solely intent on cultivating my reputation, then in drunken bouts and gambling losses, when trouble arises, how could I face my aunt? By then it would be too late for you to regret, and even your long-practiced dignity would be lost. This grand garden, under your careful supervision as veteran maids, is meant to be maintained with proper decorum. Yet you let others roam free, indulging in drinking and gambling. If your aunt hears of this, she might give you a good talking-to; if any of the household managers hear it, they won’t even wait for your aunt to intervene—they will reprimand you directly. And in the end, you old maids will be taught a lesson by the younger ones. Even though they are the ones in charge, why not preserve your own dignity rather than debasing yourselves? Thus I have devised this extra measure, so that we may all work together to manage the garden in a strict and careful manner. Then those in authority, seeing such earnestness, will not have to worry—and their hearts will be filled with respect. Think it over carefully.”  Everyone burst into cheerful agreement, saying, “Young lady, you speak truly. From now on, grandmother, you can rest assured. With you caring for us so tenderly, if we were to fall short in our duties, heaven and earth themselves would not forgive it!”  Just then, a messenger from the Lin family entered, announcing, “The family from the Zhen residence of Jiangnan arrived in the capital yesterday and today have come to pay respects at the palace. Their advance messenger has delivered gifts and conveyed their greetings.” He then handed over a list of gifts. Tanchun accepted it and read aloud: “For the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of decorative brocade in the style of a large python; for the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of assorted colored satin; for the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of various gauzy fabrics; for the palace—twelve bolts of official silks; and for the palace—twenty-four bolts of assorted satin, gauze, and crepe silks.”  Li Wan and Tanchun inspected the gifts. “Prepare the finest seals to reward him,” Tanchun ordered, and then sent word back to Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia, in turn, summoned Li Wan, Tanchun, Baochai, and the others to come over so she might inspect the gifts. Li Wan took them aside and instructed the treasury men, “Wait until our mistress returns and sees them before accepting delivery.”  Grandmother Jia remarked, “The Zhen family is unlike the others. Their practice of sending the finest seals to honor a man might, in the blink of an eye, be followed by sending women to pay respects, as if preparing extra measures.”  Before she could finish speaking, a messenger returned, “Four women from the Zhen residence have come to pay their respects.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia immediately ordered that they be brought in. These four were all over forty, and their attire was nearly as fine as that of their mistresses. After exchanging greetings, Grandmother Jia ordered that four footstools be brought over. The four women thanked her and sat down, waiting until Baochai and the others were seated before all took their places. Grandmother Jia then asked, “When did you all arrive in the capital?”  The four hastily stood and replied, “We arrived yesterday, but today our mistress brought the young ladies to the palace to pay respects. That is why we, the women, have come to pay our respects on behalf of the young ladies.”  Grandmother Jia smiled and asked, “You haven’t been to the capital these past few years, and yet you came all of a sudden?”  They all laughed and replied, “That is so. This year we were summoned by imperial order.”  Grandmother Jia inquired, “Have all the family members come?”  They replied, “The elderly matriarch, the brothers, the two young ladies, and the other mistresses have not come; only the mistress brought the third young lady.”  Grandmother Jia said, “Is no one else coming?”  They answered, “Not yet.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Your eldest and second sisters are very well connected with our family.”  They laughed, “Indeed.
She wore green trousers and red shoes, dazzling in contrast. She moved about, now laughing, now raging, utterly unladylike. Her dangling earrings swung like children on a swing. Under the lamplight, her willow brows appeared darker, her lips redder. Her eyes sparkled like autumn waters, and with a few more cups in her, they gleamed even more bewitchingly. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, both enthralled and terrified, didn’t dare approach yet couldn’t bear to leave, entranced and left gaping. To make matters worse, her scathing talk pinned them down. Both men, for once, had no witty repartee. She prattled away with coarse banter, openly mocking them until she’d had her fill of fun. Then, once she’d drunk her fill, she refused to let them stay longer, driving them out and bolting the door behind them. From that day forward, whenever Third Sister found them alone, she would curse Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong, calling them swindlers who preyed on a widow and her daughters. Jia Zhen, after that first debacle, didn’t dare come without reason. Sometimes, if she was in the mood, she would send a page to summon him; once he arrived, he could do nothing but sit there, gazing helplessly as she pleased. Reader, note that Third Sister You had a uniquely eccentric temperament. She was undeniably captivating and loved to dress in bold, striking styles unlike anyone else’s, displaying a charm that few men could resist. Even a stalwart veteran or a man of stone would be tempted. But as soon as they came near her, her wild and brash manner—showing no regard for others—would intimidate them. Hence, though Jia Zhen could do whatever he liked with Second Sister, he was increasingly obsessed with Third Sister. He was content to “give” Second Sister to Jia Lian and focus on pursuing Third Sister himself. Yet Third Sister might sometimes banter with him, but she maintained an imposing presence that kept him from trying anything. Her mother and Second Sister tried to talk sense into her, but she scoffed, “Silly women! Our exceptional beauty is being sullied by these fools. Besides, that family has a vicious wife. Sure, we’re keeping things hidden for now, but when she finds out, do you think she’ll let it go? That’s bound to end in a huge scandal, and who knows which of us might live or die? How can you treat this as some comfortable refuge?” Seeing her so determined, they gave up. Day after day, Third Sister demanded fancy clothes and adornments: if she had something in silver, she’d want gold; if she had pearls, she’d want gemstones. She’d eat a fat goose and next demand a fat duck. If anything disappointed her, she’d shove over the entire table; if a garment wasn’t to her liking—no matter how fine the silk or satin—she’d snip it to shreds, cursing as she tore it apart. Jia Zhen and the rest hardly had a day of ease and had spent enormous sums in vain. Jia Lian, when he came, stayed exclusively with Second Sister and was starting to feel some misgivings. Yet Second Sister was tenderhearted and saw him as her lifelong master. She was attentive and considerate, more so than Lady Feng. As for her beauty, her speech, and her bearing, she equaled Feng in every regard. But she had stumbled in reputation, branded as unchaste, and nothing else could erase that. Jia Lian, however, declared, “Who doesn’t make mistakes? Once you recognize them, that’s enough.” He refused to dwell on her past and cherished her goodness in the present, devoting himself to her as though glued at the hip. In his mind, there was no place left for Feng or even Ping’er. In the bedchamber, Second Sister often urged Jia Lian, “Discuss with Master Zhen the idea of choosing someone suitable to marry Third Sister. Keeping her here forever isn’t safe; trouble is bound to come.” Jia Lian said, “I suggested that to my elder brother the other day, but he can’t let her go. I said, ‘She’s like a prime cut of lamb, except it’s too scalding to touch. A rose is lovely but its thorns prick. We may not be able to handle her.
Explain clearly—whose relatives have come?” The maids and servants all burst into laughter and explained, “Grandmother’s two younger sisters are here; also present is a young lady said to be Miss Xue’s sister, and even a young man, purportedly Master Xue’s brother. I am now off to summon the concubine’s maid. Grandmother and the young ladies, please go upstairs first.” With that, they dispersed. Baochai teased, “Have our Xue Ke and his sister not come as well?” Li Wan laughed, “Or perhaps my aunt has come up to the capital? How is it that everyone seems to be gathered together? Truly a wondrous occurrence!”  Soon all assembled in Mrs. Wang’s upper room. The space was packed with a dark, pressing mass of people. Also, Mrs. Xing’s sister-in-law had arrived, bringing her daughter Xiuyan to be presented to Mrs. Xing. By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had come to support one another. Along the way, they encountered the widowed Li Wan accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—and the families soon found themselves chatting as relatives; thus, the three households traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin, Xue Ke, who in his youth had been kept at the pawnshop (where his family had accumulated two or three thousand taels for a living), joined in as well, since he had heard that Wang Ren was arriving. All these relatives gathered, exchanging courtesies and greetings. Grandmother and Mrs. Wang were exceedingly pleased. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns burst and reassembled again and again – it was all meant to culminate today!” While chatting about family affairs and accepting the gifts brought along, she also ordered that wine and food be kept on hand. Fengjie, needless to say, was busily occupied. Li Wan and Baochai exchanged heartfelt farewells with their kin, while Daiyu, though initially happy, soon recalled that everyone had relatives while she was all alone—and tears welled in her eyes. Bao Yu, knowing her heart, consoled her at length. Later, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard and, with a teasing smile, announced to Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen: “Hurry along and go have a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’ Bao’s own dear kin should appear thus? Her uncles and brothers behave in such a peculiar manner—as if they were her true siblings. And while you always praise our stunning sister, now you see her with her two elder sisters! I find myself at a loss for words. Heaven above, how many brilliant and graceful souls there are! They say nothing is impossible for the determined – yet here, right in our midst, each one outshines the next. I feel I’ve learned something new today.” He chuckled to himself. Xiangren, sensing a mischievous glimmer in his tone, demurred from inspecting further. Qingwen and the others had already gone out and returned with laughter, teasing, “Look at that—a niece of the head of the household, a sister of Miss Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister – all gathered together like a neat row of slender scallions!”  Before they had finished, Tan Chun entered laughing, “Our poetry society is flourishing!” Bao Yu replied, “Indeed. In a fit of merriment I founded a poetry society – and by some strange twist of fate, these people have gathered. But I wonder: has anyone here truly learned to compose? Tan Chun answered, “I have asked around; though they modestly claim ignorance, judging by their bearing, none are entirely unskilled. Even if some are inept, it is no great matter – just look at Xiangling!” Qingwen teased, “Among them, the younger sister of Miss Xue is even better. How about Third Sister?” Tan Chun replied, “Certainly. In my eyes, even her elder sister and the others pale in comparison.” Xiangren, both astonished and amused, said, “How strange – where else might one find such refined souls? I do long to see them for myself!” Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them. She has practically insisted that our madams treat these young ladies as proper ‘daughters.’ Grandmother intends to support them; and if any do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.” Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?” Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” and then laughed, “Grandmother’s fondness for her great-grandchild nearly makes her forget about you, my dear.” Bao Yu smiled, “That’s fine – it is only proper to pamper the girls.
The Liu household, not quite understanding at first, said, “The outer kitchen is already prepared.” Tanchun laughed, “You didn’t know? Today is Sister Ping’s special day—what is prepared externally is for the higher ranks; but we have privately pooled funds to prepare two banquet tables solely for her. Just choose the freshest and most exquisite vegetables, and then open an account with me for reimbursement.” The Liu household laughed, “Today it is as if Sister Ping’s eternal celebration has come; we had no idea!” They then knelt before Ping’er, and in their haste Ping’er quickly pulled them aside. The Liu household departed to arrange the feast. Later, Tanchun invited Baoyu to the hall to share noodles. When Li Wan and Baochai later arrived, Tanchun sent someone to call Aunt Xue and Daiyu. Thanks to the warm weather and Daiyu’s improving health, she too came. In a hall bedecked with clusters of flowers, nearly everyone was gathered. At that time, Xue Ke sent over a four-color gift of silk fans and scented handkerchiefs for Baoyu. Consequently, Baoyu went over to join him for noodles. Both families held birthday feasts, exchanged gifts, and took turns hosting. By midday, Baoyu accompanied Xue Ke for two more cups of wine. Aunt Xue then brought Baoqin over to pay her respects to Xue Ke. After repeated pleasantries, Baoqin was urged, “There’s no need to send over our home’s wine; such empty pomp is unnecessary. Simply invite your servants to dine. My brother and I will join later, as we have other matters to attend to.” Xue Ke quickly replied, “Dear sister, please do as you wish; I’m sure the helpers will be pleased.” Baoyu quickly apologized, and soon his sister returned. As soon as they reached the side gate, Baochai ordered an old maid to lock the door and took the key for herself. Baoyu protested, “Why must we lock the door? Not many people pass through—plus, our aunts and sisters are all inside. If someone needs to retrieve something, it will be troublesome.” Baochai laughed, “Be careful—these days, with so many mishaps, we have fewer people than before. Locking the door is effective. If it were left open, someone might take a shortcut and slip in unnoticed. Better to lock it so that even Mother and I are confined, and no one can wander off. If anything does happen, we cannot blame those outside.” Baoyu laughed, “So you know that recently our household has lost items?” Baochai replied, “You only know about the rose dew and poria snow—but there are others as well. In the future, if nothing goes missing, it will be our good fortune; if things do go missing, who knows how many will be implicated? You never meddle in these affairs, which is why I’m telling you now. Ping’er is very sensible—I already told her that with Grandmother away, she must be extra vigilant. If nothing untoward occurs, no one will lose face; but if something does, then the record will be set and Ping’er won’t be blamed. Just heed my words and be cautious. And don’t let this be told to a single other person.”  With that, they arrived at the Qin Fang Pavilion. There, by the edge of the pavilion, Xiren, Xiangling, the clerk, Qingwen, Miaoyue, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and several others were gathered watching the fish. When they saw them coming, someone called out, “The peony screen has been set up—hurry, take your seats!” Baochai and the others then led the group into one of the three small open halls of the Red Fragrance Courtyard, where even Aunt You had already been invited. Everyone was present except for Ping’er, who had gone out to receive gifts from the You, Lin, and other families; one gift followed another, as is the custom with the numerous relatives paying their respects. Ping’er busied herself distributing reward money and offering thanks; later she reported to Fengjie, accepting some items while refusing others, and giving away what she did accept. After a while—and only after Fengjie had finished her noodles—she changed clothes and returned to the garden. No sooner had she entered the garden than several maids came to fetch her; together they proceeded into the Red Fragrance Courtyard.
Even if some older ones remain, it is only because of their personal reasons for not returning; they have been kept on merely to serve our household servants.”  Lady You added, “Let us ask for twelve of them. Those willing to return shall be given a letter and asked to have their parents collect them with a few taels as travel money. If we do not call upon their kin, wretched scoundrels might claim them under false names and resell them—would that not squander this favor? And those unwilling to leave shall remain.” Wang Xifeng smiled, “That is settled.” Lady You and others sent word to Sister Feng; at the same time they informed the head of the household’s finances that each teacher should be given eight taels so that they could do as they wished. All items from the Lixiang Courtyard were carefully inventoried, and someone was assigned to handle night duty. The twelve girls were summoned, and upon being questioned face-to-face, more than half declared that they wished not to return. Some said that though their parents were alive, they feared that once sold out as our “sisters” they would be resold again; others said their parents were dead or had been sold off by uncles or brothers; still others had no one to return to; and a few confessed that they were reluctant to leave because of their bonds of affection. Wang Xifeng, hearing this, could only leave them behind. The four or five who were to leave were sent home under the care of their “dry” (adoptive) mothers, awaiting their biological parents to come collect them; those who wished to stay were dispersed throughout the garden to serve. Grandmother Jia then arranged for a number of officials: a “Morning Official” was assigned to Baoyu, a “Little Morning Official” to Baochai, a “Child Official” to Daiyu, a “Great Floral Face Official” to Xiangyun, a “Little Floral Bean Official” to Baoqin, an “Old External Ai Official” to Tanchun, and Lady You managed to obtain an “Old Evening Eggplant Official” for herself. Each thus received their proper post, as if like tired birds released from a cage and free to frolic in the garden. Everyone knew that these individuals were unskilled in embroidery and other needlework and were not accustomed to handling such tasks—and so they were hardly blamed. Some one or two who did take their responsibilities seriously, fearing that they might one day have no useful skill, even abandoned their former techniques and began to learn sewing, embroidery, and spinning, along with other domestic arts. One day, during a grand ritual in the court, Grandmother Jia and the others left at dawn (around the fifth watch). After a light meal of snacks and small dishes, they entered the court; once the morning meal was finished they returned to the lower quarters to rest. After lunch and a brief rest, they returned to the court for the second evening ritual before coming back again to rest; and only after dinner did they finally return home. Coincidentally, these lower quarters belonged to the ancestral temple of a high-ranking official—an abode maintained by Buddhist nuns with numerous, impeccably clean halls. The Rong Mansion had leased the east courtyard, while the Prince of Beining had leased the west courtyard. The Dowager and the young consorts of the Tai Fei (Grand Empress Dowager) took their afternoon rest, and when they saw Grandmother Jia and the others in the east courtyard, they would come and go together, assisting one another. As for the myriad outside matters, there is no need to go into detail. In the Grand View Garden, with Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng rarely at home and the spirit-sending ceremony having taken a month to complete, all the maidservants and old women found themselves with ample free time and spent many hours roaming the garden. In addition, the old servants from the Lixiang Courtyard were all recalled and scattered about the garden to await orders, making it appear as if the garden now housed several dozen extra people. Among the literary officials and others in the household—some of whom were haughty, some abused their power, some were finicky about food and clothing, and some flaunted their talents—there were many who did not behave properly. Thus, the old servants harbored grievances, though they dared not openly quarrel. Now that the school had disbanded, many took the opportunity to slack off—some with abandoned duties, others clinging to old resentments—and all were assigned to different rooms so as to prevent them from interfering with one another. It happened that on the Qingming Festival, Jia Lian had already prepared the customary memorial rites, and he led Jia Huan, Jia Cong, and Jia Lan to the Tiekan Temple to offer sacrifices and burn paper money for the deceased.
After the sisters had enjoyed their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and others wandered outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess, while Baochai and Xiuyun observed. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled beneath a cluster of flowers, murmuring softly to each other. Soon a member of the Lin household arrived, accompanied by a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps and kowtowed. Tanchun, having just lost a chess match and having accumulated “two eyes” (a game term for losses), kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing out chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there a long while; only when he later went to ask for tea did he notice the scene. He then pointed at the young wife and said, “This is Cai’er—the mother of little Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. Her speech is poor; I overheard a few words, and she dared not respond to the young mistress. She had to be brought forward for questioning.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just now, Grandmother was seen heading toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It matters not if we don’t report it—I’ll mention it later. In any case, let’s expel her for now and decide when the mistress returns.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing beneath the flowers, remarked quietly. Daiyu said, “Your third maid is so well-behaved—even though she is assigned certain tasks, she rarely leaves her post. If only she were given more freedom, she would soon command respect.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—when you were ill, she handled several matters for us. Now that this garden is divided among so many managers—even a stray blade of grass is accounted for—they have already reallocated responsibilities just to accommodate me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan every detail are most shrewd.” Daiyu said, “That is best. Yet we are expending too much effort. Although I do not meddle, when I have a moment I tally things up; if expenditures exceed income, sooner or later there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us will never be short.” Daiyu then turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of freshly brewed tea, and asked, “Where are you two going? I see you haven’t had tea in a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I’ll pour another.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just enough to rinse my mouth is fine.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is plenty. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s nowhere to be found.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed. Baoyu nudged him, “Don’t sleep—let’s go have some fun outside. Later, we’ll have a proper meal.” The Flower Official replied, “You all drink wine and ignore me; I become bored and fall asleep.” Baoyu pulled him up, laughing, “We’ll dine again tonight at home.
At that moment Baoyu was fuming over the commotion caused by Aunt Zhao; his heart was troubled, saying one thing and then another—until after the squabble was over, and after Tanchun had persuaded him to calm down, he then comforted the Flower Official for a while before sending him off to the kitchen for a word. When the Flower Official returned, he mentioned that he still needed some rose dew for Wu’er’s treatment. Baoyu quickly said, “We have some—since I hardly eat, you may give it all to her.” He then ordered Xiren to bring it out. When they saw that the bottle was nearly empty, Baoyu, not wishing to shortchange the Flower Official, handed over the entire bottle to him. The Flower Official then took the bottle and left with it. At that very moment the Liu family had just brought their daughter out for a stroll in one secluded corner of the garden; after wandering for a while she returned to the kitchen, where she sat down to have tea. Not long after, the Flower Official entered carrying a small glass bottle about five inches high which, when held up to the light, revealed a half-filled vial of a rouge-like liquid—apparently a Western-style grape wine that Baoyu was meant to drink. Mother and daughter quickly said, “Hurry and bring a pot of boiling water—please sit down.” The Flower Official smiled, “There’s only a little left; you may even keep the bottle for yourself.” Wu’er, upon hearing this, realized it was rose dew; she accepted it with thanks. She then said, “Today is a good day; let’s have a little stroll. This area behind here is rather dull—just a bunch of large stones, big trees, and the back wall of a house. There isn’t much of a proper view.” The Flower Official asked, “Why don’t you go forward then?” The Liu family replied, “I haven’t told her to go forward. The young ladies don’t recognize her—if an unsuitable person were to notice, there would be a heap of gossip. Tomorrow, when you take her along and she has her room, I’m afraid there won’t be anyone to accompany her for a stroll; who knows, she might tire of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “What’s there to fear? I’m here for her.” Aunt Liu’s daughter said, “Oh, my dear! Our skin is so thin compared with yours.” She then poured another cup of tea. The Flower Official, not really eating the tea, merely rinsed his mouth with a sip and then departed. Aunt Liu’s daughter said, “I still have some—Wu’er will see to it.” Wu’er then went out, and seeing no one around, tugged at the Flower Official and said, “Have I not said my piece?” The Flower Official laughed, “Am I not entertaining you? I heard that in this very house there are two vacant positions—one was that of Xiao Hong’s (which Second Lady Lian intended to fill) and the other for the one who fell; since they haven’t been filled, you wouldn’t be asking for too much. It is not overreaching.” He continued, “Ping’er always says, ‘Any affair involving people or money must be tolerated for a day.’ Now, Third Sister is about to be used as a paddle (to settle accounts). Even if some matters in our own room are not properly arranged, why must we get entangled in others’? If any words are exchanged, in time we’ll be too old to turn back. Let’s wait until things cool down; once the Dowager and the mistress have leisure, they can discuss even the largest matter with our elder. Nothing will be amiss.” Wu’er replied, “Although you say so, I am of an impatient nature—I cannot wait. While I’m at it, I want to honor my mother; I want to add to my monthly allowance so that the household will be more at ease; and if I can cheer things up, perhaps my illness will be cured soon. Even if I have to pay the doctor, it will save the household money in the long run.” The Flower Official said, “I understand your meaning—rest assured.” After these words, the Flower Official departed. Meanwhile, Wu’er returned and thanked her mother profusely for the Flower Official’s kindness.
My sister, however, did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, managing incorrigible souls is no easy task. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” Fengjie, unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion, finally sent for Jia Huan. Jia Huan, understanding all too well what Fengjie intended, pondered the propriety of having Zhang Hua reinstated. He then returned to Jia Zhen and secretly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the engagement? If you cling to your original decision, you risk provoking a backlash that will leave you with no refuge! Use your silver to return home—the best men are never hard to find.” Zhang Hua, after pondering this, agreed with his parents. In due course, he and his father departed for their native place, with a sum of money arranged. Meanwhile, Jia Huan continued to investigate the matter and reported everything back to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Jia Zhen was delighted, exclaiming that the matter had been resolved, and awarded him one hundred taels of silver. He even arranged for a seventeen-year-old maid from the household to be given as a concubine to him. Jia Huan accepted with thanks, overjoyed. Later, when Jia Huan met with Grandmother Jia and the rest of the family, he appeared somewhat sheepish. Yet Fengjie did not display her usual calm composure; instead, together with Second Sister You, she exchanged greetings. When Jia Huan mentioned the matter of the maid Autumn Tong (Qiutong), his face showed a touch of pride. Fengjie, upon hearing this, quickly ordered that two of the wives be sent by carriage to fetch Autumn Tong. Deep in thought, Jia Huan secretly thought, “How can Zhang Hua be allowed to return and maintain our family’s honor?” He then sent word to Zhang Hua, saying, “Since you now have plenty of silver, why insist on reclaiming your arranged wife? If you press the issue too forcefully, you risk inciting anger—leaving you with no footing! You should return home; you will be rewarded with some travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after considering this, agreed. In the meantime, Fengjie, distressed, hurried back to Grandmother Jia and said, “It is all due to our dear Second Sister’s incompetence; they never properly canceled the engagement, and now people are complaining. This will surely be an official scandal!” Grandmother Jia quickly summoned Second Sister You and said, “Since your betrothal from childhood was never properly canceled, and now someone has complained—what is this all about?” Second Sister You replied, “They even took the silver—how can it be that nothing was formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua’s statement now claims that no silver was seen and no one was taking him away. His father, however, said, ‘Our relatives once agreed—but when the relative died, you were to take her as a second wife.’ Without firm evidence, we must allow him to argue his case. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that people know, how can we send him back without losing face?” Grandmother Jia then said, “Since the marriage was never consummated and no one is forcibly deprived of their spouse, our reputation remains intact. Who then would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother, on a certain day, paid him twenty taels of silver to cancel the engagement. Yet he, in his desperation, retracted his word. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible wretches are hard to manage. Feng’er, please handle this matter.” Fengjie, at her wit’s end, sent for Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, knowing full well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim, it would bring shame upon the family. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why must you insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk angering our elders to the point where you might have no safe haven! Use your silver to return home—any decent man can be found. If you leave, we will even reward you with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua considered this, and after consulting with his family, they agreed.
I dare not compose any more poetry—each time I do, I’m penalized and embarrassed.” She covered her face with both hands. Bao Yu teased, “Why do you worry? I am not afraid of embarrassment; you, however, seem to be blushing profusely.” Baochai then proposed, “Next time I shall host a session with four poetry topics—four odes and four lyrics. Each person must compose four poems and four lyrics. The first poem shall be on ‘The Taiji Diagram,’ using the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme in a five-character regulated verse; not one syllable of the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme may be left unused.” Baoqin laughed, “That indeed is a challenge—clearly our sister isn’t truly committed to the society if she sets such hardships. One might force words out, but if they end up a jumble of ‘I Ching’ phrases, what pleasure will there be? When I was eight years old, I accompanied my father to the Western Sea to buy Western goods. Who would have thought that a girl barely fifteen—whose beauty resembled that in Western paintings, with golden hair, cascading ornaments, and a head bedecked with agates, corals, cat’s eyes, and emeralds, wearing a brocade gown with embroidered sleeves and carrying a jeweled Wakizashi—could be so exquisite? They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write a couplet for her, and then to compose a poem.” Everyone marveled at the oddity of it all. Bao Yu laughed, “My dear sister, show us what you have written.” Baoqin replied, “It is kept in Nanjing—where could I possibly retrieve it now?” Bao Yu sighed in disappointment, “Alas, I have no chance to see such wonders!” Daiyu smiled teasingly, “Don’t try to fool us; I know that when you come, you always bring these treasures from home. And yet you claim you have none! They might believe you, but I do not.” Baoqin’s face flushed red as she lowered her head in a modest smile. Baochai said, “Your words betray your cleverness, though your tongue is too forthright. Our little Qinqi often spouts such things, and you, too, have become quite sharp.” Daiyu then said, “If you have brought them along, show them to us!” Baochai replied, “The boxes and cases are in a tangle—once they’re sorted out, we shall examine them together.” Then she added to Baoqin, “Please, recite something for us to hear.” Baoqin answered, “I recall a five-character regulated verse I once composed about a foreign beauty; it is difficult indeed.” Baochai said, “Hold on – let’s call Yun over so that he may also hear it.” With that, Baochai sent a little maid to fetch Yun. After a while, Xiangyun asked, “So which foreign beauty has arrived?” As she walked, she and Xiangling came together. Everyone laughed, “One hears her voice before even seeing her!” Baoqin and the others sat down, and the earlier conversation was recounted. Xiangyun said, “Hurry and recite for us!” Baoqin then recited:   In the night’s vermilion tower, I dream;   Tonight I sing of a water-bound realm. Clouds over islands steam the great sea,   Mist rises to join the clustered forest. Moon, timeless and ever ancient,   Passions run shallow or deep by fate. In the lands south of the Han, spring appears so clearly –   How can one not be moved?” Everyone remarked, “Marvelous! Indeed, she surpasses even our own in this!” Before they could discuss further, Meiyue arrived with news: “Second Young Master has been told by the madams that tomorrow morning you must go to Uncle’s place. They say that his mother is very ill and longs to see her daughter.” Mrs. Wang replied, “A mother and child – how could we not allow that?” Fengjie was immediately summoned to report the matter, and she instructed Zhou Rui’s family to relay the news to Ping’er.
And if the clusters sprout in opposite directions, it would be ‘Adversarial Hui’! You’ve been away for half a year—if you miss someone and tug at the blossoms, it appears even the flowers pair up—how shameful!” Xiangling blushed and, as she attempted to stand, playfully scolded, “I’ll smack you for your nonsense, you little brat spouting foolishness!” Bean Official, unwilling to let her rise, quickly pinned her down and called for Ru Official and others to help “bind her mouth” (i.e. hush her). The two rolled on the floor, and everyone clapped and laughed, “Remarkable—what a sight! Alas, her new skirt got soiled in the process!” Bean Official glanced over and indeed saw a small puddle nearby, with half of Xiangling’s skirt stained. Embarrassed, he quickly ran off. Everyone laughed heartily, fearing Xiangling might take her anger out on them, and soon they dispersed amid laughter. Xiangling then rose and, looking down, saw droplets of green water streaming from her skirt. Just as she was about to launch into a tirade, Baoyu—having gathered some wild flowers for fun—noticed that everyone had scattered except Xiangling, who still stood there adjusting her skirt. He asked, “What happened? Why did everyone scatter?” Xiangling replied, “I had a cluster of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ that none recognized, and they ended up accusing me of making up tales—in the ensuing commotion, my new skirt was ruined.” Baoyu laughed and said, “You claim to have ‘Coupled Hibiscus’—well, I here have a double lotus blossom!” As he spoke, he plucked a double lotus blossom and simultaneously picked up a ‘Hui’ flower. Xiangling said, “What do you mean by ‘not coupled’ or ‘not a double blossom’? Look at my skirt!” Baoyu bent down and exclaimed, “Alas, it’s muddied! What a pity—this pomegranate‑red silk, so difficult to keep pristine!” Xiangling explained, “This was brought by Sister Qin the other day. She made one for herself and one for me; today I wore mine for the first time.” Baoyu stamped his foot and sighed, “If your household lost one garment every day, it might not matter—but if the very first one, the one Sister Qin brought, is ruined, isn’t that a betrayal of her affection? And then there’s Aunt Zhao’s constant nagging—I even heard her say you never know how to live properly or cherish your blessings. If Aunt Zhao sees this, she’ll never let it pass!” Struck by his words, Xiangling found herself strangely pleased. She laughed and said, “That’s exactly right. I have several new skirts, but none suit me; if I had one that did, I’d simply change into it.” Baoyu said, “Don’t fuss—just stand still; otherwise, even your undergarments, knee covers, and shoes will get muddied. I have an idea: Sister Xiren made a skirt exactly like this last month; since she was so filial she never wore it and even gave it to you in exchange—how about that?” Xiangling laughed and shook her head, “No, if they find out, it won’t do.” Baoyu replied, “What’s there to fear? Once she is full of filial piety, won’t she let you offer her something else? If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it isn’t a secret matter—just tell Sister Baoqin as well. I only worry that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. But promise me she delivers it in person!” Overjoyed, Baoyu quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly he mused, “What a pity that such a person—an orphan who has even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant—should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier even Ping’er was unexpected, but today is an unforeseen twist upon twists.” Lost in thought, he returned to his room and called Xiren to recount the matter in detail.
On my birthday the other day, when no one was outside to attend to affairs, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he simply sat there cursing. When two women entered, he gathered the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of steamed buns all over the courtyard. After everyone had gone, I sent Cai Ming to admonish him—and he ended up berating Cai Ming fiercely. That insolent wretch – why hasn’t he been expelled?” Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him – teach him a lesson so that he may mend his ways. Expelling him outright would be too harsh, for he is not our own flesh and blood but merely the attendant of the madams. I say, let Grandmother administer a few lashes as a warning; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.” Fengjie said, “Very well – tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never approach the wine!” Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai ordered, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I will have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse escorted them away. Later that evening, as everyone returned home, Aunt Xue and Baochai discovered that Xiangling’s eyes were swollen from crying. When they went to see Sè Pan, they found that although his face and body bore scars, his injuries were not serious. Aunt Xue felt both sorrow and anger; she cursed Sè Pan and even Xiangling, considering telling Mrs. Wang so that someone might apprehend Xiangling. Baochai quickly interjected, “It’s nothing major – after a night of drinking, a few slaps are inevitable. Besides, our household is notorious for its unruliness. Mother only feels upset because she cares. In a few days, when your brother recovers and goes out, those respectable men like Mr. Zhen and Jia Lian won’t let it go, and someone will have to apologize on his behalf.” Sè Pan lay in his room, cursing Xiangling and even ordering his servant, “Go dismantle his house, beat him to death, and sue him!” But his servant was quickly hushed by Aunt Xue, who said, “Xiangling may have been out of line while drunk, but now that she’s sober, she truly regrets it and fears punishment.” Sè Pan, hearing this, realized his predicament. (How these matters ultimately resolve… we shall continue in the next installment.) Chapter 52 Charming Ping’er Hides Her True Feelings Behind a “Shrimp-Whisker” Bracelet; Valiant Qingwen, Though Ill, Bravely Mends Her “Peacock” Coat  Grandmother Jia remarked, “That’s exactly it. I once wanted to say these words—but seeing how many grand matters you all handle nowadays (and now even more issues have cropped up), you dare not complain. Yet you may think I care only for these little grandchildren and neglect those in charge. Now that you’ve spoken so plainly, all is well.” At that moment Aunt Xue, Aunt Li, and others were present; Mrs. Xing and Mrs. You had also come to pay their respects. Before they could depart, Grandmother Jia turned to Mrs. Wang and the rest and said, “Today, I finally speak out. In former days I held my tongue—first, I feared offending Fengjie’s pride; second, the others might not abide it. But now you are all here, each connected by your sister- and sister-in-law ties—and who among you wouldn’t long to benefit from such favor?” Aunt Xue, Aunt Li, and Mrs. You all laughed in unison, “Truly, few can boast such loyalty—others merely display courteous appearances, but you all really love your little sisters and brothers-in-law. Even before Grandmother, you have shown true filial devotion.” Grandmother Jia nodded with a sigh, “Though I do cherish him, I also worry he is too clever for his own good—which is hardly a blessing.” Fengjie quickly laughed and interjected, “Oh, don’t quote our Grandmother so harshly!
Bao Yu quickly asked, “Where are you off to?” Xiao Luo replied, “Both young ladies are in Lin’s room; I’m on my way there now.” Bao Yu, upon hearing this, turned and joined her toward the Xiāoxiāng (Mist-Snow) Pavilion. There, not only were the Baochai sisters present, but even Xiuyan was there. The four of them gathered around a warming brazier and chatted amiably. Meanwhile, Ziyuan sat in the warm chamber by the window, sewing. When Bao Yu arrived, they teased, “Here comes another one! There’s no more room for you!” Bao Yu chuckled, “What a splendid ‘Winter Boudoir Gathering’ it is—but alas, I arrived too late. After all, this room is far warmer than the others and the chairs are not cold at all.” He then took a seat in the spot where Daiyu usually sat, placing a gray mouse chair on top of another. He noticed an exquisite jade basin on a display table, which contained a single potted narcissus with solitary petals. Bao Yu exclaimed in delight, “What a beautiful flower! The warmer the room, the richer its fragrance. Why did I not see it yesterday?” Daiyu smiled, “That was a gift from our chief steward – Aunt Lai sent two pots: one of narcissus to me and one of wax plum to Yun. I originally refused them, afraid of offending her, but if you want, I can pass one along to you.” Bao Yu replied, “I already have two pots at home, though they are not as fine as this one. How can one re-gift something so precious? That wouldn’t do.” Daiyu said, “I spend so many days burning the decoction—how can there still be room for the fragrance of flowers? It only makes them weaker. Better that you take it away so that the flower’s scent remains pure, undisturbed by any other odor.” Bao Yu laughed, “So you already know?!” Daiyu smiled, “I confess, I only recently learned of the affairs in your house. You did not come early enough to hear the old tales; now that you have, I am quite startled.”  Bao Yu then said, “Tomorrow at our society we shall have a new theme—let us recite odes to the narcissus and the wax plum.” Daiyu replied with a laugh, “Enough, enough! I dare not compose any more poetry—each time I do, I’m penalized and embarrassed.” She covered her face with both hands. Bao Yu teased, “Why do you worry? I am not afraid of embarrassment; you, however, seem to be blushing profusely.” Baochai then proposed, “Next time I shall host a session with four poetry topics—four odes and four lyrics. Each person must compose four poems and four lyrics. The first poem shall be on ‘The Taiji Diagram,’ using the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme in a five-character regulated verse; not one syllable of the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme may be left unused.” Baoqin laughed, “That indeed is a challenge—clearly our sister isn’t truly committed to the society if she sets such hardships. One might force words out, but if they end up a jumble of ‘I Ching’ phrases, what pleasure will there be? When I was eight years old, I accompanied my father to the Western Sea to buy Western goods. Who would have thought that a girl barely fifteen—whose beauty resembled that in Western paintings, with golden hair, cascading ornaments, and a head bedecked with agates, corals, cat’s eyes, and emeralds, wearing a brocade gown with embroidered sleeves and carrying a jeweled Wakizashi—could be so exquisite? They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write a couplet for her, and then to compose a poem.” Everyone marveled at the oddity of it all. Bao Yu laughed, “My dear sister, show us what you have written.” Baoqin replied, “It is kept in Nanjing—where could I possibly retrieve it now?” Bao Yu sighed in disappointment, “Alas, I have no chance to see such wonders!” Daiyu smiled teasingly, “Don’t try to fool us; I know that when you come, you always bring these treasures from home.
Nonsense. It’s just that, in Master Bao’s household, though the staff is large, you’re the one who truly looks after him. He can’t do without you. I’ve often heard Ping’er say that you think of me behind my back, frequently asking after my health. That’s real devotion.” She told Ping’er to move a stool next to the bed and motioned for Xiren to sit. Feng’er brought tea, and Xiren gestured politely, “Let Sister Feng’er sit.”  They were chatting idly when a little maid tiptoed in from the outer room and whispered to Ping’er, “Wang’er is here, waiting by the second gate.” Ping’er quietly replied, “Got it. Have him wait outside for now. He can come back later—no need for him to hang around the doorway.” Xiren realized they had private matters to discuss, so after exchanging a few more words, she rose to leave. Wang Xifeng said, “Stay a while and chat, so I won’t be so bored.” Then she told Ping’er, “See her out.” Ping’er complied, escorting Xiren. They saw two or three little maids standing there, quiet and watchful. Wondering what was happening, Xiren went on her way. Ping’er returned and reported, “Wang’er came just now. I told him to wait outside because Xiren was here. Shall I call him right in, or wait?” Wang Xifeng said, “Bring him.” Ping’er ordered a maid to summon Wang’er. Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng asked Ping’er again, “Exactly what did you hear?” Ping’er answered, “Just what that little maid said: she was at the second gate and overheard two young men outside saying, ‘This new Second Madam is even prettier than our old Second Madam, and she’s nicer, too.’ Not sure who Wang’er is, but he scolded them, ‘What’s this talk of old and new Madams? Quiet down, or if the household hears, you’ll lose your tongues!’” Ping’er had just finished explaining when a maid came in announcing, “Wang’er is here.” Wang Xifeng gave a cold chuckle. “Send him in!”  The maid stepped outside and said, “Second Mistress is calling you.” Wang’er walked in at once, saluted in the outer room, hands at his sides. Wang Xifeng said, “Come closer! I have questions for you.” Wang’er stepped forward to stand near the inner doorway. She asked, “Your Second Master is keeping a woman outside—did you know that?” Wang’er bowed and replied, “I’m on duty at the second gate each day, madam, and I have no knowledge of your Second Master’s private affairs.” Wang Xifeng gave a sneer. “Of course you ‘know nothing.’ If you knew nothing, why did you stop them from talking?” Realizing the matter had leaked, Wang’er saw no point in denial. He fell to his knees and said, “I truly don’t know the details. I just overheard Xing’er and Xier joking, so I scolded them. As for what’s really going on, I don’t dare speak. You can ask Xing’er, who often travels with Second Master.” Wang Xifeng spat on the floor. “A pack of ingrates, worthless bastards, all in it together! You think I’m clueless? Go fetch that wretch Xing’er. You’re not leaving either! Once I’ve questioned him, I’ll come back to you. Excellent. So this is the kind of trustworthy man I’ve raised.” Wang’er repeatedly said yes, kowtowed, then left to find Xing’er. Xing’er was in the accounts room playing around with some other boys when Wang’er came to say, “Second Mistress wants you.” Startled, Xing’er never guessed the reason. He hurried after Wang’er. Once Wang’er went in first to announce him, Wang Xifeng barked, “Summon him!” Hearing her sharp tone, Xing’er felt his legs weaken.
“That makes it all the more amusing!” they cried. Baochai then added a “Phoenix” character to the title above the “Rice-Fragrance Old Farmer,” and Li Wan explained the title to her. Lady Phoenix thought long and hard before laughing and saying, “Don’t laugh at me—I only have one rough line, though it is five characters long. I’m at a loss for the remainder.”  Everyone laughed and said, “The rougher the words, the better. Now speak up, and then get on with the real business.”  Lady Phoenix laughed: “When you expect snow, the north wind must blow. Last night I heard the north wind howl all night long; thus, I have this line:   ‘All night the north wind blows fierce.’ Whether it works or not—I care not.”  Hearing this, everyone exchanged amused looks and said, “Though it’s a rough line, it sets a fine tone for composing verse. Not only is it good, but it leaves endless possibilities for subsequent lines. Since this is the opening line, the Rice-Fragrance Old Farmer must quickly write his piece to continue the thread.”  Lady Phoenix, along with Aunt Li and Ping’er, downed another two cups of wine before departing. At that point, Li Wan wrote:    All night the north wind blew fierce,   —then one voice added:   Opening the door, the snow still drifts;   Stepping into the mud, pity for its pure white. Xiangling remarked:   All around, one treasures jade-like beauty;   Tan Chun declared:   Without intent, one cares not to adorn with withered sprouts. Li Qi offered:   When village brew is prized, the granaries overflow in a bountiful year;   Li Wen noted:   As reeds stir, the ash takes flight with the wind;   The sun circles as if turning the ladle of the Big Dipper. Xiu Yan commented:   Cold mountains have lost their emerald hue,   While frozen shores refuse to yield any tide. Xiangyun observed:   Willowy branches, so easily disturbed,   And plantain leaves, too scattered to pile. Baoqin intoned:   Musk and coal melt within a treasured cauldron,   While silken sleeves enclose a golden mink. Daiyu added:   Light seizes the mirror hung before the window,   And fragrant spices adorn the wall with pepper. Baoyu mused:   A cool breeze drifts idly through clear dreams. Then he queried:   Where might one hear the sound of a plum-blossom flute? Baochai finished with:   Whose jade-like flute calls forth such tone? Soon after, Li Wan laughed, “I’ll keep an eye on your warm wine.”  Baochai then ordered Baoqin to continue the couplets. Just then, Xiangyun rose and said:    The dragons’ formation disperses as clouds dissolve;   On the wild bank, a solitary boat turns back. Baoqin smiled and added:    Pointing her whip at Ba Bridge in rhyme,   One shows tender care for a pair of awarded cloaks. Xiangyun, not one to yield, declared with raised brows and a spirited tone:    Add a thought of extra rations for levies;   Survey the embankment’s risks and steep slopes alike. Baochai burst into a string of praises and then linked:    Branches and twigs tremble, fearing to sway;   Step by step, the light, snowy drifts proceed. Daiyu quickly contributed:    Snipping and dancing, they cling to one’s waist;   Bitter tea becomes a new delight. As they spoke, Baochai then urged Baoyu to join in. Baoyu, watching Baoqin, Baochai, and Daiyu engaged in a lively verbal duel with Xiangyun—so entertaining that he nearly forgot his own verse—finally found his voice when Daiyu nudged him on:    The solitary pine, destined to stand long,   Leaves its tracks in the muddy geese’ prints. Baoqin continued:    In the forest, one may hear the axes or the song of a woodcutter;   Hidden among a thousand peaks, an elephant’s tusk protrudes,  Xiangyun, not missing a beat, added:    While along a winding path, a coiled serpent lies in wait.
Jia Lian even handed over all the savings he had accumulated over the years, entrusting them to Second Sister’s care. He poured out for her everything about Wang Xifeng’s habits and ways, both in bed and out, insisting that once that “poisonous wife” died, he would bring Second Sister into the household. Hearing this, Second Sister was of course happy. Meanwhile, about ten people lived in the new house with more than enough money and supplies; their days were comfortable indeed. Nearly two months passed. One evening, Jia Zhen completed a Buddhist service at the Iron Threshold Temple and returned home. Long separated from his “younger sister,” he decided to pay her a visit, first sending a page boy to see whether Jia Lian was in or not. The boy returned saying Jia Lian was away, and Jia Zhen was delighted. He dismissed his attendants, keeping only two trusted young pages to lead his horse, and went quietly to the new house at lamp-lighting time. Once there, he had the two pages tie the horse in the courtyard and wait in the lower quarters while he slipped inside. He greeted Madam You and Third Sister You first; then Second Sister came out to see him. Overjoyed at the sight of her, Jia Zhen sipped tea and laughed, “What do you think of my matchmaking efforts? If you had missed this chance, you wouldn’t find such fortune even by lantern-light. Before long, your elder sister will come with a formal gift to visit.” As he spoke, Second Sister told the servants to prepare a meal and close the door. Among themselves, they were all one family, so there was no need for formality. Bao Er approached to pay respects. Jia Zhen said, “You have a conscience; that’s why Second Master entrusted you to serve them. One day I’ll have even greater use for you. Don’t run around drinking and causing trouble. I’ll reward you when the time comes. If anything is lacking here, go tell me directly. We brothers are not like strangers.” Bao Er promised, “Yes, I understand. If I fail to do my best, may I lose my head.” Jia Zhen nodded with a smile, “It’s good that you know.”  Thus the four of them drank together. Second Sister, however, fearing that Jia Lian might suddenly appear and create an awkward situation, withdrew after two cups. Jia Zhen could do nothing about that and simply watched her leave. Madam You and Third Sister remained to keep him company. Though Third Sister would occasionally jest with Jia Zhen, she was not as agreeable and yielding as her elder sister, so despite his keen desire, Jia Zhen dared not push his luck and risk being rebuffed. Besides, with Madam You right there, he felt too self-conscious to act too forward. Meanwhile, the two young pages who had come with Jia Zhen were in the kitchen drinking with Bao Er. Bao Er’s wife, Mistress Duo, was busy at the stove. Suddenly two of Second Sister’s maids came in giggling, wanting a drink. Bao Er cautioned, “Girls, aren’t you supposed to be upstairs serving? You’re slipping away; what if someone calls you and no one’s there?” His wife scolded him, “You muddleheaded fool, you’ve drunk yourself stupid. What does it matter to you? If someone calls, I’ll handle it. Whatever storms blow, they won’t land on your head.”  Because Bao Er’s status before Jia Lian depended on his wife’s influence, he left everything to her. With that, he drank a bit more and went to bed. Mistress Duo then kept drinking with the maids and page boys, joking and flirting to please them, hoping this would help her curry favor with Jia Zhen. They were all enjoying themselves when suddenly came the sound of knocking at the gate. Mistress Duo hurried out to see who it was and found Jia Lian dismounting. He asked if anything was going on. She whispered, “The Master is here, in the west wing.” Jia Lian went at once to the bedchamber, where Second Sister was sitting with two young maids. Seeing him, her expression turned somewhat uneasy. Jia Lian pretended not to notice and said, “Bring wine quickly! Let’s have a couple of cups and then sleep. I’m quite worn out today.” Second Sister, with a forced laugh, helped him remove his coat, brought him tea, and asked about his day.
Everyone laughed, “No wonder two were missing—he’s waiting here all along, preparing plum blossoms as well!”  Grandmother Jia, delighted, laughed, “Look there on that snowy slope—paired with his presence, his attire, and the plums behind him, what does it remind you of?”  They all laughed, “It resembles that painting ‘Snow in Splendor’ hung in the Grand Matriarch’s room by Qiu Shizhou.”  Grandmother Jia shook her head and said, “But where in that painting does one see such attire? A person cannot be so perfect.”  Before she had finished speaking, another figure appeared behind Baoqin—a person clad in a large red pelisse. Grandmother Jia asked, “And who might that young lady be?”  They all laughed, “We’re all here—why, it is Baoyu!”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “My eyes grow ever dimmer.”  In the midst of their banter, who should appear but Baoyu and Baoqin? Baoyu smiled at Baochai, Daiyu, and the others and said, “I have just returned to the Langcui Nunnery, where Miaoyu has sent each of you a red plum branch. I have already dispatched messengers.”  Everyone smiled and said, “Many thanks for your thoughtfulness.”  After their conversation, they exited the garden and entered Grandmother Jia’s room. After finishing the meal, while they continued to chat and laugh, suddenly Aunt Xue arrived, saying, “What heavy snow! Not a day has passed without someone coming to see the Grand Matriarch. Is she in a foul mood today? It’s the perfect time for enjoying the snow.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “When was I not pleased? I was merely playing with these young ones for a while.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Last night I was thinking of borrowing the garden for a day with our mistress, setting two tables of rustic wine to let the Grand Matriarch enjoy the snow; but then I heard that she retired early—Baoyu even said, ‘The Grand Matriarch’s heart is not cheerful’—so I dared not disturb her. Had I known, I would have arranged it indeed.”  Grandmother Jia smiled, “It is only October—this is the first snow; there will be many snowy days hence, and it wouldn’t hurt to indulge the mistress a bit more.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Indeed, my filial piety is sincere.”  Lady Phoenix laughed, “How could Aunt Xue forget? Now that fifty taels of silver have been weighed out and handed to me for safekeeping, the moment it snows I will prepare the wine. Aunt Xue, you need not worry or forget.”  Grandmother Jia smiled, “So it is decided: our mistress shall keep the fifty taels, and you and Lady Phoenix shall each have twenty-five taels. When next the snow falls, if my heart feels bitter, I will simply let it pass. Aunt Xue need not be troubled—after all, both Lady Phoenix and I benefit.”  Lady Phoenix clapped her hand and laughed, “Excellent! That is exactly my idea.”  Everyone laughed. Grandmother Jia then chided playfully, “Bah! How shameless—you clambered up like a pole! If you hadn’t said that our mistress is a guest who has endured wrongs at our home, we wouldn’t be spending money on her. Yet here you are, demanding fifty taels outright—how impudent!”  Lady Phoenix laughed, “Our esteemed ancestor always has the keenest sense. Try asking Aunt Xue: if she can produce fifty taels to share with me, then why not? Now, seeing that it won’t be of use, she’s turned the tables on me by speaking so generously. I shall not press Aunt Xue for silver any further—instead, I will provide the silver myself to pay for the wine and treat the Grand Matriarch, and then I will seal an extra fifty taels in filial tribute to her. Let it be a penalty for meddling in others’ affairs. Isn’t that splendid?”  Before she could finish, everyone burst into laughter on the kang (heated brick bed). Grandmother Jia then mentioned how even Baoqin’s red-plum branch, picked from the snow, surpassed the quality of those in paintings.
If she sent you, why didn’t she tell me you were here? Going out and having me close the door—what is the meaning of that? Are you lying?”  Wu’er, at a loss for words, replies, “It was my mother’s instruction early this morning. I forgot to mention it until now. I was afraid my mother might have mistaken me for someone else, so she didn’t inform the mistress.”  The Lin official, sensing that Wu’er’s explanation is feeble and recalling that not long ago, Yuchuan had mentioned that some things were missing from the main room—and that a few maids had complained—suspicion arose. Soon, Little Chan, Lianhua, and several young wives come by and say, “Aunt Lin must question her. In recent days, you’ve been sneaking around like a ghost, doing who knows what!”  Little Chan adds, “Indeed. Yesterday, Sister Yuchuan said, ‘The cabinet in the mistress’s side room has been opened and quite a few trinkets are gone.’ And Second Lady Lian had sent Ping’er and Sister Yuchuan to fetch some rose dew—but even that was short by a can, and no one seems to know where it went!”  Lianhua laughs, “I haven’t heard about that. Today, I even saw a bottle of dew.”  The Lin official, now agitated by the lack of explanation, immediately orders lanterns to be lit and for everyone to search the kitchen. Wu’er, anxious, exclaims, “That must be the bottle that Brother Baoyu’s Flower Official gave me!”  The Lin official retorts, “No matter what—whether it’s ‘Square Official’ or ‘Round Official’—I have evidence of theft, and I shall report it. You, my master, can argue if you like.”  With that, he enters the kitchen. Lianhua leads him to a small bottle of dew. Fearing there might be more hidden contraband, they search carefully and find, along with the bottle, a packet of poria snow. Together they gather these items and bring them back to Li Wan and Tanchun. At that moment Li Wan, who has been ignoring affairs due to Lan’er’s illness, is sent to see Tanchun. Tanchun is already in her room. After a short while someone returns and tells the maids in the courtyard, “Young Miss Ping, please bring Second Lady Lian to see her.”  The Lin official is forced to accompany them to Feng Xifeng’s quarters, where he finds Ping’er and reports the matter. Feng Xifeng, who had just been dozing, upon hearing of the incident, commands, “Give her a good forty strokes and expel her—she is never to set foot in the second hall again! As for Wu’er, hit her with forty strokes immediately and then hand her over to the estate manager to be sold or given in marriage!”  Hearing this, Ping’er steps out and, in accordance with Feng Xifeng’s orders, instructs the Lin official. Wu’er, terrified, bursts into tears and falls to her knees before Ping’er, explaining in detail the matter of the Flower Official. Ping’er says, “This is not difficult. Tomorrow we’ll question the Flower Official to get to the truth. But the poria snow that was delivered the other day was not to be tampered with until Grandmother and the mistress have seen it—and it should not have been taken in secret.”  Wu’er, hearing this, hastily reveals that her uncle had also sent her a packet. Ping’er laughs, “In that case, you appear completely innocent—why then use you as a scapegoat? Since it is evening and Grandmother has only just returned from her medicinal break, it is not proper to fuss over such trifling matters now. For the time being, let’s confine her under watch for one night. Tomorrow, when I return to Grandmother, I will settle this matter properly.”  The Lin official dares not defy her and takes Wu’er away, leaving her in the custody of the night-shift matron while he departs. Thus, Wu’er is effectively confined and cannot move far. Meanwhile, many of the young wives protest, “This is not proper conduct!” Others complain, “Not only can a proper person not be seated here, but now we’ve also got a thief to watch over.
After sipping two more cups of strong tea, Tanchun immediately sent her a small “sobering stone” to place in her mouth, and then gave her a sour soup. Gradually, she began to recover. Meanwhile, various fruits and vegetables were selected and sent to Sister Feng, who in turn returned a few items. After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and others wandered outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess, while Baochai and Xiuyun observed. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled together beneath a cluster of flowers, murmuring softly to one another. Soon, a member of the Lin household arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps to kowtow. Tanchun, having just lost a chess match and counting her “two eyes” (a game term for one’s losses), continued to gaze fixedly at the chessboard while absentmindedly fishing out pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there a long while; only when he later went to ask for tea did he notice the situation. He then pointed at the young wife and said, “This is Cai’er—the mother of little Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. Her speech is poor; I overheard a few words, and she dared not answer the young mistress. She had to be brought forward for questioning.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just now, Grandmother was seen heading toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It does not matter if we do not report it—I will mention it later. In any case, let’s expel her for now and decide when the mistress returns.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing under the flowers, remarked softly. Daiyu said, “Your third maid is such a well-behaved child. Even though she is assigned certain tasks, she hardly ever leaves her post—if only she were given more freedom, she would soon command respect.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—in your time of illness, she handled several matters for us. Now this garden is divided among many managers; even a stray blade of grass is accounted for. They have trimmed several responsibilities just to make room for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan every detail are most shrewd.” Daiyu said, “That is best. But we are expending too much effort. Though I do not interfere, when I have a moment, I tally things up; if the expenditures exceed the income, eventually there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us are never short.” Daiyu then turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of freshly brewed tea, and asked, “Where are you two off to? I see you haven’t had tea for a while—you’ve poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Isn’t that for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I’ll pour another.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just a little to rinse my mouth is fine.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is plenty. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was just here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s nowhere to be found.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed.
A setup like this can’t last forever. We need a plan for the long run.”  Jia Lian laughed, “Don’t worry—I’m not the jealous type. I know all about your earlier affairs, so don’t think you must hide them. Since you’ve come to me, naturally my elder brother must be discreet. In my view, why not let Third Sister marry my elder brother, so neither of you is hindered? We’d all share our good times together. Isn’t that best?”  Second Sister wiped her tears and said, “Though your intentions are kind, first there’s my third sister’s temper to consider; second, your elder brother might be embarrassed. It’s not so simple.” Jia Lian answered, “That’s no obstacle at all. Let’s settle it now. I’ll go over there right this moment and make things happen.”  Half-drunk with boldness, Jia Lian rose and headed to the west wing. Light shone through the window. He pushed the door open and called, “Elder brother, are you here? I’m here to greet you.” Jia Zhen, startled, turned pale at hearing Jia Lian’s voice. Seeing him come in, Jia Zhen felt a flush of shame. Madam You also looked mortified. Jia Lian laughed, “What’s there to feel awkward about? We’ve been like this for ages, as close as brothers can be. You’ve done so much for me. If you act uneasy, I feel guilty. I just hope you’ll treat me the same as always; otherwise, I’d rather never come here again.” He moved to kneel, and Jia Zhen hurriedly grabbed him and insisted, “Don’t say such things, brother. I’ve no choice but to accept your goodwill.”  Jia Lian then called, “Someone bring wine! Let me have a few cups with Elder Brother.” With a mischievous grin he said to Third Sister, “Why not drink a double-cup of wine with Elder Brother? I too want to toast you both and offer my congratulations!”  Third Sister leaped up onto the kang, pointing at Jia Lian with a mocking smile, “Don’t try your fancy talk on me! I’m too clearheaded for that. Better keep the show going without pricking the thin paper screen. Don’t imagine we’re ignorant of the doings in your mansion. You spend a little money, you two brothers treat my sister and me as though we were mere courtesans for your pleasure. You’ve made a mistake. I know all about your wife’s viciousness. Now you’ve tricked my sister into becoming your second wife, but like the proverb says, ‘A stolen drum can’t be beaten openly.’ I’d like to meet this Lady Feng and see if she has extra heads and extra arms. If she’s reasonable, fine; but if she dares act high and mighty, I’ll slice out the gall from you two dogs and then fight her to the death! Afraid of some wine? Let’s drink, then!”  With that, she picked up the wine pot, filled a cup, drank half, yanked Jia Lian toward her, and tried to pour the rest down his throat. Terrified, he sobered instantly. Jia Zhen, too, never expected Third Sister to be so blunt. The two men—normally so smooth in flirtation—were left speechless by this barrage. Seeing them tongue-tied only spurred Third Sister on. She shouted, “Bring my sister! If we’re going to have fun, let’s all have fun together—four of us! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing’s cheaper than family property.’ You two are brothers, we two are sisters; we’re not outsiders, so come on!” Mortified, Madam You felt this had gone too far. Jia Zhen tried to slip away, but Third Sister blocked him. Now Jia Zhen regretted getting involved. This fiery woman was no ordinary plaything, and he could no longer be frivolous around her. Third Sister proceeded to remove her ornaments and outer clothes. She gathered her hair loosely and wore only a red jacket, half open, deliberately revealing a bright green bodice and a glimpse of snowy skin below.
Baochai teased, “Have our Xue Ke and his sister not come as well?” Li Wan laughed, “Or perhaps my aunt has come up to the capital? How is it that everyone seems to be gathered together? Truly a wondrous occurrence!”  Soon all assembled in Mrs. Wang’s upper room. The space was packed with a dark, pressing mass of people. Also, Mrs. Xing’s sister-in-law had arrived, bringing her daughter Xiuyan to be presented to Mrs. Xing. By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had come to support one another. Along the way, they encountered the widowed Li Wan accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—and the families soon found themselves chatting as relatives; thus, the three households traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin, Xue Ke, who in his youth had been kept at the pawnshop (where his family had accumulated two or three thousand taels for a living), joined in as well, since he had heard that Wang Ren was arriving. All these relatives gathered, exchanging courtesies and greetings. Grandmother and Mrs. Wang were exceedingly pleased. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns burst and reassembled again and again – it was all meant to culminate today!” While chatting about family affairs and accepting the gifts brought along, she also ordered that wine and food be kept on hand. Fengjie, needless to say, was busily occupied. Li Wan and Baochai exchanged heartfelt farewells with their kin, while Daiyu, though initially happy, soon recalled that everyone had relatives while she was all alone—and tears welled in her eyes. Bao Yu, knowing her heart, consoled her at length. Later, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard and, with a teasing smile, announced to Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen: “Hurry along and go have a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’ Bao’s own dear kin should appear thus? Her uncles and brothers behave in such a peculiar manner—as if they were her true siblings. And while you always praise our stunning sister, now you see her with her two elder sisters! I find myself at a loss for words. Heaven above, how many brilliant and graceful souls there are! They say nothing is impossible for the determined – yet here, right in our midst, each one outshines the next. I feel I’ve learned something new today.” He chuckled to himself. Xiangren, sensing a mischievous glimmer in his tone, demurred from inspecting further. Qingwen and the others had already gone out and returned with laughter, teasing, “Look at that—a niece of the head of the household, a sister of Miss Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister – all gathered together like a neat row of slender scallions!”  Before they had finished, Tan Chun entered laughing, “Our poetry society is flourishing!” Bao Yu replied, “Indeed. In a fit of merriment I founded a poetry society – and by some strange twist of fate, these people have gathered. But I wonder: has anyone here truly learned to compose? Tan Chun answered, “I have asked around; though they modestly claim ignorance, judging by their bearing, none are entirely unskilled. Even if some are inept, it is no great matter – just look at Xiangling!” Qingwen teased, “Among them, the younger sister of Miss Xue is even better. How about Third Sister?” Tan Chun replied, “Certainly. In my eyes, even her elder sister and the others pale in comparison.” Xiangren, both astonished and amused, said, “How strange – where else might one find such refined souls? I do long to see them for myself!” Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them. She has practically insisted that our madams treat these young ladies as proper ‘daughters.’ Grandmother intends to support them; and if any do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.” Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?” Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” and then laughed, “Grandmother’s fondness for her great-grandchild nearly makes her forget about you, my dear.” Bao Yu smiled, “That’s fine – it is only proper to pamper the girls.
Xing’s sister-in-law, who had brought along her daughter Xiuyan to be presented to Mrs. Xing. By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had arranged to help one another. Along the way, while boarding a boat, they encountered the widowed aunt Li Wan, who was accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—who too were traveling to the capital. As they exchanged greetings, it turned out they were all relatives; thus the three families traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin Xue Ke—whose father had once in the capital promised his younger sister Xue Baoqin in marriage to a high-ranking official’s son—also joined in, having heard that Wang Ren was on his way. So that day, everyone assembled, visiting and presenting their respects as relatives. Grandmother and Mrs. Wang were overjoyed. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns and blossoms exploded and reassembled over and over—it was all meant to culminate today.” While chatting about family affairs, she received the gifts that had been brought and ordered that wine and food be kept on hand. Fengjie, needless to say, was extremely busy. Li Wan and Baochai consoled one another over parting sentiments. Daiyu, though initially happy, soon remembered that everyone had their own relatives while she was left all alone—and tears welled in her eyes. Bao Yu, understanding her feelings deeply, consoled her at length. Afterward, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard, where he greeted Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen with teasing smiles: “Hurry along and go take a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’—Bao’s own dear sibling—should look just like this? Her uncles and brothers behave in a most peculiar fashion, almost as if they were her true blood; yet all the while you keep saying how extraordinarily beautiful our sister is. Now, to see her with her two elder sisters—how can I describe it? Heaven above, how many refined and talented souls are there? They say that in our time no one is without his equal—but look around, right here in our own neighborhood, each person outshines the next. I’ve learned a great deal today.” And as he spoke, he laughed to himself. Xiangren, sensing a hint of mischief in Bao Yu’s tone, refused to inspect further. Qingwen and the others had already gone to take a look and then returned, laughing as they told Xiangren, “Go on, just take a look—a young lady of the household, a sister of Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister—all gathered together like four slender scallions!”  Before their words were finished, Tan Chun came laughing to find Bao Yu, exclaiming, “Our society is thriving!”  Bao Yu replied, “Indeed. In a fit of merriment I founded a poetry society, and by some strange twist, these people have gathered. But one thing: I wonder if any of them truly know how to write poetry?”  Tan Chun answered, “I’ve asked around. Though they modestly claim they’re not skilled, judging by their bearing, none of them are entirely incapable. Even if some lack skill, it isn’t difficult—you only need to look at Xiangling!”  Qingwen added with a laugh, “Among them, the younger sister of Miss Xue is even better. How about Third Sister?”  Tan Chun replied, “Indeed.” “In my eyes, not even her elder sister and the rest compare to her.”  Hearing this, Xiangren was both amazed and amused, and said, “How strange—where else could one find such refined souls? I do wish to see for myself.”  Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them; she has already practically insisted that our madams acknowledge these young ladies as proper ‘girls.’ Grandmother intends to support them, and if those three do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.”  Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?”  Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” She then laughed, “Grandmother has such a fine grandchild that she almost forgets about you, my dear.”  Bao Yu smiled, “That doesn’t matter—one should indeed pamper the girls.
Baoqin smiled and added:    Pointing her whip at Ba Bridge in rhyme,   One shows tender care for a pair of awarded cloaks. Xiangyun, not one to yield, declared with raised brows and a spirited tone:    Add a thought of extra rations for levies;   Survey the embankment’s risks and steep slopes alike. Baochai burst into a string of praises and then linked:    Branches and twigs tremble, fearing to sway;   Step by step, the light, snowy drifts proceed. Daiyu quickly contributed:    Snipping and dancing, they cling to one’s waist;   Bitter tea becomes a new delight. As they spoke, Baochai then urged Baoyu to join in. Baoyu, watching Baoqin, Baochai, and Daiyu engaged in a lively verbal duel with Xiangyun—so entertaining that he nearly forgot his own verse—finally found his voice when Daiyu nudged him on:    The solitary pine, destined to stand long,   Leaves its tracks in the muddy geese’ prints. Baoqin continued:    In the forest, one may hear the axes or the song of a woodcutter;   Hidden among a thousand peaks, an elephant’s tusk protrudes,  Xiangyun, not missing a beat, added:    While along a winding path, a coiled serpent lies in wait. Baoqin then said:    On flowered branches, frost weaves its magic;   Deep in the courtyard, a startled sparrow senses the chill. Xiangyun, now parched, grabbed his teacup only to have it knocked away as he added:    On a pool of water, driftwood bobs aimlessly;   Dawn glimmers on the edge of a clear day,  Daiyu quickly linked:    As a riot of colors flows into an endless night. Xiangyun laughed and added:    Forgetting the chill of three feet of cold,   While auspicious omens relieve the nine-fold furnace’s burn. Baoqin, laughing, followed with:    Who, then, will inquire about this stiffened traveler? For even a wanderer delights in a warm summons. Then Baoyu offered:    As fate cuts the thread of mortal coil,   The bustling market of the world loses its shimmering veil. Xiangyun quickly joined:    And the sea of illusion loses its gauze of silken clouds. Daiyu, not allowing him to finish, continued:    Lonely pavilions lie desolate and sealed;  Xiangyun, ever the rapid responder, added:    While the poor, with but a basket and a bowl, cherish their meager fare. Baoqin, hardly giving him a moment’s peace, said:    The water for boiling tea steadily reaches a rolling boil;  Xiangyun, amused by his own wit, added:    And leaves, though stubborn, prove hard to ignite a fire in the wine pot. Daiyu then laughed:    Not even the mountain monk with his broom can sweep away such frosts;  Baoqin echoed with a smile:    Nor can a little boy, tasked with carrying a zither, lift the burdens away. Xiangyun, bending over with laughter, recited a line. When the others inquired, “What exactly are you saying?” he replied:    In the stone tower, a crane sleeps undisturbed;  Daiyu, clutching her chest with mirth, bellowed:    While in a brocade chamber, a pet cat is held dear. Baoqin quickly added:    In a moonlit cavern, silver waves are overturned;  Xiangyun linked:    And in the rosy haze of a city of clouds, a red banner lies hidden. Daiyu, laughing, continued:    Where the fragrance of plums invites a lingering chew,  Baochai beamed and said, “Fine line!” and promptly added:    Where droplets on bamboo, in their inebriation, find the perfect tune. Baoqin quickly interjected:    Perhaps a soaked pair of mandarin duck straps,  Xiangyun added:    Or, at times, frozen jade leaves arched in graceful poise. Daiyu then added:    Even if there’s no breeze, the glances remain intimate;  Baoqin finished with a smile:    And though no rain falls, the lament is ever so soft.
I fear that if I were to complain, our family’s honor would be tarnished, and I might be forced to use some of our silver to settle accounts!” As she cried and raved, she clutched Lady You’s face and cursed Jia Huan relentlessly. At length, the concubines, maids, and wives knelt in a mass, pleading in unison, “Second Grandmother, you are most magnanimous. Although our own Grandmother has suffered, she has borne it long enough—remember how kindly she has always treated us! Please, spare us further humiliation.” They then brought tea, and Fengjie, after a bout of tears and scolding, wiped her eyes, combed her hair, and admonished Jia Huan, “Go fetch your father so I may question him face-to-face about our situation! I must learn the extent of our filial merits and your arranged marriage—this matter, I truly know nothing; let me learn so I may instruct you!” Jia Huan knelt and repeatedly kowtowed, saying, “I beg your pardon, Aunt—please punish me if you must; I will accept any reproof. Let our family handle this matter properly.” Fengjie then turned her scorn upon Lady You, saying, “How dare you meddle in our affairs! What right do you have to run about? Do you not know that if you meddle in our family’s business, even if you have your own children, you will be blamed? You’re as if you have no regard for your own mother—if you cause trouble, then you’ve no one to blame but yourself!” Lady You, in tears, pleaded, “Aunt, please forgive me. I have done nothing but obey; what more can I do?” Amid the tumult, many of the younger concubines and maids gathered, whispering among themselves. Fengjie then sent someone to secretly inquire about You Er’s situation, learning that indeed her household was in a similar state. With this information, she ordered that no news of these matters be allowed to spread—if Grandmother or Wang Xifeng learned of it, she warned, “I shall have you all punished!” In the garden, the servants and young maids were already trembling at the mere mention of Fengjie’s wrath, well aware that such matters were treated with utmost severity in Jia Lian’s household. Fengjie quietly instructed Li Wan to shelter her for a few days, promising that once matters were resolved they would all go over together. Fengjie then dispatched her maid to recall her own attendants and then sent one of her maids to accompany her to manage affairs covertly. Meanwhile, the household buzzed with rumors. Many remarked, “Look how virtuous she has become!” Some among the sisters, seeing that everyone in the garden was happy and content, felt reassured that they, too, had found their place. Yet three days later, a maid named Shanjie grew discontent with her tasks. You Er said, “If we run out of head oil, go and tell Second Grandmother to bring some.” Shanjie retorted, “Second Grandmother! Have you no sense? Our Grandmother has always catered to the ladies at home and now is expected to cover for both sides! With so many relatives—hundreds of men and women—each day there are countless tasks, both large and small. Outside, starting with the empress herself and extending to dukes and marquises, the favors and monetary gifts are immense. Within our own family, our kin manage all these affairs; if a single word were uttered about such trivial matters, wouldn’t it be a scandal? I advise you to let it be!” Hearing this, You Er’s heart sank. In the end, even though Shanjie grew timid and eventually feared bringing food to her mistress, the matter remained unresolved for days. Meanwhile, word came that it was Baoyu’s birthday. The celebrations were far more modest than in years past—since Wang Xifeng was absent, there was no grand merrymaking. At dawn, Baoyu rose, washed and dressed, and proceeded to the front courtyard where four attendants—Li Gui and three others—had already arranged incense and candles. Baoyu lit incense, performed his ritual bows, offered tea and burned paper, then visited the ancestral halls of the Ning mansion’s ancestral temple. On the moon terrace, he respectfully bowed to Grandmother, Jia Zheng, Wang Xifeng, and others. In sequence, he went to the You household’s upper room, performed his rites and sat for a while, then proceeded to the Rong mansion.
Grandmother Jia instructed, “You know our family’s rules—there is never any squabbling between in-laws over status or face. Now that you have been entrusted to manage matters between the two families, do not be stingy, yet do not overspend—make sure that everything is handled properly for me.” The matrons readily agreed. Aunt Xue was delighted beyond measure and hurried home to send over an invitation letter to the Ning residence. Lady Xing, well aware of Lady Xing’s (her own) temperament, originally did not wish to get involved, but having been personally instructed by Grandmother Jia, she had no choice but to agree—only carefully considering Lady Xing’s wishes as she proceeded. Aunt Xue was a matter-of-fact sort, and was rather easy to deal with. But that is another story. Now that Aunt Xue had arranged for Xing Xiuyan as her daughter-in-law, the entire household knew it. Lady Xing originally intended to take Xiuyan out to live with them, but Grandmother Jia said, “What harm is there? The two children will hardly ever see each other anyway—even if one has a stepmother, an elder sister, or a younger sister; besides, they are both girls, and thus will be close.” Lady Xing finally consented. As for Xue Pan and Xiuyan, they had once met on the road and had both felt that everything was to their liking. Yet Xiuyan was somewhat reserved compared to before and found it hard to chat casually with the Baochai sisters; furthermore, with Xiangyun prone to teasing, she felt awkward. Fortunately, Xiuyan was well-educated and refined. Though a daughter, she was not one to feign shyness or behave affectedly. Baochai, since that day, had noted her, partly out of sympathy for her poor family background; besides, while other parents were of advanced age and of refined character, her own parents were as if steeped in wine—and Lady Xing was interested more in appearances than genuine affection. Moreover, Xiuyan was modest, and Yingchun was a simple, honest girl. Even though Xiuyan herself was not fully managed by her own household, she never complained. In secret, Baochai always discreetly helped her, not daring to let Lady Xing know, for fear of idle gossip. Yet now the unexpected, fortunate match had come about. In her heart Xiuyan already held Baochai in high regard; at times she would chat lightly with Baochai, and Baochai would call her “little sister.”  That day, Baochai went to see Daiyu and happened to encounter Xiuyan on the way. Baochai smiled and called her over; the two walked together. Reaching a stone wall, Baochai teased, “It’s so cold today—why are you wearing a different kind of waistcoat?” Xiuyan, caught off guard, lowered her head and gave no reply. Baochai immediately sensed that something must be amiss, and asked with a smile, “Surely it must be that your monthly allowance has fallen short again—now even Sister Feng has no ideas?”  Xiuyan replied, “He intended to give a good sum on a proper day. My aunt sent word that we need not use more than two taels per month, and to set aside one tael for our parents—after all, among the things you receive, even the items for your two elder sisters must be enough. Sister, you know that our second sister is so honest she never pays close attention. Though I am in the household, I dare not be too demanding of them. In a few days I’ll have to put out some money to treat them to wine and snacks. Thus, two taels a month are not enough. And now they have taken away an extra tael—in fact, just the other day I secretly had my cotton garments valued at a few taels as travel expenses.”  Baochai listened and sighed in distress, “But the Mei family is also residing here, and they are not arriving until the year after next. If things were as they were before, we could have discussed your matter further—but without her here, it’s over. Now, not only can her sister’s matter not be settled, but you dare not marry first either. This is truly a predicament. If we delay another two years, I fear you will suffer so much that you may fall ill again. Let me discuss it further with mother.”  Baochai then pointed to a jade pendant on Xiuyan’s skirt and asked, “Who gave you that?”  Xiuyan answered, “It was given by Third Sister.”  Baochai nodded, “I noticed everyone has one except you—perhaps she feared you’d be teased, so she sent you one.
I only blurted a word in passing.” Xiren and Qingwen laughed, “Let’s not humiliate him—when he’s at play, he calls out names; but when it comes to serious occasions, it’s as proper as ever.” The Lin household person said, “That’s best—that’s how a cultured scholar behaves. The more modest you are, the more respect you command. Not only among the descendants of several generations, but even the cats and dogs in the mistress’s room wouldn’t dare slight him. That is what it means to be properly educated.” After finishing their tea, he said, “Now, please rest. We’re leaving.” Baoyu added, “Let’s rest a bit longer.” The Lin household person then led everyone off to check other matters. Meanwhile, inside, Qingwen and the others quickly closed the door. Xiren then came in with a laugh, “Did that old lady have a drink? All that prattling and fussing—you made a scene for us again!” Miaoyue teased, “Was it done out of goodwill? It seems she always carries a few words with her, as if she fears losing her grandeur.” They set out wine and snacks. Xiren suggested, “No need for a high table—let’s just set that round huangli (rosewood) table on the Kang (heated platform); it’s both spacious and convenient.” Sure enough, they brought it in. Miaoyue and Fourth Maid went off to fetch fruits, using two large tea trays and carrying them over in several trips. Two older maids squatted by the brazier outside, sifting wine. Baoyu remarked, “It’s so hot—let’s all take off our coats.” Everyone laughed, “If you take yours off, we’ll all follow suit and then arrange our seats.” Baoyu said, “If we’re seated now, it will be until the early hours of dawn. You know I hate all these formalities in front of outsiders—it bothers me. If they start giving me grief now, it won’t do.” Everyone agreed. Soon, no sooner had they finished their makeup and undressed than they began to remove their formal attire. In a short time, everyone had casually tied up their hair; most wore only their fitted jackets. Baoyu himself was in a bright red, soft-silk jacket over green satin trousers with loose hems, tied with a sweatband. He rested against a new jade-colored, floral-embroidered, gauzy pillow, flanked by the Flower Official. At that moment, the Flower Official was complaining about the heat; he wore only a small, patched jacket of three-tone satin with a modest sweatband and water-red trousers with scattered cuffs. His hair was plaited neatly into a small braid across his forehead, with a single small jade earring in his right ear and a rigid, red, gold-inlaid pendant the size of a walnut in his left—a look that made him appear as pale and round as a full moon, with eyes clear as autumn water. This appearance drew many jokes: “They do look like a pair of twin brothers!” Xiren poured wine for him and said, “Please, drink a little more.” Soon, Xiangyun won a drinking game against Baoyu; Xiren bested Ping’er, and rounds of toasts were exchanged. Then Xiangyun declared, “For the toast on the wine’s surface, we need one line of ancient text, one of an old poem, one domino name, one tune title, and one line from a government decree—all to form a verse. And the base of the toast should mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so verbose! But it has a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed and said, “Who said so? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily while Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies alongside the solitary falcon; A fierce wind sweeps the river and sky, and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can break one’s stride, Stirring one’s innermost being; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse.
Better to lock it so that even Mother and I are confined, and no one can wander off. If anything does happen, we cannot blame those outside.” Baoyu laughed, “So you know that recently our household has lost items?” Baochai replied, “You only know about the rose dew and poria snow—but there are others as well. In the future, if nothing goes missing, it will be our good fortune; if things do go missing, who knows how many will be implicated? You never meddle in these affairs, which is why I’m telling you now. Ping’er is very sensible—I already told her that with Grandmother away, she must be extra vigilant. If nothing untoward occurs, no one will lose face; but if something does, then the record will be set and Ping’er won’t be blamed. Just heed my words and be cautious. And don’t let this be told to a single other person.”  With that, they arrived at the Qin Fang Pavilion. There, by the edge of the pavilion, Xiren, Xiangling, the clerk, Qingwen, Miaoyue, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and several others were gathered watching the fish. When they saw them coming, someone called out, “The peony screen has been set up—hurry, take your seats!” Baochai and the others then led the group into one of the three small open halls of the Red Fragrance Courtyard, where even Aunt You had already been invited. Everyone was present except for Ping’er, who had gone out to receive gifts from the You, Lin, and other families; one gift followed another, as is the custom with the numerous relatives paying their respects. Ping’er busied herself distributing reward money and offering thanks; later she reported to Fengjie, accepting some items while refusing others, and giving away what she did accept. After a while—and only after Fengjie had finished her noodles—she changed clothes and returned to the garden. No sooner had she entered the garden than several maids came to fetch her; together they proceeded into the Red Fragrance Courtyard. The banquet was splendidly laid out on a tortoiseshell tray with lotus and hibiscus cushions, and everyone exclaimed, “The Longevity Star is complete!” At the top, four seats were reserved for four individuals, yet none would sit. Aunt Xue said, “Heavens, it does not suit your little group! I feel so constrained—I might as well retire to the hall and lie down for a while. I can’t eat much nor drink heavily; this arrangement is too awkward for me.” Aunt You and the others insisted otherwise. Baochai remarked, “That’s fine; let Mother relax in the hall. If she has an appetite, send some food over. Besides, no one outside is around to monitor.” Tanchun laughed, “In that case, obedience is as good as compliance.” They then escorted her to the meeting hall. After the young maids spread out a brocaded mat with cushions and pillows, Tanchun instructed, “Be sure to massage the Mistress’s feet. Provide tea and water without delay. Once you deliver the gifts, let the Mistress eat and reward you—and do not stray from here.” The little maids all agreed, and Tanchun and the others soon departed. Afterwards, Baoyu, Xiangyun, and the others sat at a table: Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Ping’er at one table (with Baoyu facing east and Ping’er facing west). Tanchun then called Yuanyang to join her side. At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was reserved for Aunt You and Li Wan, accompanied by Xiren and Caiyun. A final table was arranged for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun proposed that they perform a drinking game. Baoqin and four others remarked, “With all this commotion, we couldn’t possibly sit still all day!” Before long, two of the girls were scheduled to perform a song for the birthday, while others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes—go up and entertain the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue.
The following day, he headed back, going first to see Second Sister. She ran the household strictly, keeping the gates shut and hearing no outside gossip. True to her vow, Third Sister devoted herself daily to serving their mother, spending the rest of her time with her sister, working. Even though Jia Zhen tried to sneak over twice while Jia Lian was away, Second Sister always made excuses not to see him. As for Third Sister, Jia Zhen already knew her temper and didn’t dare pester her again, so he gradually stopped coming. When Jia Lian arrived and saw them both so virtuous and composed, he was overjoyed and grateful to Second Sister. They exchanged pleasantries, and Jia Lian told them about meeting Liu Xianglian. He took out the Mandarin Duck Sword and handed it to Third Sister. She examined the ornate dragons and protective designs inlaid with precious stones. Pulling the blade from its scabbard, she discovered that it was actually two swords fitting together as one. One blade was engraved with “Mandarin,” the other with “Duck.” Both gave off a chill shine like two streaks of autumn water. Ecstatic, Third Sister carefully hung them in her boudoir by the bed, gazing at them daily and feeling she now had a secure future. Jia Lian stayed two days, then returned to report to his father and greet the entire household. By that time, Wang Xifeng had fully recovered and was running household affairs again. Jia Lian told Jia Zhen about the wedding plans. Jia Zhen, recently distracted by a new fling and annoyed with how coldly the sisters had treated him, shrugged the matter off. He gave Jia Lian free rein but did provide him with some silver to cover wedding expenses. Jia Lian passed the money to Second Sister, who used it to prepare Third Sister’s trousseau. In the eighth month, Liu Xianglian did indeed arrive in the capital and first called on Aunt Xue. Meeting Xue Pan again, he found that Xue Pan had been ill ever since he got back, unused to the northern climate and water. Hearing that Liu Xianglian had arrived, Xue Pan invited him into his sickroom. Aunt Xue bore no grudge for past events; she only felt deep gratitude for her son’s rescue, and both mother and son thanked Xianglian profusely. They also discussed the proposed match, saying everything was prepared and only the date needed to be set. Xianglian expressed his gratitude. The next day, he went to see Baoyu, and the two of them were as close as fish to water. Xianglian asked about the matter of Jia Lian secretly taking a second wife, and Baoyu laughed. “I heard a bit from Beiming, but I’ve never seen her. I can’t get involved, and besides, I heard from Beiming that my Second Brother has been searching for you. Not sure what he wants.” Xianglian then related everything that had happened on the road. Baoyu smiled. “That’s wonderful—what good news! You’re getting a rare beauty, truly unmatched, perfect for someone like you.” Xianglian said, “I’m puzzled that they sought me out. She must have no shortage of suitors. And I’m not exactly tight with Jia Lian. Why did he press me so hard during our brief roadside meeting? Could the girl’s family actually be chasing after the groom? Afterward, I felt uneasy about leaving the sword as a pledge. That’s why I came to you, to find out the truth.” Baoyu laughed. “You’re overthinking it. You wanted a rare beauty, right? Now you have one. No need to doubt.” Xianglian said, “You say she’s a rare beauty, but how do you know, if you don’t even know her background?” Baoyu said, “She’s the younger sister of my cousin-in-law from the Eastern Mansion, both brought by their stepmother. I was with them for over a month. They truly are two stunning women, and their surname is You.” Xianglian, hearing this, stomped his foot and exclaimed, “This isn’t good—no way. I absolutely refuse. Everyone in your Ning Mansion is filthy, except maybe the pair of stone lions at the gate!” Baoyu turned red. Xianglian realized his slip and quickly bowed, saying, “I deserve to die for talking such nonsense.
Mrs. Wang, busy with congratulatory and condolence visits, found herself unable to spare time for proper supervision. Thus, the two ladies (Tan Chun and Li Wan) ended up spending every day in that meeting hall, while Baochai was appointed to supervise from the upper room until Mrs. Wang returned. Every night, before retiring, the two would board a sedan chair along with the night-watch servants to inspect the grounds. In this way, the two became even more scrupulous than Xifeng had ever been in power. Consequently, both the inner and outer servants grumbled in secret, remarking, “Earlier we lost one ‘night patrol demon’ and now we’ve added three ‘mountain-stabilizing old gods’—now even the time the servants secretly spend drinking and playing cards at night is reduced!”   On that very day, Mrs. Wang was set to attend a banquet at the residence of Marquis Jinxiang. After Li Wan and Tan Chun had been groomed and seen off, they returned to the meeting hall. While having tea, the wife of Wu Xindeng entered and announced, “Zhao Yiniang’s brother, Zhao Guoji, had an accident yesterday. He has already reported to Old Madam and to the ladies. He has instructed that the young lady be called back.” After saying this, she quietly took her place at the side and said no more. By that time, many were buzzing about, all eager to know how the two were managing their responsibilities. If they handled things properly, everyone would be reassured; if there were even slight mishaps, not only would they not be obeyed, but word would spread in the form of many amusing anecdotes. Wu Xindeng’s wife, who already had her mind made up, would have, if Xifeng were in charge, by now offered many suggestions and even cited many old precedents for Feng’s consideration—but now that she regarded Li Wan as too honest and Tan Chun as too young, she chose to offer only one remark, to test their judgment. Tan Chun then asked Li Wan, and after a moment’s thought, Li Wan said, “The other day when Xiangren’s mother died, I heard that she was awarded 40 taels of silver. Let’s also award her 40 taels.” Wu Xindeng’s wife, upon hearing this, quickly nodded “Yes” and then departed after exchanging a couple of pleasantries. Tan Chun then said, “Please come back.” Wu Xindeng’s household had to return. Tan Chun continued, “Now, don’t rush to spend any silver. Let me ask you this: In past years, for our Old Aunts—both those in our household and those external—what amount was awarded when one died? Tell us the amounts for each case.” Upon asking, Wu Xindeng’s family could not recall and only laughed awkwardly, replying, “It isn’t a big matter—awards are given in varying amounts, and who would dare dispute them?” Tan Chun laughed and said, “That is absurd. In my opinion, awarding 100 taels would be proper! If we don’t follow tradition, not only will you be ridiculed now, but even tomorrow you may scarcely face your Second Aunt!” Wu Xindeng’s family blushed deeply and quickly withdrew. The wives all stuck out their tongues in disapproval. Soon thereafter, another matter was raised: Wu Xindeng’s family produced their old account books. Tan Chun examined them and found that for those who were in-house, the awards had been 20 taels each; for those from outside, 40 taels each. In addition, there were two “outside” cases—one awarded 100 taels and another 60 taels. The reasons behind these two cases were as follows: one pertained to the relocation of a parent’s coffin across provinces (rewarded 60 taels), and the other related to purchasing burial land (rewarded 20 taels). Tan Chun handed the account to Li Wan and said, “Give him 20 taels of silver and keep these records for further examination.” Wu Xindeng’s family left. Just then, Zhao Yiniang entered. Li Wan and Tan Chun hurriedly offered their seats. Zhao Yiniang began, “All of you here in this room should be kicked down for all the trouble you’ve caused me! Young lady, think about it: shouldn’t you stand up for me?” She burst into tears with snot and lament.
Without proper support, you’d be nothing!”   Tan Chun, nearly choking on her tears, cried, “Who is my uncle? My uncle was promoted to the high-ranking inspector of nine provinces long ago! Now, how could another uncle appear? I have always observed propriety—how can I now begin to honor these relatives? When your uncles go out every day, why does Zhao Guoji suddenly stand up to attend your classes? Why doesn’t he provide the customary funds? Oh, how pitiful! Everyone knows I was raised by my aunt—but then, after a couple of months, wouldn’t someone eventually find an excuse to completely vent their anger? It would be best if I could openly confess everything, so that there would be no shame! But then, who will be left without shame?”   Li Wan hurriedly tried to soothe her, but Zhao Yiniang continued her lament. Suddenly, someone announced, “Second Aunt has sent Ping’er to speak!” Zhao Yiniang quickly stifled her sobs. Soon, Ping’er entered. Zhao Yiniang quickly smiled and offered her a seat, then asked anxiously, “How is your grandmother faring? I was about to go see her but was pressed for time.” Li Wan, upon seeing Ping’er, asked, “What brings you here?” Ping’er replied with a smile, “Grandmother said that Zhao Yiniang’s brother has passed away, and she feared that neither she nor the young ladies would be aware of our old custom. Under normal circumstances, only 20 taels would be awarded—but now, please have the girls decide if a larger amount should be given.” Tan Chun, having just wiped away her tears, said, “What need is there to add any extra? Who was reared for 24 months? Otherwise, these are the expenses for those who marched off to battle or fled with their masters—no one is like that. Your master was so fortunate as to let me set up the precedent, so that when he does good, he can receive the money that Madam does not care to spend. If you suggest adding money, let him add it at his leisure when he’s well out and about!”   By this time, Ping’er had clearly understood the half of it. Seeing Tan Chun frown, she could only lower her head silently. At that moment, Baochai from the upper room entered, and Tan Chun and Li Wan quickly stood to offer seats. Before they could speak, one of the wives entered to inquire about something; because Tan Chun had been crying earlier, a few little maids soon followed with basin, handkerchiefs, and small mirrors and powder boxes. At that moment, Tan Chun—who was sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch—had a maid approach with a basin. The maid knelt on both knees and presented the basin; two other little maids also knelt with handkerchiefs and small mirrors with powder and ornaments. Seeing that the official secretary was absent, Ping’er hurried over, helped Tan Chun remove her bracelets, and even handed her a large handkerchief to cover her exposed bosom. Only then did Tan Chun extend her hand to the basin to wash her face. The wife then remarked, “Madam, the annual allowance for those at Zhi Huan’s Academy—supporting Brother Huan and Brother Lan—is…”   Ping’er interrupted with a laugh, “What are you doing? I saw the young lady washing her face with your own eyes; if you do not go and attend to her, then you should be the one to speak up first! When Second Aunt is present, you should not behave so rudely! I must go back to Second Aunt and tell her that in your eyes, the young lady is not being valued—otherwise, you’ll be blamed for losing face!” The wife, taken aback, quickly apologized with a smile and withdrew. Tan Chun, after smoothing her face, glared coldly at Ping’er and said, “You’re a step behind—I barely caught the tail end of a laugh, and now someone else is making fun of us! Even Sister Wu, who has long been in charge, did not thoroughly investigate before joining us. Fortunately, when we inquired, he had the nerve to say ‘I forgot’—and I thought, ‘Has Second Aunt’s matter been so forgotten that we must search again?’ I doubt your master will have the patience to go and search for him!” Ping’er laughed, “If he were that insistent, I guarantee his leg tendons would have snapped by now.
The more modest you are, the more respect you command. Not only among the descendants of several generations, but even the cats and dogs in the mistress’s room wouldn’t dare slight him. That is what it means to be properly educated.” After finishing their tea, he said, “Now, please rest. We’re leaving.” Baoyu added, “Let’s rest a bit longer.” The Lin household person then led everyone off to check other matters. Meanwhile, inside, Qingwen and the others quickly closed the door. Xiren then came in with a laugh, “Did that old lady have a drink? All that prattling and fussing—you made a scene for us again!” Miaoyue teased, “Was it done out of goodwill? It seems she always carries a few words with her, as if she fears losing her grandeur.” They set out wine and snacks. Xiren suggested, “No need for a high table—let’s just set that round huangli (rosewood) table on the Kang (heated platform); it’s both spacious and convenient.” Sure enough, they brought it in. Miaoyue and Fourth Maid went off to fetch fruits, using two large tea trays and carrying them over in several trips. Two older maids squatted by the brazier outside, sifting wine. Baoyu remarked, “It’s so hot—let’s all take off our coats.” Everyone laughed, “If you take yours off, we’ll all follow suit and then arrange our seats.” Baoyu said, “If we’re seated now, it will be until the early hours of dawn. You know I hate all these formalities in front of outsiders—it bothers me. If they start giving me grief now, it won’t do.” Everyone agreed. Soon, no sooner had they finished their makeup and undressed than they began to remove their formal attire. In a short time, everyone had casually tied up their hair; most wore only their fitted jackets. Baoyu himself was in a bright red, soft-silk jacket over green satin trousers with loose hems, tied with a sweatband. He rested against a new jade-colored, floral-embroidered, gauzy pillow, flanked by the Flower Official. At that moment, the Flower Official was complaining about the heat; he wore only a small, patched jacket of three-tone satin with a modest sweatband and water-red trousers with scattered cuffs. His hair was plaited neatly into a small braid across his forehead, with a single small jade earring in his right ear and a rigid, red, gold-inlaid pendant the size of a walnut in his left—a look that made him appear as pale and round as a full moon, with eyes clear as autumn water. This appearance drew many jokes: “They do look like a pair of twin brothers!” Xiren poured wine for him and said, “Please, drink a little more.” Soon, Xiangyun won a drinking game against Baoyu; Xiren bested Ping’er, and rounds of toasts were exchanged. Then Xiangyun declared, “For the toast on the wine’s surface, we need one line of ancient text, one of an old poem, one domino name, one tune title, and one line from a government decree—all to form a verse. And the base of the toast should mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so verbose! But it has a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed and said, “Who said so? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily while Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies alongside the solitary falcon; A fierce wind sweeps the river and sky, and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can break one’s stride, Stirring one’s innermost being; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut kernel and recited as the wine’s base:  “Hazelnuts are not the clattering stones beyond the courtyard— How then comes the sound of a thousand households pounding laundry?” And that settled the round. Yuanyang, Xiren, and others then recited common sayings—each including the word “longevity”—without further ado.
It is not as if I have contracted consumption!”  Bao Yu, at his wit’s end, had no choice but to leave. Later that afternoon, feeling that his condition was worsening, he returned. Although Qingwen’s illness was severe, her natural habit of exerting strength without engaging her heart—and her long-practiced, frugal diet which had protected her from hunger—meant that even the notorious “secret methods” in the Jia household, whether for the servants above or below, usually resulted only in a mild wind-cold or cough that was treated chiefly by fasting and modest medicine. Thus, when she had fallen ill the previous day, she had fasted for two or three days and taken her medicine very cautiously. Now, though fatigued by recent labors and having been under additional care for several days, she was gradually recovering. In recent days the sisters in the garden had been eating and enjoying their meals with ease—and Bao Yu himself could regulate his own broth without fuss (details need not be recounted). After Xiangren had seen off her own mother’s funeral, she had returned. Meiyue then informed her about the incident with the lost bracelet—how “Qingwen had been driven out by her and later Bao Yu had been told of it,” and so on. Xiangren merely remarked, “She is always so impatient.”  Meanwhile, Li Wan too had caught a cold from the wintry weather; Mrs. Xing was on high alert, and Yingchun and Xiuyan had all gone to attend to their medicines; while Aunt Li’s younger brother had taken Aunt Li, Li Wen, and Li Qi away to stay for a few days. With Xiangren so often melancholic over missing her own mother and Qingwen still not fully recovered, the poetry society had lost its usual lively spirit and a few gatherings were cancelled. Now it was the final month of the lunar year, and New Year’s was near. Mrs. Wang and Fengjie busied themselves with the year-end preparations. (Not to mention that Prince Zi had been promoted to a supervisory post over nine provinces, and Jia Yucun had been appointed as a high-ranking official—details need not be repeated.)  At Ningguo Mansion the ancestral shrine was being prepared: workers were busy cleaning and tidying the shrine, setting out the ritual implements, inviting the ancestral tablets, and arranging the upper halls so that the genuine portraits of the ancestors might be hung for the ceremony. At that moment both the Rongguo and Ningguo mansions, inside and out, were abuzz with activity. That day in the Ning Mansion, Mrs. You arose and, together with Jia Rong’s wife, arranged to deliver needlework gifts to Grandmother. At the same time a little maid arrived carrying a tea tray along with the New Year “money” (small ingots) as a token. She reported, “Xing’er has returned to Grandmother; also, that broken gold collection from before – altogether, it weighs 153 taels, 6 qian, and 7 fen, with pieces of varying purity – has yielded a total of 220 ingots.” She then handed them over. Mrs. You inspected the items and saw designs of plum blossoms, of begonia, of “Pen-Stroke Ruyi,” and of “Eight Treasures in Spring”; she ordered, “Pack these away and have Xing’er hurry and deliver the silver ingots.” The maid answered and went off. Before long Jia Zhen entered to eat. Jia Rong’s wife stayed aside. Jia Zhen then asked Mrs. You, “Have we received the New Year’s tribute for the spring sacrifice yet?” Mrs. You replied, “I have sent Rong’er away with it.” Jia Zhen said, “Even though our family does not require many taels of silver, we must accept the imperial grace. Pack it up and send it to the old lady, so that our ancestors’ offerings may be properly prepared and we, in turn, may receive the Emperor’s blessings – for the benefit of our ancestors and to share in our clan’s fortune. Even if one were to spend ten thousand taels on the ancestral sacrifice, it is still more dignified and suffused with blessing than this. Moreover, among those impoverished, the hereditary officials, if they do not have this silver, how can they present a proper offering at New Year? Truly, the imperial grace is boundless – it must be thoroughly considered.” Mrs.
Even Sister Wu, who has long been in charge, did not thoroughly investigate before joining us. Fortunately, when we inquired, he had the nerve to say ‘I forgot’—and I thought, ‘Has Second Aunt’s matter been so forgotten that we must search again?’ I doubt your master will have the patience to go and search for him!” Ping’er laughed, “If he were that insistent, I guarantee his leg tendons would have snapped by now. Do not trust them too easily. They are watching Second Aunt as if she were a bodhisattva, and you, being a bashful young lady, are merely riding on our coattails.” In a low voice, she added, “Now, go outside and let everyone frolic—when Grandmother is well, we shall discuss it further.” The wives outside all laughed. At that moment, Autumn (Qiu Wen) arrived. The wives quickly came forward to greet her, and she said, “Dear sisters, please rest awhile—the meal is being set out. Once the tables are cleared, we can resume our conversation.” Autumn laughed, “I have no time to wait!” and promptly headed for the main hall. Ping’er called out, “Come back quickly!” Autumn turned, saw Ping’er, and laughed, “What are you doing here, playing gatekeeper?” She then returned to sit on Ping’er’s mat. In a hushed tone, Ping’er asked, “What did you want to ask?” Autumn replied, “I’m wondering about Bao Yu’s monthly stipend—how early or late do we receive ours?” Ping’er said, “It isn’t a major matter! Just go back and tell Xiangren what I said: whatever happens today, don’t return any items. If one item is returned, then a hundred items will be returned. (That is, any discrepancy will be repaid one-for-one.)”   Autumn, puzzled, asked, “Why is that?” Ping’er and the wives explained the details, adding, “We are planning to set up a few measures for handling urgent matters and establishing clear guidelines so as to prevent disputes among everyone. Why must you all bring up this trivial issue now? Once you mention it, they may very well use it as an example and, in doing so, burden you all further. Just listen—regarding Second Aunt’s case, they might even demand you provide two more examples to silence the crowd.”   Hearing this, Autumn extended her tongue and laughed, “Thank goodness, dear sister, that you are here—otherwise, I’d be utterly embarrassed. Now go back and tell them!” With that, she got up and left. Not long after, Baochai’s meal was ready, and Ping’er rushed back to serve. At that time Zhao Yiniang had already departed; the three of them (Ping’er, Baochai, and Tan Chun) were sitting on a low wooden bed—with Baochai facing south, Tan Chun to the west, and Li Wan facing east. All the wives waited quietly in the corridor, attended only by the maids assigned to the official secretary’s group; no one else dared to intrude. The wives whispered among themselves, “Let’s not get carried away—don’t be heartless! Even Sister Wu has been given too little; what sort of face do we have?” They continued their hushed conversation until after the meal, when not even the sound of clinking bowls or cutlery could be heard inside. Suddenly, one maid lifted the curtain high; shortly thereafter, two others carried in tables from outside. In the tea room, three maids came in carrying three basins. When they saw that the meal table had been set out, all three entered. After a while, they returned with basins and washbasins, and the official secretary then commanded the little maid, “Attend well—while we eat, keep exchanging items without letting anyone sneak off to sit by themselves.” The wives then quietly resumed their conversation, no longer as inattentive as before. Tan Chun’s anger gradually subsided, and she said to Ping’er, “I have a major matter that I have long meant to discuss with Grandmother. Once you have finished your meal, come quickly. Bao Yu’s dear sister is also here; let the four of us discuss it, and then ask Grandmother whether it is acceptable.” Ping’er agreed and went away.
Moreover, when the gathering disperses and the young men retire to their beds, if their bedding is cold and tea is scarce, then everything will be in disarray. Naturally, if they come back in that state, I shall not have them return. But if our ancestors demand their presence, then I shall call them back!”  Grandmother, delighted by Fengjie’s careful planning, said, “You speak truly—you always plan so thoroughly. But pray, tell me: how long has it been since her mother passed? How could I not know?” Fengjie laughed and replied, “Just the other day, Xiangren went back to see Old Madam herself—but how could I possibly forget?” Grandmother thought for a moment and then laughed, “My memory really is not what it used to be!” Everyone burst into laughter, exclaiming, “Our Grandmother never forgets such things!”  Then Grandmother sighed, “I recall how she served me faithfully from her childhood—first attending to Yun, and later even giving us what might be called a ‘demon-king’ as her charge. She has bewitched us for many years. Yet she is not one of our native servants, for she has not received our great benefactions; now that her own mother is gone, I had intended to send her a few taels of silver in honor of her lost mother—but I forgot.” Fengjie interjected, “But Old Madam awarded her forty taels the other day—that is sufficient!” Grandmother nodded, “That is fine. Incidentally, the other day, the mother of Yuanyang also passed away; I understand her paternal side is in the south, and I did not instruct her household to observe mourning. Now that she has been honored in both respects, why not have her accompany someone as a partner?” She then ordered the servants to bring out some fruits, dishes, and snacks for the pair to share. Huangbo remarked, “Already? She must have left long ago!” And so the gathering resumed with more drinking and viewing of the play. Meanwhile, Bao Yu returned to the garden. The old maids, upon seeing him return to his room, did not follow him but instead sat in the tea room by the garden gate to warm themselves by the fire while the tea-serving women secretly sipped wine and played cards. When Bao Yu reached the courtyard, although the lanterns burned brilliantly, there was not a sound to be heard. Meiyue whispered, “Have they all gone to sleep?” Then someone suggested, “Let’s sneak in and give them a little scare!” So everyone tiptoed silently and crept behind a lattice partition to peer inside. They saw Xiangren and another person slumped on the heated platform, with two old maids beating on one end. Only after confirming that two were indeed asleep did Bao Yu decide to approach. Suddenly, he heard Yuanyang cough and exclaim, “Truly, nothing is ever certain in this world! You, left alone while your parents are away—year after year they wander without a fixed course; I fear you will never see your own end. And yet this very year you die here—go, take your own funeral!” Xiangren added, “Exactly! I never imagined I would be forced to witness my parents’ burial. After Madam distributes her silver—forty taels no less—it will be considered a service to me, and I dare not expect more.” Alarmed, Bao Yu quickly turned away and whispered to Meiyue, “Who would have thought he would come too? If he leaves in a huff again, perhaps we should retreat so that they may speak in peace. At least Xiangren will then have company.” With that, Bao Yu quietly slipped away. He then went behind some boulders to adjust his clothes. Meiyue and Qiuyun teased him, “Bend down and fix your garment—watch out, the wind might freeze your stomach!” Meanwhile, two little maids, realizing they were needed for minor tasks, hurried off to the tea room to fetch water. Not long after, Bao Yu encountered two young women approaching. One carried a small basin, while the other clutched a handkerchief and a small kettle—they had been waiting for quite some time. Soon, Xiangyun’s group arrived. Xiangyun teased, “Look, here comes another one! There’s no room left for you!” Bao Yu chuckled, “What a ‘Winter Boudoir Gathering’ indeed—alas, I have arrived too late.
Baoyu laughed and said, “Mother is right. I always sleep early, but whenever Mother comes in, I’m so unaware that I’ve already fallen asleep. Today, after eating noodles, I felt I couldn’t stop, so I played around a bit longer.” The Lin household person then joked with Xiren and the others, “I’ve heard that Second Master’s mouth has been swapping words all day; now even the young ladies are calling him by name. Although in this room we should always speak respectfully of our elders, if you casually blurt out a name at the wrong moment, your nephews and brothers might later mock you—imagine if your own elders end up with no respect!” Baoyu grinned, “Mother speaks truly. I only blurted a word in passing.” Xiren and Qingwen laughed, “Let’s not humiliate him—when he’s at play, he calls out names; but when it comes to serious occasions, it’s as proper as ever.” The Lin household person said, “That’s best—that’s how a cultured scholar behaves. The more modest you are, the more respect you command. Not only among the descendants of several generations, but even the cats and dogs in the mistress’s room wouldn’t dare slight him. That is what it means to be properly educated.” After finishing their tea, he said, “Now, please rest. We’re leaving.” Baoyu added, “Let’s rest a bit longer.” The Lin household person then led everyone off to check other matters. Meanwhile, inside, Qingwen and the others quickly closed the door. Xiren then came in with a laugh, “Did that old lady have a drink? All that prattling and fussing—you made a scene for us again!” Miaoyue teased, “Was it done out of goodwill? It seems she always carries a few words with her, as if she fears losing her grandeur.” They set out wine and snacks. Xiren suggested, “No need for a high table—let’s just set that round huangli (rosewood) table on the Kang (heated platform); it’s both spacious and convenient.” Sure enough, they brought it in. Miaoyue and Fourth Maid went off to fetch fruits, using two large tea trays and carrying them over in several trips. Two older maids squatted by the brazier outside, sifting wine. Baoyu remarked, “It’s so hot—let’s all take off our coats.” Everyone laughed, “If you take yours off, we’ll all follow suit and then arrange our seats.” Baoyu said, “If we’re seated now, it will be until the early hours of dawn. You know I hate all these formalities in front of outsiders—it bothers me. If they start giving me grief now, it won’t do.” Everyone agreed. Soon, no sooner had they finished their makeup and undressed than they began to remove their formal attire. In a short time, everyone had casually tied up their hair; most wore only their fitted jackets. Baoyu himself was in a bright red, soft-silk jacket over green satin trousers with loose hems, tied with a sweatband. He rested against a new jade-colored, floral-embroidered, gauzy pillow, flanked by the Flower Official. At that moment, the Flower Official was complaining about the heat; he wore only a small, patched jacket of three-tone satin with a modest sweatband and water-red trousers with scattered cuffs. His hair was plaited neatly into a small braid across his forehead, with a single small jade earring in his right ear and a rigid, red, gold-inlaid pendant the size of a walnut in his left—a look that made him appear as pale and round as a full moon, with eyes clear as autumn water. This appearance drew many jokes: “They do look like a pair of twin brothers!” Xiren poured wine for him and said, “Please, drink a little more.” Soon, Xiangyun won a drinking game against Baoyu; Xiren bested Ping’er, and rounds of toasts were exchanged. Then Xiangyun declared, “For the toast on the wine’s surface, we need one line of ancient text, one of an old poem, one domino name, one tune title, and one line from a government decree—all to form a verse.
At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was reserved for Aunt You and Li Wan, accompanied by Xiren and Caiyun. A final table was arranged for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun proposed that they perform a drinking game. Baoqin and four others remarked, “With all this commotion, we couldn’t possibly sit still all day!” Before long, two of the girls were scheduled to perform a song for the birthday, while others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes—go up and entertain the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue. Baoyu said, “A dignified seated celebration is dull—it is better to perform our ritual decrees.” Some suggested one type of decree; others suggested another. Daiyu remarked, “I propose that we write down all these various decrees on brush and ink, draw lots, and whoever’s chosen shall be the one. That will settle it!” Everyone exclaimed, “Splendid!” and they fetched a set of brush, ink, and floral stationery. Recently, Xiangling had been learning poetry and calligraphy; when she saw the materials she eagerly volunteered, “I’ll write!” After a short discussion, they ended up with about ten lots. They tossed the lots into a bottle, and Tanchun ordered Ping’er to draw one. Mixing them up with a stick, Ping’er pulled one out; when unwrapped, it bore the two characters “She Fu” (meaning “to play guessing games”). Baochai laughed, “You’ve drawn the old decree—‘She Fu’ is an ancient game now lost to time. It is so obscure that half the people won’t understand it. It might as well be discarded; let’s draw a new one that everyone, both refined and popular, can appreciate.” Tanchun laughed, “Once one is drawn, how can we destroy it? If we draw another, and it turns out pleasing, then let that be our decree.” She then had Xiren draw another lot, which came out as “Mu Zhan” (“Thumb Battle”). Xiangyun laughed, “That is crisp and to the point—it suits my taste perfectly. I cannot abide ‘She Fu’—it leaves me gloomy; I’d rather simply play rock–paper–scissors.” Tanchun said, “If he fails to recite the decree properly, Sister Baoqin should penalize him with a cup of wine!” Baochai, not willing to let the matter drop, quickly poured a cup for Xiangyun. Tanchun then announced, “I will have a cup as well; I am the official in charge of these decrees. No formal announcement is needed—just listen as I assign them. Fetch a dice bowl and let Sister Qin toss the dice. Whoever draws the number designated for ‘She Fu’ must accept the decree.” Baoqin tossed her dice and obtained a three. Xiuyun, Baoyu, and the others tossed but none hit the mark until Xiangling finally tossed a three. Baoqin laughed, “It seems that spring is born indoors—if we were to compare with the outside, it would be too chaotic.” Tanchun said, “Naturally. Anyone who fails three times in a row shall be penalized with a cup. Now, answer my decree.” Baoqin thought for a moment and pronounced the word “Old.” Xiangling, however, having grown up with such games, could not immediately think of an appropriate phrase—no idiom involving “old” came to mind. Xiangyun scanned the room and suddenly noticed on the door a plaque with the words “Hong Xiang Pu” (Red Fragrance Garden), and deduced that Baoqin must have meant the “garden” radical. Seeing that Xiangling could not guess, the others quietly urged her and taught her to say “Yao” (medicine) instead. Daiyu observed, “Quick—punish her! We must prevent this gossip from spreading!” Amid the commotion, Xiangling was penalized with a cup of wine.
Before long, the sound of footsteps announced that Jia Lian had returned. Ping’er quickly went out to greet him. Jia Lian, noticing Yuanyang seated in the hall, paused and, with a teasing smile, said, “Sister Yuanyang, today you have graced us with your presence in our humble abode!” Yuanyang, smiling in reply, said, “I came to pay my respects to the elders, though those who are not home may be sleeping.” Jia Lian chuckled, “Sister, you know our mother labors so hard for Grandmother every day—I hardly even notice you. Today, having feasted on noodles, I lost track of time. I only now recall that I must ask you—what has become of that precious item? Last year on Grandmother’s birthday, an itinerant monk presented her with a delicate, lacquered “Buddha’s Hand” made of cold, preserved lard. Grandmother, enchanted by it, displayed it. Recently, on her birthday again, I recalled an entry in the old account books mentioning this item, but now I cannot recall its whereabouts. The antiques department in our household has inquired twice, but I have yet to be told its location. So tell me, is it still with Grandmother or has it been passed along?” Yuanyang replied, “Grandmother grew tired of it after a few days, and she sent it along with some of our gifts; you may ask either our mother or Ping’er.” Jia Lian laughed, “Since Grandmother already passed it on, why did you let it slip by?” Ping’er, who had been arranging clothes, interjected quickly, “Grandmother did inform Second Master. Perhaps she wished to send it as a gift—yet I fear we might be remiss.” Jia Lian, lowering his head with a wry smile, clapped his hands and said, “I am so forgetful these days—always losing things and inviting criticism!” Yuanyang shook her head and then excused herself, “Sister, please go rest a while. I have another matter to discuss with you.” Jia Lian, now in high spirits, motioned for her to come closer. “Sister,” he said, “I have something pressing to ask of you. Please, quickly prepare a cup of fresh tea using yesterday’s new batch. We must settle this matter soon!” He then confided in her in low tones about the urgent financial difficulties facing the household: “These days, with Grandmother’s auspicious but demanding celebrations, our funds have been stretched thin. There are numerous rental payments and household expenses that won’t come due until September—and tomorrow we must send a tribute to the Southern An Mansion, plus prepare for the upcoming Double Ninth Festival. In all, we need at least two to three thousand taels of silver immediately. As the old saying goes, ‘It’s better to rely on oneself than to beg others.’ I fear that if I borrow any money, our elders will find fault with me.” Yuanyang laughed, “You’re ever so resourceful! How did you come by that idea?” Jia Lian grinned, “If only you had more silver in your hands, then we’d have it all covered. But alas, I fear it might be impossible—even if we needed three to five thousand taels, it might not suffice. I have no desire to borrow, yet I must—so I beg you, help me secure the funds!” Fengjie, who had been listening, interjected sharply, “I will never allow you to sully my reputation by taking such measures. If you’re forced to borrow money, you’ll be forever in debt—and our family’s honor would be at risk! How can you be so careless?” Jia Lian, stammering with both embarrassment and determination, replied, “Sister, if you have any silver to spare, even a few hundred taels would suffice. Surely, it won’t bring shame upon you!” Fengjie’s eyes flashed with indignation as she retorted, “Who cares about a few hundred taels? We must preserve my reputation at all costs. Besides, if our elders learn of this, I will be shamed for years to come!” At that moment, a servant came in with news: “Wang’er’s wife has arrived!” Fengjie then inquired, “Has it been settled?” The servant replied, “It has not worked out.
Only Bao Yu and Xiangyun were absent. Daiyu remarked, “They never seem to meet together; if they do, who knows what might occur? Perhaps they’ve already schemed over that venison!”  Just then, one of the maids announced, “Miss Li’s maid has come to look around!” Li Wan laughed, “Who exactly has arrived? Explain clearly—whose relative is it?” The maid replied, “It is one of Grandmother’s two younger sisters; there is also a young lady who claims to be Miss Xue’s sister, and a young man said to be the brother of Master Xue. Now I’m about to summon the concubine; Grandmother and the young ladies, please go up first.” With that, she left. Baochai teased, “So has our Xue Ke and his sister come as well?” Li Wan laughed, “Or perhaps my aunt has come up to the capital? How is it that everyone is gathered together? This is truly a wonder.”  After much courtesy and exchange of greetings, Grandmother, Mrs. Wang, and the other relatives were delighted. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns burst and reassembled over and over—it was all meant for today!” As they chatted about family matters, received the gifts that had been brought in, and arranged for wine and food to be served, Fengjie worked tirelessly. Li Wan and Baochai consoled one another over heartfelt farewells, and Daiyu, after initial delight, grew tearful remembering her loneliness; Bao Yu, understanding her heart, comforted her extensively. Later, Bao Yu and Daiyu retired to the Yíhóng Courtyard. Bao Yu, finding Daiyu still troubled by unspoken thoughts, softly encouraged her to share her worries. Meanwhile, the household bustled with preparations for a poetry gathering; Lady Li proposed that they compose poems to celebrate the coming of the new year. “Though it is late today,” she said, “if tomorrow comes and the weather clears, it will be no fun—but I doubt the snow will melt so quickly. Even if it does, tonight’s snowfall is plenty to admire.”  She then arranged for several silver coins—one or two taels per person—to be pooled for the festivities. After some discussion of poetic themes and rhyming schemes (with Bao Yu, Xiangyun, Tan Chun, and the others exchanging witty banter about the “immediate scene” and “five-character regulated verses” under a prescribed “Er Xiao” rhyme), the sisters and guests agreed on a theme and prepared their verses. That very morning, when dawn broke, Bao Yu, troubled by a sleepless night, rose early. Lifting the curtains, he expected sunlight—but instead, through the glass he saw that it was not sunlight at all but a blanket of snow nearly a foot thick, twirling like soft cotton in the sky. Overjoyed, Bao Yu called for his attendants. Quickly washed and dressed in a simple eggplant-colored woolen coat lined with fox fur, over which he donned a “Sea-Dragon” jacket, tied his waist, threw on a raincoat made of jade-needle fabric, and wore a golden-tasseled hat; then he mounted his sandalwood clogs and hurried off toward Lùxuě Ting. Exiting the courtyard and looking around, he saw nothing but dark green pines and bamboo in the distance—he felt as if he were enclosed in a glass basin. Soon he reached the foot of a hill and, turning the corner, caught a whiff of a crisp fragrance. Looking back, he discovered that at Miaoyu’s Lóngcuì Nunnery there were a dozen red plum blossoms, as red as rouge, set against the snow—a sight so vibrant and spirited it was most amusing. Bao Yu paused to admire them before continuing. On the narrow Bǎng Bridge, a person with an umbrella was approaching—sent by Li Wan to fetch Fengjie. Bao Yu arrived at Lùxuě Ting and found the maids busy clearing snow and paving a path. The garden, known as Lùxuě Ting, stood on a riverside sandbank beneath a hill, with several modest thatched structures, bamboo windows, and open thresholds from which one could fish. A winding path led from among the reeds to the bamboo bridge of Lǒu Xiāng Xiè. The maids and old women, upon seeing Bao Yu in his raincoat and hat, laughed, “We were just saying that we’re short one fisherman—and now he’s arrived!” Bao Yu, hearing this, had no choice but to return indoors.
Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four cream-filled pastry pieces, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such food?” He mixed the soup with rice, ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then half a bowl of porridge, and stopped. Baoyu, smelling the food, thought it tasted better than usual, and so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found extremely fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the leftovers. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it’s not enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “There’s no need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve had enough; no more is needed.” She then stood by the table, finished her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for me.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen also drink well, although they’re usually too shy—today, since we’re breaking our fast together, it’s fine.” Baoyu then remembered another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s case. Please speak with the Liu household and insist that she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it, and that will be the end of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is indeed a proper matter.” Spring Yan then called in two little maids to help wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part need not be detailed further). Baoyu then resumed his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters, with the Flower Official following, carrying his fan. Just as they stepped out, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set up the meal—we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted his earlier encounter at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company—it would add to the merriment.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox, where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you manage it without informing us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow if everyone leaves and leaves the Flower Official alone, that’ll be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you simply cannot go!” Qingwen retorted, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will mend it? Don’t go babbling on. I’m not fussing over you—if you never help out, then what? You’ve been gone for days, nearly risking your life, yet still come back empty-handed—what’s the point? Speak up already! Why act so foolishly and smile at me? That won’t do.” Qingwen spat in playful anger. Soon, everyone entered the hall. Aunt Xue also arrived, and all the ladies sat down to dine. Baoyu served a symbolic half-cup of tea-soaked rice. After the meal, everyone enjoyed tea and exchanged light banter and playful jokes. Outside, several young servants (including Xiao Luo, Xiangling, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and a few others) played in the garden, gathering flowers and plants and sitting amidst them in a game of “guess the plant.” One declared, “I have the Guanyin willow!” Another said, “I have the Arhat pine!” A third, “I have the Gentleman’s bamboo!” Yet another, “I have the calla of beauty!” One more said, “I have the sparkling emerald!” Another exclaimed, “I have the peony from The Peony Pavilion!” And yet another, “I have the pipa fruit from The Pipa Story!” Bean Official then declared, “I have the sisterly blossom!” When no one could top that, Xiangling said, “I have the ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ (Hui of Husband and Wife).” Bean Official retorted, “I’ve never heard of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’!” Xiangling explained, “When a single arrow yields one flower, it is called ‘Lan’; if it yields several, it is ‘Hui.’ If the flowers form a cluster at the top, that’s ‘Brotherhood Hui’; when they grow side by side, it is ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’ Mine, with two clusters side by side, is definitely ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’” Bean Official had no reply and got up laughing, “According to you, if one cluster is larger than the other, it would be ‘Old Man and Son Hui’!
Those monks are so filthy, I was afraid their smell would bother you’? And then, when he was drinking tea, you asked for some, and an old woman picked up his cup to pour for you; he quickly stopped her, saying, ‘That cup is dirty now—wash another one before filling it.’ From these two things alone, I kept an eye on him and saw that as long as he’s with the girls, he’ll do whatever’s needed. He just doesn’t follow the usual formalities with outsiders, so they don’t understand him.”  Second Sister You smiled. “From that, it sounds as if you two already have feelings for each other. Wouldn’t it be nice if we betrothed you to him?” Third Sister, noticing Xing’er’s presence, simply lowered her head and cracked melon seeds without speaking. Xing’er laughed, “In terms of looks and personality, they’d make a fine couple. But he’s already got someone, though it isn’t publicly known yet. The plan is likely set that he’ll marry Miss Lin. She’s often ill, and both of them are still young, so nothing’s been arranged yet, but give it a few years: once the Old Lady brings it up, no one would dare say no.”  They were still talking when Long’er came and said, “The Master has important business, something confidential, and wants Second Master to travel to Ping’an Prefecture. He’ll be leaving in three or five days and might be gone half a month. He’s not coming today. He asks Old Madam and Second Madam here to settle that matter with Miss Third Sister soon. Tomorrow, he’ll come and make a final decision.” With that, he took Xing’er along and left. Second Sister You had the gates shut and retired early. She questioned her younger sister through the night. By midday the next day, Jia Lian arrived. Second Sister advised him, “Since you have real business to tend to, you shouldn’t rush here and risk delaying it for my sake.” Jia Lian replied, “It’s not really pressing—it’s just that I suddenly have a faraway assignment. I’ll set out at the end of the month and be gone about half a month.” Second Sister said, “If that’s the case, then go with an easy mind. We’ll be fine here. As for Third Sister, she doesn’t change her mind like the wind. She’s chosen someone; you only need to agree.” Jia Lian hurriedly asked, “Who is it?” Second Sister laughed. “That person isn’t here now. Who knows when he’ll appear? She truly has an eye for such things. She said that if he doesn’t come for a year, she’ll wait a year; if he never comes, she’ll wait until death, at which time she’ll shave her head and become a nun. She’ll never marry if he doesn’t show up.” Jia Lian asked, “Who is this man who has so captivated her?” Second Sister said, “It’s a long story. Five years ago, our mother’s family held a birthday feast. Our mother took us along to pay respects, and they had a troupe of talented performers from a decent background. One of them, who specialized in playing the young scholar, was named Liu Xianglian. If he’s the one who appears, she’ll marry. I heard that last year he got into some trouble and fled, so we don’t even know if he’s back.”  Jia Lian responded, “That explains it. I wondered who it could be. It’s him! She does have good taste. You don’t know him—this Liu the Second is a rare gem, aloof and cold. He shows no emotion to most people, but he’s good friends with Baoyu. Last year, he got into a fight with that fool Xue Pan, and because of the awkwardness, he disappeared. I have no idea where he went or if he’s back. Someone mentioned he might have returned, but I’m not sure. I’ll ask Baoyu’s pages. If he truly hasn’t come, well…he’s a wanderer.
Fengjie then returned, agitated, to Grandmother Jia, exclaiming, “It is all because Sister You did not cancel the engagement properly—now someone has filed a complaint, and the officials are on our case!” Grandmother Jia immediately summoned Second Sister You and asked, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now a complaint has been lodged, what is the meaning of all this?” Second Sister You replied, “They even collected the silver—but it was never formalized!” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now claims he saw neither the silver nor anyone removing him. Yet his father insists that our relatives once agreed, but then reneged when the relative died—leaving us with nothing conclusive. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the news is out, how can we send him away without losing face?” Grandmother Jia mused, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our honor remains intact. Who, then, would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother paid him twenty taels on a certain day to cancel the betrothal, but in desperation he retracted his promise. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible wretches are hard to manage. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” At her wits’ end, Fengjie sent for Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, knowing well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim it would bring shame upon the family. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk inciting our elders to anger—use your silver to return home; any decent man can be found.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Soon, with the arranged sum, he and his father departed for their native home at daybreak. Later that evening, Fengjie went to see Grandmother Jia and recounted everything: “It is all due to Sister You’s mishandling—the engagement was never formally canceled, and now someone has filed a complaint, risking an official investigation!” Grandmother Jia summoned Second Sister You, asking again, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now there’s a complaint, what is the meaning of it all?” Second Sister You explained, “They even took the silver—how could nothing have been formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now insists he saw no silver or anyone removing him, while his father said that our relatives had once agreed but then reneged upon a death. Without firm evidence, we must let him spin his tale. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the matter is public, how can we send him away without disgrace?” Grandmother Jia remarked, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our reputation remains unblemished. Who then would dare to blame us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother, on a certain day, paid him twenty taels to cancel the engagement, yet in desperation he retracted his word. My sister was innocent.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Incorrigible ruffians are hard to manage indeed. Feng’er, please handle this matter.” Unable to resolve the issue, Fengjie turned to Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, fully aware of Fengjie’s intentions, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim, our family would suffer disgrace. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the arranged match? If you continue, you risk provoking our elders to such anger that you will have nowhere to turn. Simply return home—any decent match can be found. And if you leave, we will even reward you with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after considering the matter, agreed. Meanwhile, Jia Huan reported everything to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Pleased with the resolution, Jia Zhen awarded Jia Huan one hundred taels of silver and arranged for a seventeen‑year‑old maid, Autumn Tong, to be given as a concubine.
Li Wan said, “Yesterday Aunt Xue remarked that Sister Qin, who has seen much of the world, has traversed many paths—indeed, you should be composing more riddles. And since your poem was so fine, why not compose a few for us to guess?”  Baoqin, nodding with a smile, went off to think. Baochai also composed one and recited:    Carved layers of sandalwood and catalpa—are they not built up by the finest of craftsmen? Though half a day of wind and rain may pass, has one ever heard the chime of a Brahma bell? While the others guessed, Baoyu himself had one and said:    In the vastness of heaven and earth all is dim and vague,   Beware the tinkling jade pendants and their cautious clatter. The melodious tones of phoenix and crane demand one’s careful gaze—   So that one may sigh and answer to the heavens above. Daiyu also had one ready:    Why trouble with binding the purple cords? The force that sweeps a city and digs a moat is formidable. The master signals as winds and clouds stir—   While on the turtle’s back, three mountains stand in solitary fame. Not long after, Tan Chun too had composed one. Before he could recite, Baoqin approached laughing and said, “There are many ancient sites in the places I’ve roamed since childhood. I have selected ten such relics and composed ten ‘Nostalgia for Antiquity’ poems. Though their language is rough, they evoke past glories and subtly hide ten common motifs—sisters, please try to guess them!”  Everyone agreed, “How timely! Why not write them out for all to see?”  To learn the whole story, one must wait for the next installment. Chapter 51 At Lùxuě Ting, a Contest of Couplet Compositions on Immediate Scenery; At Nuanxiang Wu, an Elegant Gathering to Devise Spring Lamp Riddles  It happened that Baoqin announced that she had composed ten “reminiscent of antiquity” quatrains – each alluding subtly to ten classical objects – based on various historical sites she had visited in the provinces. All present marveled, exclaiming, “How innovative and clever! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing in the world is impossible to one who is determined.’ Our society will certainly make you a member!” Yet Xiangling, not fully convinced, suspected they were merely teasing her. She looked around for confirmation from Daiyu, Baochai, and the others. At that moment, several little maids and old servants rushed in, chattering and laughing, “A host of young ladies and mistresses have arrived! We scarcely recognize one another—hurry and introduce yourselves properly!” Li Wan laughed and inquired, “What exactly is meant? Explain clearly—whose relatives have come?” The maids and servants all burst into laughter and explained, “Grandmother’s two younger sisters are here; also present is a young lady said to be Miss Xue’s sister, and even a young man, purportedly Master Xue’s brother. I am now off to summon the concubine’s maid. Grandmother and the young ladies, please go upstairs first.” With that, they dispersed. Baochai teased, “Have our Xue Ke and his sister not come as well?” Li Wan laughed, “Or perhaps my aunt has come up to the capital? How is it that everyone seems to be gathered together? Truly a wondrous occurrence!”  Soon all assembled in Mrs. Wang’s upper room. The space was packed with a dark, pressing mass of people. Also, Mrs. Xing’s sister-in-law had arrived, bringing her daughter Xiuyan to be presented to Mrs. Xing. By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had come to support one another. Along the way, they encountered the widowed Li Wan accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—and the families soon found themselves chatting as relatives; thus, the three households traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin, Xue Ke, who in his youth had been kept at the pawnshop (where his family had accumulated two or three thousand taels for a living), joined in as well, since he had heard that Wang Ren was arriving. All these relatives gathered, exchanging courtesies and greetings.
Fengjie ordered in hushed tones, “Do not let any news get out. If Grandmother or Wang Xifeng find out, I’ll have your heads!” All the maids and servants, already trembling at the mere mention of Fengjie’s authority and recalling the strict discipline of Jia Lian’s family, kept silent. Fengjie quietly pleaded with Li Wan to shelter her for a few days, saying, “Once we sort this out, we’ll come over at our leisure.” Li Wan, understanding the delicate situation, agreed reluctantly. Fengjie then recalled all her maidservants and sent one of her own to assist You Er, instructing the household women in the garden, “Watch over her carefully. If she goes missing or escapes, you will all be held accountable.” She then went off to manage matters discreetly. Later, the family members secretly marveled, “See how virtuous she has become!” You Er, having found a secure place for herself, felt reassured. However, three days later a maid named Shan Jie grew discontent with her duties. You Er said, “When we run out of head oil, go and inform Second Grandmother so that she may provide some.” Shan Jie retorted, “Second Grandmother! How ungrateful can you be? Our Grandmother has always accommodated the ladies, catering to both the eldest and the youngest. The daughters‐in‐law in our family, numbering in the hundreds, eagerly await her instructions—every day there are at least twenty major and several minor errands to be done. Outside, starting from the Empress down to the dukes and marquises, countless favors and monetary transactions occur daily—all managed through her. Who would fuss over such trivial matters? I advise you to let it be! We are not here for a formal match; it is our good fortune that a virtuous person is among us. If someone were to hear of this and cause a ruckus, you’d be left in the lurch, wouldn’t you?” Such words caused You Er to lower her head. With this argument, she had no choice but to accept the situation. Shan Jie eventually became so timid that she dreaded serving meals—sometimes eating early, sometimes late—and all the provisions she brought were mere leftovers. After two or three days, when Fengjie met her, Fengjie would praise her and advise her to keep quiet. A few days later, Fengjie herself sent word with the promise of 20 taels of silver to Officer Wang (a trusted subordinate) to discreetly summon a certain young man named Zhang Hua—whom it turned out was a gambler. Zhang Hua, only 19 years old and known to gamble recklessly, had been expelled from his family after spending his fortune, and now frequented gambling dens. Fengjie, having learned all the details, secretly sealed a twenty-tael silver gift for Officer Wang and ordered him to “coax Zhang Hua into our service, and have him draft a petition accusing Second Master’s household of treason—of concealing orders and using wealth and power to force a remarry, so as to halt the marriage and remarry.” Zhang Hua, well aware of the risks, dared not act rashly. Officer Wang returned and reported to Fengjie. With cold determination, Fengjie scolded, “That’s exactly what his mother would say! No wonder there is a saying, ‘A leprous dog cannot be raised against a wall.’ Tell him, ‘Even if you conspire against our family, it’s of no consequence!’ If things escalate, I will handle it.” Officer Wang then conveyed Fengjie’s instructions to Zhang Hua. Fengjie further ordered, “If he lodges a complaint, then confront him directly—I have my reasons.” Officer Wang, emboldened by having Fengjie’s backing, had Zhang Hua add his own words: “Just mention that my involvement covers all the instigation of Second Master.” Zhang Hua, after some discussion with Officer Wang, prepared a petition and the next day marched to the Bureau of Censors to file his grievance. The censor’s office reviewed the petition—a complaint against Jia Lian—and noted that it was lodged by “a family retainer,” so they sent someone to call Officer Wang to come and answer for it. A low-ranking clerk, too fearful to enter on his own, was sent with a note. Officer Wang, already waiting for this matter, did not require a messenger and had been stationed on that street.
Wu’er, deeply grateful, accepts. Shortly thereafter, Ping’er brings them over to her own side, where she sees that the Lin household has already arrived with several young wives—enough to secure the situation. The Lin official then tells Ping’er, “This morning I escorted her in, but I was afraid no one would be there to attend to breakfast, so I temporarily sent Qin Xian’s woman to serve the young ladies’ meal.”  Ping’er asks, “Who is Qin Xian’s woman? I don’t know her well.”  The Lin official explains, “She’s the one on duty at the south corner at night—quiet by day, so the young ladies might not know her. She’s tall, with a lean, graceful figure and bright, clear eyes—the very picture of efficiency.”  Yuchuan exclaims, “That’s right! Sister, how could you forget? She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient. Now that everything is coming to light—and even the item lost in the mistress’s room the other day has found an owner—it was when Baoyu came over with those two rascals (the culprits) who, not being cautious, inadvertently caused a stir. They panicked, and in the end Baoyu found out and brought the items out to me. That poria snow, too, was obtained by Baoyu from outside; it has been given to many people—not only in the garden but also to the older maids for their relatives. Xiren, too, once gave some to a worthy person. Their private dealings are nothing new. The two baskets displayed in the meeting hall the other day were left intact—so how did they come to be mixed up? I will explain it to the mistress once I return.”  After saying this, Ping’er slips away to her boudoir and relates the matter in detail to Feng Xifeng. Feng Xifeng remarks, “Even so, Baoyu is the sort who, regardless of right or wrong, loves to take charge of every affair. Even if others plead with him, he won’t spare a kind word—instead, he’ll grab a coal bucket and vow to handle every matter himself! If we take him at his word, then when major issues arise it will be chaos. I say we gather all the maidservants from the mistress’s room. While we might not resort to harsh beatings, we should at least have them kneel on ceramic tiles under the sun and deprive them of food. If they don’t do so for a day, they are as fixed as iron—once taken in, they will be bound for life.”  Then she adds, “‘Flies don’t hold onto eggs without cracks’—although the Liu family didn’t steal anything, some influential people will still claim it. Even if we don’t impose the thief’s penalty, we ought to dismiss him. The court might later find fault with us, but that will not be seen as an injustice.”  Ping’er replies, “Why trouble yourself? ‘When it is time to let go, let go’—there’s nothing major here. In my opinion, even if you fuss for a hundred days here, eventually you’ll return to the other room, and no small grievance should leave a lasting grudge. Besides, you yourself have endured three disasters and eight hardships—barely managing to conceive a son, only to lose him at six or seven months. How can we not think that you were overworked and heartbroken? It’s better if half the people see you than if none do.”  Feng Xifeng laughs and says, “Do as you please! I won’t hold any grudges.”  Ping’er smiles, “Isn’t that proper?”  After saying this, she turns and goes out to distribute the instructions one by one. ——  To know the whole story in full detail, we must await the next chapter. Chapter 62 Drunken Xiangyun Slumbers on the Peony Screen, while Clueless Xiangling Unravels the Pomegranate-Skirt  Afterwards, Ping’er stepped out and instructed the Lin household person, saying: “‘Great affairs become small, and small matters vanish altogether’ – that is the mark of a thriving household.
If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it isn’t a secret matter—simply tell Sister Baoqin as well. I only worry that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. But promise me that she delivers it in person!” Overjoyed, Baoyu quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly, he mused, “What a pity that such a person—a poor orphan who has even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant—should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier even Ping’er was unexpected, but today is an unforeseen twist upon twists.” Lost in thought, he returned to his room and called Xiren to recount the matter in detail. Xiangling, beloved by all for her gentle nature, was adored by everyone; and Xiren—naturally free-spirited and close to Xiangling—upon hearing the news immediately opened her heart and, after neatly gathering her thoughts, accompanied Baoyu to find Xiangling. Finding her still waiting, Xiren teased, “I told you you’re always so mischievous—always stirring up some story!” Xiangling blushed and said, “Thank you, Sister; who would have known that the cunning little rascal has such a dark heart?” She then removed her skirt, inspected it, and indeed found it unchanged. She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Hand this soiled skirt over to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you can ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister—take it, but do not give it to that other girl. I’m done with it.” Xiren responded, “You are so generous!” Xiangling then knelt twice in thanks before Xiren took the muddy skirt away. Later, Baoyu was found squatting at a spot where he had, using a twig, dug a small pit; he had gathered fallen blossoms to line it, arranged the lotus and ‘Hui’ flowers in it, and then covered them with soil to press them down. Xiangling grabbed his hand and laughed, “What are you doing? Everyone says you’re such a sneaky little fellow who makes others blush. Look at your hands—they’re so muddy and slippery with moss; you’d better wash them off!” Baoyu laughed and got up to wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called to Baoyu. Not sure what she wished to say, he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply, laughing as she tried to speak but found no words. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face grew even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just do not mention this skirt matter to your brother—let’s leave it at that.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? You’re practically sticking your head into the lion’s den!” He then returned to his room. To learn the full details of these intrigues and playful exchanges, we must await the next chapter… Chapter 71 Spurred by Lingering Resentments, Suspicions Arise Among Relatives; Yet a “Mandarin Duck” Maiden Unwittingly Encounters Her Match  At Grandmother Jia’s residence, two maids hurriedly came seeking Baoyu, exclaiming, “Second Master, come with us at once—the master’s family has arrived!” Overjoyed yet troubled, Baoyu quickly changed his clothes and went forward to pay his respects. In the room where Jia Zheng was with Grandmother Jia, still unready in his attire, Baoyu’s arrival to offer his greetings filled Jia Zheng with both delight and a tinge of sorrow. After discussing some official matters, Grandmother Jia told him, “You must be tired—go rest a while.” Jia Zheng, rising quickly and smiling, agreed with a “Yes,” exchanged a few more words, then withdrew. Baoyu and the others followed suit. It turned out that Jia Zheng had returned to the capital on official orders but, being a poor student, had not dared to come home immediately.
Distressed, Xiren pulled at her, “Please, sir, aren’t you frightened? Tell us what happened so we can inform Grandmother and the mistress. Why did you begin crying so?”  Aunt Li pounded on the bed and shook her pillow, exclaiming, “This is utterly useless! I’ve wasted a lifetime of worry!”  Xiren, knowing Aunt Li to be wise with age, had invited her to see Baoyu. Now, upon hearing her words and seeing his condition, she believed every word and began to cry as well. Qingwen then recounted the earlier events to Xiren. Upon hearing this, Xiren rushed over to the Xiangxiang Chamber, where Huizi was busy helping Daiyu take her medicine. Without pause, she approached Huizi and said, “What exactly did you say to our Baoyu? Look at him! If you go back to Grandmother now, I can’t help it!” Then she sat down. Daiyu suddenly noticed that Xiren’s face was filled with urgent anger and tear tracks, and her demeanor had changed so much that she couldn’t help but ask what had happened. After a moment’s pause, Xiren wept, “I don’t know what words you, Sister Huizi, said—but that dullard’s eyes have gone wide, his limbs have turned cold, and he won’t say a word. Even when Aunt Li pinched him, it didn’t hurt—he’s nearly half dead! Even his own mother says he’s useless, and now she’s bawling her eyes out! I’m afraid he may very well die this moment!”  At this, Daiyu, who had long since accepted that Aunt Li’s ways were ineffective, burst into a cry as she spat out all the medicine she had taken, her body trembling as if her very entrails were in uproar. Soon her face was flushed, her eyes puffy, and she could barely lift her head in gasping distress. Huizi quickly came over to pat her back. After Daiyu lay on her pillow catching her breath for a while, she urged Huizi, “There’s no need to pat me—you’re as if you’re strangling me with a rope! I mean it!”  Huizi replied, “I didn’t mean any harm. I merely made a few lighthearted remarks, and he took them seriously.”  Xiren added, “You know how that fool is—always taking a joke literally!”  Daiyu asked, “What did you say exactly? Hurry now and explain it, or he might just wake up.”  Hearing this, Huizi hurried down from the bed and went with Xiren to the Yihong Courtyard. But when they arrived, Grandmother Jia, Wang Xifeng, and others were already there. Grandmother Jia, upon seeing Huizi, glared furiously and scolded, “You little imp—what did you say to him?”  Huizi stammered, “I—I didn’t dare say anything improper; I only spoke a few playful words.” Just then Baoyu, upon seeing Huizi, burst into tears with a loud “Ah!” and began to cry. Everyone sighed with relief. Grandmother Jia then grabbed Huizi, as though she believed Huizi had offended Baoyu, and ordered that she make amends. But Baoyu clung to Huizi with all his might, refusing to let go, exclaiming, “If you must go, take me with you!”  The assembled crowd was puzzled. Upon further inquiry it turned out that Huizi had mentioned that she was to return to Suzhou—a careless remark made in jest. Grandmother Jia, wiping away tears, said, “I thought something momentous had occurred—it was only a jest!” She then chided Huizi, “You clever child! You know that he has a bit of a simple nature—why would you tease him like that?”  Aunt Xue then comforted, “Baoyu is naturally sincere; but it so happens that Lin, being a young child from his household, is very dear to him. Just now, with his sister nearby, even though he is a genuine simpleton, even a cold-hearted adult would feel hurt. This is not a grave illness—Grandmother and the mistress need only give him a dose or two of medicine, and he’ll be fine.”  Just then a servant announced, “The folks from the Lin Zhixiao household have come to see our young master!”  Grandmother Jia said, “How thoughtful of them—to come and see him!” At the mention of the name “Lin,” Baoyu began to protest loudly from his bed, “This is terrible—those Lin family folks have come!
Jia Lian also feared arousing Jia Zhen’s jealousy and did not dare act rashly. Their desire remained unfulfilled, though mutual understanding existed. After Jia Jing’s coffin had been taken away, the household at the Ning mansion was sparse: aside from Lady You, Second Sister, Third Sister, and a few old maids and servant girls in the main rooms, most of the concubines and maids followed Jia Zhen and Jia Rong to the temple. Outside, only a few servants remained on guard duty, patrolling at night and watching the gates by day; they seldom ventured inside. Jia Lian seized this opportunity, claiming to be assisting Jia Zhen and decided to lodge at the temple. He frequently claimed to manage household affairs on Jia Zhen’s behalf and used these excuses to visit the Ning mansion and seduce Second Sister. One day, the steward Yu Lu came to report to Jia Zhen, “All the funeral supplies—canopies, poles, mourning cloth, plus the palanquin bearers and their robes—cost a total of one thousand, one hundred and ten taels of silver. So far we have paid five hundred taels; six hundred and ten remain. Yesterday the merchants came demanding payment, so I’ve come for your instructions.” Jia Zhen replied, “Just collect it from the storeroom. Why bother me?” Yu Lu explained, “I went there yesterday, but since the master passed away, there have been many expenses. What remains must be saved for the hundred-day observances and the monastery’s needs, so they cannot provide the rest. That’s why I had no choice but to ask you if perhaps there’s some other source of funds, or if I should try to borrow it.” Jia Zhen laughed, “You think we’re hiding silver somewhere? Just borrow it from somewhere—how you do it is your business.” Yu Lu smiled wryly, “If it were just one or two hundred, I might manage, but six or seven hundred is beyond my means.” Jia Zhen thought a moment and told Jia Rong, “Go ask your mother. Yesterday, someone from the Jiangnan Zhen family brought five hundred taels as a condolence gift. We haven’t turned it into the storeroom yet. Have your mother give it to him. Look around for some more, put it all together, and settle his accounts. The rest, Yu Lu can try to borrow.” Jia Rong agreed. He went to inform You-shi, then returned and said, “Of that five hundred taels, two hundred have already been spent. The remaining three hundred were sent home for Mother to keep.” Jia Zhen said, “In that case, take him there. Get the silver from your mother, then tell him to borrow the rest. Make sure he has enough. And ask after your two aunts. Come right back.” Jia Rong acknowledged and was about to leave when Jia Lian arrived. Yu Lu bowed and told him what was happening. Jia Lian said, “That’s not too big a sum. Why borrow from others? I received a sum of silver yesterday that I haven’t used yet. Why not let me add what’s missing? That’ll solve the problem cleanly.” Jia Zhen replied, “Excellent! Tell Rong to collect the full amount from you. I’m really indebted to you.” Jia Lian insisted, “Oh, we’re family. No need for such politeness.” He then told Jia Rong, “Let’s go get it together. I need to return home to pay respects to the Old Lady and the Master, and see how things are. I might as well come with you.” Jia Zhen told Jia Rong, “Go with your uncle, and remember to greet the Old Lady and the Master. Give them our regards and see if the Old Lady is feeling completely recovered. Ask if she’s still taking medicine.” Jia Rong nodded and left with Jia Lian, accompanied by several pages, all on horseback. As they rode, uncle and nephew chatted idly. With a hidden motive, Jia Lian brought up Second Sister You, praising her beauty and gentle demeanor: “She’s so poised, so soft-spoken, so lovable in every way. Everyone talks about your aunt, but in my view, she can’t compare to your Second Aunt in any aspect.” Sensing his purpose, Jia Rong teased, “Uncle, if you’re that taken with her, I can propose a match for you—would you like her as your second wife?” Jia Lian laughed, “Are you joking or serious?” Jia Rong replied, “I’m quite serious.” Jia Lian laughed again, “I’d love that, but would your aunt allow it?
Jia Lian passed the money to Second Sister, who used it to prepare Third Sister’s trousseau. In the eighth month, Liu Xianglian did indeed arrive in the capital and first called on Aunt Xue. Meeting Xue Pan again, he found that Xue Pan had been ill ever since he got back, unused to the northern climate and water. Hearing that Liu Xianglian had arrived, Xue Pan invited him into his sickroom. Aunt Xue bore no grudge for past events; she only felt deep gratitude for her son’s rescue, and both mother and son thanked Xianglian profusely. They also discussed the proposed match, saying everything was prepared and only the date needed to be set. Xianglian expressed his gratitude. The next day, he went to see Baoyu, and the two of them were as close as fish to water. Xianglian asked about the matter of Jia Lian secretly taking a second wife, and Baoyu laughed. “I heard a bit from Beiming, but I’ve never seen her. I can’t get involved, and besides, I heard from Beiming that my Second Brother has been searching for you. Not sure what he wants.” Xianglian then related everything that had happened on the road. Baoyu smiled. “That’s wonderful—what good news! You’re getting a rare beauty, truly unmatched, perfect for someone like you.” Xianglian said, “I’m puzzled that they sought me out. She must have no shortage of suitors. And I’m not exactly tight with Jia Lian. Why did he press me so hard during our brief roadside meeting? Could the girl’s family actually be chasing after the groom? Afterward, I felt uneasy about leaving the sword as a pledge. That’s why I came to you, to find out the truth.” Baoyu laughed. “You’re overthinking it. You wanted a rare beauty, right? Now you have one. No need to doubt.” Xianglian said, “You say she’s a rare beauty, but how do you know, if you don’t even know her background?” Baoyu said, “She’s the younger sister of my cousin-in-law from the Eastern Mansion, both brought by their stepmother. I was with them for over a month. They truly are two stunning women, and their surname is You.” Xianglian, hearing this, stomped his foot and exclaimed, “This isn’t good—no way. I absolutely refuse. Everyone in your Ning Mansion is filthy, except maybe the pair of stone lions at the gate!” Baoyu turned red. Xianglian realized his slip and quickly bowed, saying, “I deserve to die for talking such nonsense. Please, I only ask you to tell me: how is her character?” Baoyu gave a half-smile. “Since you already look down on our place, why do you bother asking? I guess I’m unclean as well.” Xianglian grinned. “Forgive me—my words slipped out. Please don’t take offense.” Baoyu laughed. “If you didn’t mean it, there’s no need to mention it again, or you’ll only prove you do.”  Xianglian bowed and took his leave. As he went, he thought about calling on Xue Pan, but realized Xue Pan was both ill and unreliable. He decided instead to get his sword back. Resolute, he headed straight to see Jia Lian, who was at the new house. Overjoyed at Xianglian’s arrival, Jia Lian rushed outside to greet him and escorted him into the inner hall. Madam You came out, and Xianglian bowed, calling her “Elder Aunt,” referring to himself as “your younger generation.” Jia Lian was surprised at these formalities. Over tea, Xianglian said, “Pressed by the urgency of traveling, I never expected my aunt would arrange a marriage for me back in April, which leaves me no grounds to refuse. Abandoning her arrangement and following you would be improper. If this had been an exchange of gold or jewels, I’d forfeit them, but the sword is an heirloom from my grandfather. Please give it back.” Jia Lian’s face showed his displeasure. “Second Brother, that goes against everything. The very reason for a pledge is to prevent reneging.
When Aunt Zhao sees this, she’ll never stop talking!” Xiangling, struck by his words, found herself oddly pleased. She laughed and said, “That’s exactly right. I have several new skirts, but none that suit me; if I had one that did, I’d just change into it.” Baoyu said, “Stop fidgeting – just stand still, or else your undergarments, knee covers, and shoes will all get muddied. I have an idea: Sister Xiren made a skirt exactly like this last month; since she was filial she never wore it, and she even gave it to you in exchange – how about that?” Xiangling laughed and shook her head, “No, if they find out, it won’t do.” Baoyu replied, “What’s there to fear? Once she’s full of filial piety, won’t she let you give her something else? If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it’s not a secret matter – you might as well tell Sister Baoqin. I’m just worried that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. Just promise me she personally delivers it!” Baoyu, delighted, quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly he mused, “What a pity that such a person – orphaned, having even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant – should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier, even Ping’er was an unexpected case, but today is an unexpected twist beyond twists.” As his thoughts whirled, he returned to his room and called Xiren, recounting the matter in detail. Xiangling, beloved by all and so gentle by nature, was adored by everyone; and Xiren – a naturally carefree spirit – being close to Xiangling, upon hearing the news immediately opened a chest, folded it neatly, and accompanied Baoyu to find Xiangling. Finding her still waiting, Xiren teased, “I told you you were too mischievous – you always have to stir up some story!” Xiangling blushed and thanked her sister, “Thank you, Sister – who would have known that the conniving little devil was so black-hearted?” She then took off her skirt, examined it, and indeed found it exactly as it had been before. She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Take this soiled skirt to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you’ll ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister – take it, and do not give it to that other girl. I’m done with it.” Xiren replied, “You are most generous.” Xiangling then knelt twice in thanks before Xiren took the muddy skirt away. Later, Xiangling noticed Baoyu squatting by a spot where he had dug a small pit with a twig, collected fallen blossoms to line it, placed the lotus and ‘Hui’ flowers in position, then covered them with soil to press them flat. Xiangling grasped his hand and laughed, “What are you doing? It seems everyone says you’re a sly little sneak who likes to make people feel awkward. Look at your hands – so muddy and slimy with moss; you’d best wash them.” Baoyu laughed and rose to go wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called out to Baoyu. Uncertain what she wished to say, with his two muddy hands, he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply and only laughed, her lips parting as if to speak but failing to find the words. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face turned even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just don’t mention this skirt matter to your brother – that’s all.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? Stepping my head into the lion’s den, I am!” He then returned to his room. To know the full details of these intrigues and playful exchanges, we must await the next chapter… Chapter 63 The Night Banquet in Honor of Longevity in the Red Fragrance Courtyard, While the “Dead Gold Pill” Stands Alone in Mourning  Afterwards, Baoyu returned to his room to wash his hands.
If you don’t mind, come on in and have a look around.” Barely had the Flower Official entered when an old maid came out holding a small plate of pastries. The Flower Official joked, “Who bought these hot pastries? I’d love to try one first!” Little Chan quickly took the plate and said, “They were bought by someone else—don’t be so particular!” Aunt Liu’s daughter, seeing this, laughed and said, “Miss Fang, if you love these, I have bought a plate for your elder sister; she didn’t eat them, so they’re all here, neat and untouched.” She then retrieved a plate and handed it to the Flower Official, adding, “Just wait while I prepare a fine cup of tea for you.” She went inside and quickly set up the fire to brew tea. The Flower Official, holding the pastries, raised them to Little Chan’s face and said, “Who would care for your pastries? Aren’t these pastries proper? I’m only teasing—you’d have to kowtow to me first, and then I’d eat!” He then broke off a piece and tossed it about as if amusing a sparrow, laughing, “Aunt Liu, don’t feel bad—I’ll come back and buy you two pounds more!” Little Chan, stunned, said, “Even Lord Lei has eyes—why doesn’t he beat the miscreant for this?” Everyone remarked, “Oh, dear sisters, every day we hear such prattle!” A few experienced performers, noticing the bickering, worried that trouble might ensue, gathered their things and walked away. Little Chan, now reluctant to speak further, mumbled and left. Later, when the Liu family’s people saw everyone dispersing, they hurried out to speak with the Flower Official, “Have you mentioned what happened the other day?” The Flower Official replied, “Yes, I have. Wait a day or two and we’ll bring it up again. Meanwhile, that incorrigible Zhao—always causing trouble with me—did we not have a spat the other day over the rose dew? Sister, have you had enough?” Aunt Liu’s daughter replied, “Indeed, we all had some. He seems to fancy himself something special and won’t let you have any more.” The Flower Official said, “It’s nothing; I’ll simply ask for more for him.” It turned out that one of the Liu family’s girls—a sixteen‐year‐old who, although the daughter of a kitchen maid, was as attractive as Ping, Xiren, Yuanyang, and Ziyuan—was called “Wu’er” (the Fifth). Because she was the fifth daughter and had long been a delicate child with frail health, she was never assigned much work. Now, having heard that in Baoyu’s room the number of maidservants was abundant and that he was soon to free them, the Liu family planned to assign her to a position of honor. Having no alternative, and as fate would have it, Wu’er was a servant of the Lixiang Courtyard—who was exceptionally diligent—and she soon earned the favor of the Flower Official and his attendants. Wu’er spoke with the Flower Official and even entreated him to mention it to Baoyu. Baoyu, though inclined to agree, had been ill of late and preoccupied with other matters, so there had been no opportunity for discussion. Let us now set aside these preliminaries and turn to the present. The Flower Official returned to the Yihong Courtyard and reported back to Baoyu. At that moment Baoyu was fuming over the commotion caused by Aunt Zhao; his heart was troubled, saying one thing and then another—until after the squabble was over, and after Tanchun had persuaded him to calm down, he then comforted the Flower Official for a while before sending him off to the kitchen for a word. When the Flower Official returned, he mentioned that he still needed some rose dew for Wu’er’s treatment. Baoyu quickly said, “We have some—since I hardly eat, you may give it all to her.” He then ordered Xiren to bring it out. When they saw that the bottle was nearly empty, Baoyu, not wishing to shortchange the Flower Official, handed over the entire bottle to him. The Flower Official then took the bottle and left with it.
And if outsiders were to hear of it, not only would my reputation suffer, but yours as well. Besides, Second Master’s reputation is of utmost importance; our minor squabbles are trivial in comparison. As for the idle gossip of servants, it is only natural—they say I run the household too strictly, and they whisper behind my back. Think: since ancient times it has been said, “The head of the household is like a water jar”—if there is even a slight fault in our leadership, with several elders and sisters and daughters-in-law in the house, how can I possibly be held blameless? Even if Second Master marries you and lives outside, I would never willingly see you. And when Ping’er mentioned it, I even advised Second Master to keep her. It is all the more grievous when such small people are blamed on me.” Moved to tears, Fengjie burst into heartfelt sobs. You Er, seeing this, couldn’t help but shed tears as well. The two exchanged courteous greetings and then sat down. Soon Ping’er came over to offer her respects. You Er observed that Ping’er, though modestly dressed and comporting herself with dignity, must indeed be the same Ping’er we all know; she quickly took her in hand and said, “Sister, please do not be troubled—you and I are of the same sort.” Fengjie, laughing, scolded lightly, “Knock it off! You must simply receive the courtesy—after all, you’re our maid. Don’t let me be accused by others!” Then she had Zhou Rui’s family send in four sets of finely colored embroidered headpieces and four pairs of gold-and-pearl hairpins as gifts for the visitors. You Er accepted them with a respectful bow. Over tea, the two sisters recounted past events. Fengjie, full of self-reproach, lamented, “I cannot help it if others blame me. All I wish is that you treat me with tenderness.” You Er, a sincere woman at heart, took him for a good man, thinking, “If my own heart fails me, even to speak ill of our mistress is common enough.” With tears and unreserved candor, she confided at length—so much so that Fengjie came to regard her as a kindred spirit. Meanwhile, the wives of Zhou Rui’s household praised Fengjie for her many good policies, though they remarked that she was too self-sacrificing and endearing, to the point of inviting resentment. They said, “Our residence has been arranged already; once Grandmother sees it, all will be well.” You Er, who had long intended to live with Fengjie for convenience, now felt that it was most appropriate and said, “It would have been best to accompany Sister Fengjie, but what can be done?” Fengjie replied, “That is simple enough. Your belongings—your fine silks and delicate items—should be carried in by the servants. Those rough, shoddy items, which serve no useful purpose, should remain here. Whomever is deemed suitable shall stay.” You Er then said, “Since we have met today, from now on let everything be managed by you. I am new to these matters and have little experience in running a household, so I dare not take charge.” Fengjie then called for the attendants to record everything carefully and have the items carried into the East Wing. With haste, she ordered You Er to dress quickly; the two of them, hand in hand, climbed into the carriage and quietly confided, “Our family’s rules are absolute. If Grandmother and Wang Xifeng ever learn of this, Second Master’s filial duties will be in jeopardy—and they might strike us down. For now, just remain out of sight for a couple of days in the garden. Once I have arranged everything properly, we will meet again.” You Er replied, “As you wish, Sister. I shall leave it in your capable hands.” The household boys, prearranged for this purpose, no longer entered through the main gate but instead came out the back. After disbanding the assembly, Fengjie and You Er entered the Grand View Garden’s rear gate and proceeded to meet Li Wan. Meanwhile, word had spread quickly among nearly everyone in the Grand View Garden. Suddenly, Fengjie herself appeared with her retinue, prompting everyone to come forward in inquiry. You Er met each person in turn. Fengjie ordered in hushed tones, “Do not let any news get out.
is very formidable) and wouldn’t dare cross you. Just think about it—these eggs are indeed hard to come by.”  Siqi is persuaded by their kind words and gradually her temper cools. Meanwhile, in a separate part of the house, Miss Liu’s daughter (referred to as “Wu’er,” the fifth daughter) had been sent out to deliver a portion of poria snow. Wu’er, having heard that some was to be given to the Flower Official, secretly repackaged a half portion in a paper packet at dusk when few were around. She then went to the gate of the Yihong Courtyard and, not daring to go inside, stood in a clump of rose bushes, watching from afar. After a short while—over tea—Spring Yan comes out and calls, “Sister, where are you?” Wu’er replies with a smile, “Call out for the Flower Official and I’ll speak with him.” Spring Yan whispers, “Sister, you’re far too impatient. In a few days he’ll come anyway. Just wait a bit. Earlier I sent him ahead—but if you tell me something now, I’m afraid you won’t be able to wait, and the garden might be locked up.”  Wu’er then hands a package of poria snow to Spring Yan, saying, “This is the poria snow; use it as needed to replenish. I’ve secured some for him—please pass it on.”  With that, she returns. As she walks along a winding path, she unexpectedly meets some of the Lin household’s people accompanied by several old maids. Wu’er, caught unawares, must come forward to greet them. A member of the Lin household inquires, “I heard you were ill—what brings you here?”  Wu’er, forcing a laugh, explains, “My mother sent me here to ease my boredom.”  The Lin household official retorts, “That can’t be. I saw your mother leave earlier and then closed the door. If she sent you, why didn’t she tell me you were here? Going out and having me close the door—what is the meaning of that? Are you lying?”  Wu’er, at a loss for words, replies, “It was my mother’s instruction early this morning. I forgot to mention it until now. I was afraid my mother might have mistaken me for someone else, so she didn’t inform the mistress.”  The Lin official, sensing that Wu’er’s explanation is feeble and recalling that not long ago, Yuchuan had mentioned that some things were missing from the main room—and that a few maids had complained—suspicion arose. Soon, Little Chan, Lianhua, and several young wives come by and say, “Aunt Lin must question her. In recent days, you’ve been sneaking around like a ghost, doing who knows what!”  Little Chan adds, “Indeed. Yesterday, Sister Yuchuan said, ‘The cabinet in the mistress’s side room has been opened and quite a few trinkets are gone.’ And Second Lady Lian had sent Ping’er and Sister Yuchuan to fetch some rose dew—but even that was short by a can, and no one seems to know where it went!”  Lianhua laughs, “I haven’t heard about that. Today, I even saw a bottle of dew.”  The Lin official, now agitated by the lack of explanation, immediately orders lanterns to be lit and for everyone to search the kitchen. Wu’er, anxious, exclaims, “That must be the bottle that Brother Baoyu’s Flower Official gave me!”  The Lin official retorts, “No matter what—whether it’s ‘Square Official’ or ‘Round Official’—I have evidence of theft, and I shall report it. You, my master, can argue if you like.”  With that, he enters the kitchen. Lianhua leads him to a small bottle of dew. Fearing there might be more hidden contraband, they search carefully and find, along with the bottle, a packet of poria snow. Together they gather these items and bring them back to Li Wan and Tanchun. At that moment Li Wan, who has been ignoring affairs due to Lan’er’s illness, is sent to see Tanchun.
After lunch I was too tired to go with Tan (Tan-chun) to see Sister-in-law. Having some free time, I decided to pick out a few figures and compose some verses, just letting my emotions run free. I managed five poems when I got sleepy and left them there. Then along came Baoyu, rummaging through my things. It’s not that I mind his reading them, but I’m afraid he might copy them and show them to others.” Baoyu said at once, “When would I ever show them around? Yesterday I copied your ‘White Crabapple’ poems onto my fan, but that was because I admired them so. I only kept them on me to read. Do you think I don’t know that poems from a young lady’s hand must never be carelessly passed around? Since you scolded me last time, I haven’t once taken them outside the Garden.”  Baochai smiled, “Cousin Lin is right to be cautious. If you wrote them on a fan and happened to leave it in the schoolroom, someone might ask who wrote them, and the word would spread. That wouldn’t be good at all. It’s long been said that ‘a girl’s virtue is to be without talent.’ Above all, one must be chaste and quiet; needlework is secondary. Poems and lyrics are just amusements in the boudoir—nice to have or not. We young ladies of prominent families don’t need such reputations for literary talent.” She then turned to Daiyu and said, “But it’s all right if I read them, as long as they don’t leave your room.” Daiyu laughed, “Well, then maybe even you shouldn’t read them!” She pointed at Baoyu. “He’s already snatched them away.”  Hearing this, Baoyu took the paper from his robe and read it with Baochai. They saw five poems, each entitled with the name of a beauty:  Xishi “In one age of perfect beauty, she followed the waves into the swirl of fate; Empty were the courtiers of Wu, still longing for the girl from her home. Mock not the village girl trying to imitate her brow’s furrow— When hair is white, she still washes clothes by the stream.”  Yu Ji “At midnight, crows cry and the wind howls, tearing the heart, How can Yu’s hidden sorrow face those eyes with double pupils? Qing and Peng willingly fell to pieces in the future— Why not drink the sword’s edge under the Chu war tent?”  Wang Zhaojun “She astounded all with breathtaking splendor when she left the Han palace, Beauty doomed by fate, the same in ancient days and now. Even if the emperor scorned her charms, How could he hand over the power to a painter who decided her destiny?”  Green Pearl “Jade or common pebble, all are cast aside alike; When did Shi Wei ever prize a maiden’s grace? Her stubborn fortune must have been shaped in a previous life— At least, in the end, there was a shared end to console her loneliness.”  Hongfu (Red Whisk) “A long sword and bold talk—her manner was unique indeed, A beauty with discerning eyes recognized the despairing path. Lifeless bodies fill Lord Yang’s camp, How could they confine this girl with the heart of a hero?”  Baoyu was full of praise and suggested, “Why not call these five poems ‘Five Beauties in Verse?’” Without waiting for her to reply, he took a brush and added the title at the end. Baochai also commented, “When writing on well-known subjects, the challenge is to avoid repeating old ideas. If one merely follows in others’ footsteps, even if the wording is refined, it still lacks originality and can’t be counted among truly good poems. Take, for example, the many existing pieces on Wang Zhaojun: some lament her, some blame the painter Mao Yanshou, others criticize the Han emperor for failing to seek portraits of worthy ministers instead of beautiful women. There are endless variations. Later, Wang Anshi wrote, ‘For such grace and bearing, no brush could do her justice—back then they wrongfully killed Mao Yanshou.’ Ouyang Xiu wrote, ‘If even what one sees and hears can be distorted so, how could one control distant barbarians?’ Those verses each expressed fresh thoughts.
Jia Zhen, too, never expected Third Sister to be so blunt. The two men—normally so smooth in flirtation—were left speechless by this barrage. Seeing them tongue-tied only spurred Third Sister on. She shouted, “Bring my sister! If we’re going to have fun, let’s all have fun together—four of us! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing’s cheaper than family property.’ You two are brothers, we two are sisters; we’re not outsiders, so come on!” Mortified, Madam You felt this had gone too far. Jia Zhen tried to slip away, but Third Sister blocked him. Now Jia Zhen regretted getting involved. This fiery woman was no ordinary plaything, and he could no longer be frivolous around her. Third Sister proceeded to remove her ornaments and outer clothes. She gathered her hair loosely and wore only a red jacket, half open, deliberately revealing a bright green bodice and a glimpse of snowy skin below. She wore green trousers and red shoes, dazzling in contrast. She moved about, now laughing, now raging, utterly unladylike. Her dangling earrings swung like children on a swing. Under the lamplight, her willow brows appeared darker, her lips redder. Her eyes sparkled like autumn waters, and with a few more cups in her, they gleamed even more bewitchingly. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, both enthralled and terrified, didn’t dare approach yet couldn’t bear to leave, entranced and left gaping. To make matters worse, her scathing talk pinned them down. Both men, for once, had no witty repartee. She prattled away with coarse banter, openly mocking them until she’d had her fill of fun. Then, once she’d drunk her fill, she refused to let them stay longer, driving them out and bolting the door behind them. From that day forward, whenever Third Sister found them alone, she would curse Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong, calling them swindlers who preyed on a widow and her daughters. Jia Zhen, after that first debacle, didn’t dare come without reason. Sometimes, if she was in the mood, she would send a page to summon him; once he arrived, he could do nothing but sit there, gazing helplessly as she pleased. Reader, note that Third Sister You had a uniquely eccentric temperament. She was undeniably captivating and loved to dress in bold, striking styles unlike anyone else’s, displaying a charm that few men could resist. Even a stalwart veteran or a man of stone would be tempted. But as soon as they came near her, her wild and brash manner—showing no regard for others—would intimidate them. Hence, though Jia Zhen could do whatever he liked with Second Sister, he was increasingly obsessed with Third Sister. He was content to “give” Second Sister to Jia Lian and focus on pursuing Third Sister himself. Yet Third Sister might sometimes banter with him, but she maintained an imposing presence that kept him from trying anything. Her mother and Second Sister tried to talk sense into her, but she scoffed, “Silly women! Our exceptional beauty is being sullied by these fools. Besides, that family has a vicious wife. Sure, we’re keeping things hidden for now, but when she finds out, do you think she’ll let it go? That’s bound to end in a huge scandal, and who knows which of us might live or die? How can you treat this as some comfortable refuge?” Seeing her so determined, they gave up. Day after day, Third Sister demanded fancy clothes and adornments: if she had something in silver, she’d want gold; if she had pearls, she’d want gemstones. She’d eat a fat goose and next demand a fat duck. If anything disappointed her, she’d shove over the entire table; if a garment wasn’t to her liking—no matter how fine the silk or satin—she’d snip it to shreds, cursing as she tore it apart. Jia Zhen and the rest hardly had a day of ease and had spent enormous sums in vain. Jia Lian, when he came, stayed exclusively with Second Sister and was starting to feel some misgivings. Yet Second Sister was tenderhearted and saw him as her lifelong master. She was attentive and considerate, more so than Lady Feng. As for her beauty, her speech, and her bearing, she equaled Feng in every regard. But she had stumbled in reputation, branded as unchaste, and nothing else could erase that.
In it Ji Zi once said, ‘Those who climb the ladder of wealth and status, who navigate the realm of strategy, exhaust the words of Yao and Shun, and turn their backs on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.’”  Baochai asked with a smile, “And what of the next line?”  Tanchun grinned, “I suppose I’d be cursing myself if I recited it.”  Baochai continued, “There is nothing in the world that cannot be put to use. If something is of service, it must have its price. It’s a pity that for you clever ones this major issue has not yet been experienced firsthand.”  Li Wan laughed, “You’ve assembled everyone here and yet you avoid the serious topic. Why not continue discussing learning?”  Baochai answered, “True learning is the serious matter. Without holding fast to our scholarly principles, everything slips into vulgarity.”  After teasing one another for a while, the three returned to business. Tanchun went on, “Our garden alone, if doubled in size, would yield an annual interest of four hundred taels. To now introduce fresh funds for expansion would be a trifling matter—not befitting our family’s standing. Yet if we send two trustworthy persons out with valuable items to be used at others’ discretion, it might lead to waste and spoilage. Why not select from among the longtime gardeners those who know the ins and outs of the garden and commission them to manage and tidy it up? They need not pay any rent or taxes; simply let them report what they can offer annually. First, having dedicated caretakers for the garden means it will flourish each year without any last-minute chaos; second, it avoids waste and mismanagement of our valuables; third, our veteran staff might earn a little extra, recompensing the years of hard work in the garden; and fourth, we can also save on the expenses of hiring seasonal labor for trimming, cleaning, and such. Any surplus can be used to offset any shortfalls. Doesn’t that seem reasonable?”  While Baochai was examining the calligraphy and paintings on the wall below, she nodded and said, “Splendid! ‘Within three years, there shall be no famine.’”  Li Wan concurred, “A great idea! Surely our lady will be delighted. Saving money is a minor matter; if the garden is maintained by someone dedicated to their duty—and if they’re even allowed to sell surplus for profit, with the incentive of extra pay—they’ll leave no task undone.”  Ping’er interjected, “This matter must be brought out by the young ladies. Although our grandmother harbors such thoughts, she may not dare voice them. With you all residing in the garden, adding extra trimmings for appearance might instead invite stricter supervision under the guise of saving money. It is difficult to phrase it properly.”  Baochai quickly moved over, gently patting Ping’er’s face with a smile, “Open your mouth so I may see how your teeth and tongue are made! From this morning until now, you’ve spoken in one consistent manner—neither flattering Third Sister nor implying that our grandmother’s ideas fall short. When Third Sister speaks, you echo with your own words, as though what she thinks is exactly what our grandmother also intends, save that there’s always an unworkable reason. And now, because the young ladies are living in the garden, it isn’t proper to say that saving money means having someone supervise. Think on it: if you were to hand the money over to someone, that person would not dare pluck even a single flower or fruit, and naturally the young ladies would be too timid to express any opinion—resulting in constant squabbles with the maids. Though he is cautious and balanced, our grandmother is not doing us any favors; if she hears this, she’ll surely be mortified into reform.”  Tanchun smiled and said, “I woke up in a foul mood earlier, and when I heard him, I immediately thought of his master—always so unbridled when in charge! Seeing him now only increased my anger. And then he said those things—rather than praising me for my kindness toward our grandmother, he remarked, ‘It’s not for nothing that the young ladies have always cared for our grandmother.’ That sentence not only deflated my anger but filled me with regret and sorrow. I thought, what advantage do I have as a young woman when I’m already left to fend for myself, unloved and uncared for?”  At this point, his voice broke and tears welled up.
They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics, and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write couplets for her!”  Everyone marveled. Bao Yu laughed, “My dear sister, show us what you have composed!”  Baoqin replied, “It is kept in Nanjing—I cannot retrieve it now.”  Bao Yu sighed in disappointment, “Alas, I have no chance to see such wonders!”  Daiyu teased, “Don’t try to fool us; I know that when you come you always bring these treasures from home. And yet you claim you have none—if they believe you, so be it; I, however, do not.”  Baoqin’s face flushed red, and she lowered her head demurely. Baochai said, “Your words betray your cleverness, though your tongue is too forthright. Our little Qinqi often spouts such things; you too have become quite sharp.”  Daiyu then said, “If you have brought them along, please recite something for us.”  Baochai replied, “Let’s wait—once we summon Yun, he too shall listen.”  And so a little maid was sent to fetch Yun. After a while, Xiangyun asked, “So tell us: Which foreign beauty has arrived?”  As she walked, she and Xiangling met. Everyone laughed, “We hear her voice before even seeing her!”  Baoqin and the others sat down, and the earlier conversation was recounted. Xiangyun said, “Hurry, recite for us!”  Baoqin then recited:   In the vermilion tower I dream at night,   Tonight I sing of a realm of water and mist. Island clouds steam the vast ocean,   While mists enshroud the clustered forest. The moon, ageless and eternal,   Bears passions both shallow and deep by fate. In the lands south of the Han, spring glows vividly—   How can one remain unmoved? Everyone marveled, “Truly extraordinary! She surpasses even our own poets!”  Before further discussion could ensue, Meiyue announced that Second Young Master had been informed by the madams that his ailing mother longed to see her daughter. Mrs. Wang immediately said, “A mother and child—how could we not allow that?” Fengjie was hurried to report this matter and instructed Zhou Rui’s family to pass the message to Xiangren: “Tell her to pack a few fine garments and prepare a proper bundle of clothes, ensuring everything is well secured; also arrange for a warming brazier. When she departs, have her come here first for my inspection.”  Zhou Rui’s family agreed and soon departed with the message. After a short while, Xiangren appeared, dressed and accompanied by two maids carrying a brazier and a bundle. Fengjie observed that Xiangren’s hair was adorned with several golden hairpins and jewels, and that her attire was a peach-red gown with intricate silver embroidery, overlaid with a gray mouse jacket. Fengjie laughed, “These three outfits were all bestowed by Madam—they suit you well. But the jacket is rather plain; in this cold weather you ought to wear a heavy fur garment.”  Xiangren replied, “Madam only gave me the gray mouse one and a silver one. They promised that when the season turns, I will be given a heavy fur coat.”  Fengjie laughed, “I happen to have one as well. I was dissatisfied with mine and was about to replace it. For now, wear mine. Later, when Madam’s new garments are prepared, I shall exchange it with you. Consider it as a temporary loan until you repay me.”  Everyone laughed, “Our ancestors are so generous with their kin, secretly compensating for so many things without ever keeping count! How could such largesse be measured?”  Fengjie then instructed, “Xiangren, if your mother does not recover, send word to me so that I can have extra bedding and provisions sent to you.” She then told Zhou Rui’s family, “You all know the customs here; there is no need for further instructions. When you come here, you must always ensure you have an inner room if you are to stay.”  With that matter settled, Fengjie called in two old maids from the Yíhóng Courtyard and said, “I fear Xiangren will not return soon.
Baochai, pondering this, noted that since there were chickens at the table, perhaps it alluded to the idiom “Ji Chuang, Ji Ren” (“the chicken’s window, the chicken’s person”)—and he guessed the word “Shi” (threshold). Tanchun, realizing his intended meaning, smiled and sipped her drink. Soon Xiangyun and the others began a lively game of fist and guess. Outside, Aunt You and Yuanyang—seated separately—also played by calling out numbers. Ping’er and Xiren paired up as well, and the tinkling of bracelets filled the air. Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu, while Xiren outdid Ping’er; rounds of toasts were exchanged. Xiangyun then declared, “For the verse upon our toast, we require one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one drawn from domino names, one from tune titles, and one from an official decree—all to form a complete verse. And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so long-winded—but they have a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did so, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, Fierce winds sweep the river and sky as geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul time and again; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut and recited for the base:  “Hazelnuts are not produced by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence comes the clamor of a thousand households pounding laundry?” Thus the round was concluded. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting familiar proverbs—each including the character “longevity”—with no further embellishment. After a while, the group began playing a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Furen absent, no one kept strict order; everyone indulged freely—shouting, laughing, and calling out. The hall was awash in a dazzling interplay of red and green, with glimmering jade and tinkling pearls—a scene of exuberant merriment. After a time, as people began to disperse, Xiangyun was nowhere to be found. Assuming she had stepped out on her own, they waited; yet she did not return. Searches were conducted in every direction, but she was nowhere in sight. Soon after, members of the Lin household, accompanied by several elderly maids, arrived—both worried that urgent matters might arise and anxious that with Wang Furen absent the young maids might overindulge and lose their propriety. When Tanchun saw them, she smiled and said, “Come and see for yourselves—do not worry; we have not overdrunk, only used wine for amusement. Rest assured, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Although the Dowager insisted that the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses away, we simply had fun. We came to check on you. Moreover, as the day wears on and the young ladies continue their revelry, they might require some light snacks. Since they rarely indulge, a couple of cups of wine might not be enough nourishment.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were just about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids all agreed and hurried off to gather refreshments. Tanchun then said, “Now rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I’ll have someone send over more wine shortly.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” Soon they too departed. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My cheeks are burning—I’m too embarrassed to face them. I say let it be, so as not to provoke any more.” Tanchun laughed, “It matters not—as long as we don’t drink excessively, nothing will come of it.”  Just then, a little maid bounded in laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a cool stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and indeed found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step beside a wall, fast asleep in a drunken stupor.
Embarrassed, Second Sister said nothing. Third Sister, half-smiling and half-cross, scolded, “You little brat, you’re impossible! I can’t wait to tear your mouth off someday!” Jia Rong only laughed and ran off, with Jia Lian also smiling his farewells. Leaving the house, Jia Lian told the household stewards not to demand any “fees” from the merchants. He discreetly urged Jia Rong to talk to Jia Zhen about the proposal. He then caught up with Yu Lu, handed him enough silver to make up the debt, and headed off. After paying respects to Jia She and Grandmother Jia, he left the mansion. Jia Rong, finding himself free, returned inside to flirt with his two aunts. By evening he was back at the temple to report to Jia Zhen, “I’ve given the silver to Yu Lu. Grandmother is feeling better and no longer taking medicine.” Then, seeing the moment was right, he told Jia Zhen about Jia Lian’s wish to marry Second Sister You as a secondary wife and how he proposed buying a house outside so that Fengjie wouldn’t find out. He said, “He wants children, and he really likes Second Aunt. It’s a perfect union with no risk. He’s begging you to consent.” Concealing his own part in the plan, Jia Rong embellished the story. Jia Zhen paused, then laughed, “It might work. I’ll have to see if your Second Aunt is willing. Tomorrow, go speak with your mother. Ask her to see how your aunt feels. Then we can decide.” He also told Jia Rong how to proceed. That evening, Jia Zhen relayed the plan to You-shi, who recognized the impropriety and tried to dissuade him. But Jia Zhen had already made up his mind. Besides, Second Sister was not her full sister, and You-shi could not easily intervene. She had to give in. Early the next day, Jia Rong went again into the city to talk to his mother, repeating Jia Zhen’s intentions. He added all sorts of persuasive details: how good-natured Jia Lian was, how Fengjie’s illness was likely incurable, that they might discreetly move to a house outside, wait a year or so, and after Fengjie’s death, bring Second Sister in as the legal wife. Moreover, Jia Zhen would cover all costs, so Lady You need not spend anything. Hearing this, Lady You quickly went to ask Second Sister. Second Sister, being quite changeable in nature and already on bad terms with her brother-in-law (Jia Zhen), resented her betrothal to Zhang Hua. Now that she saw Jia Lian was in love with her, and her brother-in-law was helping arrange it, she readily consented. She had never liked being stuck with a poor fiancé from her former family, so she agreed at once. Lady You then reported back to Jia Rong, who rushed to inform Jia Zhen. Within days, they were purchasing a house, having jewelry made, and preparing a trousseau for Second Sister, as well as furnishing the new home with beds, canopies, and other items. In no time, they secured a property in the Little Huazhi Lane about two li away from Ning and Rong mansions—over twenty rooms in total. They also bought two young maids. However, they hesitated to use the Jia household’s regular servants, fearing rumors that might reach Fengjie. They considered hiring new servants from outside but worried they wouldn’t be trustworthy. Suddenly, Jia Lian remembered Bao Er. Previously, he and his wife had quarreled because Bao Er’s wife had been unfaithful with Jia Lian; she had hanged herself from shame. Jia Lian had given Bao Er a hundred taels to marry someone else. Bao Er then married “Duo Guniang,” a cook’s widow, who had once been involved with Jia Lian. They now lived outside. Jia Lian decided this couple was just right for managing the secret household. Bao Er and his wife, hearing of this opportunity, gladly accepted. As for Zhang Hua’s family, originally stewards of a grain-tax estate, they declined after misfortune. They had indeed betrothed their son Zhang Hua to Second Sister You in her infancy. But when they suffered lawsuits, they fell into poverty, unable even to afford a wedding.
That evening, she took two doses; though she perspired and still had a fever and a heavy headache with a blocked nose, her state did not much improve. The next day, Mrs. Wang’s physician visited again and adjusted the decoction. Although the fever was slightly reduced, her headache persisted. Bao Yu then ordered Meiyue to fetch some nasal snuff: “Give her some to inhale; a few good sneezes will clear her up.” Meiyue promptly retrieved a small, gold-inlaid, double–gold “star” glass box. Bao Yu opened the box—it contained a small Western-style porcelain figurine of a red-haired, bare-bodied woman with delicate curves—and inside were high-quality Western tobacco. Qingwen, who had been gazing at a painting, was told by Bao Yu, “Inhale some; if you hold your breath too long, you’ll feel worse.” Qingwen, after some hesitation, used her fingernails to lift a pinch of the snuff into her nostrils. Almost immediately, she was overcome by a sharp, acrid tang that invaded her senses. She sneezed repeatedly—five or six times—while tears and snot flowed. Qingwen quickly put the box away, laughing, “My goodness, it’s so spicy! Quickly, bring some paper!” A small maid promptly delivered a bundle of fine paper, and Qingwen used it to dab her nose. Bao Yu asked, “How do you feel now?” Qingwen replied, “It does help—though my head still aches.” Bao Yu smiled, “Then let’s use more of this Western remedy—perhaps it will cure you soon.” He then ordered Meiyue, “Go ask Second Madam for some of that Western ointment for headaches—called ‘Yi Fo Na’—and bring me a little.” Meiyue went off and soon returned with a small piece. Bao Yu then selected a corner of red satin, cut two round patches the size of a fingertip, and mixed the ointment with a little heat, spreading it thinly on a pinhead-sized applicator. Qingwen, in turn, applied it to her temples. Meiyue teased, “The sick look like disheveled ghosts—now with that ointment, you’re rather cute. Second Madam is so used to it, she won’t mind.” Bao Yu then asked, “Second Madam said tomorrow is Uncle’s birthday. What shall you wear? We must have everything ready so you won’t have to fumble in the morning.” Bao Yu replied, “Whatever is most convenient. A birthday every year can be confusing enough.” With that, he rose and left his room to visit Xiangyun’s chamber. Outside the courtyard, Bao Yu encountered a little maid named Xiao Luo, who was hurrying by. Bao Yu quickly asked, “Where are you off to?” Xiao Luo replied, “Both young ladies are in Lin’s room; I’m on my way there now.” Bao Yu, upon hearing this, turned and joined her toward the Xiāoxiāng (Mist-Snow) Pavilion. There, not only were the Baochai sisters present, but even Xiuyan was there. The four of them gathered around a warming brazier and chatted amiably. Meanwhile, Ziyuan sat in the warm chamber by the window, sewing. When Bao Yu arrived, they teased, “Here comes another one! There’s no more room for you!” Bao Yu chuckled, “What a splendid ‘Winter Boudoir Gathering’ it is—but alas, I arrived too late. After all, this room is far warmer than the others and the chairs are not cold at all.” He then took a seat in the spot where Daiyu usually sat, placing a gray mouse chair on top of another. He noticed an exquisite jade basin on a display table, which contained a single potted narcissus with solitary petals. Bao Yu exclaimed in delight, “What a beautiful flower! The warmer the room, the richer its fragrance. Why did I not see it yesterday?” Daiyu smiled, “That was a gift from our chief steward – Aunt Lai sent two pots: one of narcissus to me and one of wax plum to Yun. I originally refused them, afraid of offending her, but if you want, I can pass one along to you.” Bao Yu replied, “I already have two pots at home, though they are not as fine as this one.
After returning from the palace, they went to Ning Mansion to perform the ancestral rites. Once the rites were complete, they changed their clothes and rested. All the visiting relatives during the festive season mingled freely with Aunt Xue and Aunt Li; sometimes they played board games or cards with Bao Yu, Baochai, and the other sisters. Mrs. Wang and Fengjie, meanwhile, were busy inviting guests for New Year’s banquets. In the halls and courtyards there was no shortage of revelers, and merriment continued well into the night. It was only after seven or eight days of continuous festivities that everything was finished. Soon after, the Lantern Festival approached. Both the Ning and Rong mansions were festooned with lanterns and decorations. On the eleventh day, Jia She hosted Grandmother and others; on the following day, Jia Zhen again invited Grandmother. Mrs. Wang and Fengjie were repeatedly invited to New Year’s banquets—the list is too long to record here. On the fifteenth evening, Grandmother ordered a banquet in the grand flower hall. Several tables of wine were arranged, a small troupe of short plays was prepared, and colorful lanterns were hung. Relatives from the Rong and Ning mansions—all the nephews, nieces, and grandchildren—gathered together for the feast. Jia Jing, who never drank or ate meat, did not attend. On the seventeenth day the ancestral rite was completed, and then those who had stayed in the mansion gradually departed; even among the young men some remained behind. Those who did not join the court procession all waited near the mansion before being escorted inside the ancestral hall. Now, regarding Baoqin: This was her first visit to the Jia ancestral shrine. As she carefully scrutinized the shrine, she discovered that in a separate courtyard on the west side of the Ning Mansion, enclosed by a dark, oil-painted railing, stood five large halls with a plaque reading “Jia Family Ancestral Shrine” (accompanied by a note from the former Grand Tutor, Wang Xī). On either side hung long couplets:   “Devotion poured out from the heart, our clan’s favor preserved by endless gratitude;   Fame and honor stretch to the heavens, revered by generations.” (An inscription by the Grand Tutor.)  Inside the courtyard, a pathway of white stone wound between ancient pines and cypresses. On a terrace stood antique bronze cauldrons and ritual vessels. In front of the main hall hung a golden plaque adorned with nine dragons, inscribed “Illuminated by the Stars” – an imperial inscription. On both sides were couplets reading:   “Meritorious deeds shine forth, outshining sun and moon;   Fame and honor pass down unbroken to our descendants.” (Again, an imperial inscription.)  In the five-hall main shrine, a plaque reading “Mindful of the Departed” hung, with an adjoining couplet:   “May our progeny inherit everlasting fortune;   Even now, the common people speak of the glory of the Ning and Rong mansions.” (All in imperial script.)  Inside, the halls glowed with bright lights, embroidered curtains, and hanging silk draperies. Although several ancestral tablets were set up, one could not make out their true appearance. The Jia family then proceeded with the ceremony in full. Young cousins and nephews were arranged in order. Jia Jing officiated, Jia She assisted, Jia Zhen presented the ceremonial ribbons, while Jia Lian and Jia Cong offered silk; Bao Yu carried incense; Jia Chang and Jia Ling arranged seating cushions and prepared the sacrificial wine. The musicians in blue played as the ritual progressed with offerings and the burning of the tablets, and then the food, wine, tea, and other items were distributed. Grandmother then sat down with Mrs. Wang, and after the ceremony, everyone dispersed. Meanwhile, in the Rong Mansion, preparations were similarly underway. The halls were renovated and new decorations were hung. After the banquet, the families distributed New Year money and gifts to their relatives, and the festivities continued into the night with singing, dancing, and the bursting of firecrackers. On the following day at five “drum strikes” (early morning), Grandmother and the others, attired in full ceremonial dress according to rank, accompanied a group of officials into the palace to offer New Year’s greetings and to bestow blessings on Yuan Chun. After the court audience, they returned to the Ning Mansion, where they again performed the ancestral rite. When all the formalities were completed, they changed clothes and rested.
When she opened the door, she found the courtyard glistening with a fresh, moist, mossy green, for a light drizzle had fallen at the early watch. She then called for Xiangyun and others to help her wash and groom. Xiangyun remarked that her cheeks were itching, fearful it might trigger her habitual “peach-blossom” eczema, and inquired if Baochai had any rosewater salve. Baochai replied, “I gave all the leftovers to Sister Qin the other day.” Then she added, “Pín (Daiyu’s nickname) has accumulated many such remedies, and I was just about to ask for some—only, this year I haven’t had the itch, so it slipped my mind.” She then ordered Ying’er to fetch some. As Ying’er went off to retrieve the remedy, Ru Official (Rui Guan) interjected, “I’ll come with you—and while we’re at it, let’s have a look at Lotus Officer.” With that, he and Ying’er left the Hengwu Courtyard together. The two chatted and laughed as they strolled along the willow-lined embankment until they reached the banks of the “Willow Leaf Shoal.” Along the winding willow dyke—with slender branches drooping like fine golden threads—Ying’er teasingly asked, “Can you weave something out of these willow twigs?” Ru Official laughed, “Weave something? What might we weave?” Yuann’er then said, “What can’t you weave? Anything for play is fair game. Just wait—let me pick some fresh twigs, and I’ll braid a flower basket; then we can fill it with assorted blossoms. That would be truly delightful!” Without pausing to fetch the rose salve, Ying’er plucked many tender branches and handed them to Ru Official, who began to braid an exquisitely delicate basket as they walked. Along the way, whenever they passed a blooming flower, they would pick a branch here or there, assembling a basket that, with its lush green leaves and artfully arranged blossoms, was both unique and charming. Ru Official, delighted, said, “Oh, dear sister, give it to me!” Ying’er replied, “Let’s present this to our Lin sister—when she returns, we can gather more and weave several baskets for everyone to enjoy.” And so they arrived at the Xiangxiang Chamber. At that moment, Daiyu—who was in the midst of her morning grooming—saw the basket and smiled, “Who has woven such a fresh flower basket?” Ying’er answered, “I made it, to give as a gift for you to play with.” Daiyu accepted it with a laugh, “No wonder everyone praises your nimble hands—this little creation is truly charming.” As she admired it, she directed that it be hung for display. Ying’er then went to inquire of Aunt Xue about the rose salve, and only after that did she bring some to Daiyu in a small packet wrapped by Aunt Ziyuan. Daiyu then said, “I feel well enough now; today I shall go out and stroll about. Tell Sister that there is no need to trouble Mother by coming over. I have already done my hair and will join Mother for breakfast—let’s have some lively company.”  Ying’er agreed and went off. Soon she entered Aunt Ziyuan’s room to find Ru Official. There she found Ru Official deep in cheerful conversation with Lotus Officer; the two were so engrossed that they were reluctant to part. Ying’er teased, “Sister, why don’t you go too? Wouldn’t it be better if Lotus Officer waited with you?” Hearing this, Aunt Ziyuan also remarked, “That is a fine idea. This fellow is such a mischievous rascal!” With that, she wrapped Daiyu’s chopsticks and spoon in a neatly folded cloth and handed them to Lotus Officer, saying, “Take these along—it counts as a little errand.” Lotus Officer accepted with a grin, and the two of them set off along the willow dyke. As Ying’er continued braiding her willow basket, she remarked, “Hurry, or I won’t finish my weaving!” Lotus Officer replied, “I’ll go with you and return swiftly.” And off they went.
The remaining three hundred were sent home for Mother to keep.” Jia Zhen said, “In that case, take him there. Get the silver from your mother, then tell him to borrow the rest. Make sure he has enough. And ask after your two aunts. Come right back.” Jia Rong acknowledged and was about to leave when Jia Lian arrived. Yu Lu bowed and told him what was happening. Jia Lian said, “That’s not too big a sum. Why borrow from others? I received a sum of silver yesterday that I haven’t used yet. Why not let me add what’s missing? That’ll solve the problem cleanly.” Jia Zhen replied, “Excellent! Tell Rong to collect the full amount from you. I’m really indebted to you.” Jia Lian insisted, “Oh, we’re family. No need for such politeness.” He then told Jia Rong, “Let’s go get it together. I need to return home to pay respects to the Old Lady and the Master, and see how things are. I might as well come with you.” Jia Zhen told Jia Rong, “Go with your uncle, and remember to greet the Old Lady and the Master. Give them our regards and see if the Old Lady is feeling completely recovered. Ask if she’s still taking medicine.” Jia Rong nodded and left with Jia Lian, accompanied by several pages, all on horseback. As they rode, uncle and nephew chatted idly. With a hidden motive, Jia Lian brought up Second Sister You, praising her beauty and gentle demeanor: “She’s so poised, so soft-spoken, so lovable in every way. Everyone talks about your aunt, but in my view, she can’t compare to your Second Aunt in any aspect.” Sensing his purpose, Jia Rong teased, “Uncle, if you’re that taken with her, I can propose a match for you—would you like her as your second wife?” Jia Lian laughed, “Are you joking or serious?” Jia Rong replied, “I’m quite serious.” Jia Lian laughed again, “I’d love that, but would your aunt allow it? And would your mother consent? Besides, I’ve heard that your Second Aunt is already spoken for.” Jia Rong said, “No problem. My father didn’t raise my two aunts; Mother brought them from a previous marriage. I heard that back in their old household, Mother had betrothed Second Aunt to the family of Zhang, a grain tax clerk, when both sides were still expecting. Later the Zhang family fell on hard times, and Mother then remarried elsewhere. Over the past ten-plus years, both sides lost contact. Mother has often grumbled about calling off that engagement. My father also wanted to find someone else for her. All he needs is to locate that Zhang family, pay them a few taels for compensation, and get a formal release from the engagement. The Zhangs are so poor, they’ll surely agree—and even if they didn’t, they wouldn’t dare oppose us. If you propose taking her as your second wife, I’m sure both my mother and father will consent. The only obstacle might be your own wife!” Hearing this, Jia Lian was overjoyed, so blinded by lust that he ignored his formal mourning status, his wife’s jealousy, and all the impropriety involved, seeing only a perfect plan. Little did he know Jia Rong had his own secret agenda: he had feelings for his aunt, but Jia Zhen’s presence had prevented him from acting. If Jia Lian took her as a concubine and kept her in an outside residence, Jia Rong would have opportunities for his own secret liaisons when Jia Lian was away. Jia Lian, suspecting nothing, thanked Jia Rong, “Good nephew! If you can arrange this, I’ll reward you with two lovely maids!”  They soon arrived at the gate of the Ning mansion. Jia Rong said, “Uncle, go in and ask Mother for that silver, then you can hand it over to Yu Lu. I’ll hurry to Grandmother’s to pay my respects.” Jia Lian laughed and warned him, “Remember, don’t tell her we came together.” Jia Rong replied, “I know,” and, making a quick private gesture to indicate Second Sister, he added, “Don’t be impatient if you see her.
And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal fruit or dish.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so tedious to recite—but there’s a charm to them.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, While fierce winds sweep the river and sky and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul over and over; such is the welcome of a returning guest.” Everyone laughed at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut kernel and recited for the base of the toast:  “Hazelnuts are not forged by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence then does the sound of laundry-pounding in countless homes come?” And that concluded the round. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting a common proverb, each version including the character “longevity,” with no further embellishment. After a while, they began to play a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng absent, no one kept strict order; everyone indulged freely—shouting, calling out, and laughing. The hall was a riot of red and green, with jade gleaming and pearls tinkling—a truly exuberant scene. After playing for a while, everyone began to disperse. Suddenly, however, Xiangyun was nowhere to be seen. Assuming she had stepped outside on her own, they waited—but her figure did not reappear. They sent people in all directions to search, but she was nowhere to be found. Soon after, members of the Lin household, accompanied by several elderly maids, arrived—partly worried that there might be pressing business, and partly fearing that in the absence of Wang Xifeng the young maids might drink to excess and lose all decorum. When Tanchun saw them, she smiled and said, “Come and see—rest assured, we have not overindulged; we were merely jesting, using wine as a pretext. Do not worry, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Even though the Dowager insisted the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses absent, we simply had fun. We came to check on you. Moreover, as time goes on, if the young ladies party, they may need a snack. Since they seldom eat extras, if they have only a couple of cups of wine, they might not be nourished enough.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids all agreed and hurried off to gather some. Tanchun then said, “You all rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I will have someone send more wine for you.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” After a short while they too left. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My cheeks are burning—I’m too embarrassed to face them now. I say we let it be, so as not to provoke them further.” Tanchun laughed, “It matters not—as long as we don’t drink too heavily, nothing will come of it.”  Just then, a little maid bounded in, laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a cool stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and indeed found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step against a rock, fast asleep in a drunken stupor. Peony petals were scattered over her, and her face and sleeves were dusted with red perfume. Her fan lay half-buried under fallen blossoms, and a swarm of bees and butterflies buzzed about her. Even a small kerchief was arranged as a pillow from peony petals. Touched and amused, everyone rushed over to help her up. Xiangyun mumbled drunkenly about toasts and drinking games, saying, “The fragrant spring wine is so cool… let us stagger home together—may dear friends be ever near.” They laughed and urged her, “Quick, wake up and come eat.
Who knows how many years before he returns? Wouldn’t that waste a lifetime?” Second Sister said, “Our Third Sister is decisive. Whatever she says, that’s it.”  Just then, Third Sister came in and said, “Brother-in-law, you really don’t know us. Let me tell you plainly today: trust us when we say we’re people who match words to deeds. If I see that Liu man come, I’ll marry him. Starting right now, I’m going vegetarian and devoting myself to Buddha as I care for my mother, waiting for the day he arrives so I can wed him. If he never comes, I’ll devote my life to spiritual practice.” With that, she plucked a jade hairpin from her hair and snapped it in half. “If any of my words prove false, let me be broken like this hairpin.” Then she returned to her room. Jia Lian, seeing no other way, discussed some household details with Second Sister and then went home to confer with Wang Xifeng about his journey. He also told someone to ask Beiming about Liu Xianglian. Beiming replied, “I know nothing. I assume he isn’t back. If he had returned, I’d have heard of it.” Jia Lian asked around in Liu Xianglian’s neighborhood and was told the same. So he relayed this news to Second Sister. When his departure day drew near, he initially claimed he would leave two days earlier. In truth, he went to stay two nights with Second Sister before secretly setting off from there. Indeed, Third Sister had changed completely, behaving as if she were a different person. Second Sister was meticulous with household management, so Jia Lian had no concerns at all. Early that morning, he left the city for Ping’an Prefecture, traveling from dawn to dusk, hastily eating and drinking on the road. On the third day, they were moving along when they saw a caravan of pack animals approaching, among which were about ten horses with both masters and servants. Drawing closer, he recognized them: it was none other than Xue Pan traveling with Liu Xianglian. Startled, Jia Lian galloped up to meet them, and after exchanging greetings and inquiries about their time apart, they all stopped at a roadside inn to rest and chat. Jia Lian laughed. “After your fight, we tried to invite you both to reconcile, but we couldn’t find you anywhere, Liu Second Brother. How is it you’re traveling together now?” Xue Pan chuckled. “It’s a story filled with coincidences. My business partner and I set out this spring with goods, and everything was peaceful until we reached the outskirts of Ping’an Prefecture. There we were ambushed by bandits, who stole our cargo. But who should come along but Liu Second Brother here, and he chased them away, recovering our goods and saving our lives. I tried to reward him, but he refused, so we became sworn brothers. We’re heading back to the capital together. When we reach that fork in the road ahead, he’ll separate from me and travel south about a hundred miles to visit his aunt. Then I’ll go home to settle my affairs and find him a house, plus a good wife, so we can live close by.” Jia Lian smiled. “Now I see. And that’s wonderful. But earlier, we all worried for nothing.” He then continued, “We’d been discussing a marriage for you, Brother Liu. I happen to have just the right match, well suited for you.” He proceeded to describe how he had secretly married Second Sister You and needed to find a husband for her younger sister, but he didn’t mention that Third Sister had chosen Liu Xianglian on her own. He merely stressed, “Don’t let anyone at home know. Once a child is born, everyone will figure it out.” Xue Pan was delighted. “It should’ve been done sooner! It’s all because of my cousin that we had problems.” Liu Xianglian quickly interrupted, smiling. “You’re slipping again. Enough.” Xue Pan fell silent and then said, “Anyway, if this is the plan, let’s definitely do it.” Liu Xianglian added, “I once made a vow to find an exceptionally beautiful wife. Since you two brothers are so kind, I won’t be too choosy. I’ll follow your arrangements.” Jia Lian said gleefully, “No words can convey her beauty.
Can’t you bring in a couple of those with managerial insight to accompany the doctor?”  One of them replied, “We have Old Madame Wu and Old Madame Shan; the two of them are waiting at the Southwest Corner, by the brocade gate.”  Hearing this, Ping’er allowed the matter to drop. After the old maids left, Tanchun asked Baochai, “Well?”  Baochai smiled and answered, “Fortunately the initiators are more energetic than the finishers; those who are eloquent also have a taste for profit.” Tanchun nodded approvingly, then pointed out several names in the register for the three of them to examine. Ping’er hurried off to fetch brush and inkstone. The three discussed, “That old ‘Zhumu’ is reliable—especially considering that his forefathers and his son have long been in charge of maintaining the bamboo. And now all the bamboo is entrusted to him. And that old ‘Tianmu’ originally specialized in farming—over in the Daoxia village, no matter the vegetables, rice, or weeds, even if they are minor produce, he still must tend to them carefully and add in proper cultivation at the right times. Wouldn’t that be even better?”  Tanchun laughed again, “It’s a pity that in the two grand estates of the Hengwu Courtyard and the Yihong Courtyard, there seems to be nothing of merit.”  Li Wan quickly laughed, “Hengwu Courtyard is even more promising. Nowadays, the spices and herbal condiments sold at the perfumery and at the major markets and temples are none other than these items. All in all, their returns are even greater. And as for Yihong Courtyard, not to mention other matters, just consider the roses in spring and summer alone—how many blossoms fall? Then there are also the wild roses, monthly roses, and clusters of candied flowers, golden and silver honeysuckle, and wisteria blossoms along the fence. Once dried and sold to tea and medicine shops, they fetch a good price.”  Tanchun nodded with a smile, “It’s just that there aren’t many who know how to work with these aromatic herbs.”  Ping’er laughed, “Bao’s friend, Ying’er’s mother, is exactly the person who can handle these. Last time she even gathered some, dried them, and made them into a flower basket and gourd for my amusement. Have you forgotten?”  Baochai laughed, “I was just praising you—and now you’re teasing me!”  The three were surprised and asked, “Why is that?”  Baochai explained, “It’s not acceptable to be so capricious. You already have enough personnel on hand, and now if I introduce someone new, they might even come to look down on me. I have an idea: In Yihong Courtyard there is an old woman named Ye—she is the one in charge of baking the tea. She is a trustworthy old soul and is especially favored by Ying’er’s mother. Why not entrust this matter to Old Ye? Even if she does not understand all the details, there’s no need for us to explain every point; she can simply confer with Ying’er’s mother. Even if Old Ye refuses altogether and delegates it to another, it is their own affair—and any idle gossip would not be directed at us. In this way, the work is fair and proper.”  Both Li Wan and Ping’er agreed, “Very well.”  Tanchun laughed, “Even so, I worry that once they see the profit they might forget their obligations.”  Ping’er smiled, “That won’t matter. Just the other day Ying’er even accepted Old Ye as her godmother, and both families are on very good terms.”  Satisfied with that, Tanchun then selected several more names, all of whom had long been regarded with a discerning eye. Using her brush she circled four names. Soon the old maids went back and forth. “The doctor has left,” they announced, having delivered the prescription upstairs. While some were sent outside to fetch the medicine and supervise its administration, Tanchun and Li Wan gathered the women and explained: “Each one of you shall be responsible for a certain area. According to the seasons, apart from what is allotted for household use, any surplus may be taken by you to earn a profit.
Grandmother remarked, “I see you’re preoccupied with other matters if you can’t even eat properly. Save the venison for your evening meal.” Fengjie quickly added, “That is fine—if there is any left, so be it.”  Xiangyun then proposed to Bao Yu, “Since there is fresh venison, why don’t we take a portion for ourselves—retrieve it from the garden and enjoy it together?” Bao Yu wholeheartedly agreed and ordered a matron to have the meat brought into the garden. After the meal, everyone dispersed and later reconvened in the garden near Lùxuě Ting, where Li Wan initiated a challenge by proposing an impromptu composition contest. Only Bao Yu and Xiangyun were absent. Daiyu commented, “They never seem to meet together; if they do, who knows what mischief might arise? Perhaps they’ve already conspired over that piece of venison!” Just then, a maid hurried in, and Daiyu smiled, “Our dear maid has arrived!” Xiangling’s face flushed, and she retorted, “So you’ve all colluded against me! Just wait until I confront you and our master!” Seeing Xiangling’s irritation, Ping’er, feeling remorse for her previous words, pulled her aside beneath a maple tree on a stone bench and recounted in detail every word Fengjie had said earlier—explaining the whole sequence of events. Xiangling’s cheeks reddened even further; she bitterly sneered, “I intend to keep this to myself—don’t let Second Madam hear a word. For heaven’s sake, if the head of the household decides to make me his concubine, I will never agree!” Before Ping’er could reply, laughter erupted from behind a boulder. “You shameless wench! Look at you – without a shred of modesty!” The group laughed heartily, teasing and chiding each other. Then Ping’er pulled Baochai aside in a low tone, “Sister, have you heard our latest news?” Baochai replied, “I haven’t heard a thing. My brother has been away these past days, so I’m completely out of the loop.” Ping’er laughed, “Lord Jia beat Second Young Master something fierce—did you not hear?” Baochai said, “I only caught a vague remark this morning and wasn’t sure. I was about to ask your grandmother when you arrived. What exactly was he beaten for?” Ping’er gritted her teeth and cursed, “It’s all because of that damned Jia Yucun – that unruly, wild brat! In less than ten years he’s caused endless trouble. This spring, our master found some old fans; when he returned, he discovered that all the fine fans in the house had become useless, so he ordered a search. And who should appear but that insolent scoundrel known as ‘Stone Dullard’—so poor he could barely eat, yet he clings stubbornly to twenty old fans as if he’d never let them go! Our Second Young Master, after enduring so much hardship, invited him into his home and inspected the fans. According to him, these were priceless masterpieces – depicting Xiang Fei, bamboo, deer, and jade – authentic relics of antiquity. When our master heard of it, he offered as many silver taels as necessary. But that Stone Dullard insisted, ‘Even if I starve or freeze, I won’t sell them!’ Our master was beside himself, cursing Second Young Master for his failure. In the end, he promised 500 taels – first exchanging silver, then taking the fans – yet the scoundrel refused, declaring, ‘You must take my life before you can have my fans!’ Think about it – what absurdity is this?” Baochai, upon hearing this, ordered a maid, “Go ask our mother; if she approves, I won’t interfere.” Ping’er went off, and after a while returned, “Sister, did you hear?” Baochai said, “If that is so, then let’s not worry; our master is not one to be trifled with. Even if he suffers a few setbacks, it will eventually all balance out.”  Just then, a young relative arrived. Fengjie and the others quickly rose to greet her. Old Madam Lai sat down and cheerfully said, “I am delighted – were it not for our masters’ favor, where would my joy be?
I’ll tell you the truth: I had a dream last night in which the Apricot Blossom Spirit demanded a set of white coins from me—no one in this house was to burn them, but rather a stranger was to burn them. Only then would my illness be cured swiftly. That is why I had white coins prepared and pestered someone to burn them for me. Because of that, I have just risen today. Now you’ve seen it—things are not well. It’s all your doing; why go on reporting him? Lotus Officer, just follow my instructions when you speak to them!”  Hearing this, Lotus Officer’s resolve strengthened and he insisted on leaving. The old maid, in haste, dropped the paper money and pleaded with Baoyu in a friendly tone, “I had no idea—if I go back to the mistress, I’ll be in deep trouble!” Baoyu replied, “You must not mention it again—I won’t say another word.” The old maid retorted, “I already reported back as I was told to take him along; all I could say is that he was summoned by Lin Daiyu.” Baoyu nodded in agreement, and the maid departed. Later, Baoyu questioned Lotus Officer in detail, “For whom exactly are you burning these offerings? It surely isn’t for your parents or siblings—it must be for someone else.” Still feeling grateful for having been shielded earlier—and knowing that Baoyu was one of the select few—Lotus Officer, with tears in his eyes, admitted, “Apart from the Flower Official in your room and Sister Baogui’s Ru Official, no one else knows of this matter. Today, by chance, you discovered it; you must not tell a soul.” He then wept, “I cannot speak openly with you; just return and discreetly ask the Flower Official, and you’ll know.” With that, he left glumly. Puzzled by what he had heard, Baoyu slowly made his way back to the Xiangxiang Chamber. There he found Daiyu looking ever more fragile and pale; when he inquired, she admitted that although she felt better than before, memories of past events brought tears to her eyes. After a brief conversation, she urged Baoyu to rest and recuperate—and so he reluctantly returned. Still, he longed to ask the Flower Official for further explanation, but Xiangyun and Xiangling had arrived, chatting and laughing with Xiren and the Flower Official. Not wanting to be pestered again, Baoyu held his tongue. After a while, the Flower Official went with his adoptive mother to wash his hair; however, his adoptive mother insisted that her own daughter be washed first before calling for the Flower Official. Offended, the Flower Official remarked that she was being partial, “Using your daughter’s leftover water to wash me? My monthly allowance is all you withhold—and instead, you give me the scraps!” His adoptive mother, mortified and then angry, scolded, “You ungrateful wretch! No wonder everyone says that no actor in this trade is worth keeping. What good is there about you? Ever since you joined this line, you’ve gone to seed! Even a little brat could pick on you—your tongue is as sharp as a mule’s bite!” The two began to quarrel. Xiren quickly sent someone away, saying, “Stop all this clamor! Look—Grandmother is not home; if you all keep shouting, not even a word of calm can be heard!”  Jingwen then commented, “This is just the Flower Official being careless—he doesn’t know what he’s doing, pretending to be all theatrical, as if he has once captured a rebel king or caught a traitor.” Xiren retorted, “One hand alone can’t make a clap. The elders are too unjust, and the younger ones are just too hateful.”  Baoyu added, “It’s no wonder the Flower Official feels aggrieved. As the saying goes, ‘When things are not right, even things will cry out.’ He is orphaned and has no one to care for him, yet people take advantage of him and trample him—how can we blame him?” Then he leaned over to Xiren and said, “How much does he get a month, anyway? Perhaps you should take him in to care for him—it would simplify matters.”  Xiren replied, “I’d love to take care of him, but if I do, I’d have to extract his few coins as well—and that would only invite accusations.” With that she got up, went into another room, and returned with a bottle of floral oil, an egg, some scented soap, and a hair tie.
Meanwhile, following his mother’s instructions, Xue Pan quickly sent out invitations and prepared a banquet. The next day, four of his merchant companions arrived. They discussed business matters related to the goods. Then the guests were seated, and Xue Pan poured wine in turn. Madam Xue asked a maid to convey her greetings from inside. As they drank and chatted, one of the men remarked, “We’re missing two good friends at this banquet.” The others asked, “Who do you mean?” He replied, “Who else but Second Master Lian from the Jia family and Master Xue’s sworn brother, Liu Second Master?” Indeed, everyone remembered them and asked Xue Pan, “Why didn’t you invite Second Master Lian and Second Master Liu?” Xue Pan frowned and sighed, “Second Master Lian left for Ping’an Prefecture two days ago. As for Second Master Liu—don’t even speak of it. It’s the strangest thing: he’s no longer ‘Liu Second Master’ but who knows where he’s gone as ‘Liu the Daoist?’” Everyone was stunned and asked what he meant. Xue Pan told them the whole story about Xianglian. The group was even more amazed. One said, “No wonder a few days ago at the inn, we heard a rumor that a Daoist used just a few words to ‘take someone across’ and then disappeared like a gust of wind. We were busy loading shipments and had no time to learn more, so we weren’t sure if it was true. Little did we know it was actually Liu Second Master! Had we known, we could have tried to persuade him otherwise. No matter what, we wouldn’t have let him go.” One of them wondered aloud, “Could it be something else?” The rest asked, “What could that be?” He replied, “Liu Second Master is such a sharp man—could he really have become a Daoist? He has some martial skill and strength. Maybe he saw through that Daoist’s trickery and only pretended to join him, so he could handle him in secret. Who can say?” Xue Pan said, “If that’s the case, fine. In this world, why does no one stop these charlatans from misleading people?” Another asked, “When you heard, didn’t you go search for him?” Xue Pan answered, “I searched everywhere, inside and outside the city. Laugh at me if you will—I was so distraught at not finding him that I cried.” He finished with a long sigh, looking depressed, nothing like his usual cheerful self. The merchants, seeing his state of mind, felt it best not to linger. They merely drank a few cups, had a quick meal, and departed. Meanwhile, Baoyu arrived at Baochai’s place with Daiyu. Baoyu said, “My elder brother went through such trouble bringing these gifts, yet you’ve given them all away—even to us.” Baochai laughed, “They’re just odds and ends collected along the way, not anything special, but they may look novel to you all.” Daiyu said, “When we were little, we didn’t care about such things, but now they seem new indeed.” Baochai smiled. “You see? That’s exactly what people mean by ‘goods from afar seem more valuable.’ In reality, they’re nothing much.” Baoyu, noticing this echoed Daiyu’s earlier feelings, quickly changed the subject: “Next year, if my brother goes again, he must bring us more.” Daiyu glanced at him. “If you want them, just say so—no need to drag anyone else into it. Sister, look at him—he didn’t come to thank you; he’s already placing orders for next year.” Both Baochai and Baoyu laughed. They chatted a while longer. Then, as the topic of Daiyu’s illness arose, Baochai offered some gentle advice. “If you’re feeling unwell, Sister, it might help to force yourself to go out a bit, walk around, and distract yourself. It’s better than sitting idle in your room. I’ve been feeling weak myself lately, feverish, just wanting to lie down all day. With this nasty weather, I was afraid of getting sick, so I tried keeping busy.
That insolent wretch—why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him, and teach him a lesson so that he may mend his ways. Expelling him outright would be too harsh, for he is not our own blood but merely the attendant of the madams. I say, let Grandmother administer a few lashes as a warning; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares to drink again, he shall never near the wine!”  Old Madam Lai’s family agreed, and soon Zhou Rui’s and Zhang Cai’s families arrived with their accounts. Fengjie announced, “My daughter-in-law is here to fetch her mother-in-law.”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded. Old Madam Lai asked, “What is the matter? Explain to me so I may decide.”  Fengjie explained, “On my birthday the other day, while no one was outside handling things, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he merely sat cursing. When two women entered, he gathered the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of buns in the courtyard. After everyone left, I sent Cai Ming to admonish him—and he ended up cursing Cai Ming. Such lawlessness! Why hasn’t he been expelled?”  Old Madam Lai replied, “I know his faults. Beat him, scold him—teach him to mend his ways. Expelling him outright is unthinkable, for he is not our own child but merely the attendant of the madams. I say, let Grandmother teach him a few licks as a warning; if he continues, then expel him. Consider both his own mother and the madams.”  Fengjie said, “Very well—tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never come near the wine!”  Zhou Rui’s family knelt once more and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai then ordered, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I’ll have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse escorted them away. Later that evening, as everyone returned to their homes, Aunt Xue and Baochai noticed that Xiangling’s eyes were swollen from crying. When they went to see Sè Pan, they found that although his face and body bore scars, he had not suffered any serious injury. Aunt Xue felt both sorrow and anger, cursing Sè Pan and then cursing Xianglian, and even considered telling Mrs. Wang so someone could apprehend Xianglian. Baochai quickly interjected, “It’s nothing major—after a night of drinking, a few slaps are bound to happen. Besides, our household is notorious for its unruliness. Mother only feels sorrow because she cares. In a few days, when your brother recovers and goes out, those dignified men like Mr. Zhen and Jia Lian won’t let it go, and someone will be made to apologize on his behalf. For now, let Mother speak up, and it will all be settled.”  Sè Pan lay in his room, cursing Xianglian and even ordering his attendant, “Go dismantle his house, beat him to death, and sue him!” But his attendant was quickly hushed by Aunt Xue, who said, “Xianglian was merely out of line while drunk; now that he is sober, he deeply regrets his actions and fears punishment.” Sè Pan heard this and realized his predicament. (How these matters ultimately resolve… we shall continue in the next installment.) Chapter 50 At Lu Xue-Ting: A Contest of Impromptu Poems, and at Nuan Xiang Wu: An Elegant Assembly of Spring Lantern Riddles  It happened that Xue Baochai said, “Let’s decide on an order so I can write ours out.” With that, she ordered everyone to draw lots for the sequence. Naturally, the first turn fell to Miss Li; then each, in turn, began to present their verse. “Since that is so,” said Lady Phoenix (Fengjie’er), “I too will have a word at the very beginning.”  Everyone burst into laughter.
Everyone laughed heartily, fearing Xiangling might take her anger out on them, and soon they dispersed amid laughter. Xiangling then rose and, looking down, saw droplets of green water streaming from her skirt. Just as she was about to launch into a tirade, Baoyu—having gathered some wild flowers for fun—noticed that everyone had scattered except Xiangling, who still stood there adjusting her skirt. He asked, “What happened? Why did everyone scatter?” Xiangling replied, “I had a cluster of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ that none recognized, and they ended up accusing me of making up tales—in the ensuing commotion, my new skirt was ruined.” Baoyu laughed and said, “You claim to have ‘Coupled Hibiscus’—well, I here have a double lotus blossom!” As he spoke, he plucked a double lotus blossom and simultaneously picked up a ‘Hui’ flower. Xiangling said, “What do you mean by ‘not coupled’ or ‘not a double blossom’? Look at my skirt!” Baoyu bent down and exclaimed, “Alas, it’s muddied! What a pity—this pomegranate‑red silk, so difficult to keep pristine!” Xiangling explained, “This was brought by Sister Qin the other day. She made one for herself and one for me; today I wore mine for the first time.” Baoyu stamped his foot and sighed, “If your household lost one garment every day, it might not matter—but if the very first one, the one Sister Qin brought, is ruined, isn’t that a betrayal of her affection? And then there’s Aunt Zhao’s constant nagging—I even heard her say you never know how to live properly or cherish your blessings. If Aunt Zhao sees this, she’ll never let it pass!” Struck by his words, Xiangling found herself strangely pleased. She laughed and said, “That’s exactly right. I have several new skirts, but none suit me; if I had one that did, I’d simply change into it.” Baoyu said, “Don’t fuss—just stand still; otherwise, even your undergarments, knee covers, and shoes will get muddied. I have an idea: Sister Xiren made a skirt exactly like this last month; since she was so filial she never wore it and even gave it to you in exchange—how about that?” Xiangling laughed and shook her head, “No, if they find out, it won’t do.” Baoyu replied, “What’s there to fear? Once she is full of filial piety, won’t she let you offer her something else? If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it isn’t a secret matter—just tell Sister Baoqin as well. I only worry that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. But promise me she delivers it in person!” Overjoyed, Baoyu quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly he mused, “What a pity that such a person—an orphan who has even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant—should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier even Ping’er was unexpected, but today is an unforeseen twist upon twists.” Lost in thought, he returned to his room and called Xiren to recount the matter in detail. Xiangling—beloved by all for her gentle nature—was adored by everyone; and Xiren, naturally free-spirited and close to Xiangling, upon hearing the news immediately opened her heart and, after neatly gathering her thoughts, accompanied Baoyu to find Xiangling. Finding her still waiting, Xiren teased, “I told you you’re always so mischievous—always stirring up some story!” Xiangling blushed and said, “Thank you, Sister; who would have known that the cunning little rascal has such a dark heart?” She then removed her skirt, inspected it, and indeed found it unchanged. She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Hand this soiled skirt over to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you can ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister—take it, but do not give it to that other girl.
As they entered, they heard loud wailing. It was Jia She and Jia Lian, who had escorted Grandmother Jia home and then gone directly to this mansion. The moment Grandmother Jia stepped inside, Jia She and Jia Lian, with the clan in tow, knelt in tears to greet her. Jia Zhen and Jia Rong also clung to her, weeping bitterly. Grandmother Jia, an elderly woman, was overcome with grief at the sight, and for a while she held Zhen and Rong, lamenting loudly. Jia She and Jia Lian urged her to stop; only then did she manage to check her tears. She then moved to the right side of the hall, where she saw You-shi and her daughter-in-law, who also wept in her arms. After this round of crying, everyone else came forward to pay respects. Fearing that watching over the coffin might deepen her grief and harm her health, Jia Lian and the others urged her to go home. Unwilling as she was, she finally agreed to leave. Indeed, at her advanced age, she found it difficult to withstand the emotional strain. That night she felt flushed and heavy-headed, her nose stuffed and voice hoarse, so they summoned a physician. All were busy through half the night; fortunately, the illness had not penetrated deeply, and after some sweating, her pulse stabilized. By the third watch, her fever subsided, easing everyone’s mind. She continued to take medicine and recover over the following days. Not long after, came the date set for Jia Jing’s interment. Grandmother Jia was still not fully well, so she stayed home with Baoyu to attend her. Wang Xifeng also remained due to her lingering illness, but Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing, and Lady Wang led many household members, both men and women, to escort the coffin to the Iron Threshold Temple. They did not return until nightfall. Jia Zhen, You-shi, and Jia Rong stayed at the temple to keep vigil, planning to accompany the coffin back to their ancestral home after a hundred days, leaving old Lady You and her two daughters, Second Sister and Third Sister, in charge of the household. Meanwhile, Jia Lian—having heard much about the two You sisters—had long been eager to meet them. During the period Jia Jing’s coffin was kept at home, he grew familiar with these sisters and fell for Second Sister. Knowing of Jia Zhen and Jia Rong’s own dalliances, he dared to flirt, exchanging glances and signals. Third Sister, however, remained indifferent, while Second Sister seemed to reciprocate. Yet in the presence of so many people, they had no chance to proceed. Jia Lian also feared arousing Jia Zhen’s jealousy and did not dare act rashly. Their desire remained unfulfilled, though mutual understanding existed. After Jia Jing’s coffin had been taken away, the household at the Ning mansion was sparse: aside from Lady You, Second Sister, Third Sister, and a few old maids and servant girls in the main rooms, most of the concubines and maids followed Jia Zhen and Jia Rong to the temple. Outside, only a few servants remained on guard duty, patrolling at night and watching the gates by day; they seldom ventured inside. Jia Lian seized this opportunity, claiming to be assisting Jia Zhen and decided to lodge at the temple. He frequently claimed to manage household affairs on Jia Zhen’s behalf and used these excuses to visit the Ning mansion and seduce Second Sister. One day, the steward Yu Lu came to report to Jia Zhen, “All the funeral supplies—canopies, poles, mourning cloth, plus the palanquin bearers and their robes—cost a total of one thousand, one hundred and ten taels of silver. So far we have paid five hundred taels; six hundred and ten remain. Yesterday the merchants came demanding payment, so I’ve come for your instructions.” Jia Zhen replied, “Just collect it from the storeroom. Why bother me?” Yu Lu explained, “I went there yesterday, but since the master passed away, there have been many expenses. What remains must be saved for the hundred-day observances and the monastery’s needs, so they cannot provide the rest. That’s why I had no choice but to ask you if perhaps there’s some other source of funds, or if I should try to borrow it.” Jia Zhen laughed, “You think we’re hiding silver somewhere?
She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient. Now that everything is coming to light—and even the item lost in the mistress’s room the other day has found an owner—it was when Baoyu came over with those two rascals (the culprits) who, not being cautious, inadvertently caused a stir. They panicked, and in the end Baoyu found out and brought the items out to me. That poria snow, too, was obtained by Baoyu from outside; it has been given to many people—not only in the garden but also to the older maids for their relatives. Xiren, too, once gave some to a worthy person. Their private dealings are nothing new. The two baskets displayed in the meeting hall the other day were left intact—so how did they come to be mixed up? I will explain it to the mistress once I return.”  After saying this, Ping’er slips away to her boudoir and relates the matter in detail to Feng Xifeng. Feng Xifeng remarks, “Even so, Baoyu is the sort who, regardless of right or wrong, loves to take charge of every affair. Even if others plead with him, he won’t spare a kind word—instead, he’ll grab a coal bucket and vow to handle every matter himself! If we take him at his word, then when major issues arise it will be chaos. I say we gather all the maidservants from the mistress’s room. While we might not resort to harsh beatings, we should at least have them kneel on ceramic tiles under the sun and deprive them of food. If they don’t do so for a day, they are as fixed as iron—once taken in, they will be bound for life.”  Then she adds, “‘Flies don’t hold onto eggs without cracks’—although the Liu family didn’t steal anything, some influential people will still claim it. Even if we don’t impose the thief’s penalty, we ought to dismiss him. The court might later find fault with us, but that will not be seen as an injustice.”  Ping’er replies, “Why trouble yourself? ‘When it is time to let go, let go’—there’s nothing major here. In my opinion, even if you fuss for a hundred days here, eventually you’ll return to the other room, and no small grievance should leave a lasting grudge. Besides, you yourself have endured three disasters and eight hardships—barely managing to conceive a son, only to lose him at six or seven months. How can we not think that you were overworked and heartbroken? It’s better if half the people see you than if none do.”  Feng Xifeng laughs and says, “Do as you please! I won’t hold any grudges.”  Ping’er smiles, “Isn’t that proper?”  After saying this, she turns and goes out to distribute the instructions one by one. ——  To know the whole story in full detail, we must await the next chapter. Chapter 62 Drunken Xiangyun Slumbers on the Peony Screen, while Clueless Xiangling Unravels the Pomegranate-Skirt  Afterwards, Ping’er stepped out and instructed the Lin household person, saying: “‘Great affairs become small, and small matters vanish altogether’ – that is the mark of a thriving household. If every little thing were to be made a spectacle with bells and drums, nothing would be proper. Now, take that mother and daughter back, resume your usual duties, and retrieve those belonging to the Qin family. Let’s not dwell on this matter any longer—just be sure to patrol carefully each day.” With these words, she rose and left. The Liu family’s mother and daughter quickly knelt in respect. The Lin household person then escorted them back into the garden, returning to Li Wan and Tanchun. Both replied, “Understood. Better to have nothing happen at all.”  Meanwhile, Siqi and the others had been excited for a while. At that very moment the household of Qin Xian, having long waited for an opening, burst forth into activity in the kitchen—scrambling to pack up utensils, rice, coal, and so on.
Seeing Tan Chun frown, she could only lower her head silently. At that moment, Baochai from the upper room entered, and Tan Chun and Li Wan quickly stood to offer seats. Before they could speak, one of the wives entered to inquire about something; because Tan Chun had been crying earlier, a few little maids soon followed with basin, handkerchiefs, and small mirrors and powder boxes. At that moment, Tan Chun—who was sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch—had a maid approach with a basin. The maid knelt on both knees and presented the basin; two other little maids also knelt with handkerchiefs and small mirrors with powder and ornaments. Seeing that the official secretary was absent, Ping’er hurried over, helped Tan Chun remove her bracelets, and even handed her a large handkerchief to cover her exposed bosom. Only then did Tan Chun extend her hand to the basin to wash her face. The wife then remarked, “Madam, the annual allowance for those at Zhi Huan’s Academy—supporting Brother Huan and Brother Lan—is…”   Ping’er interrupted with a laugh, “What are you doing? I saw the young lady washing her face with your own eyes; if you do not go and attend to her, then you should be the one to speak up first! When Second Aunt is present, you should not behave so rudely! I must go back to Second Aunt and tell her that in your eyes, the young lady is not being valued—otherwise, you’ll be blamed for losing face!” The wife, taken aback, quickly apologized with a smile and withdrew. Tan Chun, after smoothing her face, glared coldly at Ping’er and said, “You’re a step behind—I barely caught the tail end of a laugh, and now someone else is making fun of us! Even Sister Wu, who has long been in charge, did not thoroughly investigate before joining us. Fortunately, when we inquired, he had the nerve to say ‘I forgot’—and I thought, ‘Has Second Aunt’s matter been so forgotten that we must search again?’ I doubt your master will have the patience to go and search for him!” Ping’er laughed, “If he were that insistent, I guarantee his leg tendons would have snapped by now. Do not trust them too easily. They are watching Second Aunt as if she were a bodhisattva, and you, being a bashful young lady, are merely riding on our coattails.” In a low voice, she added, “Now, go outside and let everyone frolic—when Grandmother is well, we shall discuss it further.” The wives outside all laughed. At that moment, Autumn (Qiu Wen) arrived. The wives quickly came forward to greet her, and she said, “Dear sisters, please rest awhile—the meal is being set out. Once the tables are cleared, we can resume our conversation.” Autumn laughed, “I have no time to wait!” and promptly headed for the main hall. Ping’er called out, “Come back quickly!” Autumn turned, saw Ping’er, and laughed, “What are you doing here, playing gatekeeper?” She then returned to sit on Ping’er’s mat. In a hushed tone, Ping’er asked, “What did you want to ask?” Autumn replied, “I’m wondering about Bao Yu’s monthly stipend—how early or late do we receive ours?” Ping’er said, “It isn’t a major matter! Just go back and tell Xiangren what I said: whatever happens today, don’t return any items. If one item is returned, then a hundred items will be returned. (That is, any discrepancy will be repaid one-for-one.)”   Autumn, puzzled, asked, “Why is that?” Ping’er and the wives explained the details, adding, “We are planning to set up a few measures for handling urgent matters and establishing clear guidelines so as to prevent disputes among everyone. Why must you all bring up this trivial issue now? Once you mention it, they may very well use it as an example and, in doing so, burden you all further. Just listen—regarding Second Aunt’s case, they might even demand you provide two more examples to silence the crowd.”   Hearing this, Autumn extended her tongue and laughed, “Thank goodness, dear sister, that you are here—otherwise, I’d be utterly embarrassed.
And yet this very year you die here—go, take your own funeral!” Xiangren added, “Exactly! I never imagined I would be forced to witness my parents’ burial. After Madam distributes her silver—forty taels no less—it will be considered a service to me, and I dare not expect more.” Alarmed, Bao Yu quickly turned away and whispered to Meiyue, “Who would have thought he would come too? If he leaves in a huff again, perhaps we should retreat so that they may speak in peace. At least Xiangren will then have company.” With that, Bao Yu quietly slipped away. He then went behind some boulders to adjust his clothes. Meiyue and Qiuyun teased him, “Bend down and fix your garment—watch out, the wind might freeze your stomach!” Meanwhile, two little maids, realizing they were needed for minor tasks, hurried off to the tea room to fetch water. Not long after, Bao Yu encountered two young women approaching. One carried a small basin, while the other clutched a handkerchief and a small kettle—they had been waiting for quite some time. Soon, Xiangyun’s group arrived. Xiangyun teased, “Look, here comes another one! There’s no room left for you!” Bao Yu chuckled, “What a ‘Winter Boudoir Gathering’ indeed—alas, I have arrived too late. After all, this room is far warmer than the others, and the chairs are quite comfortable.” He then sat in the spot where Daiyu usually sat, placing a small chair atop another. While doing so, he noticed an exquisite jade basin on display that held a single potted narcissus with delicate petals. Exclaiming, “What a beautiful flower! The warmer the room, the richer its fragrance. Why did I not see it yesterday?”  Daiyu smiled and said, “That was a gift from our chief steward; Aunt Lai sent two pots—one of narcissus for me and one of wax plum for Yun. I originally refused them for fear of offending her, but if you wish, I can pass one along to you.”  Bao Yu replied, “I already have two at home, though they pale in comparison to this one. How could I possibly re-gift something so precious? That wouldn’t be proper.”  Daiyu replied, “I spend so many days tending to my medicines that I can scarcely keep up with the fragrance of flowers—they eventually fade. It is better that you take it away, so that the flower’s scent remains pure and undisturbed.”  Bao Yu laughed, “You truly understand these things!”  Daiyu then said, “Tomorrow our poetry society shall have a new theme—let us compose odes to the narcissus and the wax plum.”  Bao Yu teased, “Enough, enough! I dare not compose any more; every time I do I am penalized and left feeling embarrassed.”  Daiyu covered her face in sorrow. Bao Yu said, “Why worry? I have no fear of embarrassment; you, however, seem to blush terribly.”  At that moment, Baochai proposed, “Next time I will host a session with four topics—four odes and four lyrical pieces. Each person must compose four poems and four lyrics. The first topic shall be ‘Ode to the Taiji Diagram,’ using the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme in a five-character regulated verse; not a single syllable of the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme shall remain unused.”  Baoqin laughed, “That indeed is a challenge—it shows that our sister is not entirely sincere if she sets such hardships. Even if one forces words out, they may end up as a jumble of ‘I Ching’ phrases. I recall when I was eight and accompanied my father to the Western Sea to purchase Western goods—who would have thought that a girl barely fifteen, whose beauty resembled that of a Western painting (with golden hair, cascading ornaments, and a head adorned with agate, coral, cat’s-eye, and emerald), dressed in a brocade gown with embroidered sleeves and carrying a jeweled Wakizashi, could be so exquisite? They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics, and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write couplets for her!”  Everyone marveled.
They’re both like fairy maidens, skilled in letters. When they ride in carriages or stroll in the garden, we scarcely dare breathe.”  Second Sister chuckled, “With such strict family rules, young page boys like you shouldn’t even think of crossing paths with those young ladies, let alone breathe near them.” Xing’er shook his head. “That’s not it. It’s just that if our breathing were too forceful, we might blow Lin Miss off her feet, and if it were too warm, we might melt Xue Miss!” Everyone burst into laughter. Chapter 66  Once Xing’er joked about blowing Lin girl away or melting Xue girl, everyone burst into laughter. Bao Er’s wife gave him a light swat and said with a laugh, “There was already some truth in what you said, but now you’re completely letting it run loose. You’re supposed to be one of Second Master’s people, yet these words sound like they come from Baoyu’s crowd.” Second Sister You was about to pursue the subject further when Third Sister You asked with a smile, “So, what exactly does your Baoyu do all day apart from attending classes?”  Xing’er laughed and replied, “Third Aunt, you shouldn’t even ask. If I tell you, you might not believe it. He’s never actually studied properly. From our ancestors down to our Second Master, who wasn’t watched by a strict tutor day in and day out? But Baoyu hates studying, and because he’s our Old Lady’s favorite, the Master stopped trying to force him. He’s restless all day, jabbering nonsense that no one understands, and doing things that no one can figure out. From the outside, he looks refined and bright, so people think he must be clever inside, but in truth, he’s even more muddled than he seems. When he meets someone, he doesn’t say a word. Interestingly, though he never studied, he somehow recognizes a few characters. Each day, he doesn’t learn literature or martial arts and even avoids seeing people, preferring to play among the maids. What’s more, he’s not the least bit forceful. Now and then, he might see us and feel like joining in without any formalities. If he’s not in the mood, he just leaves, and we do the same. Sitting or lying around, if he sees us, he doesn’t mind; we don’t stand up for him, and he never scolds us. We’re not afraid of him at all. Everybody does as they please, and he doesn’t interfere.”  Third Sister You laughed. “The master is lenient, yet you complain. If he were strict, you’d also complain. Looks like you servants are impossible to please.” Second Sister You added, “We always heard he was a good one; turns out he’s like this. What a shame that a child with such a fine constitution is so careless!” Third Sister You said, “Sister, don’t believe all he’s saying. We’ve seen Baoyu more than once or twice. His manner, his speech, even how he eats and drinks, carry a bit of a girl’s air—probably from spending all his time indoors. But is he truly muddled? Remember when everyone was in mourning, and we were all together that day when the monks came to circle around the coffin? We stood on one side, and he stood in front, blocking the way. People said he was rude and lacked sense. But didn’t he quietly tell us afterward, ‘Sisters, you don’t know; I wasn’t just being clueless. Those monks are so filthy, I was afraid their smell would bother you’? And then, when he was drinking tea, you asked for some, and an old woman picked up his cup to pour for you; he quickly stopped her, saying, ‘That cup is dirty now—wash another one before filling it.’ From these two things alone, I kept an eye on him and saw that as long as he’s with the girls, he’ll do whatever’s needed. He just doesn’t follow the usual formalities with outsiders, so they don’t understand him.”  Second Sister You smiled. “From that, it sounds as if you two already have feelings for each other. Wouldn’t it be nice if we betrothed you to him?” Third Sister, noticing Xing’er’s presence, simply lowered her head and cracked melon seeds without speaking.
Finding her still waiting, Xiren teased, “I told you you’re always so mischievous—always stirring up some story!” Xiangling blushed and said, “Thank you, Sister; who would have known that the cunning little rascal has such a dark heart?” She then removed her skirt, inspected it, and indeed found it unchanged. She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Hand this soiled skirt over to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you can ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister—take it, but do not give it to that other girl. I’m done with it.” Xiren responded, “You are so generous!” Xiangling then knelt twice in thanks before Xiren took the muddy skirt away. Later, Baoyu was found squatting at a spot where he had, using a twig, dug a small pit; he had gathered fallen blossoms to line it, arranged the lotus and ‘Hui’ flowers in it, and then covered them with soil to press them down. Xiangling grabbed his hand and laughed, “What are you doing? Everyone says you’re such a sneaky little fellow who makes others blush. Look at your hands—they’re so muddy and slippery with moss; you’d better wash them off!” Baoyu laughed and got up to wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called to Baoyu. Not sure what she wished to say, he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply, laughing as she tried to speak but found no words. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face grew even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just do not mention this skirt matter to your brother—let’s leave it at that.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? You’re practically sticking your head into the lion’s den!” He then returned to his room. To learn the full details of these intrigues and playful exchanges, we must await the next chapter… Chapter 71 Spurred by Lingering Resentments, Suspicions Arise Among Relatives; Yet a “Mandarin Duck” Maiden Unwittingly Encounters Her Match  At Grandmother Jia’s residence, two maids hurriedly came seeking Baoyu, exclaiming, “Second Master, come with us at once—the master’s family has arrived!” Overjoyed yet troubled, Baoyu quickly changed his clothes and went forward to pay his respects. In the room where Jia Zheng was with Grandmother Jia, still unready in his attire, Baoyu’s arrival to offer his greetings filled Jia Zheng with both delight and a tinge of sorrow. After discussing some official matters, Grandmother Jia told him, “You must be tired—go rest a while.” Jia Zheng, rising quickly and smiling, agreed with a “Yes,” exchanged a few more words, then withdrew. Baoyu and the others followed suit. It turned out that Jia Zheng had returned to the capital on official orders but, being a poor student, had not dared to come home immediately. On the first day he went out, both Zhen, Lian, and Baoyu had already greeted him at the station. After first greeting Grandmother Jia, he then ordered everyone to see to the household’s needs. The next day, after the imperial audience and the completion of official duties, he returned home. Granted a month’s leave, he spent his time in relative ease. Now, as age pressed and affairs grew heavy—and after several years spent apart from one another—the family finally gathered in cheerful reunion. All household matters were set aside; they read books, played chess and drank with their close friends, and during the day the mother, children, and spouses all enjoyed the pleasure of familial reunion. That same year, on the third day of the eighth lunar month, Grandmother Jia celebrated her eightieth birthday. With all relatives present, it was feared that the banquet might not have enough space. So the family, together with Jia She and Jia Lian, decided that from the twenty-eighth day until the fifth day of the next month the Ning and Rong mansions would hold separate banquets: the Ning mansion for official guests and the Rong mansion for those from the inner court.
Indeed, at her advanced age, she found it difficult to withstand the emotional strain. That night she felt flushed and heavy-headed, her nose stuffed and voice hoarse, so they summoned a physician. All were busy through half the night; fortunately, the illness had not penetrated deeply, and after some sweating, her pulse stabilized. By the third watch, her fever subsided, easing everyone’s mind. She continued to take medicine and recover over the following days. Not long after, came the date set for Jia Jing’s interment. Grandmother Jia was still not fully well, so she stayed home with Baoyu to attend her. Wang Xifeng also remained due to her lingering illness, but Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing, and Lady Wang led many household members, both men and women, to escort the coffin to the Iron Threshold Temple. They did not return until nightfall. Jia Zhen, You-shi, and Jia Rong stayed at the temple to keep vigil, planning to accompany the coffin back to their ancestral home after a hundred days, leaving old Lady You and her two daughters, Second Sister and Third Sister, in charge of the household. Meanwhile, Jia Lian—having heard much about the two You sisters—had long been eager to meet them. During the period Jia Jing’s coffin was kept at home, he grew familiar with these sisters and fell for Second Sister. Knowing of Jia Zhen and Jia Rong’s own dalliances, he dared to flirt, exchanging glances and signals. Third Sister, however, remained indifferent, while Second Sister seemed to reciprocate. Yet in the presence of so many people, they had no chance to proceed. Jia Lian also feared arousing Jia Zhen’s jealousy and did not dare act rashly. Their desire remained unfulfilled, though mutual understanding existed. After Jia Jing’s coffin had been taken away, the household at the Ning mansion was sparse: aside from Lady You, Second Sister, Third Sister, and a few old maids and servant girls in the main rooms, most of the concubines and maids followed Jia Zhen and Jia Rong to the temple. Outside, only a few servants remained on guard duty, patrolling at night and watching the gates by day; they seldom ventured inside. Jia Lian seized this opportunity, claiming to be assisting Jia Zhen and decided to lodge at the temple. He frequently claimed to manage household affairs on Jia Zhen’s behalf and used these excuses to visit the Ning mansion and seduce Second Sister. One day, the steward Yu Lu came to report to Jia Zhen, “All the funeral supplies—canopies, poles, mourning cloth, plus the palanquin bearers and their robes—cost a total of one thousand, one hundred and ten taels of silver. So far we have paid five hundred taels; six hundred and ten remain. Yesterday the merchants came demanding payment, so I’ve come for your instructions.” Jia Zhen replied, “Just collect it from the storeroom. Why bother me?” Yu Lu explained, “I went there yesterday, but since the master passed away, there have been many expenses. What remains must be saved for the hundred-day observances and the monastery’s needs, so they cannot provide the rest. That’s why I had no choice but to ask you if perhaps there’s some other source of funds, or if I should try to borrow it.” Jia Zhen laughed, “You think we’re hiding silver somewhere? Just borrow it from somewhere—how you do it is your business.” Yu Lu smiled wryly, “If it were just one or two hundred, I might manage, but six or seven hundred is beyond my means.” Jia Zhen thought a moment and told Jia Rong, “Go ask your mother. Yesterday, someone from the Jiangnan Zhen family brought five hundred taels as a condolence gift. We haven’t turned it into the storeroom yet. Have your mother give it to him. Look around for some more, put it all together, and settle his accounts. The rest, Yu Lu can try to borrow.” Jia Rong agreed. He went to inform You-shi, then returned and said, “Of that five hundred taels, two hundred have already been spent. The remaining three hundred were sent home for Mother to keep.” Jia Zhen said, “In that case, take him there. Get the silver from your mother, then tell him to borrow the rest. Make sure he has enough.
Yesterday I copied your ‘White Crabapple’ poems onto my fan, but that was because I admired them so. I only kept them on me to read. Do you think I don’t know that poems from a young lady’s hand must never be carelessly passed around? Since you scolded me last time, I haven’t once taken them outside the Garden.”  Baochai smiled, “Cousin Lin is right to be cautious. If you wrote them on a fan and happened to leave it in the schoolroom, someone might ask who wrote them, and the word would spread. That wouldn’t be good at all. It’s long been said that ‘a girl’s virtue is to be without talent.’ Above all, one must be chaste and quiet; needlework is secondary. Poems and lyrics are just amusements in the boudoir—nice to have or not. We young ladies of prominent families don’t need such reputations for literary talent.” She then turned to Daiyu and said, “But it’s all right if I read them, as long as they don’t leave your room.” Daiyu laughed, “Well, then maybe even you shouldn’t read them!” She pointed at Baoyu. “He’s already snatched them away.”  Hearing this, Baoyu took the paper from his robe and read it with Baochai. They saw five poems, each entitled with the name of a beauty:  Xishi “In one age of perfect beauty, she followed the waves into the swirl of fate; Empty were the courtiers of Wu, still longing for the girl from her home. Mock not the village girl trying to imitate her brow’s furrow— When hair is white, she still washes clothes by the stream.”  Yu Ji “At midnight, crows cry and the wind howls, tearing the heart, How can Yu’s hidden sorrow face those eyes with double pupils? Qing and Peng willingly fell to pieces in the future— Why not drink the sword’s edge under the Chu war tent?”  Wang Zhaojun “She astounded all with breathtaking splendor when she left the Han palace, Beauty doomed by fate, the same in ancient days and now. Even if the emperor scorned her charms, How could he hand over the power to a painter who decided her destiny?”  Green Pearl “Jade or common pebble, all are cast aside alike; When did Shi Wei ever prize a maiden’s grace? Her stubborn fortune must have been shaped in a previous life— At least, in the end, there was a shared end to console her loneliness.”  Hongfu (Red Whisk) “A long sword and bold talk—her manner was unique indeed, A beauty with discerning eyes recognized the despairing path. Lifeless bodies fill Lord Yang’s camp, How could they confine this girl with the heart of a hero?”  Baoyu was full of praise and suggested, “Why not call these five poems ‘Five Beauties in Verse?’” Without waiting for her to reply, he took a brush and added the title at the end. Baochai also commented, “When writing on well-known subjects, the challenge is to avoid repeating old ideas. If one merely follows in others’ footsteps, even if the wording is refined, it still lacks originality and can’t be counted among truly good poems. Take, for example, the many existing pieces on Wang Zhaojun: some lament her, some blame the painter Mao Yanshou, others criticize the Han emperor for failing to seek portraits of worthy ministers instead of beautiful women. There are endless variations. Later, Wang Anshi wrote, ‘For such grace and bearing, no brush could do her justice—back then they wrongfully killed Mao Yanshou.’ Ouyang Xiu wrote, ‘If even what one sees and hears can be distorted so, how could one control distant barbarians?’ Those verses each expressed fresh thoughts. Now your five poems truly show unique insights and open a new perspective.”  Before she could continue, someone came to report, “Second Master Lian has returned. Word was that he went to the Eastern Mansion, but it’s been a while, so he must be back.” Baoyu immediately rose to greet him inside the front gate. Sure enough, Jia Lian was just dismounting. Baoyu greeted him with a bow and delivered the usual respects for Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and so on, then bowed to Jia Lian himself.
If you leave now, you will be rewarded with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua considered this and thought, “That is a good idea indeed.” After consulting with his parents, they agreed and arranged a sum of a hundred taels. The next morning, at the break of dawn (during the fifth watch), Zhang Hua and his father departed for their hometown. Jia Huan later confirmed the details and reported back to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Jia Zhen remarked, “Zhang Hua’s father and son made a false accusation and then fled in terror; the authorities, aware of the facts, did not pursue the matter further. The matter is now concluded.” Fengjie, however, expressed her dismay to Grandmother Jia, “It is all because Sister Zhen mishandled things. They never officially canceled the arranged marriage, and now someone has filed a complaint. This is an official matter!” Grandmother Jia summoned Second Sister You over and said, “Since your betrothed was arranged in childhood and was never properly canceled, and now complaints have been made—what are we to do?” Second Sister You explained, “They even collected the silver—but it wasn’t enough to secure the cancellation.” Fengjie added, “Zhang Hua’s testimony now says he never saw any silver or anyone taking him away. His father, however, said that our relatives had once agreed but then reneged. Without conclusive evidence, we must let him spin his tale. Thankfully, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that people are aware, how can we send him away without tarnishing our face?” Grandmother Jia replied, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one is forcibly deprived of their spouse, our reputation will not suffer. Who would then dare claim our honor?” Second Sister You then reported, “My mother, on a certain day, paid him twenty taels of silver to cancel the engagement. Yet he, in his desperation, retracted his word. My sister, however, did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, managing incorrigible souls is no easy task. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” Fengjie, unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion, finally sent for Jia Huan. Jia Huan, understanding all too well what Fengjie intended, pondered the propriety of having Zhang Hua reinstated. He then returned to Jia Zhen and secretly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the engagement? If you cling to your original decision, you risk provoking a backlash that will leave you with no refuge! Use your silver to return home—the best men are never hard to find.” Zhang Hua, after pondering this, agreed with his parents. In due course, he and his father departed for their native place, with a sum of money arranged. Meanwhile, Jia Huan continued to investigate the matter and reported everything back to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Jia Zhen was delighted, exclaiming that the matter had been resolved, and awarded him one hundred taels of silver. He even arranged for a seventeen-year-old maid from the household to be given as a concubine to him. Jia Huan accepted with thanks, overjoyed. Later, when Jia Huan met with Grandmother Jia and the rest of the family, he appeared somewhat sheepish. Yet Fengjie did not display her usual calm composure; instead, together with Second Sister You, she exchanged greetings. When Jia Huan mentioned the matter of the maid Autumn Tong (Qiutong), his face showed a touch of pride. Fengjie, upon hearing this, quickly ordered that two of the wives be sent by carriage to fetch Autumn Tong. Deep in thought, Jia Huan secretly thought, “How can Zhang Hua be allowed to return and maintain our family’s honor?” He then sent word to Zhang Hua, saying, “Since you now have plenty of silver, why insist on reclaiming your arranged wife? If you press the issue too forcefully, you risk inciting anger—leaving you with no footing! You should return home; you will be rewarded with some travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after considering this, agreed. In the meantime, Fengjie, distressed, hurried back to Grandmother Jia and said, “It is all due to our dear Second Sister’s incompetence; they never properly canceled the engagement, and now people are complaining. This will surely be an official scandal!” Grandmother Jia quickly summoned Second Sister You and said, “Since your betrothal from childhood was never properly canceled, and now someone has complained—what is this all about?” Second Sister You replied, “They even took the silver—how can it be that nothing was formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua’s statement now claims that no silver was seen and no one was taking him away.
Although Bao Yu is here, he is not really one of us. Even the eldest sister is no help. The Second Sister is not even part of this household. Only the Fourth Sister remains. Lan and Huan are but scraggly little kittens that can only hide away in a warm kitchen or near a hearth. Truly, how can one have a respectable person born from one mother’s womb who behaves so outrageously? I cannot abide it! Now that he has that mindset, he must be aligned with him. Then, with him on our side, we won’t be alone. In terms of proper rites and the dictates of Heaven and human conscience, having him help out would ease our burden with Madam’s affairs. But if you take it as selfish scheming, I must retract and reconsider—if you pursue him relentlessly, people will eventually come to hate you. They will smile while hiding their knives, and if we—just four eyes and two hearts—are not cautious, we might inadvertently ruin everything. Seize the moment while it’s still swift; if he manages to make a move, then all our old resentments may be temporarily assuaged. One more thing: I know you understand all this very well, though I fear you may not be able to keep it in your heart. Remember, even though he is a woman, she is exceedingly astute in all matters—she speaks with care. In fact, she is even more knowledgeable than I am. As the saying goes, ‘to capture a thief, one must first seize the ringleader.’ If she intends to set the rules, she will surely begin by targeting me; if she dares refute me, do not argue—simply be as respectful as possible and say that it is she who is being contradicted. Under no circumstances should you fear that I will lose face by confronting her.”  Before Ping’er could finish speaking, she burst out laughing, “You’ve completely got everyone confused! I was already ahead of the game, and now you’re just advising me!”  Fengjie laughed, “I only worry that your eyes and heart contain only me and nothing else, so I must remind you—now that you are already ahead, you understand better than I do. Isn’t it that you’re getting so worked up, talking ‘you’ and ‘I’ so much?”  Ping’er retorted, “You keep saying ‘you’! If you won’t listen, isn’t that akin to giving someone a good thrashing? Must I strike you again? Have you not tasted such blows on your face before?”  Fengjie laughed, “You little clumsy one—how many times must I hammer you? Look at how I am ill at the moment, yet you dare to sulk! Come, sit down; no one is around, and we’ll eat in proper fashion.”  With that, Fengjie motioned for Feng’er and two or three little maids to bring in a small low table. Xifeng herself ate only a bowl of bird’s-nest porridge accompanied by two dishes of exquisitely prepared small delicacies; the daily allowance of side dishes had been temporarily reduced. Then, Fengjie ordered Feng’er to serve Ping’er four standard side dishes on the table along with her rice. Ping’er bent one knee on the edge of the low platform, with half her body still standing below, and after eating and rinsing her mouth, she gave Feng’er some instructions before heading off to see Tan Chun. Soon after, the courtyard grew quiet as everyone dispersed. (To be continued in the next installment.)  Chapter 56  Investing in Improvements and Eliminating Shortcomings: Tanchun’s Initiative, Baochai’s Modest Contribution, All in Good Order  It happened that after Ping’er had eaten with Sister Feng and finished washing up, she went off to visit Tanchun. When she reached the courtyard she found it quiet—with every maid and old servant standing by the windows, attentively waiting. Entering the hall, she saw Tanchun, Li Wan, and a couple of other young ladies discussing household affairs. Their conversation turned to the upcoming banquet that the household was to host before the end of the year, and also the various happenings in the garden. Noticing Ping’er’s arrival, Tanchun ordered her to take a seat. “You see,” she began, “my concern is not for any grand matter but something as small as the two taels of oil and rouge we use each month.
Even before Jia Lian’s departure, she had secretly ordered various artisans and laborers to remodel three rooms in the East Wing—fashioning them to match the standards of her own residence with fine decorations and furnishings. Fourteen days later she reported to Grandmother and Wang Xifeng that, on the fifteenth morning, she would lead a procession to the “Aunt’s Temple” (a relative’s temple) for an incense offering. Only four women were to accompany her—Ping’er, Feng’er, Zhou Rui’s wife, and Wang’er’s wife. Before boarding the carriage, she explained the plan to the assembled crowd and then ordered all the men, dressed in plain clothes and simple coverings, to come along immediately. Xing’er was appointed to lead the way, and they marched to the gate, knocking in turn. When the household of Bao Er (the second branch) opened the door, Xing’er laughed and called out, “Quickly, send word back to Second Grandmother—the elder has arrived!” Hearing this, the Bao household’s strong-willed head was startled out of his composure and hurried inside to inform Sister You (the second sister). Although You Er was also taken aback, she quickly arrived and, with proper decorum, greeted Fengjie. At the gate Fengjie herself stepped down from the carriage. You Er, noticing her impeccable attire—her head adorned with plain silver ornaments, her jacket made of moon-white satin, a blue satin vest embroidered with silver thread, and a simple white gauze skirt, with eyebrows curved like willow leaves and her eyes sparkling like phoenixes—marveled at her beauty, reminiscent of a peach in spring and a chrysanthemum in autumn. Soon the wives of Zhou Rui and Wang’er were led into the courtyard. You Er greeted Fengjie warmly, exclaiming “Sister!” and apologizing profusely for not having received her sooner, then kowtowed. Fengjie, laughing and gracious, quickly returned the greeting, taking You Er’s hand and leading her inside. Inside, as Fengjie sat in the main hall, You Er immediately ordered the maidservants to fetch cushions and then bowed, saying:  “My dear, now that you have come here, all matters are decided by Mother and our elder sisters. I am honored to meet you today. Should you not dismiss my humble state, I would be most grateful and would pour out my heart, ever ready to serve you.” After bowing, she stepped back. Fengjie, smiling, replied, “It is only because I too am young. I have always been advised by the women to caution Second Master against frolicking away his time among pretty girls—lest our elders become worried. All this is born of our shared devotion. Who would suspect that, after marrying a younger wife as a second consort, Second Master would undertake such serious matters without consulting me? I even advised him to settle this matter promptly, for if he had produced a son or even a daughter later, I might have some claim of my own. Instead, Second Master, misinterpreting my intentions as jealousy, went ahead and acted on his own, leaving me with grievances I can scarcely express! My heart—only heaven and earth can bear witness. I heard of it in the first ten days, but fearing that Second Master might misread the situation, I dared not speak up until now, when, by fortune, he has already departed. That is why I have come personally to see you, imploring that you sympathize with my plight and arrange for us to be housed together at home. When sisters live together in harmony, offering advice and caring for one another, that is proper etiquette. If you remain away while I am here alone, how could I bear it? And if outsiders were to hear of it, not only would my reputation suffer, but yours as well. Besides, Second Master’s reputation is of utmost importance; our minor squabbles are trivial in comparison. As for the idle gossip of servants, it is only natural—they say I run the household too strictly, and they whisper behind my back. Think: since ancient times it has been said, “The head of the household is like a water jar”—if there is even a slight fault in our leadership, with several elders and sisters and daughters-in-law in the house, how can I possibly be held blameless? Even if Second Master marries you and lives outside, I would never willingly see you. And when Ping’er mentioned it, I even advised Second Master to keep her.
Baoyu smiled. “That’s wonderful—what good news! You’re getting a rare beauty, truly unmatched, perfect for someone like you.” Xianglian said, “I’m puzzled that they sought me out. She must have no shortage of suitors. And I’m not exactly tight with Jia Lian. Why did he press me so hard during our brief roadside meeting? Could the girl’s family actually be chasing after the groom? Afterward, I felt uneasy about leaving the sword as a pledge. That’s why I came to you, to find out the truth.” Baoyu laughed. “You’re overthinking it. You wanted a rare beauty, right? Now you have one. No need to doubt.” Xianglian said, “You say she’s a rare beauty, but how do you know, if you don’t even know her background?” Baoyu said, “She’s the younger sister of my cousin-in-law from the Eastern Mansion, both brought by their stepmother. I was with them for over a month. They truly are two stunning women, and their surname is You.” Xianglian, hearing this, stomped his foot and exclaimed, “This isn’t good—no way. I absolutely refuse. Everyone in your Ning Mansion is filthy, except maybe the pair of stone lions at the gate!” Baoyu turned red. Xianglian realized his slip and quickly bowed, saying, “I deserve to die for talking such nonsense. Please, I only ask you to tell me: how is her character?” Baoyu gave a half-smile. “Since you already look down on our place, why do you bother asking? I guess I’m unclean as well.” Xianglian grinned. “Forgive me—my words slipped out. Please don’t take offense.” Baoyu laughed. “If you didn’t mean it, there’s no need to mention it again, or you’ll only prove you do.”  Xianglian bowed and took his leave. As he went, he thought about calling on Xue Pan, but realized Xue Pan was both ill and unreliable. He decided instead to get his sword back. Resolute, he headed straight to see Jia Lian, who was at the new house. Overjoyed at Xianglian’s arrival, Jia Lian rushed outside to greet him and escorted him into the inner hall. Madam You came out, and Xianglian bowed, calling her “Elder Aunt,” referring to himself as “your younger generation.” Jia Lian was surprised at these formalities. Over tea, Xianglian said, “Pressed by the urgency of traveling, I never expected my aunt would arrange a marriage for me back in April, which leaves me no grounds to refuse. Abandoning her arrangement and following you would be improper. If this had been an exchange of gold or jewels, I’d forfeit them, but the sword is an heirloom from my grandfather. Please give it back.” Jia Lian’s face showed his displeasure. “Second Brother, that goes against everything. The very reason for a pledge is to prevent reneging. Why treat marriage so lightly, as if you can come and go at will? That won’t do at all.” Xianglian answered with a laugh, “Then blame me for being in the wrong, but I cannot comply.” Jia Lian tried to keep arguing, but Xianglian stood up and said, “Let’s speak outside. This room isn’t suitable.”  Third Sister You, listening from her chamber, had long looked forward to Xianglian’s arrival. Now she heard him withdrawing from the engagement, presumably because of rumors about the Ning mansion that lumped her in with the dissolute. He found her unworthy as a wife. If she let him and Jia Lian step outside to talk, she knew Jia Lian couldn’t force him, and if they argued, it would only bring her shame. The moment she heard Jia Lian agreeing to talk elsewhere, she snatched one half of the female sword and hid it under her sleeve. She stepped out and said, “No need to go outside. Take back your pledge here and now.” Tears streamed down her face as she offered Xianglian the sword in its scabbard with her left hand. Then, using her right elbow to hold the female blade, she swung it toward her neck.
“Each family has its own affairs, none of our concern. Go pour some tea,” she told Ying’er, who left and did so. Meanwhile, after escorting Daiyu back, Baoyu kept thinking how lonely she was and felt sad for her. Wanting to discuss it with Xiren, he returned to his rooms but found only Sheyue and Qiuwen. He asked, “Where’s your Sister Xiren?” Sheyue replied, “She’s just around these courtyards somewhere—no way she’s lost. You panic if she’s gone for a moment.” Baoyu teased, “I’m not worried about losing her. I just saw Miss Lin in tears again, all because Miss Bao sent her something reminding her of home. I wanted Sister Xiren to go console her.” At that, Qingwen entered and asked, “You’re back? Whom do you want to console?” Baoyu repeated the story. Qingwen said, “Sister Xiren just went out. I heard her say she was heading to Second Mistress Lian’s place. Maybe she’ll stop by Miss Lin’s too.” Baoyu, silent, took a cup of tea from Qiuwen, rinsed his mouth, gave the cup to a junior maid, and lay down restlessly on the bed. Xiren, after Baoyu had gone out, had done some needlework. She then recalled that Wang Xifeng was unwell and realized she hadn’t visited recently. Besides, with Jia Lian away, it seemed like a good opportunity to chat. She told Qingwen, “Stay in the room. Don’t all go off, or when the young master returns, no one will be here.” Qingwen retorted, “You’re the only one who cares about him? The rest of us are good for nothing, is that it?” Xiren smiled without responding and left. Strolling along the bank near Cleft Fragrance Bridge, she admired the lotus blossoms transitioning from summer to autumn, the mingled red and green foliage. Halfway down the path, she looked up and noticed an old maid named Granny Zhu under a grape arbor, waving a duster. Approaching, she greeted the woman, who replied, “What brings you out walking today, Miss?” Xiren said, “I’m heading to Mistress Lian’s. What are you doing here?” The older woman explained, “I’m chasing away wasps. Because this year’s rainy season was short, insects have infested the fruit trees, leaving worm-eaten, spotted fruit that’s falling everywhere. You might not know it, Miss, but wasps are the worst. They’ll pierce a few fruits, then the juice leaks onto others and rots the whole cluster. We just chatted a moment, and look how many have landed.” Xiren said, “No matter how much you swat, you can’t catch them all. Why not tell the buyers to sew little gauze bags for each cluster? They let in air but keep the fruit safe.” The old maid exclaimed, “That’s a fine idea! This is my first year on orchard duty, so I never knew such a trick.” She laughed. “Though some fruit is spoiling, the taste is good. Would you like me to pick one for you to try?” Xiren replied firmly, “That wouldn’t be right. Not only are they not fully ripe yet, but they also haven’t been offered at table. How can we eat them first? You’ve worked here a long time—surely you know this rule.” The old maid hurriedly apologized, “Yes, yes. I saw you looking fondly at them, so I overstepped. I must be getting senile.” Xiren said, “It’s fine—just make sure you older folks aren’t the first to break the rules.”  She continued out of the garden and arrived at Wang Xifeng’s courtyard. As soon as she entered, she heard Wang Xifeng exclaim, “Heaven help me—I’m roasting alive in here, practically like a thief!” Xiren realized something serious must have happened. She couldn’t leave after coming this far, yet she was uncomfortable going in, so she stamped her footsteps more audibly.
I saw your mother leave earlier and then closed the door. If she sent you, why didn’t she tell me you were here? Going out and having me close the door—what is the meaning of that? Are you lying?”  Wu’er, at a loss for words, replies, “It was my mother’s instruction early this morning. I forgot to mention it until now. I was afraid my mother might have mistaken me for someone else, so she didn’t inform the mistress.”  The Lin official, sensing that Wu’er’s explanation is feeble and recalling that not long ago, Yuchuan had mentioned that some things were missing from the main room—and that a few maids had complained—suspicion arose. Soon, Little Chan, Lianhua, and several young wives come by and say, “Aunt Lin must question her. In recent days, you’ve been sneaking around like a ghost, doing who knows what!”  Little Chan adds, “Indeed. Yesterday, Sister Yuchuan said, ‘The cabinet in the mistress’s side room has been opened and quite a few trinkets are gone.’ And Second Lady Lian had sent Ping’er and Sister Yuchuan to fetch some rose dew—but even that was short by a can, and no one seems to know where it went!”  Lianhua laughs, “I haven’t heard about that. Today, I even saw a bottle of dew.”  The Lin official, now agitated by the lack of explanation, immediately orders lanterns to be lit and for everyone to search the kitchen. Wu’er, anxious, exclaims, “That must be the bottle that Brother Baoyu’s Flower Official gave me!”  The Lin official retorts, “No matter what—whether it’s ‘Square Official’ or ‘Round Official’—I have evidence of theft, and I shall report it. You, my master, can argue if you like.”  With that, he enters the kitchen. Lianhua leads him to a small bottle of dew. Fearing there might be more hidden contraband, they search carefully and find, along with the bottle, a packet of poria snow. Together they gather these items and bring them back to Li Wan and Tanchun. At that moment Li Wan, who has been ignoring affairs due to Lan’er’s illness, is sent to see Tanchun. Tanchun is already in her room. After a short while someone returns and tells the maids in the courtyard, “Young Miss Ping, please bring Second Lady Lian to see her.”  The Lin official is forced to accompany them to Feng Xifeng’s quarters, where he finds Ping’er and reports the matter. Feng Xifeng, who had just been dozing, upon hearing of the incident, commands, “Give her a good forty strokes and expel her—she is never to set foot in the second hall again! As for Wu’er, hit her with forty strokes immediately and then hand her over to the estate manager to be sold or given in marriage!”  Hearing this, Ping’er steps out and, in accordance with Feng Xifeng’s orders, instructs the Lin official. Wu’er, terrified, bursts into tears and falls to her knees before Ping’er, explaining in detail the matter of the Flower Official. Ping’er says, “This is not difficult. Tomorrow we’ll question the Flower Official to get to the truth. But the poria snow that was delivered the other day was not to be tampered with until Grandmother and the mistress have seen it—and it should not have been taken in secret.”  Wu’er, hearing this, hastily reveals that her uncle had also sent her a packet. Ping’er laughs, “In that case, you appear completely innocent—why then use you as a scapegoat? Since it is evening and Grandmother has only just returned from her medicinal break, it is not proper to fuss over such trifling matters now. For the time being, let’s confine her under watch for one night. Tomorrow, when I return to Grandmother, I will settle this matter properly.”  The Lin official dares not defy her and takes Wu’er away, leaving her in the custody of the night-shift matron while he departs. Thus, Wu’er is effectively confined and cannot move far. Meanwhile, many of the young wives protest, “This is not proper conduct!” Others complain, “Not only can a proper person not be seated here, but now we’ve also got a thief to watch over.
You’ve been away for half a year; if you miss someone and tug at the blossoms, it appears even the flowers pair up—how shameful!” Xiangling blushed and, trying to stand, playfully scolded, “I’ll smack you for your nonsense, you little brat spouting foolishness!” Bean Official, not willing to let her rise, quickly pinned her down and then called for Ru Official and others to help “tie her mouth” (i.e. hush her). The two rolled on the floor, and everyone clapped and laughed, “Remarkable—what a sight! Alas, her new skirt got soiled in the process!” Bean Official glanced over and indeed saw a small puddle nearby, with half of Xiangling’s skirt stained. Embarrassed, he quickly ran off. Everyone laughed heartily, fearing Xiangling might take her anger out on them, and soon they all dispersed amid laughter. Xiangling then rose and, looking down, saw droplets of green water streaming from her skirt. Just as she was about to launch into a tirade, Baoyu—having gathered some wild flowers for fun—noticed that everyone had dispersed except Xiangling, who still stood there adjusting her skirt. He asked, “What happened? Why did everyone scatter?” Xiangling replied, “I had a cluster of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ that none recognized, and they ended up accusing me of fabricating tales—in the ensuing commotion my new skirt was ruined.” Baoyu laughed and said, “You claim to have ‘Coupled Hibiscus’—well, I here have a double lotus blossom!” As he spoke, he plucked a double lotus blossom and, simultaneously, picked up a ‘Hui’ flower. Xiangling said, “What do you mean by ‘not coupled’ or ‘not a double blossom’? Look at my skirt!” Baoyu bent down and exclaimed, “Alas, it’s muddied! What a pity—this pomegranate-red silk, so difficult to keep clean!” Xiangling explained, “This was brought by Sister Qin the other day. She made one for herself and one for me; today I wore mine for the first time.” Baoyu stamped his foot and sighed, “If your household loses one garment every day, it might be nothing—but if the very first one, the one Sister Qin brought, is ruined, isn’t that a betrayal of her affection? And then Aunt Zhao’s incessant nagging—I even heard her say you never know how to live properly or cherish your blessings. If Aunt Zhao sees this, she’ll never let it pass!” Struck by his words, Xiangling found herself oddly pleased. She laughed and said, “That’s exactly right. I have several new skirts, but none suit me; if I had one that did, I’d simply change into it.” Baoyu said, “Don’t fuss—just stand still; otherwise, even your undergarments, knee covers, and shoes will get muddied. I have an idea: Sister Xiren made a skirt exactly like this last month; since she was filial she never wore it, and even gave it to you in exchange—how about that?” Xiangling laughed and shook her head, “No, if they find out, it won’t do.” Baoyu replied, “What’s there to fear? Once she is full of filial piety, won’t she let you offer her something else? If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it’s not a secret matter—simply tell Sister Baoqin as well. I only worry that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. But promise me she delivers it in person!” Baoyu, overjoyed, quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly he mused, “What a pity that such a person—an orphan who has even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant—should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier even Ping’er was unexpected, but today is an unforeseen twist upon twists.” Lost in thought, he returned to his room and called Xiren to recount the matter in detail. Xiangling, beloved by all for her gentle nature, was adored by everyone; and Xiren—naturally free-spirited and close to Xiangling—upon hearing the news immediately opened her heart and, after folding her thoughts neatly, accompanied Baoyu to find Xiangling.
You know that my aunt has repeatedly urged me—three or five times in her own words—that now that the eldest lady is so busy and the other young ladies are so young, she has entrusted me to oversee things. Were I to decline, it would only give her more trouble. Our mistress is ill and the household is in a constant state of bustle. I have leisure, and it is only natural that I extend a helping hand—even to neighbors. How could I afford to be accused of neglect? If I were solely intent on cultivating my reputation, then in drunken bouts and gambling losses, when trouble arises, how could I face my aunt? By then it would be too late for you to regret, and even your long-practiced dignity would be lost. This grand garden, under your careful supervision as veteran maids, is meant to be maintained with proper decorum. Yet you let others roam free, indulging in drinking and gambling. If your aunt hears of this, she might give you a good talking-to; if any of the household managers hear it, they won’t even wait for your aunt to intervene—they will reprimand you directly. And in the end, you old maids will be taught a lesson by the younger ones. Even though they are the ones in charge, why not preserve your own dignity rather than debasing yourselves? Thus I have devised this extra measure, so that we may all work together to manage the garden in a strict and careful manner. Then those in authority, seeing such earnestness, will not have to worry—and their hearts will be filled with respect. Think it over carefully.”  Everyone burst into cheerful agreement, saying, “Young lady, you speak truly. From now on, grandmother, you can rest assured. With you caring for us so tenderly, if we were to fall short in our duties, heaven and earth themselves would not forgive it!”  Just then, a messenger from the Lin family entered, announcing, “The family from the Zhen residence of Jiangnan arrived in the capital yesterday and today have come to pay respects at the palace. Their advance messenger has delivered gifts and conveyed their greetings.” He then handed over a list of gifts. Tanchun accepted it and read aloud: “For the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of decorative brocade in the style of a large python; for the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of assorted colored satin; for the Emperor’s use—twelve bolts of various gauzy fabrics; for the palace—twelve bolts of official silks; and for the palace—twenty-four bolts of assorted satin, gauze, and crepe silks.”  Li Wan and Tanchun inspected the gifts. “Prepare the finest seals to reward him,” Tanchun ordered, and then sent word back to Grandmother Jia. Grandmother Jia, in turn, summoned Li Wan, Tanchun, Baochai, and the others to come over so she might inspect the gifts. Li Wan took them aside and instructed the treasury men, “Wait until our mistress returns and sees them before accepting delivery.”  Grandmother Jia remarked, “The Zhen family is unlike the others. Their practice of sending the finest seals to honor a man might, in the blink of an eye, be followed by sending women to pay respects, as if preparing extra measures.”  Before she could finish speaking, a messenger returned, “Four women from the Zhen residence have come to pay their respects.” Hearing this, Grandmother Jia immediately ordered that they be brought in. These four were all over forty, and their attire was nearly as fine as that of their mistresses. After exchanging greetings, Grandmother Jia ordered that four footstools be brought over. The four women thanked her and sat down, waiting until Baochai and the others were seated before all took their places. Grandmother Jia then asked, “When did you all arrive in the capital?”  The four hastily stood and replied, “We arrived yesterday, but today our mistress brought the young ladies to the palace to pay respects. That is why we, the women, have come to pay our respects on behalf of the young ladies.”  Grandmother Jia smiled and asked, “You haven’t been to the capital these past few years, and yet you came all of a sudden?”  They all laughed and replied, “That is so. This year we were summoned by imperial order.”  Grandmother Jia inquired, “Have all the family members come?”  They replied, “The elderly matriarch, the brothers, the two young ladies, and the other mistresses have not come; only the mistress brought the third young lady.”  Grandmother Jia said, “Is no one else coming?”  They answered, “Not yet.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Your eldest and second sisters are very well connected with our family.”  They laughed, “Indeed.
Since they don’t normally eat much, if you have only a couple of cups of wine, you might not be sufficiently nourished.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were just about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids agreed and hurried off to bring some treats. Tanchun then said, “You all rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I’ll have someone send over more wine for you.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” After a while they too departed. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My face is so warm now—I’m too embarrassed to face them. I say, let’s just drop it so as not to provoke them further.” Tanchun laughed, “No matter—you see, as long as we don’t drink seriously, it won’t matter.”  Just then a little maid came skipping in, laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a blue stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and sure enough, they found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step, fast asleep in her drunken stupor. Peony petals had clung to her all over, and her face and sleeves were sprinkled with red perfume. The fan in her hand lay partly buried under fallen blossoms, while a swarm of bees and butterflies buzzed about. She even had a kerchief arranged as a pillow made of peony petals. Everyone was touched and amused; they quickly came forward to help her up. Xiangyun mumbled drunkenly about toasting and drinking, half-awake saying,  “The fragrant spring wine is chilled… let us stagger home together—may our dear friends be ever near.” They laughed and urged her, “Come on, wake up and eat. Don’t sleep here on these cold steps—you might catch a chill!” Slowly, Xiangyun opened her eyes and, seeing everyone, realized she was drunk. She had sought a quiet spot for refreshing herself and, having overindulged, had dozed off—feeling remorseful afterward. Earlier, a couple of little maids had brought a basin of water and mirrors, and after waiting, she freshened her face and tidied her hair. Soon she rose and, with assistance, made her way to the Red Fragrance Courtyard. After having two more cups of strong tea, Tanchun immediately sent her a small sobering stone to put in her mouth and then gave her a sour soup; gradually, she felt better. Meanwhile, a variety of fruits and vegetables were selected and sent over to Sister Feng, who in turn sent a few items in return. After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and some went outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each doing as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess while Baochai and Xiuyun watched. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled together under a cluster of flowers, speaking softly among themselves. Soon a member of the Lin household arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps to kowtow. Tanchun, having just lost a chess game and counting her losses—ending up with “two eyes” (a game term)—kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing for chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there for a long time, and only when he later turned to ask for tea did he notice the situation. He then pointed to the young wife and said,  “This is Cai’er – the mother of the little maid Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. She speaks rather poorly; I only overheard a few words, and she didn’t dare answer the young mistress. She had to be brought forward to speak.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just then, Grandmother was seen going toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It doesn’t matter if we don’t report it—I’ll mention it.
She continued to take medicine and recover over the following days. Not long after, came the date set for Jia Jing’s interment. Grandmother Jia was still not fully well, so she stayed home with Baoyu to attend her. Wang Xifeng also remained due to her lingering illness, but Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing, and Lady Wang led many household members, both men and women, to escort the coffin to the Iron Threshold Temple. They did not return until nightfall. Jia Zhen, You-shi, and Jia Rong stayed at the temple to keep vigil, planning to accompany the coffin back to their ancestral home after a hundred days, leaving old Lady You and her two daughters, Second Sister and Third Sister, in charge of the household. Meanwhile, Jia Lian—having heard much about the two You sisters—had long been eager to meet them. During the period Jia Jing’s coffin was kept at home, he grew familiar with these sisters and fell for Second Sister. Knowing of Jia Zhen and Jia Rong’s own dalliances, he dared to flirt, exchanging glances and signals. Third Sister, however, remained indifferent, while Second Sister seemed to reciprocate. Yet in the presence of so many people, they had no chance to proceed. Jia Lian also feared arousing Jia Zhen’s jealousy and did not dare act rashly. Their desire remained unfulfilled, though mutual understanding existed. After Jia Jing’s coffin had been taken away, the household at the Ning mansion was sparse: aside from Lady You, Second Sister, Third Sister, and a few old maids and servant girls in the main rooms, most of the concubines and maids followed Jia Zhen and Jia Rong to the temple. Outside, only a few servants remained on guard duty, patrolling at night and watching the gates by day; they seldom ventured inside. Jia Lian seized this opportunity, claiming to be assisting Jia Zhen and decided to lodge at the temple. He frequently claimed to manage household affairs on Jia Zhen’s behalf and used these excuses to visit the Ning mansion and seduce Second Sister. One day, the steward Yu Lu came to report to Jia Zhen, “All the funeral supplies—canopies, poles, mourning cloth, plus the palanquin bearers and their robes—cost a total of one thousand, one hundred and ten taels of silver. So far we have paid five hundred taels; six hundred and ten remain. Yesterday the merchants came demanding payment, so I’ve come for your instructions.” Jia Zhen replied, “Just collect it from the storeroom. Why bother me?” Yu Lu explained, “I went there yesterday, but since the master passed away, there have been many expenses. What remains must be saved for the hundred-day observances and the monastery’s needs, so they cannot provide the rest. That’s why I had no choice but to ask you if perhaps there’s some other source of funds, or if I should try to borrow it.” Jia Zhen laughed, “You think we’re hiding silver somewhere? Just borrow it from somewhere—how you do it is your business.” Yu Lu smiled wryly, “If it were just one or two hundred, I might manage, but six or seven hundred is beyond my means.” Jia Zhen thought a moment and told Jia Rong, “Go ask your mother. Yesterday, someone from the Jiangnan Zhen family brought five hundred taels as a condolence gift. We haven’t turned it into the storeroom yet. Have your mother give it to him. Look around for some more, put it all together, and settle his accounts. The rest, Yu Lu can try to borrow.” Jia Rong agreed. He went to inform You-shi, then returned and said, “Of that five hundred taels, two hundred have already been spent. The remaining three hundred were sent home for Mother to keep.” Jia Zhen said, “In that case, take him there. Get the silver from your mother, then tell him to borrow the rest. Make sure he has enough. And ask after your two aunts. Come right back.” Jia Rong acknowledged and was about to leave when Jia Lian arrived. Yu Lu bowed and told him what was happening. Jia Lian said, “That’s not too big a sum. Why borrow from others? I received a sum of silver yesterday that I haven’t used yet. Why not let me add what’s missing?
Everyone says you’re such a sneaky little fellow who makes people blush. Look at your hands—they’re all so muddy and slippery with moss; you’d better wash them off!” Baoyu laughed and got up to wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called to Baoyu. Uncertain what she wished to say, with his two muddy hands he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply, laughing as she tried to speak, but words failed her. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face grew even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just do not mention this skirt matter to your brother—let’s leave it at that.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? You’re practically sticking your head into a lion’s den!” He then returned to his room. To learn the full details of these intrigues and playful exchanges, we must await the next chapter… Chapter 69 When “Little Youniang” is Brought into the Grand View Garden by Devious Means, and Fengjie Creates a Havoc at Ningguo Mansion with Sour Tempers  The chapter opens with Second Sister You (Yòu Èr Jiě) expressing endless gratitude and following along. In the You household it was agreed that she must also come over and accompany Fengjie on her return. Fengjie laughs and says, “You say nothing—just leave it to me to explain.” Second Sister You replies, “That’s natural; but if there’s any fault, just put it on your own head.” With that, they first go to Grandmother Jia’s residence. At that time Grandmother Jia is happily chatting with the female members of the garden; suddenly Fengjie enters with an exceptionally pretty young bride. All eyes turn, and someone remarks, “Whose child is this? Such a pitiful little one!” Fengjie steps forward laughing and says, “Grandmother, please examine carefully—does she look well?” Quickly she pulls Second Sister You close and urges, “This child is meant for the great matriarch—quick, kowtow!” Second Sister You immediately performs a grand bow. Fengjie then addresses the assembled sisters, identifying the child by name and instructing that when the mistress later sees her, the proper courtesy be rendered. Second Sister You, deliberately inquiring again while lowering her head, stands aside. Grandmother Jia, surveying everyone, tilts her face upward and muses, “This child looks very familiar—so familiar!” Fengjie hastily laughs, “Grandmother, spare those old sayings—just say that she is as handsome as I am!” Grandmother Jia then, donning her glasses, orders Yuanyang and Hupo to “bring the child over so I can inspect her skin.” All the assembled burst into tight-lipped laughter as they push the little one forward. After a careful examination, Grandmother Jia removes her glasses and smiles, “She is perfectly formed—I think she is even more handsome than you!” Hearing this, Fengjie laughs and quickly falls to her knees, recounting in detail exactly what Second Sister You had said earlier. “It is only fitting that, moved by my own compassion, I let her come live with us and, one year hence, arrange a proper marriage. ” Grandmother Jia responds, “What harm is there in that? If you are so virtuous, it is all very good—even if it takes a year before her marriage is finalized.” Fengjie, now relieved, implores Grandmother Jia further, “Please, let the two women accompany me to see the mistresses (Wang Furen and others), and tell them that it is Grandmother’s idea.” Grandmother Jia agrees, and the two are sent off to meet with Madam Xing and the other senior matriarchs. In this way, Second Sister You soon sees daylight again and is allowed to move into one of the side rooms. Meanwhile, Fengjie begins covertly urging Zhang Hua (the young man whose affairs have been troublesome) with secret instructions. She even instructs him that his “first wife” must be restored—along with various tokens and silver to help him set up a household.
Jia Huan accepted with great joy. Yet when he later saw Fengjie, he couldn’t help but feel a tinge of guilt. Unexpectedly, Fengjie did not wear her usual calm expression. Instead, accompanied by Second Sister You, she met Jia Huan and exchanged cordial greetings. When Jia Huan mentioned Autumn Tong, a note of smugness crept into his tone. Fengjie quickly ordered that the household of Zhou Rui fetch Autumn Tong. Deep inside, Jia Huan worried how Zhang Hua’s return might affect the family’s reputation. He then discreetly sent word back to Zhang Hua: “Since you now have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the arranged match? If you persist, you risk angering our elders to the point of disgrace—return home, and I shall reward you with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after deliberation, agreed. Fengjie then returned, agitated, to Grandmother Jia, exclaiming, “It is all because Sister You did not cancel the engagement properly—now someone has filed a complaint, and the officials are on our case!” Grandmother Jia immediately summoned Second Sister You and asked, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now a complaint has been lodged, what is the meaning of all this?” Second Sister You replied, “They even collected the silver—but it was never formalized!” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now claims he saw neither the silver nor anyone removing him. Yet his father insists that our relatives once agreed, but then reneged when the relative died—leaving us with nothing conclusive. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the news is out, how can we send him away without losing face?” Grandmother Jia mused, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our honor remains intact. Who, then, would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother paid him twenty taels on a certain day to cancel the betrothal, but in desperation he retracted his promise. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible wretches are hard to manage. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” At her wits’ end, Fengjie sent for Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, knowing well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim it would bring shame upon the family. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk inciting our elders to anger—use your silver to return home; any decent man can be found.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Soon, with the arranged sum, he and his father departed for their native home at daybreak. Later that evening, Fengjie went to see Grandmother Jia and recounted everything: “It is all due to Sister You’s mishandling—the engagement was never formally canceled, and now someone has filed a complaint, risking an official investigation!” Grandmother Jia summoned Second Sister You, asking again, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now there’s a complaint, what is the meaning of it all?” Second Sister You explained, “They even took the silver—how could nothing have been formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now insists he saw no silver or anyone removing him, while his father said that our relatives had once agreed but then reneged upon a death. Without firm evidence, we must let him spin his tale. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the matter is public, how can we send him away without disgrace?” Grandmother Jia remarked, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our reputation remains unblemished. Who then would dare to blame us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother, on a certain day, paid him twenty taels to cancel the engagement, yet in desperation he retracted his word. My sister was innocent.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Incorrigible ruffians are hard to manage indeed. Feng’er, please handle this matter.” Unable to resolve the issue, Fengjie turned to Jia Huan again.
Yet you may think I care only for these little grandchildren and neglect those in charge. Now that you’ve spoken so plainly, all is well.” At that moment Aunt Xue, Aunt Li, and others were present; Mrs. Xing and Mrs. You had also come to pay their respects. Before they could depart, Grandmother Jia turned to Mrs. Wang and the rest and said, “Today, I finally speak out. In former days I held my tongue—first, I feared offending Fengjie’s pride; second, the others might not abide it. But now you are all here, each connected by your sister- and sister-in-law ties—and who among you wouldn’t long to benefit from such favor?” Aunt Xue, Aunt Li, and Mrs. You all laughed in unison, “Truly, few can boast such loyalty—others merely display courteous appearances, but you all really love your little sisters and brothers-in-law. Even before Grandmother, you have shown true filial devotion.” Grandmother Jia nodded with a sigh, “Though I do cherish him, I also worry he is too clever for his own good—which is hardly a blessing.” Fengjie quickly laughed and interjected, “Oh, don’t quote our Grandmother so harshly! People say, ‘Too clever and astute, one fears for a short life.’ Everyone believes that, except our Grandmother should not say or take it to heart. If there were someone ten times cleverer than me, how would he be so blessed and long-lived? I might even outlive Grandmother by a mile—when I have lived a thousand years and she passes into the West, then I shall finally rest!” Grandmother Jia laughed, “When everyone dies and only the two of us old sprites remain, what meaning will that have?” Everyone burst into laughter. At that moment Bao Yu, still preoccupied with news about Qingwen and the like, hurried back to the garden. When he reached his room, a heady aroma of medicinal herbs filled the air—but no one was to be seen except for Qingwen, lying on the kang (heated platform) with her face flushed a fiery red. He went over and gently touched her hand—it felt scalding hot. Worried, he quickly moved her hand to the brazier to warm it, then reached under the covers to feel her body; it, too, burned with heat. He asked, “Have the others already gone? What of Meiyue and Qiuyun?…” Qingwen replied, “Qiuyun I drove off to have a meal, and Meiyue was just sent out by Ping’er. They’re sneaking about, talking quietly—perhaps saying I’m too sick to leave.” Bao Yu said, “Ping’er is not like that. Besides, she didn’t come here solely to check on your health. I’m sure she was chatting with Meiyue and happened to see you ill—such things are natural among friends. If you choose not to go out, what harm is it? You two have always been close, never willing to let a trifling matter spoil your harmony.” Qingwen murmured, “That may be so—but I wonder why he suddenly began to hide the truth from me?” Bao Yu smiled, “Wait until I slip out the back door and listen at the window—then I’ll let you know what I hear.”  With that, Bao Yu quietly slipped out the back door and crept to a window to eavesdrop. There, Meiyue whispered to Ping’er, “How did you come by it?” Ping’er explained, “That day during handwashing we couldn’t find it; Second Madam immediately forbade any commotion. Once we left the garden, word spread among the maids. We suspected it was Xiangling’s maid—since she is poor and may have never seen one before, she might have mistaken it for something else. Luckily, Second Madam wasn’t in the room; when Song Ma arrived, she picked up the bracelet and said it must have been snatched by a little maid, and then Second Madam noticed it. I quickly grabbed it and thought: Bao Yu has always been especially attentive and competitive when it comes to you. That one year a lad stole a jade piece—just after two cold years, during idle moments someone would mention it. And now another thief has come along, even snatching gold from our neighbors’ houses!
If you never help out, then what? You’ve been away for days, almost risking your life, yet still come back empty-handed—what’s the point? Speak up already! Why act so foolishly and smile at me? That won’t do.” Qingwen spat playfully. Soon, everyone entered the hall. Aunt Xue also arrived, and all the ladies sat down to dine. Baoyu served a symbolic half-cup of tea-soaked rice. After the meal, the guests enjoyed tea and exchanged idle banter and playful jokes. Outside, several young servants—Xiao Luo, Xiangling, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and a few others—played in the garden. They gathered flowers and plants and began a game of “guess the plant.” One declared, “I have the Guanyin willow!” Another said, “I have the Arhat pine!” A third claimed, “I have the Gentleman’s bamboo!” Yet another said, “I have the Calla of Beauty!” One more exclaimed, “I have the sparkling emerald!” Another remarked, “I have the peony from The Peony Pavilion!” And yet another, “I have the pipa fruit from The Pipa Story!” Bean Official then declared, “I have sisterly blossoms!” When no one else could outdo him, Xiangling said, “I have the ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ (Hui of Husband and Wife).” Bean Official retorted, “I’ve never heard of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’!” Xiangling explained, “When a single arrow yields one flower, it is called ‘Lan’; if it yields several, it is ‘Hui.’ If the blossoms cluster at the top, that is ‘Brotherhood Hui’; if they grow side by side, it is ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’ Mine, with two clusters side by side, is definitely ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’” Bean Official, having no reply, got up laughing, “According to you, if one cluster is larger than the other, it would be ‘Old Man and Son Hui’! And if the clusters sprout in opposite directions, it would be ‘Adversarial Hui’! You’ve been away for half a year—if you miss someone and tug at the blossoms, it appears even the flowers pair up—how shameful!” Xiangling blushed and, as she attempted to stand, playfully scolded, “I’ll smack you for your nonsense, you little brat spouting foolishness!” Bean Official, unwilling to let her rise, quickly pinned her down and called for Ru Official and others to help “bind her mouth” (i.e. hush her). The two rolled on the floor, and everyone clapped and laughed, “Remarkable—what a sight! Alas, her new skirt got soiled in the process!” Bean Official glanced over and indeed saw a small puddle nearby, with half of Xiangling’s skirt stained. Embarrassed, he quickly ran off. Everyone laughed heartily, fearing Xiangling might take her anger out on them, and soon they dispersed amid laughter. Xiangling then rose and, looking down, saw droplets of green water streaming from her skirt. Just as she was about to launch into a tirade, Baoyu—having gathered some wild flowers for fun—noticed that everyone had scattered except Xiangling, who still stood there adjusting her skirt. He asked, “What happened? Why did everyone scatter?” Xiangling replied, “I had a cluster of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ that none recognized, and they ended up accusing me of making up tales—in the ensuing commotion, my new skirt was ruined.” Baoyu laughed and said, “You claim to have ‘Coupled Hibiscus’—well, I here have a double lotus blossom!” As he spoke, he plucked a double lotus blossom and simultaneously picked up a ‘Hui’ flower. Xiangling said, “What do you mean by ‘not coupled’ or ‘not a double blossom’? Look at my skirt!” Baoyu bent down and exclaimed, “Alas, it’s muddied! What a pity—this pomegranate‑red silk, so difficult to keep pristine!” Xiangling explained, “This was brought by Sister Qin the other day.
I have always observed propriety—how can I now begin to honor these relatives? When your uncles go out every day, why does Zhao Guoji suddenly stand up to attend your classes? Why doesn’t he provide the customary funds? Oh, how pitiful! Everyone knows I was raised by my aunt—but then, after a couple of months, wouldn’t someone eventually find an excuse to completely vent their anger? It would be best if I could openly confess everything, so that there would be no shame! But then, who will be left without shame?”   Li Wan hurriedly tried to soothe her, but Zhao Yiniang continued her lament. Suddenly, someone announced, “Second Aunt has sent Ping’er to speak!” Zhao Yiniang quickly stifled her sobs. Soon, Ping’er entered. Zhao Yiniang quickly smiled and offered her a seat, then asked anxiously, “How is your grandmother faring? I was about to go see her but was pressed for time.” Li Wan, upon seeing Ping’er, asked, “What brings you here?” Ping’er replied with a smile, “Grandmother said that Zhao Yiniang’s brother has passed away, and she feared that neither she nor the young ladies would be aware of our old custom. Under normal circumstances, only 20 taels would be awarded—but now, please have the girls decide if a larger amount should be given.” Tan Chun, having just wiped away her tears, said, “What need is there to add any extra? Who was reared for 24 months? Otherwise, these are the expenses for those who marched off to battle or fled with their masters—no one is like that. Your master was so fortunate as to let me set up the precedent, so that when he does good, he can receive the money that Madam does not care to spend. If you suggest adding money, let him add it at his leisure when he’s well out and about!”   By this time, Ping’er had clearly understood the half of it. Seeing Tan Chun frown, she could only lower her head silently. At that moment, Baochai from the upper room entered, and Tan Chun and Li Wan quickly stood to offer seats. Before they could speak, one of the wives entered to inquire about something; because Tan Chun had been crying earlier, a few little maids soon followed with basin, handkerchiefs, and small mirrors and powder boxes. At that moment, Tan Chun—who was sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch—had a maid approach with a basin. The maid knelt on both knees and presented the basin; two other little maids also knelt with handkerchiefs and small mirrors with powder and ornaments. Seeing that the official secretary was absent, Ping’er hurried over, helped Tan Chun remove her bracelets, and even handed her a large handkerchief to cover her exposed bosom. Only then did Tan Chun extend her hand to the basin to wash her face. The wife then remarked, “Madam, the annual allowance for those at Zhi Huan’s Academy—supporting Brother Huan and Brother Lan—is…”   Ping’er interrupted with a laugh, “What are you doing? I saw the young lady washing her face with your own eyes; if you do not go and attend to her, then you should be the one to speak up first! When Second Aunt is present, you should not behave so rudely! I must go back to Second Aunt and tell her that in your eyes, the young lady is not being valued—otherwise, you’ll be blamed for losing face!” The wife, taken aback, quickly apologized with a smile and withdrew. Tan Chun, after smoothing her face, glared coldly at Ping’er and said, “You’re a step behind—I barely caught the tail end of a laugh, and now someone else is making fun of us! Even Sister Wu, who has long been in charge, did not thoroughly investigate before joining us. Fortunately, when we inquired, he had the nerve to say ‘I forgot’—and I thought, ‘Has Second Aunt’s matter been so forgotten that we must search again?’ I doubt your master will have the patience to go and search for him!” Ping’er laughed, “If he were that insistent, I guarantee his leg tendons would have snapped by now. Do not trust them too easily. They are watching Second Aunt as if she were a bodhisattva, and you, being a bashful young lady, are merely riding on our coattails.” In a low voice, she added, “Now, go outside and let everyone frolic—when Grandmother is well, we shall discuss it further.” The wives outside all laughed.
Bao Er cautioned, “Girls, aren’t you supposed to be upstairs serving? You’re slipping away; what if someone calls you and no one’s there?” His wife scolded him, “You muddleheaded fool, you’ve drunk yourself stupid. What does it matter to you? If someone calls, I’ll handle it. Whatever storms blow, they won’t land on your head.”  Because Bao Er’s status before Jia Lian depended on his wife’s influence, he left everything to her. With that, he drank a bit more and went to bed. Mistress Duo then kept drinking with the maids and page boys, joking and flirting to please them, hoping this would help her curry favor with Jia Zhen. They were all enjoying themselves when suddenly came the sound of knocking at the gate. Mistress Duo hurried out to see who it was and found Jia Lian dismounting. He asked if anything was going on. She whispered, “The Master is here, in the west wing.” Jia Lian went at once to the bedchamber, where Second Sister was sitting with two young maids. Seeing him, her expression turned somewhat uneasy. Jia Lian pretended not to notice and said, “Bring wine quickly! Let’s have a couple of cups and then sleep. I’m quite worn out today.” Second Sister, with a forced laugh, helped him remove his coat, brought him tea, and asked about his day. Jia Lian was so enchanted by her attentions that his heart fluttered with pleasure. Not long after, Mistress Duo brought wine, and husband and wife drank face-to-face, the two maids serving on the floor beside them. Jia Lian’s personal page boy, Long’er, went to tie up his horse and noticed another horse already there. Examining it, he realized it belonged to Jia Zhen. Understanding the situation, he went to the kitchen, where he saw Xi’er and Shou’er, Jia Zhen’s two pages, drinking. They recognized what was happening and laughed. “You’ve come at just the right time. We couldn’t keep up with the Master’s horse and feared we’d be out after curfew, so we came here for a place to spend the night.” Long’er grinned, “Second Master sent me with his monthly silver for Madam. I’ve delivered it, and I’m not going back now.” Mistress Duo said, “No shortage of kangs here—why not all stay overnight?” Xi’er said, “We’ve had enough wine; you have some.” Long’er sat down with a cup, but just then the two horses in the stable began kicking at each other, refusing to share. Alarmed, the three set down their cups to separate the animals. Mistress Duo laughed, “Sleep well, all of you—I’m off.” The three tried to block her from leaving, pawing at her and joking rudely. Only after some raucous laughter did they let her go. By then Xi’er was already in a drunken stupor. Long’er and Shou’er snuffed the lamp and lay down. Xi’er stretched out full length on the kang. The other two nudged him, “Brother, shift a bit so we can lie down too. You can’t hog all the comfort.” Xi’er just muttered drowsily, “Tonight, we’ll share the cost and split the ovenful of biscuits evenly.” Long’er and Shou’er saw he was drunk, so they left him be and settled themselves down. Second Sister had heard the horses kicking and felt quite uneasy, trying to distract Jia Lian with conversation. After a few more cups, desire stirred within him, and he ordered the fruit and wine cleared away and the door shut. He loosened his clothes. Second Sister wore only a little red jacket, her hair down in a loose twist. Her face glowed with a springlike radiance, more enchanting at night than by day. Jia Lian embraced her, laughing, “Everyone says my ‘she-devil of a wife’ is such a beauty. Now that I see you, she’s not even fit to carry your shoes.” Second Sister replied, “I may be pretty, but I have no moral standing. Better to be less pretty if it means having good character.” Alarmed, Jia Lian said, “Why such talk?
Tell Sister that there is no need to trouble Mother by coming over. I have already done my hair and will join Mother for breakfast—let’s have some lively company.”  Ying’er agreed and went off. Soon she entered Aunt Ziyuan’s room to find Ru Official. There she found Ru Official deep in cheerful conversation with Lotus Officer; the two were so engrossed that they were reluctant to part. Ying’er teased, “Sister, why don’t you go too? Wouldn’t it be better if Lotus Officer waited with you?” Hearing this, Aunt Ziyuan also remarked, “That is a fine idea. This fellow is such a mischievous rascal!” With that, she wrapped Daiyu’s chopsticks and spoon in a neatly folded cloth and handed them to Lotus Officer, saying, “Take these along—it counts as a little errand.” Lotus Officer accepted with a grin, and the two of them set off along the willow dyke. As Ying’er continued braiding her willow basket, she remarked, “Hurry, or I won’t finish my weaving!” Lotus Officer replied, “I’ll go with you and return swiftly.” And off they went. Meanwhile, as Ying’er was still busy weaving, Chunyan—daughter of Madame He—appeared and asked with a smile, “Sister, what are you weaving?” Just then, Ru Official and Lotus Officer arrived. Chunyan then turned to Lotus Officer and said, “Tell me, what exactly did you burn the other day? My aunt saw it and nearly reported you; instead, Baoyu ended up shouldering all the blame—he told me every sordid detail. You two have been at odds for two or three years now; why don’t you settle your grudges once and for all?” Lotus Officer scoffed, “What grudge? They are never satisfied and always find fault with us. In these past two years out on the road, we’ve earned more than our share—and they still complain!” Chunyan laughed, “After all, she is my aunt. No one can speak ill of her openly. No wonder Baoyu says, ‘A girl before marriage is a priceless jewel; after marriage, she somehow acquires many unsavory traits—until in old age she’s no longer a jewel at all but merely a fish-eye.’ Though such words are foolish, they are not without truth. No one else knows; it’s only my mother and aunt who, as they grow older, have come to value money above all. At first, my two elder sisters grumbled over having no means to advance, but thankfully the garden allowed them to be taken in. Fortuitously, I was assigned to the Yihong Courtyard, saving my family the expense of one person—and leaving a surplus of some four or five hundred strings of silver each month, which still isn’t enough. Later, my two elder sisters were both dispatched to the Lixiang Courtyard to oversee affairs; Lotus Officer served my aunt, and the Flower Official served my mother. In recent years, things have been quite relaxed. Now that we’ve been transferred in, it seems they’ve been set aside—but they’re never satisfied. How laughable is that?” Ying’er interjected, “Others may not dare to pluck or break things, but I can. Ever since the land was divided among the households, each has a fixed allowance for flowers and plants: every day the maidservants and young ladies are to collect a few stems from each room—unless the young ladies themselves say, ‘We don’t need any more until we request it.’ Not once have we ever needed to ask. I am merely plucking a few now, and they cannot be too insistent.”  Before the conversation could be finished, Ying’er’s adoptive mother arrived with her cane. Ying’er and Chunyan quickly ushered her to sit. The old matron, upon seeing that Ying’er had gathered many tender willow twigs and Lotus Officer and the others had picked numerous fresh blossoms, felt that her own heart was not content. Looking at Ying’er’s braiding, she reproached Chunyan, “I told you to keep an eye on things, but you were too caught up in play. If you are summoned and then claim that I ordered you about like some invisible herb, you’ll have me to answer!” Chunyan retorted, “Aren’t you the one always bossing me around?
How about Third Sister?” Tan Chun replied, “Certainly. In my eyes, even her elder sister and the others pale in comparison.” Xiangren, both astonished and amused, said, “How strange – where else might one find such refined souls? I do long to see them for myself!” Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them. She has practically insisted that our madams treat these young ladies as proper ‘daughters.’ Grandmother intends to support them; and if any do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.” Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?” Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” and then laughed, “Grandmother’s fondness for her great-grandchild nearly makes her forget about you, my dear.” Bao Yu smiled, “That’s fine – it is only proper to pamper the girls. Tomorrow, on the sixteenth day, we shall begin our society.” Tan Chun added, “But Lin has already awoken and Second Sister is ill; everything is in disarray.” Bao Yu replied, “Even if Second Sister does not compose poetry, what harm is there?” Tan Chun said, “Perhaps we should wait a few days until the new faces settle in, then invite them – our elder sister and our dear one will have renewed spirit, and our society will thrive. If Yun arrives and the newcomers become familiar, our gathering will be even more delightful.” Bao Yu, pleased, grinned broadly, “You truly understand! I have always been such a muddle-minded fellow – lost in frivolity – never thinking of these matters.” With that, the siblings set off together to see Grandmother. Indeed, Mrs. Wang had already recognized Xue Baoqin as her goddaughter. Grandmother was overjoyed and did not insist that they remain in the garden; that very evening she slept by Grandmother’s side. Xue Ke lodged in the study of Xue Pan’s residence. Grandmother and Mrs. Xing said, “Your niece need not return home; stay in the garden for a few days and enjoy yourselves.” Mrs. Xing’s family, having endured hardships, welcomed the arrangement. Mrs. Xing then handed Xiuyan over to Fengjie. Considering that there were many young ladies in the garden with differing temperaments—and that it would be inconvenient to set aside a separate room—Fengjie decided to send Xiuyan to stay with Yingchūn. In the future, if Xiuyan encounters difficulties, even if Mrs. Xing learns of it, it will not concern me. Henceforth, if Xiuyan’s stay here is brief, then if she remains in the Grand View Garden for over a month, Fengjie will, as Yingchūn does, send her a share of provisions. Observing Xiuyan’s gentle nature, Fengjie found herself especially fond of her—more than the other young ladies. Mrs. Xing, for her part, did not object. Meanwhile, as arrangements were made, news came that the Marquis of Zhongjing, Lord Shi Ding, had been transferred to a high-ranking post in another province and would soon leave with his family. Grandmother, unwilling to lose Xiangyun, kept him at home. Initially, she had ordered Fengjie to arrange a separate room for him, but Shi Xiangyun insisted on sharing with Baochai; and so that matter was dropped. At this point, the Grand View Garden was more bustling than ever. Under the leadership of Li Wan were Yingchūn, Tan Chun, Xi Shi, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Li Wen, Li Qi, Baoqin, and Xiuyan—a total of thirteen young ladies. As for their ages, apart from Li Wan (the eldest) and Fengjie (next), most were around fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen; even they themselves could scarcely tell who was older. Grandmother, Mrs. Wang, and the servants could only refer to them generically as “sisters” or “younger sisters.”  At this time, Xiangling was entirely absorbed in her desire to compose poetry but dared not pester Baochai too much. By chance, Shi Xiangyun arrived – a man who loved to talk and could not help but launch into lengthy discussions of poetry. His arrival lifted the mood; he talked animatedly day and night about literature.
By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had come to support one another. Along the way, they encountered the widowed Li Wan accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—and the families soon found themselves chatting as relatives; thus, the three households traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin, Xue Ke, who in his youth had been kept at the pawnshop (where his family had accumulated two or three thousand taels for a living), joined in as well, since he had heard that Wang Ren was arriving. All these relatives gathered, exchanging courtesies and greetings. Grandmother and Mrs. Wang were exceedingly pleased. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns burst and reassembled again and again – it was all meant to culminate today!” While chatting about family affairs and accepting the gifts brought along, she also ordered that wine and food be kept on hand. Fengjie, needless to say, was busily occupied. Li Wan and Baochai exchanged heartfelt farewells with their kin, while Daiyu, though initially happy, soon recalled that everyone had relatives while she was all alone—and tears welled in her eyes. Bao Yu, knowing her heart, consoled her at length. Later, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard and, with a teasing smile, announced to Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen: “Hurry along and go have a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’ Bao’s own dear kin should appear thus? Her uncles and brothers behave in such a peculiar manner—as if they were her true siblings. And while you always praise our stunning sister, now you see her with her two elder sisters! I find myself at a loss for words. Heaven above, how many brilliant and graceful souls there are! They say nothing is impossible for the determined – yet here, right in our midst, each one outshines the next. I feel I’ve learned something new today.” He chuckled to himself. Xiangren, sensing a mischievous glimmer in his tone, demurred from inspecting further. Qingwen and the others had already gone out and returned with laughter, teasing, “Look at that—a niece of the head of the household, a sister of Miss Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister – all gathered together like a neat row of slender scallions!”  Before they had finished, Tan Chun entered laughing, “Our poetry society is flourishing!” Bao Yu replied, “Indeed. In a fit of merriment I founded a poetry society – and by some strange twist of fate, these people have gathered. But I wonder: has anyone here truly learned to compose? Tan Chun answered, “I have asked around; though they modestly claim ignorance, judging by their bearing, none are entirely unskilled. Even if some are inept, it is no great matter – just look at Xiangling!” Qingwen teased, “Among them, the younger sister of Miss Xue is even better. How about Third Sister?” Tan Chun replied, “Certainly. In my eyes, even her elder sister and the others pale in comparison.” Xiangren, both astonished and amused, said, “How strange – where else might one find such refined souls? I do long to see them for myself!” Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them. She has practically insisted that our madams treat these young ladies as proper ‘daughters.’ Grandmother intends to support them; and if any do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.” Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?” Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” and then laughed, “Grandmother’s fondness for her great-grandchild nearly makes her forget about you, my dear.” Bao Yu smiled, “That’s fine – it is only proper to pamper the girls. Tomorrow, on the sixteenth day, we shall begin our society.” Tan Chun added, “But Lin has already awoken and Second Sister is ill; everything is in disarray.” Bao Yu replied, “Even if Second Sister does not compose poetry, what harm is there?” Tan Chun said, “Perhaps we should wait a few days until the new faces settle in, then invite them – our elder sister and our dear one will have renewed spirit, and our society will thrive.
With you all residing in the garden, adding extra trimmings for appearance might instead invite stricter supervision under the guise of saving money. It is difficult to phrase it properly.”  Baochai quickly moved over, gently patting Ping’er’s face with a smile, “Open your mouth so I may see how your teeth and tongue are made! From this morning until now, you’ve spoken in one consistent manner—neither flattering Third Sister nor implying that our grandmother’s ideas fall short. When Third Sister speaks, you echo with your own words, as though what she thinks is exactly what our grandmother also intends, save that there’s always an unworkable reason. And now, because the young ladies are living in the garden, it isn’t proper to say that saving money means having someone supervise. Think on it: if you were to hand the money over to someone, that person would not dare pluck even a single flower or fruit, and naturally the young ladies would be too timid to express any opinion—resulting in constant squabbles with the maids. Though he is cautious and balanced, our grandmother is not doing us any favors; if she hears this, she’ll surely be mortified into reform.”  Tanchun smiled and said, “I woke up in a foul mood earlier, and when I heard him, I immediately thought of his master—always so unbridled when in charge! Seeing him now only increased my anger. And then he said those things—rather than praising me for my kindness toward our grandmother, he remarked, ‘It’s not for nothing that the young ladies have always cared for our grandmother.’ That sentence not only deflated my anger but filled me with regret and sorrow. I thought, what advantage do I have as a young woman when I’m already left to fend for myself, unloved and uncared for?”  At this point, his voice broke and tears welled up. Li Wan and the others, moved by his earnestness—and remembering how Lady Zhao’s constant slander before Madame Wang had also weighed on him—could not help but shed tears and urged him, “Since the atmosphere is calm today, let’s discuss these two matters of improving benefits and eliminating shortcomings; it will not be in vain that our lady has entrusted us with this task. Besides, what need is there to bring up trivial issues?”  Ping’er quickly said, “I understand. As soon as a young lady speaks, everything is settled.”  Tanchun replied, “Even so, we must report back to your grandmother. In our little audit of small profits, it is not appropriate to leave anything unsaid—precisely because your grandmother is so astute that I must act in this manner. Had she been muddle-headed, conniving, and jealous, I wouldn’t have dared, as if I were seizing her chance. How can we not discuss these matters?”  Ping’er smiled, “Very well, I’ll go and inform her.” After a while she returned with a smile, “It was a wasted trip—such a good idea, your grandmother would never disagree!”  Upon hearing this, Tanchun, together with Li Wan, ordered that a list be drawn up of all the old maids in the garden so they might be consulted; soon a few names were settled upon. They then summoned these women, and Li Wan explained the plan. Everyone was agreeable. Some even said, “I’ll take charge of that grove. In one year’s work it will be renewed, and besides the bamboo shoots we harvest for the household, we can even collect some grain.” Another declared, “I’ll handle that patch of rice field—over the year the assorted wild birds feed on it; without dipping into the official funds, I can even contribute grain.” Just as Tanchun was about to speak, a servant announced, “The doctor has arrived to attend to Miss Shi in the garden.” The old maids had no choice but to go and greet the doctor. Ping’er quickly remarked, “Even if you have a hundred of you, it won’t form a proper organization. Can’t you bring in a couple of those with managerial insight to accompany the doctor?”  One of them replied, “We have Old Madame Wu and Old Madame Shan; the two of them are waiting at the Southwest Corner, by the brocade gate.”  Hearing this, Ping’er allowed the matter to drop. After the old maids left, Tanchun asked Baochai, “Well?”  Baochai smiled and answered, “Fortunately the initiators are more energetic than the finishers; those who are eloquent also have a taste for profit.” Tanchun nodded approvingly, then pointed out several names in the register for the three of them to examine.
With this argument, she had no choice but to accept the situation. Shan Jie eventually became so timid that she dreaded serving meals—sometimes eating early, sometimes late—and all the provisions she brought were mere leftovers. After two or three days, when Fengjie met her, Fengjie would praise her and advise her to keep quiet. A few days later, Fengjie herself sent word with the promise of 20 taels of silver to Officer Wang (a trusted subordinate) to discreetly summon a certain young man named Zhang Hua—whom it turned out was a gambler. Zhang Hua, only 19 years old and known to gamble recklessly, had been expelled from his family after spending his fortune, and now frequented gambling dens. Fengjie, having learned all the details, secretly sealed a twenty-tael silver gift for Officer Wang and ordered him to “coax Zhang Hua into our service, and have him draft a petition accusing Second Master’s household of treason—of concealing orders and using wealth and power to force a remarry, so as to halt the marriage and remarry.” Zhang Hua, well aware of the risks, dared not act rashly. Officer Wang returned and reported to Fengjie. With cold determination, Fengjie scolded, “That’s exactly what his mother would say! No wonder there is a saying, ‘A leprous dog cannot be raised against a wall.’ Tell him, ‘Even if you conspire against our family, it’s of no consequence!’ If things escalate, I will handle it.” Officer Wang then conveyed Fengjie’s instructions to Zhang Hua. Fengjie further ordered, “If he lodges a complaint, then confront him directly—I have my reasons.” Officer Wang, emboldened by having Fengjie’s backing, had Zhang Hua add his own words: “Just mention that my involvement covers all the instigation of Second Master.” Zhang Hua, after some discussion with Officer Wang, prepared a petition and the next day marched to the Bureau of Censors to file his grievance. The censor’s office reviewed the petition—a complaint against Jia Lian—and noted that it was lodged by “a family retainer,” so they sent someone to call Officer Wang to come and answer for it. A low-ranking clerk, too fearful to enter on his own, was sent with a note. Officer Wang, already waiting for this matter, did not require a messenger and had been stationed on that street. When he saw the messenger, he greeted him warmly and said, “It must be a serious matter among brothers. Quickly, come and join us.” The attendants, not daring to object, said, “Dear brother, please go—don’t cause a scene.” They then knelt at the hall. The censor then showed them the petition. Officer Wang deliberately scanned the document and remarked, “This matter is well known to our master—but this Zhang Hua is nothing more than a petty ruffian who, in his desperation, falsely accused our family retainer. I demand that Second Master be summoned.” Zhang Hua then mentioned Jia Huan. The censor’s office, finding itself at an impasse, had no choice but to summon Jia Huan. Meanwhile, Fengjie sent Qing’er in secret to inquire, and soon summoned Wang Xin to explain the matter, instructing him to bluff and intimidate with a display of force. She also dispatched 300 taels of silver for his expenses. That very night, Wang Xin arrived at his private residence at the censor’s office and set up his post. Fully aware of the situation, the censor’s office accepted the illicit silver and the next day reported that Zhang Hua was a rogue—accusing him of fabricating complaints to extort money from Jia’s family. The Bureau of Censors, having long enjoyed a friendly relationship with Prince Teng, merely relayed the matter without further protest, and arranged for Jia Huan to answer for it. Meanwhile, Jia Huan and others were busy with matters concerning Jia Lian. Suddenly, someone reported: “Someone has accused you of this and that—hurry, explain yourself!” Jia Huan rushed to inform Jia Zhen. Jia Zhen said, “I anticipated this. It’s unthinkable that anyone would be so brazen.” He immediately sealed 200 taels of silver and sent someone to settle the matter with the censor’s office, while also instructing his household to prepare for the confrontation. In the midst of their discussion, another report came: “Second Grandmother from the West Mansion has arrived.” Hearing this, Jia Zhen was shocked, and he and Jia Huan hurried to hide.
Soon, Xiangyun’s group arrived. Xiangyun teased, “Look, here comes another one! There’s no room left for you!” Bao Yu chuckled, “What a ‘Winter Boudoir Gathering’ indeed—alas, I have arrived too late. After all, this room is far warmer than the others, and the chairs are quite comfortable.” He then sat in the spot where Daiyu usually sat, placing a small chair atop another. While doing so, he noticed an exquisite jade basin on display that held a single potted narcissus with delicate petals. Exclaiming, “What a beautiful flower! The warmer the room, the richer its fragrance. Why did I not see it yesterday?”  Daiyu smiled and said, “That was a gift from our chief steward; Aunt Lai sent two pots—one of narcissus for me and one of wax plum for Yun. I originally refused them for fear of offending her, but if you wish, I can pass one along to you.”  Bao Yu replied, “I already have two at home, though they pale in comparison to this one. How could I possibly re-gift something so precious? That wouldn’t be proper.”  Daiyu replied, “I spend so many days tending to my medicines that I can scarcely keep up with the fragrance of flowers—they eventually fade. It is better that you take it away, so that the flower’s scent remains pure and undisturbed.”  Bao Yu laughed, “You truly understand these things!”  Daiyu then said, “Tomorrow our poetry society shall have a new theme—let us compose odes to the narcissus and the wax plum.”  Bao Yu teased, “Enough, enough! I dare not compose any more; every time I do I am penalized and left feeling embarrassed.”  Daiyu covered her face in sorrow. Bao Yu said, “Why worry? I have no fear of embarrassment; you, however, seem to blush terribly.”  At that moment, Baochai proposed, “Next time I will host a session with four topics—four odes and four lyrical pieces. Each person must compose four poems and four lyrics. The first topic shall be ‘Ode to the Taiji Diagram,’ using the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme in a five-character regulated verse; not a single syllable of the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme shall remain unused.”  Baoqin laughed, “That indeed is a challenge—it shows that our sister is not entirely sincere if she sets such hardships. Even if one forces words out, they may end up as a jumble of ‘I Ching’ phrases. I recall when I was eight and accompanied my father to the Western Sea to purchase Western goods—who would have thought that a girl barely fifteen, whose beauty resembled that of a Western painting (with golden hair, cascading ornaments, and a head adorned with agate, coral, cat’s-eye, and emerald), dressed in a brocade gown with embroidered sleeves and carrying a jeweled Wakizashi, could be so exquisite? They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics, and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write couplets for her!”  Everyone marveled. Bao Yu laughed, “My dear sister, show us what you have composed!”  Baoqin replied, “It is kept in Nanjing—I cannot retrieve it now.”  Bao Yu sighed in disappointment, “Alas, I have no chance to see such wonders!”  Daiyu teased, “Don’t try to fool us; I know that when you come you always bring these treasures from home. And yet you claim you have none—if they believe you, so be it; I, however, do not.”  Baoqin’s face flushed red, and she lowered her head demurely. Baochai said, “Your words betray your cleverness, though your tongue is too forthright. Our little Qinqi often spouts such things; you too have become quite sharp.”  Daiyu then said, “If you have brought them along, please recite something for us.”  Baochai replied, “Let’s wait—once we summon Yun, he too shall listen.”  And so a little maid was sent to fetch Yun. After a while, Xiangyun asked, “So tell us: Which foreign beauty has arrived?”  As she walked, she and Xiangling met.
The very next morning, at the break of dawn, he and his father departed for their native place with a sum of one hundred taels arranged. Jia Huan then reported the full details to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Pleased with the outcome, Jia Zhen awarded Jia Huan one hundred taels of silver and even arranged for a seventeen‑year‑old maid, Autumn Tong, to be given as a concubine. Jia Huan accepted with great joy. Yet when he later saw Fengjie, he couldn’t help but feel a tinge of guilt. Unexpectedly, Fengjie did not wear her usual calm expression. Instead, accompanied by Second Sister You, she met Jia Huan and exchanged cordial greetings. When Jia Huan mentioned Autumn Tong, a note of smugness crept into his tone. Fengjie quickly ordered that the household of Zhou Rui fetch Autumn Tong. Deep inside, Jia Huan worried how Zhang Hua’s return might affect the family’s reputation. He then discreetly sent word back to Zhang Hua: “Since you now have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the arranged match? If you persist, you risk angering our elders to the point of disgrace—return home, and I shall reward you with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after deliberation, agreed. Fengjie then returned, agitated, to Grandmother Jia, exclaiming, “It is all because Sister You did not cancel the engagement properly—now someone has filed a complaint, and the officials are on our case!” Grandmother Jia immediately summoned Second Sister You and asked, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now a complaint has been lodged, what is the meaning of all this?” Second Sister You replied, “They even collected the silver—but it was never formalized!” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now claims he saw neither the silver nor anyone removing him. Yet his father insists that our relatives once agreed, but then reneged when the relative died—leaving us with nothing conclusive. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the news is out, how can we send him away without losing face?” Grandmother Jia mused, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our honor remains intact. Who, then, would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother paid him twenty taels on a certain day to cancel the betrothal, but in desperation he retracted his promise. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible wretches are hard to manage. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” At her wits’ end, Fengjie sent for Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, knowing well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim it would bring shame upon the family. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk inciting our elders to anger—use your silver to return home; any decent man can be found.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Soon, with the arranged sum, he and his father departed for their native home at daybreak. Later that evening, Fengjie went to see Grandmother Jia and recounted everything: “It is all due to Sister You’s mishandling—the engagement was never formally canceled, and now someone has filed a complaint, risking an official investigation!” Grandmother Jia summoned Second Sister You, asking again, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now there’s a complaint, what is the meaning of it all?” Second Sister You explained, “They even took the silver—how could nothing have been formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now insists he saw no silver or anyone removing him, while his father said that our relatives had once agreed but then reneged upon a death. Without firm evidence, we must let him spin his tale. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the matter is public, how can we send him away without disgrace?” Grandmother Jia remarked, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our reputation remains unblemished.
Xiren, too, once gave some to a worthy person. Their private dealings are nothing new. The two baskets displayed in the meeting hall the other day were left intact—so how did they come to be mixed up? I will explain it to the mistress once I return.”  After saying this, Ping’er slips away to her boudoir and relates the matter in detail to Feng Xifeng. Feng Xifeng remarks, “Even so, Baoyu is the sort who, regardless of right or wrong, loves to take charge of every affair. Even if others plead with him, he won’t spare a kind word—instead, he’ll grab a coal bucket and vow to handle every matter himself! If we take him at his word, then when major issues arise it will be chaos. I say we gather all the maidservants from the mistress’s room. While we might not resort to harsh beatings, we should at least have them kneel on ceramic tiles under the sun and deprive them of food. If they don’t do so for a day, they are as fixed as iron—once taken in, they will be bound for life.”  Then she adds, “‘Flies don’t hold onto eggs without cracks’—although the Liu family didn’t steal anything, some influential people will still claim it. Even if we don’t impose the thief’s penalty, we ought to dismiss him. The court might later find fault with us, but that will not be seen as an injustice.”  Ping’er replies, “Why trouble yourself? ‘When it is time to let go, let go’—there’s nothing major here. In my opinion, even if you fuss for a hundred days here, eventually you’ll return to the other room, and no small grievance should leave a lasting grudge. Besides, you yourself have endured three disasters and eight hardships—barely managing to conceive a son, only to lose him at six or seven months. How can we not think that you were overworked and heartbroken? It’s better if half the people see you than if none do.”  Feng Xifeng laughs and says, “Do as you please! I won’t hold any grudges.”  Ping’er smiles, “Isn’t that proper?”  After saying this, she turns and goes out to distribute the instructions one by one. ——  To know the whole story in full detail, we must await the next chapter. Chapter 62 Drunken Xiangyun Slumbers on the Peony Screen, while Clueless Xiangling Unravels the Pomegranate-Skirt  Afterwards, Ping’er stepped out and instructed the Lin household person, saying: “‘Great affairs become small, and small matters vanish altogether’ – that is the mark of a thriving household. If every little thing were to be made a spectacle with bells and drums, nothing would be proper. Now, take that mother and daughter back, resume your usual duties, and retrieve those belonging to the Qin family. Let’s not dwell on this matter any longer—just be sure to patrol carefully each day.” With these words, she rose and left. The Liu family’s mother and daughter quickly knelt in respect. The Lin household person then escorted them back into the garden, returning to Li Wan and Tanchun. Both replied, “Understood. Better to have nothing happen at all.”  Meanwhile, Siqi and the others had been excited for a while. At that very moment the household of Qin Xian, having long waited for an opening, burst forth into activity in the kitchen—scrambling to pack up utensils, rice, coal, and so on. Soon they discovered many shortages, exclaiming, “We’re two dan short of polished rice and have an extra month’s supply of long-grain rice, and our coal allotment is off too!” In secret they arranged to send a basketful of coal and a load of rice over to the Lin family, and also dispatched some gifts and a few vegetables to a few of their colleagues, saying, “Now that I’m here, I’m counting on all of you to support me. From this day forward, we are one family; when I cannot attend to things, at least you must all help.” Amidst all this commotion, someone called out, “Finish your breakfast and get out! Sister Liu (Liu’s wife) originally had no trouble, yet now she’s been given charge of him.” Hearing this, the Qin Xian household fell silent, dejected and crestfallen; at once their morale sank, their banners were lowered, and with their bundles they departed.
Why haven’t you gone back?”  Angry, Lianhua storms back and adds more, reporting the matter to Siqi. Siqi, in turn, becomes incensed. Meanwhile, after serving the meal to Yingchun, she gathers the little maids and, seeing that many are already eating, politely invites them to sit. Siqi then orders the little maids to “toss out every dish and vegetable from the cabinets—throw it all out to feed the dogs, so that no one profits!”  The little maids, eager for a chance to please, scramble with all their might and begin tossing things about. In the ensuing confusion, many try to calm the situation, pleading with Siqi, “Please, young lady, don’t pay heed to the ramblings of children—Aunt Liu will not allow it! Remember, Aunt Liu has eight heads (i.e. is very formidable) and wouldn’t dare cross you. Just think about it—these eggs are indeed hard to come by.”  Siqi is persuaded by their kind words and gradually her temper cools. Meanwhile, in a separate part of the house, Miss Liu’s daughter (referred to as “Wu’er,” the fifth daughter) had been sent out to deliver a portion of poria snow. Wu’er, having heard that some was to be given to the Flower Official, secretly repackaged a half portion in a paper packet at dusk when few were around. She then went to the gate of the Yihong Courtyard and, not daring to go inside, stood in a clump of rose bushes, watching from afar. After a short while—over tea—Spring Yan comes out and calls, “Sister, where are you?” Wu’er replies with a smile, “Call out for the Flower Official and I’ll speak with him.” Spring Yan whispers, “Sister, you’re far too impatient. In a few days he’ll come anyway. Just wait a bit. Earlier I sent him ahead—but if you tell me something now, I’m afraid you won’t be able to wait, and the garden might be locked up.”  Wu’er then hands a package of poria snow to Spring Yan, saying, “This is the poria snow; use it as needed to replenish. I’ve secured some for him—please pass it on.”  With that, she returns. As she walks along a winding path, she unexpectedly meets some of the Lin household’s people accompanied by several old maids. Wu’er, caught unawares, must come forward to greet them. A member of the Lin household inquires, “I heard you were ill—what brings you here?”  Wu’er, forcing a laugh, explains, “My mother sent me here to ease my boredom.”  The Lin household official retorts, “That can’t be. I saw your mother leave earlier and then closed the door. If she sent you, why didn’t she tell me you were here? Going out and having me close the door—what is the meaning of that? Are you lying?”  Wu’er, at a loss for words, replies, “It was my mother’s instruction early this morning. I forgot to mention it until now. I was afraid my mother might have mistaken me for someone else, so she didn’t inform the mistress.”  The Lin official, sensing that Wu’er’s explanation is feeble and recalling that not long ago, Yuchuan had mentioned that some things were missing from the main room—and that a few maids had complained—suspicion arose. Soon, Little Chan, Lianhua, and several young wives come by and say, “Aunt Lin must question her. In recent days, you’ve been sneaking around like a ghost, doing who knows what!”  Little Chan adds, “Indeed. Yesterday, Sister Yuchuan said, ‘The cabinet in the mistress’s side room has been opened and quite a few trinkets are gone.’ And Second Lady Lian had sent Ping’er and Sister Yuchuan to fetch some rose dew—but even that was short by a can, and no one seems to know where it went!”  Lianhua laughs, “I haven’t heard about that. Today, I even saw a bottle of dew.”  The Lin official, now agitated by the lack of explanation, immediately orders lanterns to be lit and for everyone to search the kitchen.
Everyone was there except Ping’er. (Ping’er had gone out to receive gifts from the You, Lin, and other families; one gift followed another – as numerous as the family’s tradition of paying respects. Ping’er was busy distributing reward money and thanking everyone, and later she reported to Feng Xifeng. She accepted some items, refused others, and immediately gave away what she did accept. After a while—and only after Feng Xifeng had finished her noodles—she changed clothes and returned to the garden.)  Barely upon entering the garden did several maids come to fetch her; together they went into the Red Fragrance Courtyard. The banquet was lavishly laid out on a carved tortoiseshell tray, with cushions of lotus and arrangements of hibiscus. Everyone laughed, “The longevity star is complete!” At the top, four seats were reserved for the four of them, but none of them would sit. Aunt Xue remarked, “Heavens above – it doesn’t suit your little group. I feel so constrained; perhaps I should retire to the hall and lie down for a while. I can’t eat much nor drink heavily, so it would suit me better there.” But Aunt You and the others insisted otherwise. Baochai said, “That’s fine; let Mother relax a bit in the hall. If she loves food, we can send some over, and then she’ll be content. Besides, no one is outside to watch.” Tanchun laughed, “In that case, obedience is as good as compliance.” They then escorted her into the meeting hall where, after the young maids had spread out a splendid brocade mat with cushions, Tanchun ordered, “Do be sure to massage the legs for the Mistress. Provide tea and water without any fuss. Once you’ve delivered the gifts, have the Mistress eat and reward you – but don’t stray from here!” The little maids all agreed, and Tanchun and the others then departed. Eventually, Baoyu, Xiangyun, and the others sat down at a table: Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Ping’er sat at one table (with Baoyu facing east and Ping’er west); Tanchun then brought Yuanyang to sit by her side. At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was arranged for Aunt You, Li Wan, with Xiren and Caiyun accompanying. A final table was for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun suggested they exchange toasts. Baoqin and the other four remarked, “With all this fuss, we can’t possibly sit still all day!” They soon finished. Two of the girls were to perform a song for the birthday, while the others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes – go upstairs and cheer up the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue. Baoyu said, “A proper seated celebration is dull – it is better if we perform our rituals.” Some suggested one kind of ritual, others another. Daiyu remarked, “I say we write out all the various decrees on brush and ink, form lots, and whoever’s drawn shall be the one – that will settle it!” Everyone agreed, “Splendid!” They fetched a set of brush, ink, and floral stationery. Recently, Xiangling had been learning poetry and calligraphy, and when she saw the brush and ink she eagerly volunteered, “Let me write!” After some discussion, they ended up with about ten lots. One by one, Xiangling wrote out her lot. They then tossed the lots into a bottle, and Tanchun ordered Ping’er to draw one. Ping’er mixed them up with a stick and plucked one out. When she opened it, it bore the two characters “She Fu” (meaning “to play a guessing game”). Baochai laughed, “You’ve drawn out the old decree! ‘She Fu’ has been around since ancient times, though it has long since fallen into disuse. This one is especially obscure – half the group will not know it. It might as well be discarded, and we should draw a new lot that both refined and popular can appreciate.” Tanchun laughed, “Once it’s drawn, how can we destroy it?
This appearance drew many jokes: “They do look like a pair of twin brothers!” Xiren poured wine for him and said, “Please, drink a little more.” Soon, Xiangyun won a drinking game against Baoyu; Xiren bested Ping’er, and rounds of toasts were exchanged. Then Xiangyun declared, “For the toast on the wine’s surface, we need one line of ancient text, one of an old poem, one domino name, one tune title, and one line from a government decree—all to form a verse. And the base of the toast should mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so verbose! But it has a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed and said, “Who said so? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily while Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies alongside the solitary falcon; A fierce wind sweeps the river and sky, and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can break one’s stride, Stirring one’s innermost being; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut kernel and recited as the wine’s base:  “Hazelnuts are not the clattering stones beyond the courtyard— How then comes the sound of a thousand households pounding laundry?” And that settled the round. Yuanyang, Xiren, and others then recited common sayings—each including the word “longevity”—without further ado. After a while, they began playing a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng absent, no one kept strict order; everyone enjoyed themselves, shouting and calling out. The hall was a riot of reds and greens, with jade glimmering and pearls tinkling—a most joyful scene. After playing for a time, everyone began to disperse. Suddenly, however, Xiangyun was nowhere to be seen. Assuming she had stepped out on her own, they waited—but she did not reappear. They sent people in all directions to search, but she was nowhere in sight. Shortly thereafter, members of the Lin household, accompanied by several older maids, arrived. They were partly worried that there might be urgent business and partly anxious that with Wang Xifeng absent the young maids might drink excessively and lose their propriety, so they came to inquire if anything was amiss. When Tanchun saw them, she smiled and said,  “You need not worry—come, see for yourselves. We have not overindulged; we merely used wine as an excuse to have fun. Don’t fret, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Even though the Dowager had the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses absent, we were simply having fun. We came to check on you, and also, as time goes by, the young ladies may need some light snacks. Since they don’t normally eat much, if you have only a couple of cups of wine, you might not be sufficiently nourished.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were just about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids agreed and hurried off to bring some treats. Tanchun then said, “You all rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I’ll have someone send over more wine for you.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” After a while they too departed. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My face is so warm now—I’m too embarrassed to face them. I say, let’s just drop it so as not to provoke them further.” Tanchun laughed, “No matter—you see, as long as we don’t drink seriously, it won’t matter.”  Just then a little maid came skipping in, laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a blue stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and sure enough, they found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step, fast asleep in her drunken stupor.
Once dried and sold to tea and medicine shops, they fetch a good price.”  Tanchun nodded with a smile, “It’s just that there aren’t many who know how to work with these aromatic herbs.”  Ping’er laughed, “Bao’s friend, Ying’er’s mother, is exactly the person who can handle these. Last time she even gathered some, dried them, and made them into a flower basket and gourd for my amusement. Have you forgotten?”  Baochai laughed, “I was just praising you—and now you’re teasing me!”  The three were surprised and asked, “Why is that?”  Baochai explained, “It’s not acceptable to be so capricious. You already have enough personnel on hand, and now if I introduce someone new, they might even come to look down on me. I have an idea: In Yihong Courtyard there is an old woman named Ye—she is the one in charge of baking the tea. She is a trustworthy old soul and is especially favored by Ying’er’s mother. Why not entrust this matter to Old Ye? Even if she does not understand all the details, there’s no need for us to explain every point; she can simply confer with Ying’er’s mother. Even if Old Ye refuses altogether and delegates it to another, it is their own affair—and any idle gossip would not be directed at us. In this way, the work is fair and proper.”  Both Li Wan and Ping’er agreed, “Very well.”  Tanchun laughed, “Even so, I worry that once they see the profit they might forget their obligations.”  Ping’er smiled, “That won’t matter. Just the other day Ying’er even accepted Old Ye as her godmother, and both families are on very good terms.”  Satisfied with that, Tanchun then selected several more names, all of whom had long been regarded with a discerning eye. Using her brush she circled four names. Soon the old maids went back and forth. “The doctor has left,” they announced, having delivered the prescription upstairs. While some were sent outside to fetch the medicine and supervise its administration, Tanchun and Li Wan gathered the women and explained: “Each one of you shall be responsible for a certain area. According to the seasons, apart from what is allotted for household use, any surplus may be taken by you to earn a profit. At the end of the year we will settle accounts.”  Tanchun laughed, “I just recalled another matter. If we settle accounts at the year’s end, naturally the money will be funneled back into the treasury—adding yet another layer of control by those above, who will in effect take another cut. By initiating this project now and assigning you to manage it, we are effectively bypassing their control. I cannot help but feel that when you finally settle accounts at year-end they will still find ways to impose their schemes. Moreover, during the year, for any matter under management, the principal receives one share while they get half a share—this is the long-established custom known to all. Now, since the garden is my new creation, it would be best if the final accounts come out before they have their way.”  Baochai laughed, “In my opinion, there should be no need to settle accounts internally. If one person gets more and another less, it only creates more trouble. Why not simply ask who is responsible for each share, and let him take charge of that particular matter? After all, it concerns only the garden’s personnel. I have calculated that there are only a few categories—the oil, rouge, perfume, and paper—each young lady and her attendant have fixed allowances. In addition, there are brooms, dustpans, and brushes, as well as grain for the various birds and small animals. All these items have already been contracted out, and there is no need for the treasury to dispense money. Think of how much could be saved!”  Ping’er laughed, “Although these categories seem small, when totaled over the year they can save over four hundred taels of silver.”  Baochai smiled, “Indeed—four hundred a year, eight hundred in two years. With that sum, we could buy a few more rental houses or add several acres of sandy land. Admittedly, there may be some surplus, but having worked so hard all year, the workers deserve to keep a little extra for themselves.
At that very moment the Liu family had just brought their daughter out for a stroll in one secluded corner of the garden; after wandering for a while she returned to the kitchen, where she sat down to have tea. Not long after, the Flower Official entered carrying a small glass bottle about five inches high which, when held up to the light, revealed a half-filled vial of a rouge-like liquid—apparently a Western-style grape wine that Baoyu was meant to drink. Mother and daughter quickly said, “Hurry and bring a pot of boiling water—please sit down.” The Flower Official smiled, “There’s only a little left; you may even keep the bottle for yourself.” Wu’er, upon hearing this, realized it was rose dew; she accepted it with thanks. She then said, “Today is a good day; let’s have a little stroll. This area behind here is rather dull—just a bunch of large stones, big trees, and the back wall of a house. There isn’t much of a proper view.” The Flower Official asked, “Why don’t you go forward then?” The Liu family replied, “I haven’t told her to go forward. The young ladies don’t recognize her—if an unsuitable person were to notice, there would be a heap of gossip. Tomorrow, when you take her along and she has her room, I’m afraid there won’t be anyone to accompany her for a stroll; who knows, she might tire of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “What’s there to fear? I’m here for her.” Aunt Liu’s daughter said, “Oh, my dear! Our skin is so thin compared with yours.” She then poured another cup of tea. The Flower Official, not really eating the tea, merely rinsed his mouth with a sip and then departed. Aunt Liu’s daughter said, “I still have some—Wu’er will see to it.” Wu’er then went out, and seeing no one around, tugged at the Flower Official and said, “Have I not said my piece?” The Flower Official laughed, “Am I not entertaining you? I heard that in this very house there are two vacant positions—one was that of Xiao Hong’s (which Second Lady Lian intended to fill) and the other for the one who fell; since they haven’t been filled, you wouldn’t be asking for too much. It is not overreaching.” He continued, “Ping’er always says, ‘Any affair involving people or money must be tolerated for a day.’ Now, Third Sister is about to be used as a paddle (to settle accounts). Even if some matters in our own room are not properly arranged, why must we get entangled in others’? If any words are exchanged, in time we’ll be too old to turn back. Let’s wait until things cool down; once the Dowager and the mistress have leisure, they can discuss even the largest matter with our elder. Nothing will be amiss.” Wu’er replied, “Although you say so, I am of an impatient nature—I cannot wait. While I’m at it, I want to honor my mother; I want to add to my monthly allowance so that the household will be more at ease; and if I can cheer things up, perhaps my illness will be cured soon. Even if I have to pay the doctor, it will save the household money in the long run.” The Flower Official said, “I understand your meaning—rest assured.” After these words, the Flower Official departed. Meanwhile, Wu’er returned and thanked her mother profusely for the Flower Official’s kindness. Her mother said, “I never expected to obtain these things. Although they are fine items, if overused they might even provoke a fever—so sending some off is indeed a great favor.” Wu’er asked, “And to whom are they to be sent?” Her mother replied, “To your uncle and elder brother—a half cup for his fever.” Wu’er was silent for a long while before her mother poured half a cup and then placed the remainder (with the bottle) in the kitchen. Wu’er, with a bitter laugh, said, “In my opinion, they might as well not be given. If anyone asks, it would spark a great deal of gossip.” Her mother replied, “What’s there to worry about?
The moment Grandmother Jia stepped inside, Jia She and Jia Lian, with the clan in tow, knelt in tears to greet her. Jia Zhen and Jia Rong also clung to her, weeping bitterly. Grandmother Jia, an elderly woman, was overcome with grief at the sight, and for a while she held Zhen and Rong, lamenting loudly. Jia She and Jia Lian urged her to stop; only then did she manage to check her tears. She then moved to the right side of the hall, where she saw You-shi and her daughter-in-law, who also wept in her arms. After this round of crying, everyone else came forward to pay respects. Fearing that watching over the coffin might deepen her grief and harm her health, Jia Lian and the others urged her to go home. Unwilling as she was, she finally agreed to leave. Indeed, at her advanced age, she found it difficult to withstand the emotional strain. That night she felt flushed and heavy-headed, her nose stuffed and voice hoarse, so they summoned a physician. All were busy through half the night; fortunately, the illness had not penetrated deeply, and after some sweating, her pulse stabilized. By the third watch, her fever subsided, easing everyone’s mind. She continued to take medicine and recover over the following days. Not long after, came the date set for Jia Jing’s interment. Grandmother Jia was still not fully well, so she stayed home with Baoyu to attend her. Wang Xifeng also remained due to her lingering illness, but Jia She, Jia Lian, Lady Xing, and Lady Wang led many household members, both men and women, to escort the coffin to the Iron Threshold Temple. They did not return until nightfall. Jia Zhen, You-shi, and Jia Rong stayed at the temple to keep vigil, planning to accompany the coffin back to their ancestral home after a hundred days, leaving old Lady You and her two daughters, Second Sister and Third Sister, in charge of the household. Meanwhile, Jia Lian—having heard much about the two You sisters—had long been eager to meet them. During the period Jia Jing’s coffin was kept at home, he grew familiar with these sisters and fell for Second Sister. Knowing of Jia Zhen and Jia Rong’s own dalliances, he dared to flirt, exchanging glances and signals. Third Sister, however, remained indifferent, while Second Sister seemed to reciprocate. Yet in the presence of so many people, they had no chance to proceed. Jia Lian also feared arousing Jia Zhen’s jealousy and did not dare act rashly. Their desire remained unfulfilled, though mutual understanding existed. After Jia Jing’s coffin had been taken away, the household at the Ning mansion was sparse: aside from Lady You, Second Sister, Third Sister, and a few old maids and servant girls in the main rooms, most of the concubines and maids followed Jia Zhen and Jia Rong to the temple. Outside, only a few servants remained on guard duty, patrolling at night and watching the gates by day; they seldom ventured inside. Jia Lian seized this opportunity, claiming to be assisting Jia Zhen and decided to lodge at the temple. He frequently claimed to manage household affairs on Jia Zhen’s behalf and used these excuses to visit the Ning mansion and seduce Second Sister. One day, the steward Yu Lu came to report to Jia Zhen, “All the funeral supplies—canopies, poles, mourning cloth, plus the palanquin bearers and their robes—cost a total of one thousand, one hundred and ten taels of silver. So far we have paid five hundred taels; six hundred and ten remain. Yesterday the merchants came demanding payment, so I’ve come for your instructions.” Jia Zhen replied, “Just collect it from the storeroom. Why bother me?” Yu Lu explained, “I went there yesterday, but since the master passed away, there have been many expenses. What remains must be saved for the hundred-day observances and the monastery’s needs, so they cannot provide the rest. That’s why I had no choice but to ask you if perhaps there’s some other source of funds, or if I should try to borrow it.” Jia Zhen laughed, “You think we’re hiding silver somewhere? Just borrow it from somewhere—how you do it is your business.” Yu Lu smiled wryly, “If it were just one or two hundred, I might manage, but six or seven hundred is beyond my means.” Jia Zhen thought a moment and told Jia Rong, “Go ask your mother.
I hear that if someone does not obey, it will be trouble.” Everyone laughed, “Who would be so bold?” Then the Lin household inquired, “Has Second Master (Baoyu) gone to sleep?” All answered, “We don’t know.” Xiren quickly nudged Baoyu forward. Baoyu removed his shoes and went out, saying with a smile, “I haven’t slept yet. Mother, come and rest for a bit.” He then called, “Xiren, bring some tea.” The Lin household person hurried in and said with a laugh, “You haven’t slept? With these long days and short nights, you should rest early tomorrow—otherwise, by morning you’ll be late, and people will laugh at you; you’ll no longer appear as a proper scholar but like a clumsy fellow.” Baoyu laughed, “Mother is right. I always sleep early, but whenever Mother visits, I’m so distracted that I end up sleeping without noticing. Today, after eating noodles, I simply played around too long.” The Lin household person joked with Xiren and the others, “I’ve heard Second Master’s mouth has been swapping words all day—now even the young ladies are calling him by name. Although we are here, we must always show respect for our elders. If names are casually uttered, it might set a precedent for our nephews and brothers to be irreverent—people might later say our family has no proper elders at all!” Baoyu grinned, “Mother speaks truly—I only blurted a word in passing.” Xiren and Qingwen laughed, “Let’s not embarrass him too much; when he’s playing, he calls out names, but in formal occasions, he’s as proper as ever.” The Lin household person said, “That is best—that is how a well-educated gentleman should behave. The more modest you are, the more respect you command. Even the cats and dogs in the mistress’s room would not dare slight him. That is the mark of a cultured scholar.” After tea, he said, “Now rest—then we shall leave.” Baoyu added, “Let’s rest a little longer.” The Lin household then took their leave to attend to other matters. Inside, Qingwen and the others quickly closed the door. Xiren then returned with a laugh, “Did that old lady have a cup? All her prattling and fussing—she made a scene for us again.” Miaoyue teased, “Was it done out of good will? She must be very cautious, always keeping her dignity, for fear of losing her stature.” They set out wine and snacks. Xiren suggested, “Forget about the high table—let’s just use that round huangli table on the Kang; it’s spacious and convenient.” Soon, they carried it in. Miaoyue and Fourth Maid went to fetch fruits using two large tea trays, while two elderly maids sat by the brazier outside sifting wine. Baoyu remarked, “It’s so hot—let’s all remove our coats.” Everyone laughed, “If you take yours off, we’ll all follow and arrange our seats accordingly.” Baoyu said, “If we sit now, it will be until the early hours. You know I detest all these formalities before outsiders—if they start giving me grief, it’ll be no good.” All agreed. Before long, everyone undressed their formal attire. In short order, everyone had casually tied up their hair; most wore only their fitted jackets. Baoyu himself was clad in a bright red soft-silk jacket over green satin trousers (with loose hems), secured with a sweatband, and rested against a new jade-colored gauze pillow decorated with rose and peony petals, accompanied by the Flower Official. At that moment, the Flower Official complained about the heat, wearing only a small patchwork jacket of three-color satin with a modest sweatband and water-red trousers with loosely hemmed cuffs. His hair was braided neatly at the forehead; he sported a tiny jade earring on his right ear and a prominent red-and-gold pendant on his left, making him appear as if he were a perfectly round moon with clear, autumnal eyes. His droll appearance earned many jests—“They do look like a pair of twin brothers!” Xiren poured wine for him and said, “Please have another cup.” Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu in a drinking game, while Xiren outdid Ping’er.
Noticing a piece of paper sticking out from under the inkstone, he picked it up. Daiyu hurried to stop him, but he had already tucked it into his robe. Smiling, he pleaded, “My dear Cousin, let me see it!” Daiyu said, “Nothing important, but you always rummage around!” Before she could finish, Xue Baochai arrived. She said, smiling, “What is Baoyu trying to look at?” Unsure of the text or Daiyu’s reaction, Baoyu dared not immediately respond and instead looked to Daiyu with a smile. Daiyu, inviting Baochai to sit, explained with a laugh, “I was reading about beautiful and talented women in history whose fates were both admirable and pitiable, and I felt deeply moved. After lunch I was too tired to go with Tan (Tan-chun) to see Sister-in-law. Having some free time, I decided to pick out a few figures and compose some verses, just letting my emotions run free. I managed five poems when I got sleepy and left them there. Then along came Baoyu, rummaging through my things. It’s not that I mind his reading them, but I’m afraid he might copy them and show them to others.” Baoyu said at once, “When would I ever show them around? Yesterday I copied your ‘White Crabapple’ poems onto my fan, but that was because I admired them so. I only kept them on me to read. Do you think I don’t know that poems from a young lady’s hand must never be carelessly passed around? Since you scolded me last time, I haven’t once taken them outside the Garden.”  Baochai smiled, “Cousin Lin is right to be cautious. If you wrote them on a fan and happened to leave it in the schoolroom, someone might ask who wrote them, and the word would spread. That wouldn’t be good at all. It’s long been said that ‘a girl’s virtue is to be without talent.’ Above all, one must be chaste and quiet; needlework is secondary. Poems and lyrics are just amusements in the boudoir—nice to have or not. We young ladies of prominent families don’t need such reputations for literary talent.” She then turned to Daiyu and said, “But it’s all right if I read them, as long as they don’t leave your room.” Daiyu laughed, “Well, then maybe even you shouldn’t read them!” She pointed at Baoyu. “He’s already snatched them away.”  Hearing this, Baoyu took the paper from his robe and read it with Baochai. They saw five poems, each entitled with the name of a beauty:  Xishi “In one age of perfect beauty, she followed the waves into the swirl of fate; Empty were the courtiers of Wu, still longing for the girl from her home. Mock not the village girl trying to imitate her brow’s furrow— When hair is white, she still washes clothes by the stream.”  Yu Ji “At midnight, crows cry and the wind howls, tearing the heart, How can Yu’s hidden sorrow face those eyes with double pupils? Qing and Peng willingly fell to pieces in the future— Why not drink the sword’s edge under the Chu war tent?”  Wang Zhaojun “She astounded all with breathtaking splendor when she left the Han palace, Beauty doomed by fate, the same in ancient days and now. Even if the emperor scorned her charms, How could he hand over the power to a painter who decided her destiny?”  Green Pearl “Jade or common pebble, all are cast aside alike; When did Shi Wei ever prize a maiden’s grace? Her stubborn fortune must have been shaped in a previous life— At least, in the end, there was a shared end to console her loneliness.”  Hongfu (Red Whisk) “A long sword and bold talk—her manner was unique indeed, A beauty with discerning eyes recognized the despairing path. Lifeless bodies fill Lord Yang’s camp, How could they confine this girl with the heart of a hero?”  Baoyu was full of praise and suggested, “Why not call these five poems ‘Five Beauties in Verse?’” Without waiting for her to reply, he took a brush and added the title at the end.
After more idle chatter, the gathering eventually dispersed, and the night passed in quiet. The next day the snow had cleared. After the meal, Grandmother Jia again instructed Xiangyun, “Regardless of the cold, you must resume your painting; hurry and finish it by New Year—even if it isn’t perfect, do not err.”  Xiangyun, though troubled by the task, agreed. In no time did everyone gather to see how her painting would proceed. Xiangyun, however, seemed lost in thought. Li Wan smiled at the gathering and said, “Let her muse in peace; in our discussion yesterday when the Grand Matriarch only mentioned lantern riddles, back at home when Qi’er and Wen’er couldn’t sleep, I composed two verses on the ‘Four Books.’ Each of them also composed two.”  Everyone laughed, “That is exactly what should be done. Now then, let’s guess them!”  Li Wan laughed, “‘Guanyin has no family pedigree in the world’—this is one verse on the ‘Four Books.’”  Xiangyun promptly said, “It must be ‘The way ends in utmost goodness.’”  Baochai smiled, “Think a bit about what ‘family pedigree’ might mean.”  Li Wan urged, “Think again.”  Daiyu laughed, “I’ll take a guess. Perhaps, ‘Though kind, none are verified?’”  Everyone laughed, “That’s it!”  Li Wan continued, “‘A pond of green grass—what is its name?’”  Xiangyun quickly added, “It must be ‘Pampas, of course; there is no alternative!’”  Li Wan smiled, “That one’s a stumper for you. And Wen’er’s riddle is, ‘Water flows from a stone’s edge, cold and clear’—it hints at an ancient name.”  Tan Chun, laughing, asked, “Is it ‘Shantao’?”  Li Wan replied, “Yes, it is.”  Li Wan then said, “And Qi’er’s is a single character, ‘Ying’—guess which one?”  After much guessing, Baoqin ventured, “Could it be the character for ‘flower’ as in blossoms?”  Li Qi laughed, “That’s exactly right.”  Everyone queried, “But what does ‘Ying’ have to do with ‘flower’?”  Daiyu smiled, “How clever—‘Ying’ can mean a transformed plant, not merely an insect’s glow!”  All understood and laughed, saying, “Splendid!”  Baochai remarked, “Although these are all fine, they do not suit the Grand Matriarch’s taste. We’d better choose themes that are both refined and accessible so that all may appreciate.”  Everyone agreed, “We must indeed have some common, plain matters too.”  Xiangyun thought for a moment and laughed, “I have composed a piece in the ‘Dian Jiang Chun’ tune. It is rather plain—care to guess its meaning?”  He recited:    Between the ravines the paths diverge, in this worldly play of red dust—what pleasure is there? Fame and fortune are as empty as mist, and later affairs are doomed to fail. Everyone was puzzled; after some time they guessed various interpretations—a few thought it referred to a monk, others to a Taoist, and still others to a wandering jester. Baoyu laughed for a long while and said, “None of those. I wager it is about a mischievous monkey!”  Xiangyun smiled, “Exactly so.”  The others then asked, “Everything in the riddle is fine—but how do you interpret the final line?”  Xiangyun replied, “Was it not that the monkey had its tail chopped off?”  Everyone laughed at the ingenious and quirky riddle. Li Wan said, “Yesterday Aunt Xue remarked that Sister Qin, who has seen much of the world, has traversed many paths—indeed, you should be composing more riddles.
It’s the perfect time for enjoying the snow.”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “When was I not pleased? I was merely playing with these young ones for a while.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Last night I was thinking of borrowing the garden for a day with our mistress, setting two tables of rustic wine to let the Grand Matriarch enjoy the snow; but then I heard that she retired early—Baoyu even said, ‘The Grand Matriarch’s heart is not cheerful’—so I dared not disturb her. Had I known, I would have arranged it indeed.”  Grandmother Jia smiled, “It is only October—this is the first snow; there will be many snowy days hence, and it wouldn’t hurt to indulge the mistress a bit more.”  Aunt Xue laughed, “Indeed, my filial piety is sincere.”  Lady Phoenix laughed, “How could Aunt Xue forget? Now that fifty taels of silver have been weighed out and handed to me for safekeeping, the moment it snows I will prepare the wine. Aunt Xue, you need not worry or forget.”  Grandmother Jia smiled, “So it is decided: our mistress shall keep the fifty taels, and you and Lady Phoenix shall each have twenty-five taels. When next the snow falls, if my heart feels bitter, I will simply let it pass. Aunt Xue need not be troubled—after all, both Lady Phoenix and I benefit.”  Lady Phoenix clapped her hand and laughed, “Excellent! That is exactly my idea.”  Everyone laughed. Grandmother Jia then chided playfully, “Bah! How shameless—you clambered up like a pole! If you hadn’t said that our mistress is a guest who has endured wrongs at our home, we wouldn’t be spending money on her. Yet here you are, demanding fifty taels outright—how impudent!”  Lady Phoenix laughed, “Our esteemed ancestor always has the keenest sense. Try asking Aunt Xue: if she can produce fifty taels to share with me, then why not? Now, seeing that it won’t be of use, she’s turned the tables on me by speaking so generously. I shall not press Aunt Xue for silver any further—instead, I will provide the silver myself to pay for the wine and treat the Grand Matriarch, and then I will seal an extra fifty taels in filial tribute to her. Let it be a penalty for meddling in others’ affairs. Isn’t that splendid?”  Before she could finish, everyone burst into laughter on the kang (heated brick bed). Grandmother Jia then mentioned how even Baoqin’s red-plum branch, picked from the snow, surpassed the quality of those in paintings. She inquired into his age and his family situation. Aunt Xue, reading his mind, guessed he was to be matched. However, having already promised him to the Mei family and with Grandmother Jia’s plans not yet clearly stated, she half-disclosed to Grandmother Jia, “It’s a pity this child has no fortune—his father passed away the year before last. Though he has seen much of the world from a young age—traveling to mountains and rivers with his father—his father, being fond of pleasure and engaged in trade, would travel with the family for a year in one province and then half a year in another. In all, out of ten journeys, there were five or six stops. That very year, he was betrothed to the son of the Mei Hanlin, yet the very next year his father died. Now, his mother suffers from a chronic phlegm illness.”  Before Aunt Xue could finish, Lady Phoenix stamped her foot and declared, “What a misfortune—I was just about to act as a matchmaker, but he is already promised to someone!”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Who are you planning to match him with?”  Lady Phoenix replied with a smile, “Our Grand Matriarch need not be concerned. I have my eye on them—they are clearly meant for each other. Now that he’s spoken for, there’s no point discussing it further.”  Grandmother Jia, understanding Lady Phoenix’s meaning, upon hearing that someone had been chosen, dropped the matter. After more idle chatter, the gathering eventually dispersed, and the night passed in quiet. The next day the snow had cleared. After the meal, Grandmother Jia again instructed Xiangyun, “Regardless of the cold, you must resume your painting; hurry and finish it by New Year—even if it isn’t perfect, do not err.”  Xiangyun, though troubled by the task, agreed.
Qingwen, tickled by the sensation, laughed and abandoned Fangguan to join Baoyu’s playful tussle; Fangguan, seizing the moment, managed to pin Qingwen down. Xiren watched the four rolling together and chuckled, “If you keep on like this in the cold, you’ll catch a chill—get dressed, everyone!” Just then, Biyue entered and announced, “Last night, Grandmother forgot a silk square here—do you think it’s still around?” Spring Yan hurriedly responded, “Yes—I found it on the floor, not sure whose it was, washed it, and hung it out; it hasn’t dried yet.” Biyue laughed at the lively scene, “You all sure know how to party early in the morning!”  Meanwhile, Baoyu listened to discussions about Wu’er’s case. He inquired, “What about Wu’er?” Spring Yan explained, “I told Sister Liu; she’s quite fond of her—but poor Wu’er, after that night’s injustice she fell ill. She’ll recover soon, I’m sure.” Baoyu sighed with regret and asked, “Has Xiren heard of this?” Spring Yan replied, “I haven’t mentioned it; I’m not sure if the Flower Official has spoken of it either.” Baoyu said, “I haven’t told him either. Well, I’ll let him know later.” With that, he went back inside and deliberately washed his hands. By the time the lamps were lit, a group was seen entering the courtyard. Peering discreetly through the window, they noticed members of the Lin household and several supervisory women approaching; one man held a large lantern. Qingwen whispered with a smile, “They’re here to check on the night duty. Once they leave, we can close the door.” Sure enough, everyone on night duty from the Yihong Courtyard went out. The Lin household person looked around and then ordered, “Don’t waste money on drinking—when done, lie down until dawn. I hear that if someone does not obey, it will be trouble.” Everyone laughed, “Who would be so bold?” Then the Lin household inquired, “Has Second Master (Baoyu) gone to sleep?” All answered, “We don’t know.” Xiren quickly nudged Baoyu forward. Baoyu removed his shoes and went out, saying with a smile, “I haven’t slept yet. Mother, come and rest for a bit.” He then called, “Xiren, bring some tea.” The Lin household person hurried in and said with a laugh, “You haven’t slept? With these long days and short nights, you should rest early tomorrow—otherwise, by morning you’ll be late, and people will laugh at you; you’ll no longer appear as a proper scholar but like a clumsy fellow.” Baoyu laughed, “Mother is right. I always sleep early, but whenever Mother visits, I’m so distracted that I end up sleeping without noticing. Today, after eating noodles, I simply played around too long.” The Lin household person joked with Xiren and the others, “I’ve heard Second Master’s mouth has been swapping words all day—now even the young ladies are calling him by name. Although we are here, we must always show respect for our elders. If names are casually uttered, it might set a precedent for our nephews and brothers to be irreverent—people might later say our family has no proper elders at all!” Baoyu grinned, “Mother speaks truly—I only blurted a word in passing.” Xiren and Qingwen laughed, “Let’s not embarrass him too much; when he’s playing, he calls out names, but in formal occasions, he’s as proper as ever.” The Lin household person said, “That is best—that is how a well-educated gentleman should behave. The more modest you are, the more respect you command. Even the cats and dogs in the mistress’s room would not dare slight him. That is the mark of a cultured scholar.” After tea, he said, “Now rest—then we shall leave.” Baoyu added, “Let’s rest a little longer.” The Lin household then took their leave to attend to other matters.
When our master heard of it, he offered as many silver taels as necessary. But that Stone Dullard insisted, ‘Even if I starve or freeze, I won’t sell them!’ Our master was beside himself, cursing Second Young Master for his failure. In the end, he promised 500 taels – first exchanging silver, then taking the fans – yet the scoundrel refused, declaring, ‘You must take my life before you can have my fans!’ Think about it – what absurdity is this?” Baochai, upon hearing this, ordered a maid, “Go ask our mother; if she approves, I won’t interfere.” Ping’er went off, and after a while returned, “Sister, did you hear?” Baochai said, “If that is so, then let’s not worry; our master is not one to be trifled with. Even if he suffers a few setbacks, it will eventually all balance out.”  Just then, a young relative arrived. Fengjie and the others quickly rose to greet her. Old Madam Lai sat down and cheerfully said, “I am delighted – were it not for our masters’ favor, where would my joy be? Yesterday, Grandmother even sent Cai Ge with gifts, and my grandson kowtowed at the door.” Li Wan asked with a smile, “How early did you leave last night?” Old Madam Lai sighed, “I can’t keep them in line – they do as they please. Just the other day, someone kowtowed for me at home, and I had nothing kind to say – I scolded him, ‘Boy, don’t think you’re above everyone else! You’re thirty now – even as a servant, your master’s favor should let you read and write like a young gentleman. Yet you don’t even know how to write the word ‘servant’! All you know is how to enjoy your blessings without remembering the hardships your grandfather and father endured – they toiled for generations for you, only for you to squander it away! And now, at twenty, you’ve been granted more, and you’re expected to support your future. Think of all those who starve while you, a mere sprout, are pampered! Now that you’ve been blessed for ten years, if you continue to beg for more, you’ll be the laughingstock of the household!’” Li Wan and Fengjie both laughed, “You exaggerate! We all know he does his best.” Then Old Madam Lai inquired, “But what of that Second Sister’s son? What misdeed has he committed that he must be expelled?” Fengjie laughed, “That is exactly what I was about to tell you. On my birthday the other day, when no one was outside to attend to affairs, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he simply sat there cursing. When two women entered, he gathered the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of steamed buns all over the courtyard. After everyone had gone, I sent Cai Ming to admonish him—and he ended up berating Cai Ming fiercely. That insolent wretch – why hasn’t he been expelled?” Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him – teach him a lesson so that he may mend his ways. Expelling him outright would be too harsh, for he is not our own flesh and blood but merely the attendant of the madams. I say, let Grandmother administer a few lashes as a warning; if he misbehaves again, then expel him. We must consider both his own mother and the madams.” Fengjie said, “Very well – tomorrow, have him come in and administer forty lashes; if he dares drink again, let him never approach the wine!” Zhou Rui’s family knelt and pleaded, and Old Madam Lai ordered, “Send these three back to their rooms. If any of them mention this matter again, I will have them beaten with a crutch!” The three knelt before Grandmother Jia and Mrs. Xing, and the old nurse escorted them away. Later that evening, as everyone returned home, Aunt Xue and Baochai discovered that Xiangling’s eyes were swollen from crying. When they went to see Sè Pan, they found that although his face and body bore scars, his injuries were not serious.
I see you haven’t had tea in a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I’ll pour another.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just enough to rinse my mouth is fine.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is plenty. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s nowhere to be found.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed. Baoyu nudged him, “Don’t sleep—let’s go have some fun outside. Later, we’ll have a proper meal.” The Flower Official replied, “You all drink wine and ignore me; I become bored and fall asleep.” Baoyu pulled him up, laughing, “We’ll dine again tonight at home. When we return, I’ll ask Sister Xiren to bring you to the table—how does that sound?” The Flower Official said, “Neither the Lotus Officer nor the Ru Official are coming up; it would be awkward for me to be alone. Besides, I’m not very fond of that noodle dish—I didn’t eat properly this morning. I’m already hungry. I had told Aunt Liu earlier to prepare a bowl of soup and half a bowl of polished rice for me so that once I eat, it will be enough. And if I may drink wine tonight without supervision, I’ll ensure I eat enough first. I plan to enjoy a couple of jin of fine Huiquan wine at home later. Nowadays, though some claim that too much tea ruins the throat, I’ve never heard such a thing. Moreover, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four cream-filled pastry pieces, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such fare?” He mixed the soup with rice, ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then half a bowl of porridge, and then stopped. Baoyu, upon smelling the food, thought it tasted even better than usual, so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found extremely fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the leftovers. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it isn’t enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “There’s no need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve already had my fill; no more is needed.” She then stood by the table, finished her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for me.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen also drink well, though they’re usually too shy—but today, since we are all breaking our fast together, it’s fine.” Baoyu then recalled another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s case.
As for the two taels for the young ladies, it was never meant to cover these items; it was meant for those moments when the lady in charge is either away or too busy. It’s merely to ensure that the young ladies aren’t inconvenienced. Yet, looking around, I see that in many rooms our sisters are buying these items directly with cash. It appears that either the buyer is pocketing the money or is providing substandard goods.”  Both Tanchun and Li Wan laughed. “You’ve observed it well,” they said. “It isn’t that the buyer is ‘stealing’ the funds; it’s just that when pressed for time later on, they scramble to obtain something—anything—that merely carries a name. In truth, such items are unusable; we would still have to purchase fresh ones for two taels of silver, having someone else’s servant’s brother fetch them. Even if the official buyers were sent, they’d end up the same way—we just never know what scheme they’re up to.”  Ping’er added with a laugh, “What the buyers purchase is not what we need. When others buy genuine goods, the buyers refuse to accept them, accusing them of foul play and trying to wrest control of their commission. So they’d rather offend someone in-house than jeopardize their external business. If the young ladies were to use the servants’ own purchasing channels, then no one would dare criticize.”  Tanchun continued, “That unsettles my heart. We’re wasting two taels, and half of our supplies go to waste. Why not simply dispense with the buyer’s portion every month? That’s the first matter. The second is the banquet we’re to hold for everyone this year—and you shall be there too. Look at that small garden over there; how does it compare to ours?”  Ping’er laughed, “It isn’t even half the size of ours, and it has far fewer trees and flowers.”  Tanchun explained, “I was chatting casually with a girl from that household, and she mentioned that aside from the flowers they grow, they also harvest edible bamboo shoots, vegetables, fish, and shrimp from their garden. In fact, by year’s end there is a surplus amounting to two hundred taels of silver! From that day I learned that even a single broken lotus leaf or a withered blade of grass can be valuable.”  Baochai smiled and said, “Truly the language of refined luxury! Though you ladies of high birth may not be familiar with these matters, haven’t you all read Master Zhu’s essay ‘On Not Abandoning Oneself’?”  Tanchun laughed, “I have, but it merely encourages self-reliance with empty phrases—there isn’t much substance to it.”  Baochai replied, “Master Zhu is not merely full of empty rhetoric—every word has its merit. Yet you, having just set things in motion for a couple of days, are already so blinded by profit that you dismiss Master Zhu’s words as trivial. Go out and confront larger matters of benefit and detriment, and soon even Confucius himself will seem insubstantial to you!”  Tanchun laughed again, “You, a man of insight, haven’t read Ji Zi’s letter? In it Ji Zi once said, ‘Those who climb the ladder of wealth and status, who navigate the realm of strategy, exhaust the words of Yao and Shun, and turn their backs on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.’”  Baochai asked with a smile, “And what of the next line?”  Tanchun grinned, “I suppose I’d be cursing myself if I recited it.”  Baochai continued, “There is nothing in the world that cannot be put to use. If something is of service, it must have its price. It’s a pity that for you clever ones this major issue has not yet been experienced firsthand.”  Li Wan laughed, “You’ve assembled everyone here and yet you avoid the serious topic. Why not continue discussing learning?”  Baochai answered, “True learning is the serious matter. Without holding fast to our scholarly principles, everything slips into vulgarity.”  After teasing one another for a while, the three returned to business. Tanchun went on, “Our garden alone, if doubled in size, would yield an annual interest of four hundred taels.
You’d better speak up!” Alarmed by her fury and the hostile expressions of the maids, Xing’er fell to his knees at once, repeatedly bowing. Wang Xifeng said, “I hear it’s not directly your fault, but you didn’t inform me. That’s your crime! If you tell the truth now, I’ll show you mercy. But if you lie, you can count your heads.” Trembling, Xing’er stammered, “I don’t know what madam means by ‘mishandling something with my master’…” At that, Wang Xifeng’s pent-up rage erupted. “Slap his mouth!” Wang’er stepped forward, but she snapped, “You fool—have him do it himself. You’ll have your turn if needed.” So Xing’er began slapping his own face left and right, over a dozen times, until Wang Xifeng shouted, “Enough!” She then asked, “Your Second Master has supposedly married a ‘new Madam,’ leaving me the ‘old Madam.’ Don’t you know anything?” Recognizing the reference, Xing’er panicked. He snatched off his cap and banged his head on the floor. “Spare me, madam! I won’t dare utter a single lie!” “Speak!” she demanded. Xing’er knelt upright. “At first, I didn’t know a thing. One day, after Old Master from the Eastern Mansion was buried, Yu Lu went to Iron Threshold Temple to collect silver from Master Zhen. Second Master and Young Master Rong also went there. On the way, the young master told Second Master about those two aunts in Mistress Zhen’s quarters. Second Master praised them; Young Master Rong coaxed him, suggesting he take Second Aunt.” At that, Wang Xifeng spat forcefully. “Ptui! Shameless wretch—what do you mean she’s his ‘aunt’?!” Xing’er rushed to kowtow again, “I’m guilty, I’m guilty!” not daring to look up. Wang Xifeng said, “And then what? Why did you stop?” Xing’er pleaded, “If madam pardons me, I’ll go on.” She cursed, “Spare your nonsense! Out with it—there’s plenty more to tell.” Xing’er continued, “The Second Master was excited, and afterward, I don’t know how it became real.” Wang Xifeng let out a cold laugh. “Of course you don’t. But I’m sure you know quite a bit more. Keep going.” Xing’er said, “Then Young Master Rong found him a house.” Wang Xifeng asked, “Where is it?” “Just behind our mansion,” Xing’er answered. Wang Xifeng gave a half-laugh, glancing at Ping’er. “We’re all dead in here, you see. Listen to this.” Ping’er stayed silent. Xing’er went on, “Then Master Zhen gave some money—nobody knows how much—to a Zhang family, so they wouldn’t object.” Wiping her mouth, Wang Xifeng asked, “What’s all this about the Zhang family?” Xing’er said, “Madam doesn’t know. This Second Madam—” He suddenly slapped himself again, provoking a smile from Wang Xifeng and giggles from the maids. After thinking a moment, he corrected, “I mean, Mistress Zhen’s younger sister from that side—” “Yes?” Wang Xifeng prompted. Xing’er said, “She was betrothed as a child to a poor man named Zhang Hua. Now that family is on the verge of begging. Master Zhen offered them money to withdraw the engagement. That’s how it got resolved.” Wang Xifeng nodded at the maids. “See? He claimed ignorance at first.” Xing’er continued, “Then the Second Master had people wallpaper and furnish the house and brought her in as his bride.” “From where?” asked Wang Xifeng.
Suddenly, Jia Lian remembered Bao Er. Previously, he and his wife had quarreled because Bao Er’s wife had been unfaithful with Jia Lian; she had hanged herself from shame. Jia Lian had given Bao Er a hundred taels to marry someone else. Bao Er then married “Duo Guniang,” a cook’s widow, who had once been involved with Jia Lian. They now lived outside. Jia Lian decided this couple was just right for managing the secret household. Bao Er and his wife, hearing of this opportunity, gladly accepted. As for Zhang Hua’s family, originally stewards of a grain-tax estate, they declined after misfortune. They had indeed betrothed their son Zhang Hua to Second Sister You in her infancy. But when they suffered lawsuits, they fell into poverty, unable even to afford a wedding. Meanwhile, Lady You had remarried, and for over ten years there had been no contact. Suddenly, men from the Jia family called them in and demanded they relinquish the engagement. Though they were reluctant, they feared the Jia clan’s power. The You family gave them twenty taels, and Zhang’s family wrote a formal release. Thus, that old betrothal was void. Jia Lian and the others were overjoyed, seeing no obstacle now. They fixed a wedding date—on the auspicious third day of the month—planning for a secret ceremony to bring Second Sister into the new house. Chapter 65  Jia Lian Secretly Marries Second Sister You; Third Sister You Desires to Wed Second Brother Liu  When Jia Lian, Jia Zhen, and Jia Rong had finished their discussions and made all the arrangements, on the second day of the month they first brought Madam You and Third Sister You to the new residence. Seeing the place, though not exactly as Jia Rong had described it in his persuasive talk, it was nonetheless quite well-furnished. Mother and daughter were both satisfied. Bao Er and his wife greeted Madam You as “Old Madam” or “Elder Lady” at every turn, and they addressed Third Sister You as “Third Aunt” or “Mistress.”  On the following day, at the fifth watch, a plain sedan chair carried Second Sister You to the new residence. All manner of incense, candles, paper offerings, bedding, and food and drink had long been made ready. Soon Jia Lian, dressed in mourning garb, arrived by a small sedan. After they bowed to Heaven and Earth and burned paper offerings, Madam You beamed with delight on seeing her daughter dressed head to toe in lovely attire—so different from how she had looked at home—and proudly led her into the bridal chamber. That night, Jia Lian and Second Sister consummated their union with every intimacy imaginable, which we need not describe in detail. The more Jia Lian looked at Second Sister, the more he admired her. He adored everything about her, unsure how to lavish enough favor on her to do her justice. He ordered Bao Er and the others never to speak of her as a mere second wife or concubine; they were to address her as “Madam.” He himself called her “Madam” too, effectively erasing Lady Feng from his mind. Whenever he went home, he would simply say he was busy at the Eastern Mansion. Because Wang Xifeng knew he often consulted with Jia Zhen, she suspected nothing. As for the household staff—though quite numerous—no one meddled in such matters. Even those idlers who made it their business to ferret out secrets found it more profitable to flatter Jia Lian and gain little advantages than to spread rumors. Naturally, they kept silent. Jia Lian felt deeply grateful to Jia Zhen for his help. He gave fifteen taels of silver each month for everyday expenses at the new house. If he did not come, mother and daughters dined together; if he did come, he and Second Sister ate by themselves while her mother and Third Sister withdrew to their own room. Jia Lian even handed over all the savings he had accumulated over the years, entrusting them to Second Sister’s care. He poured out for her everything about Wang Xifeng’s habits and ways, both in bed and out, insisting that once that “poisonous wife” died, he would bring Second Sister into the household. Hearing this, Second Sister was of course happy. Meanwhile, about ten people lived in the new house with more than enough money and supplies; their days were comfortable indeed.
Don’t let anyone make wild claims now.”  Ping’er laughs, “Doesn’t everyone know the story? Today, Sister Yuchuan was in tears; when I quietly asked her, she agreed—and Sister Yuchuan is no ordinary maid. So no one is taking much interest in it. Who would willingly handle such matters?”  Baoyu says, “Very well. I’ll speak up about it—just say that I was merely teasing you all by ‘stealing’ the mistress’s dew in order to scare you. With that, both matters will be settled.”  Xiren replies, “That’s truly an ominous affair—if we preserve a reputation as ‘thieves who safeguard others,’ it might be acceptable. But if the mistress hears about it, she’ll say you’re childish and ungrateful.”  Ping’er laughs, “It’s a trivial matter anyway. Let’s instead have Caiyun and Yuchuan come over and clear it up. Otherwise, if they get away with it, it will appear as if I have no way of getting to the bottom of it. Even after everything is settled, they might continue their thieving ways without accountability.”  Xiren and the others laugh, “Exactly—we must leave a record!”  So Ping’er calls for the two of them and says, “Don’t worry—the culprit has been identified.”  Yuchuan asks first, “Where is the culprit?”  Ping’er replies, “He’s in the second lady’s room—ask him about his answers. I know in my heart that it wasn’t he who stole it; poor fellow was so frightened he admitted it all. Now, Brother Baoyu only wishes to acknowledge half of it. I intended to speak up, but the thief in question is a sister with whom I have long been close; yet the mistress is as ordinary as can be—and harming a good person’s reputation puts me in a difficult position. We must persuade Brother Baoyu to approve so that everyone remains untroubled. Otherwise, if we insist on pursuing it, she will surely become angry.”  Hearing this, Caiyun blushes and, overcome with shame, says, “Sister, you needn’t be blamed—indeed, I must accept responsibility.”  Xiren and Ping’er quickly add, “If you acknowledge it, then we won’t have to report it to Aunt Zhao; otherwise, if Second Sister hears, she will be incensed. It would be better if Brother Baoyu himself acknowledges it so that no one else will know of our involvement. Moreover, if anything happens, we can all claim no responsibility. Even if the entire house were given over to someone else, it would not concern us.”  Caiyun, after some thought, lowers her head and finally assents. Thus, all matters are settled. Ping’er then takes Caiyun, Yuchuan, and the Flower Official into the night-shift room. She also summons Wu’er and discreetly instructs her to say that the poria snow was given by the Flower Official. Wu’er, deeply grateful, accepts. Shortly thereafter, Ping’er brings them over to her own side, where she sees that the Lin household has already arrived with several young wives—enough to secure the situation. The Lin official then tells Ping’er, “This morning I escorted her in, but I was afraid no one would be there to attend to breakfast, so I temporarily sent Qin Xian’s woman to serve the young ladies’ meal.”  Ping’er asks, “Who is Qin Xian’s woman? I don’t know her well.”  The Lin official explains, “She’s the one on duty at the south corner at night—quiet by day, so the young ladies might not know her. She’s tall, with a lean, graceful figure and bright, clear eyes—the very picture of efficiency.”  Yuchuan exclaims, “That’s right! Sister, how could you forget? She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient.
Even her own mother-in-law finds her irritating, calling her ‘the sparrow that always flies to the hottest spot’ and ‘the black hen that lays a whole nest of trouble,’ minding other people’s business instead of her own. If not for the Old Lady’s protection, she’d have been reined in long ago.”  Second Sister teased, “If you can speak of her like this behind her back, imagine what you might say about me someday. I’m even lower than she is, so you’ll have even more to say.” Alarmed, Xing’er knelt and cried, “Madam, if I slander you, may lightning strike me dead! If I’d been so fortunate that our Second Master had married someone like you, we’d have suffered far fewer beatings and scoldings and lived without so much anxiety. Now everyone who serves Second Master praises your kindness, saying they’d rather come serve you if Second Master moves out. We all hope for that day.”  Second Sister laughed, “You sly scamp! Get up. I was only joking. So you all stop by here sometimes, but I might just pay Lady Feng a visit.” Xing’er waved his hands emphatically, “Madam, you mustn’t! Let me warn you: it’d be better never to meet her at all. She’s all honeyed words and cruel intentions, two-faced and double-tongued—smiling at you but tripping you from behind, bright as a basin of fire while hiding a knife underneath. I doubt even Third Sister could match her in a quarrel. You’re gentle by nature—no match for her cunning.” Second Sister answered, “I would treat her with reason. Would she dare harm me?” Xing’er said, “Forgive my bluntness, I’ve had a bit too much wine. Even if you humble yourself before her, do you think she’d let you off easily, seeing you’re lovelier and more beloved than she is? She’s the queen of jealousy. If Second Master so much as glances at a maid, she’ll smash someone’s head on the spot. And though Ping Girl also belongs to her household, they’re together only once or twice a year, and Lady Feng still finds ten ways to complain. Ping Girl often ends up in tears, protesting, ‘I didn’t choose to be here; it was forced on me. If I don’t obey, I’m accused of rebellion; if I do, I’m still in trouble.’ Even so, Lady Feng needs Ping Girl’s help.”  Second Sister laughed, “I see. But I’ve heard you also have a young widow as well as several young ladies in your family. Are they not formidable enough to stand up to Lady Feng?” Xing’er clapped and laughed, “Ah, you don’t know, Madam. The widow you mention is the kindest soul alive. She doesn’t interfere in anything, just teaches the young ladies reading, writing, and needlework. A while back, when she briefly took charge due to an illness in the house, she followed the established rules without showing off. Our eldest girl is wonderful. Second Miss is nicknamed ‘Second Wood-Head.’ Third Miss is nicknamed ‘Rosebud’—so red and fragrant that everyone loves her, but she has thorns. Sadly, she’s not the Mistress’s own daughter, more like a phoenix hatched in a crow’s nest. Fourth Miss, still young, is actually Master Zhen’s sister, raised by our Mistress. She doesn’t meddle, either. Then there are two young ladies from outside our immediate household, truly unmatched in beauty and learning. One is the daughter of our Old Lady’s son-in-law, named Lin; the other is the daughter of another aunt, named Xue. They’re both like fairy maidens, skilled in letters. When they ride in carriages or stroll in the garden, we scarcely dare breathe.”  Second Sister chuckled, “With such strict family rules, young page boys like you shouldn’t even think of crossing paths with those young ladies, let alone breathe near them.” Xing’er shook his head. “That’s not it. It’s just that if our breathing were too forceful, we might blow Lin Miss off her feet, and if it were too warm, we might melt Xue Miss!” Everyone burst into laughter.
Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for myself.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen also drink well, though they’re usually too shy—but today, since we are breaking our fast together, it’s all right.” Baoyu then recalled another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s case. Please speak with the Liu household and insist she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it, and that will be that.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is indeed a proper matter.” Spring Yan then called for two little maids to come in and help wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part need not be detailed further). Baoyu then resumed his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters, with the Flower Official following, fan in hand. Just as they stepped outside, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set up the meal—we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted his earlier encounter at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company—it would add to the merriment.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox—where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you manage it without informing us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow, if everyone leaves and the Flower Official is left alone, that’ll be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you simply cannot go!” Qingwen retorted, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—even though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will mend it? Don’t babble on—I’m not fussing over you. If you never help out, then what? You’ve been away for days, almost risking your life, yet still come back empty-handed—what’s the point? Speak up already! Why act so foolishly and smile at me? That won’t do.” Qingwen spat in playful anger. Soon, everyone entered the hall. Aunt Xue also arrived, and all the ladies sat down to dine. Baoyu served a symbolic half-cup of tea-soaked rice. After the meal, everyone enjoyed tea and exchanged idle banter and playful jokes. Outside, several young servants—Xiao Luo, Xiangling, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and a few others—played in the garden, gathering flowers and plants and engaging in a game of “guess the plant.” One declared, “I have the Guanyin willow!” Another said, “I have the Arhat pine!” A third claimed, “I have the Gentleman’s bamboo!” Yet another said, “I have the Calla of Beauty!” One more exclaimed, “I have the sparkling emerald!” Another remarked, “I have the peony from The Peony Pavilion!” And yet another, “I have the pipa fruit from The Pipa Story!” Bean Official then declared, “I have sisterly blossoms!” When no one else could best that, Xiangling said, “I have the ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ (Hui of Husband and Wife).” Bean Official retorted, “I’ve never heard of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’!” Xiangling explained, “When a single arrow yields one flower it is called ‘Lan’; if it yields several, it is ‘Hui.’ If the blossoms cluster on top, that is ‘Brotherhood Hui’; if they grow side by side, it is ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’ Mine, with two clusters side by side, is definitely ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’” Bean Official had no retort and got up laughing, “According to you, if one cluster is larger than the other, that would be ‘Old Man and Son Hui’!
Second Master praised them; Young Master Rong coaxed him, suggesting he take Second Aunt.” At that, Wang Xifeng spat forcefully. “Ptui! Shameless wretch—what do you mean she’s his ‘aunt’?!” Xing’er rushed to kowtow again, “I’m guilty, I’m guilty!” not daring to look up. Wang Xifeng said, “And then what? Why did you stop?” Xing’er pleaded, “If madam pardons me, I’ll go on.” She cursed, “Spare your nonsense! Out with it—there’s plenty more to tell.” Xing’er continued, “The Second Master was excited, and afterward, I don’t know how it became real.” Wang Xifeng let out a cold laugh. “Of course you don’t. But I’m sure you know quite a bit more. Keep going.” Xing’er said, “Then Young Master Rong found him a house.” Wang Xifeng asked, “Where is it?” “Just behind our mansion,” Xing’er answered. Wang Xifeng gave a half-laugh, glancing at Ping’er. “We’re all dead in here, you see. Listen to this.” Ping’er stayed silent. Xing’er went on, “Then Master Zhen gave some money—nobody knows how much—to a Zhang family, so they wouldn’t object.” Wiping her mouth, Wang Xifeng asked, “What’s all this about the Zhang family?” Xing’er said, “Madam doesn’t know. This Second Madam—” He suddenly slapped himself again, provoking a smile from Wang Xifeng and giggles from the maids. After thinking a moment, he corrected, “I mean, Mistress Zhen’s younger sister from that side—” “Yes?” Wang Xifeng prompted. Xing’er said, “She was betrothed as a child to a poor man named Zhang Hua. Now that family is on the verge of begging. Master Zhen offered them money to withdraw the engagement. That’s how it got resolved.” Wang Xifeng nodded at the maids. “See? He claimed ignorance at first.” Xing’er continued, “Then the Second Master had people wallpaper and furnish the house and brought her in as his bride.” “From where?” asked Wang Xifeng. “They carried her in from her mother’s home,” Xing’er answered. “Great!” Wang Xifeng said. “Any formal wedding party?” “It was just Young Master Rong, along with some maids and old women. No one else,” Xing’er explained. Wang Xifeng asked, “Did the main mistress from over there attend?” “Two days later, she brought some items to have a look,” he replied. Wang Xifeng laughed and said to Ping’er, “So that’s why the Second Master kept singing her praises for those two days.” Then back to Xing’er, “Who was serving him there—presumably you?” Xing’er immediately bowed, at a loss for words. Wang Xifeng pressed on. “When he said he was dealing with that family’s affairs, it must have been about this. Right?” “Sometimes he did real business,” Xing’er said, “sometimes he went to the new house.” Wang Xifeng continued, “Who else lives with them?” “Her mother and younger sister. Yesterday her younger sister actually cut her own throat,” Xing’er answered. “Why?” Wiping his brow, he told the story of Liu Xianglian. Wang Xifeng commented, “That one at least had some fortune, avoiding a life of infamy.” She asked, “Is there anything more?” “Nothing else I know. All I’ve just told is true. If any of it is false, I’ll accept whatever punishment you wish,” Xing’er said.
The second candidate, Hupo, was now ill and unable to proceed; Caiyun—recently estranged from Jia Huan—had also contracted an incurable malady. Only Fengjie’s and Li Wan’s household’s eldest maid had been dispatched from their rooms. The remainder, being too young, were sent off to be married outwards. It had long been that because Fengjie herself was unwell, Li Wan and Tanchun had been busy with household affairs and had little leisure. Then, through the festivals and a host of other trivial matters, the old Poetry Society had been abandoned. Now in mid-spring, though time allowed, misfortune had mounted: Baoyu had withdrawn from the world because of Liu Xianglian’s seclusion at the monastery, and news had reached that Third Sister You had taken her own life while Second Sister You was forced to death by Fengjie’s pressure; further, Wu’er, after that night’s imprisonment, had grown ever more ill. Continuous worries and resentments piled up, affecting moods and language—turning hearts muddled and minds unsteady. Even Xiren and the others dared not approach Grandmother Jia, so they resorted to jesting to ease the tension. That very morning, when everyone awoke, cheerful laughter and clamor were heard from the outer rooms. Xiren laughed and said, “Hurry, go out and stretch a bit—Qingwen and Miaoyue are keeping Fangguan under control.” Hearing this, Baoyu quickly donned his grey mouse-patterned long jacket and went out to see for himself. He found that three of them were not yet properly dressed—the ever-light Qingwen wore only a scallion-green silk jacket and a small red silk vest, her hair unbound, riding atop Fangguan; Miaoyue, in a red satin strap bodice over old clothes, was tugging at Fangguan’s side; while Fangguan himself lay sprawled on the Kang wearing a tight, flower-patterned garment with red trousers and green socks, his feet flailing as he laughed uncontrollably. Baoyu laughed, “You big ones are bullying the little one! Wait till I come and tickle you!” and clambered onto the bed beside Qingwen. Qingwen, tickled by the sensation, laughed and abandoned Fangguan to join Baoyu’s playful tussle; Fangguan, seizing the moment, managed to pin Qingwen down. Xiren watched the four rolling together and chuckled, “If you keep on like this in the cold, you’ll catch a chill—get dressed, everyone!” Just then, Biyue entered and announced, “Last night, Grandmother forgot a silk square here—do you think it’s still around?” Spring Yan hurriedly responded, “Yes—I found it on the floor, not sure whose it was, washed it, and hung it out; it hasn’t dried yet.” Biyue laughed at the lively scene, “You all sure know how to party early in the morning!”  Meanwhile, Baoyu listened to discussions about Wu’er’s case. He inquired, “What about Wu’er?” Spring Yan explained, “I told Sister Liu; she’s quite fond of her—but poor Wu’er, after that night’s injustice she fell ill. She’ll recover soon, I’m sure.” Baoyu sighed with regret and asked, “Has Xiren heard of this?” Spring Yan replied, “I haven’t mentioned it; I’m not sure if the Flower Official has spoken of it either.” Baoyu said, “I haven’t told him either. Well, I’ll let him know later.” With that, he went back inside and deliberately washed his hands. By the time the lamps were lit, a group was seen entering the courtyard. Peering discreetly through the window, they noticed members of the Lin household and several supervisory women approaching; one man held a large lantern. Qingwen whispered with a smile, “They’re here to check on the night duty. Once they leave, we can close the door.” Sure enough, everyone on night duty from the Yihong Courtyard went out. The Lin household person looked around and then ordered, “Don’t waste money on drinking—when done, lie down until dawn. I hear that if someone does not obey, it will be trouble.” Everyone laughed, “Who would be so bold?” Then the Lin household inquired, “Has Second Master (Baoyu) gone to sleep?” All answered, “We don’t know.” Xiren quickly nudged Baoyu forward.
Meanwhile, about ten people lived in the new house with more than enough money and supplies; their days were comfortable indeed. Nearly two months passed. One evening, Jia Zhen completed a Buddhist service at the Iron Threshold Temple and returned home. Long separated from his “younger sister,” he decided to pay her a visit, first sending a page boy to see whether Jia Lian was in or not. The boy returned saying Jia Lian was away, and Jia Zhen was delighted. He dismissed his attendants, keeping only two trusted young pages to lead his horse, and went quietly to the new house at lamp-lighting time. Once there, he had the two pages tie the horse in the courtyard and wait in the lower quarters while he slipped inside. He greeted Madam You and Third Sister You first; then Second Sister came out to see him. Overjoyed at the sight of her, Jia Zhen sipped tea and laughed, “What do you think of my matchmaking efforts? If you had missed this chance, you wouldn’t find such fortune even by lantern-light. Before long, your elder sister will come with a formal gift to visit.” As he spoke, Second Sister told the servants to prepare a meal and close the door. Among themselves, they were all one family, so there was no need for formality. Bao Er approached to pay respects. Jia Zhen said, “You have a conscience; that’s why Second Master entrusted you to serve them. One day I’ll have even greater use for you. Don’t run around drinking and causing trouble. I’ll reward you when the time comes. If anything is lacking here, go tell me directly. We brothers are not like strangers.” Bao Er promised, “Yes, I understand. If I fail to do my best, may I lose my head.” Jia Zhen nodded with a smile, “It’s good that you know.”  Thus the four of them drank together. Second Sister, however, fearing that Jia Lian might suddenly appear and create an awkward situation, withdrew after two cups. Jia Zhen could do nothing about that and simply watched her leave. Madam You and Third Sister remained to keep him company. Though Third Sister would occasionally jest with Jia Zhen, she was not as agreeable and yielding as her elder sister, so despite his keen desire, Jia Zhen dared not push his luck and risk being rebuffed. Besides, with Madam You right there, he felt too self-conscious to act too forward. Meanwhile, the two young pages who had come with Jia Zhen were in the kitchen drinking with Bao Er. Bao Er’s wife, Mistress Duo, was busy at the stove. Suddenly two of Second Sister’s maids came in giggling, wanting a drink. Bao Er cautioned, “Girls, aren’t you supposed to be upstairs serving? You’re slipping away; what if someone calls you and no one’s there?” His wife scolded him, “You muddleheaded fool, you’ve drunk yourself stupid. What does it matter to you? If someone calls, I’ll handle it. Whatever storms blow, they won’t land on your head.”  Because Bao Er’s status before Jia Lian depended on his wife’s influence, he left everything to her. With that, he drank a bit more and went to bed. Mistress Duo then kept drinking with the maids and page boys, joking and flirting to please them, hoping this would help her curry favor with Jia Zhen. They were all enjoying themselves when suddenly came the sound of knocking at the gate. Mistress Duo hurried out to see who it was and found Jia Lian dismounting. He asked if anything was going on. She whispered, “The Master is here, in the west wing.” Jia Lian went at once to the bedchamber, where Second Sister was sitting with two young maids. Seeing him, her expression turned somewhat uneasy. Jia Lian pretended not to notice and said, “Bring wine quickly! Let’s have a couple of cups and then sleep. I’m quite worn out today.” Second Sister, with a forced laugh, helped him remove his coat, brought him tea, and asked about his day. Jia Lian was so enchanted by her attentions that his heart fluttered with pleasure. Not long after, Mistress Duo brought wine, and husband and wife drank face-to-face, the two maids serving on the floor beside them. Jia Lian’s personal page boy, Long’er, went to tie up his horse and noticed another horse already there.
If she’s reasonable, fine; but if she dares act high and mighty, I’ll slice out the gall from you two dogs and then fight her to the death! Afraid of some wine? Let’s drink, then!”  With that, she picked up the wine pot, filled a cup, drank half, yanked Jia Lian toward her, and tried to pour the rest down his throat. Terrified, he sobered instantly. Jia Zhen, too, never expected Third Sister to be so blunt. The two men—normally so smooth in flirtation—were left speechless by this barrage. Seeing them tongue-tied only spurred Third Sister on. She shouted, “Bring my sister! If we’re going to have fun, let’s all have fun together—four of us! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing’s cheaper than family property.’ You two are brothers, we two are sisters; we’re not outsiders, so come on!” Mortified, Madam You felt this had gone too far. Jia Zhen tried to slip away, but Third Sister blocked him. Now Jia Zhen regretted getting involved. This fiery woman was no ordinary plaything, and he could no longer be frivolous around her. Third Sister proceeded to remove her ornaments and outer clothes. She gathered her hair loosely and wore only a red jacket, half open, deliberately revealing a bright green bodice and a glimpse of snowy skin below. She wore green trousers and red shoes, dazzling in contrast. She moved about, now laughing, now raging, utterly unladylike. Her dangling earrings swung like children on a swing. Under the lamplight, her willow brows appeared darker, her lips redder. Her eyes sparkled like autumn waters, and with a few more cups in her, they gleamed even more bewitchingly. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, both enthralled and terrified, didn’t dare approach yet couldn’t bear to leave, entranced and left gaping. To make matters worse, her scathing talk pinned them down. Both men, for once, had no witty repartee. She prattled away with coarse banter, openly mocking them until she’d had her fill of fun. Then, once she’d drunk her fill, she refused to let them stay longer, driving them out and bolting the door behind them. From that day forward, whenever Third Sister found them alone, she would curse Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong, calling them swindlers who preyed on a widow and her daughters. Jia Zhen, after that first debacle, didn’t dare come without reason. Sometimes, if she was in the mood, she would send a page to summon him; once he arrived, he could do nothing but sit there, gazing helplessly as she pleased. Reader, note that Third Sister You had a uniquely eccentric temperament. She was undeniably captivating and loved to dress in bold, striking styles unlike anyone else’s, displaying a charm that few men could resist. Even a stalwart veteran or a man of stone would be tempted. But as soon as they came near her, her wild and brash manner—showing no regard for others—would intimidate them. Hence, though Jia Zhen could do whatever he liked with Second Sister, he was increasingly obsessed with Third Sister. He was content to “give” Second Sister to Jia Lian and focus on pursuing Third Sister himself. Yet Third Sister might sometimes banter with him, but she maintained an imposing presence that kept him from trying anything. Her mother and Second Sister tried to talk sense into her, but she scoffed, “Silly women! Our exceptional beauty is being sullied by these fools. Besides, that family has a vicious wife. Sure, we’re keeping things hidden for now, but when she finds out, do you think she’ll let it go? That’s bound to end in a huge scandal, and who knows which of us might live or die? How can you treat this as some comfortable refuge?” Seeing her so determined, they gave up. Day after day, Third Sister demanded fancy clothes and adornments: if she had something in silver, she’d want gold; if she had pearls, she’d want gemstones. She’d eat a fat goose and next demand a fat duck. If anything disappointed her, she’d shove over the entire table; if a garment wasn’t to her liking—no matter how fine the silk or satin—she’d snip it to shreds, cursing as she tore it apart.
Chapter 51 At Lùxuě Ting, a Contest of Couplet Compositions on Immediate Scenery; At Nuanxiang Wu, an Elegant Gathering to Devise Spring Lamp Riddles  It happened that Baoqin announced that she had composed ten “reminiscent of antiquity” quatrains – each alluding subtly to ten classical objects – based on various historical sites she had visited in the provinces. All present marveled, exclaiming, “How innovative and clever! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing in the world is impossible to one who is determined.’ Our society will certainly make you a member!” Yet Xiangling, not fully convinced, suspected they were merely teasing her. She looked around for confirmation from Daiyu, Baochai, and the others. At that moment, several little maids and old servants rushed in, chattering and laughing, “A host of young ladies and mistresses have arrived! We scarcely recognize one another—hurry and introduce yourselves properly!” Li Wan laughed and inquired, “What exactly is meant? Explain clearly—whose relatives have come?” The maids and servants all burst into laughter and explained, “Grandmother’s two younger sisters are here; also present is a young lady said to be Miss Xue’s sister, and even a young man, purportedly Master Xue’s brother. I am now off to summon the concubine’s maid. Grandmother and the young ladies, please go upstairs first.” With that, they dispersed. Baochai teased, “Have our Xue Ke and his sister not come as well?” Li Wan laughed, “Or perhaps my aunt has come up to the capital? How is it that everyone seems to be gathered together? Truly a wondrous occurrence!”  Soon all assembled in Mrs. Wang’s upper room. The space was packed with a dark, pressing mass of people. Also, Mrs. Xing’s sister-in-law had arrived, bringing her daughter Xiuyan to be presented to Mrs. Xing. By chance, Fengjie’s brother Wang Ren was also on his way to the capital, and the two families had come to support one another. Along the way, they encountered the widowed Li Wan accompanied by her two daughters—one named Li Wen and the other Li Qi—and the families soon found themselves chatting as relatives; thus, the three households traveled together. Later, Xue Pan’s younger cousin, Xue Ke, who in his youth had been kept at the pawnshop (where his family had accumulated two or three thousand taels for a living), joined in as well, since he had heard that Wang Ren was arriving. All these relatives gathered, exchanging courtesies and greetings. Grandmother and Mrs. Wang were exceedingly pleased. Grandmother laughed, “No wonder last night the lanterns burst and reassembled again and again – it was all meant to culminate today!” While chatting about family affairs and accepting the gifts brought along, she also ordered that wine and food be kept on hand. Fengjie, needless to say, was busily occupied. Li Wan and Baochai exchanged heartfelt farewells with their kin, while Daiyu, though initially happy, soon recalled that everyone had relatives while she was all alone—and tears welled in her eyes. Bao Yu, knowing her heart, consoled her at length. Later, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard and, with a teasing smile, announced to Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen: “Hurry along and go have a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’ Bao’s own dear kin should appear thus? Her uncles and brothers behave in such a peculiar manner—as if they were her true siblings. And while you always praise our stunning sister, now you see her with her two elder sisters! I find myself at a loss for words. Heaven above, how many brilliant and graceful souls there are! They say nothing is impossible for the determined – yet here, right in our midst, each one outshines the next. I feel I’ve learned something new today.” He chuckled to himself. Xiangren, sensing a mischievous glimmer in his tone, demurred from inspecting further. Qingwen and the others had already gone out and returned with laughter, teasing, “Look at that—a niece of the head of the household, a sister of Miss Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister – all gathered together like a neat row of slender scallions!”  Before they had finished, Tan Chun entered laughing, “Our poetry society is flourishing!” Bao Yu replied, “Indeed.
The two women peered inside: it was filled with brushes, ink, paper, inkstones, various stationery, scented sachets, beads, fans, fan pendants, face powder, rouge, and so on. There were also figurines from Tiger Hill, game tokens for drinking contests, little golden mock-fight toys filled with mercury, sand lamps, and sets of clay opera figurines encased in green gauze-topped boxes. One of them was a clay statue of Xue Pan himself, molded on Tiger Hill, looking exactly like him. Baochai was uninterested in most items, but on seeing her brother’s figurine, she picked it up for a closer look, then glanced at Xue Pan and couldn’t help laughing. She told Ying’er to have some old women carry the chests and items into the garden. After another round of small talk with her mother and brother, she returned there herself. Madam Xue took out and carefully sorted her share of the chest’s contents, then instructed Tongxi to deliver gifts to Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, and the others. Once Baochai was back in her own room, she scrutinized every novelty, picked out the items she wanted to keep, and then grouped the rest accordingly: sets of brushes and inks; sachets, fans, and pendants; cosmetics and hair oil; and single sets of toys. She made a special, larger bundle for Lin Daiyu. Once everything was organized, she instructed Ying’er and an older maid to deliver them to each recipient. The young ladies all received their gifts, rewarded the messengers, and said they would thank Baochai in person later. Only Daiyu, on seeing those items from her homeland, was overcome with grief. She thought, “My parents have died; I have no brothers. I live in the house of relatives, with no one to bring me tokens of home.” That thought left her tearful. Zijuan, understanding Daiyu’s temperament, did not pry, only whispered comforting words: “Miss, you’re already weak and taking medicine all day. You seemed a bit better these past couple of days—though not truly well. Now Miss Bao has sent these gifts, which shows that she values you. You should be pleased. There’s no need to let it distress you. If Miss Bao heard how upset you are, she’d feel uneasy, too. Furthermore, all the older ladies are doing their utmost to find good doctors and prescriptions for you. If you let sadness drag you down, you’ll only harm yourself further and increase their worries. Your illness comes from excess worry. Your precious health shouldn’t be taken lightly.”  As Zijuan was comforting her, a young maid outside called, “Second Master Bao is here!” Zijuan said, “Have him come in.” Baoyu entered the room, and Daiyu had him take a seat. Seeing her tear-stained face, he asked, “Who upset you this time?” Daiyu forced a smile. “There’s no quarrel.” Zijuan glanced toward a table behind the bed. Baoyu followed her look and noticed the pile of gifts, suspecting they were from Baochai. He playfully said, “Where did these things come from? Don’t tell me you’re opening a shop?” Daiyu made no reply. Zijuan, smiling, chimed in, “Second Master, please—these items that Miss Bao just sent have made my mistress sad instead of happy. I was just trying to comfort her. Maybe you can help?” Baoyu knew perfectly well why Daiyu was upset, but he did not dare say so. Instead, he said jokingly, “There can be only one reason your mistress is upset: Miss Bao must not have given her enough, so she’s sulking. Don’t worry, Sister; next year I’ll send someone to the south and have them bring you two full boatloads, so you won’t need to weep like this.” Daiyu knew he was teasing her to cheer her up. She could neither reject him nor follow along too readily, so she said, “Even if I’d never seen the world, I wouldn’t sulk over some insufficient gifts. I’m not a toddler. It’s insulting to think I’d be upset over that. I have my own reasons, which you wouldn’t understand.” At that, tears welled up again. Quickly, Baoyu sat down beside her, picked up the objects one by one, pretending to examine them closely: “What’s this called?
Moreover, Aunt Zhao’s nagging – I even heard her say you never know how to live properly and have no regard for fortune. When Aunt Zhao sees this, she’ll never stop talking!” Xiangling, struck by his words, found herself oddly pleased. She laughed and said, “That’s exactly right. I have several new skirts, but none that suit me; if I had one that did, I’d just change into it.” Baoyu said, “Stop fidgeting – just stand still, or else your undergarments, knee covers, and shoes will all get muddied. I have an idea: Sister Xiren made a skirt exactly like this last month; since she was filial she never wore it, and she even gave it to you in exchange – how about that?” Xiangling laughed and shook her head, “No, if they find out, it won’t do.” Baoyu replied, “What’s there to fear? Once she’s full of filial piety, won’t she let you give her something else? If you do that, you won’t be seen as you once were. Besides, it’s not a secret matter – you might as well tell Sister Baoqin. I’m just worried that Aunt Zhao might get angry.” Xiangling thought for a moment, then nodded with a smile, “That will do. Just promise me she personally delivers it!” Baoyu, delighted, quickly agreed and hurried back. Inwardly he mused, “What a pity that such a person – orphaned, having even forgotten her own surname, abducted and sold to this tyrant – should exist!” He also recalled, “Earlier, even Ping’er was an unexpected case, but today is an unexpected twist beyond twists.” As his thoughts whirled, he returned to his room and called Xiren, recounting the matter in detail. Xiangling, beloved by all and so gentle by nature, was adored by everyone; and Xiren – a naturally carefree spirit – being close to Xiangling, upon hearing the news immediately opened a chest, folded it neatly, and accompanied Baoyu to find Xiangling. Finding her still waiting, Xiren teased, “I told you you were too mischievous – you always have to stir up some story!” Xiangling blushed and thanked her sister, “Thank you, Sister – who would have known that the conniving little devil was so black-hearted?” She then took off her skirt, examined it, and indeed found it exactly as it had been before. She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Take this soiled skirt to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you’ll ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister – take it, and do not give it to that other girl. I’m done with it.” Xiren replied, “You are most generous.” Xiangling then knelt twice in thanks before Xiren took the muddy skirt away. Later, Xiangling noticed Baoyu squatting by a spot where he had dug a small pit with a twig, collected fallen blossoms to line it, placed the lotus and ‘Hui’ flowers in position, then covered them with soil to press them flat. Xiangling grasped his hand and laughed, “What are you doing? It seems everyone says you’re a sly little sneak who likes to make people feel awkward. Look at your hands – so muddy and slimy with moss; you’d best wash them.” Baoyu laughed and rose to go wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called out to Baoyu. Uncertain what she wished to say, with his two muddy hands, he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply and only laughed, her lips parting as if to speak but failing to find the words. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face turned even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just don’t mention this skirt matter to your brother – that’s all.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? Stepping my head into the lion’s den, I am!” He then returned to his room.
Use your silver to return home—there are plenty of suitable matches out there.” Zhang Hua, after deliberation and consultation with his parents, agreed. Fengjie then returned, agitated, to Grandmother Jia and declared, “It is all because Sister You did not cancel the engagement properly—now complaints have been filed, and the officials are involved! This could become a scandal!” Grandmother Jia immediately summoned Second Sister You and asked, “Since your childhood betrothal was never formally dissolved and now someone has complained—what is all this about?” Second Sister You replied, “They even collected the silver—but it was never finalized.” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now claims he saw neither silver nor anyone removing him; yet his father insists our relatives once agreed, but then reneged when the relative died. With no definitive proof, we must allow him to argue his case. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the matter is public, how can we send him back without losing face?” Grandmother Jia mused, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived of a spouse, our honor remains intact. Who would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother paid him twenty taels on a certain day to cancel the betrothal, but he, in desperation, retracted his promise. My sister was faultless.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible minions are hard to deal with. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” At her wit’s end, Fengjie again sent for Jia Huan. Jia Huan, knowing all too well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim, it would bring further disgrace upon the family. He returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why must you insist on reclaiming your arranged match? If you persist, our elders may become so incensed that you will have nowhere to turn. Use your silver to return home—any decent match can be found.” Zhang Hua, after much thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Soon, with a hundred taels arranged, he and his father departed for their native home at dawn. Later that evening, Fengjie went to Grandmother Jia and recounted everything, lamenting that it was all due to Sister You’s mishandling of the cancellation. Grandmother Jia then summoned Second Sister You and inquired, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now there is a complaint—what does it mean?” Second Sister You replied, “They even took the silver—but nothing was formalized.” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now insists he saw neither the silver nor anyone removing him, while his father maintains that our relatives once agreed and then reneged when the relative died. Without conclusive evidence, we must let him have it his way. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that it’s public, how can we send him away without dishonor?” Grandmother Jia declared, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our reputation remains unblemished. Who then would dare to oppose us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother, on a certain day, paid him twenty taels to cancel the engagement, yet in desperation he retracted his promise. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “It appears that managing unruly minions is truly a challenge. Feng’er, please see that this matter is properly resolved.” Unable to reach a satisfactory resolution, Fengjie turned once more to Jia Huan. Jia Huan, fully aware of Fengjie’s intentions, feared that if Zhang Hua were permitted to resume his claim it would bring shame upon the family. He returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have ample silver, why insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk inciting our elders’ wrath—use your silver to return home; any decent match can be found.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Later that evening, Fengjie, distressed, went to Grandmother Jia and said, “It is all because Sister You failed to cancel the engagement properly—now complaints have been filed and the officials are involved!
Though a daughter, she was not one to feign shyness or behave affectedly. Baochai, since that day, had noted her, partly out of sympathy for her poor family background; besides, while other parents were of advanced age and of refined character, her own parents were as if steeped in wine—and Lady Xing was interested more in appearances than genuine affection. Moreover, Xiuyan was modest, and Yingchun was a simple, honest girl. Even though Xiuyan herself was not fully managed by her own household, she never complained. In secret, Baochai always discreetly helped her, not daring to let Lady Xing know, for fear of idle gossip. Yet now the unexpected, fortunate match had come about. In her heart Xiuyan already held Baochai in high regard; at times she would chat lightly with Baochai, and Baochai would call her “little sister.”  That day, Baochai went to see Daiyu and happened to encounter Xiuyan on the way. Baochai smiled and called her over; the two walked together. Reaching a stone wall, Baochai teased, “It’s so cold today—why are you wearing a different kind of waistcoat?” Xiuyan, caught off guard, lowered her head and gave no reply. Baochai immediately sensed that something must be amiss, and asked with a smile, “Surely it must be that your monthly allowance has fallen short again—now even Sister Feng has no ideas?”  Xiuyan replied, “He intended to give a good sum on a proper day. My aunt sent word that we need not use more than two taels per month, and to set aside one tael for our parents—after all, among the things you receive, even the items for your two elder sisters must be enough. Sister, you know that our second sister is so honest she never pays close attention. Though I am in the household, I dare not be too demanding of them. In a few days I’ll have to put out some money to treat them to wine and snacks. Thus, two taels a month are not enough. And now they have taken away an extra tael—in fact, just the other day I secretly had my cotton garments valued at a few taels as travel expenses.”  Baochai listened and sighed in distress, “But the Mei family is also residing here, and they are not arriving until the year after next. If things were as they were before, we could have discussed your matter further—but without her here, it’s over. Now, not only can her sister’s matter not be settled, but you dare not marry first either. This is truly a predicament. If we delay another two years, I fear you will suffer so much that you may fall ill again. Let me discuss it further with mother.”  Baochai then pointed to a jade pendant on Xiuyan’s skirt and asked, “Who gave you that?”  Xiuyan answered, “It was given by Third Sister.”  Baochai nodded, “I noticed everyone has one except you—perhaps she feared you’d be teased, so she sent you one. That shows her thoughtful attention to detail.”  Xiuyan then asked, “Sister, where are you headed now?”  Baochai replied, “I’m off to the Xiangxiang Chamber. You go back and have your maid bring me that little token; I’ll take it out secretly and send it to you later tonight so you can wear it—otherwise, you’ll catch a chill from the wind! But I don’t know where it is kept?”  Xiuyan said, “It’s called Hengshu, and it’s on West Gulou Street.”  Baochai laughed, “That places it in one family’s possession altogether. Should the servants get wind of it, they might say, ‘She isn’t here yet, but her clothes have already arrived!’”  At this, Xiuyan, understanding it was part of her own household’s funds, blushed, smiled, and walked away. Baochai then herself went to the Xiangxiang Chamber. At that moment her own mother was visiting Daiyu, chatting idly. Baochai laughed, “Mother, you came so early—why didn’t I know?”  Aunt Xue replied, “I’ve been so busy these days that I haven’t been able to see Baoyu and the others; so today I came to see both of them.
For example, when a man’s wife dies and he remarries, he does not speak of the deceased—that is the mark of deep affection.’ Don’t you think he’s foolish?”  Baoyu, hearing this absurd talk, could only laugh at its silliness—feeling both joy and sorrow, marveling at the strangeness of it all. Grasping the Flower Official’s hand, he earnestly cautioned, “Since you say so, let me tell you one thing—you must never burn paper offerings again. When the appropriate season comes, simply prepare a censer of incense and offer your heartfelt devotion, and that will be enough to invoke a response. On my desk I have only one censer, and I keep it burning regardless of the date—constantly replenishing it with fresh water, tea, even flowers and fruits, and sometimes even both meat and vegetables. It is all about sincerity rather than empty rituals. Promise me that you will never burn paper offerings again.” The Flower Official agreed. Soon after their meal, someone announced, “The Dowager has returned!” Chapter 59 By the Willowy Shore, the Leaves Scold the Oriole and Rebuke the Swallow; In the Crimson Cloud Pavilion, Officials Are Summoned to Dispatch Flying Talismans  It happened that when Baoyu learned that Grandmother Jia and the others had returned—with an extra garment added to his wardrobe and his walking stick in hand—he went forward and was greeted by everyone. Grandmother Jia and the others, exhausted by their daily labors, insisted on retiring early that night, and no further conversation was had. The next day at the fifth watch they again set out for court. Not long before the memorial rites, preparations were in full swing. The maidservants Yuanyang, Hupo, Feicui, and Borili were busily organizing Grandmother Jia’s belongings, while Yuchuan, Caiyun, and Caixia arranged items for Wang Xifeng. All in all, six maidservants and ten matronly attendants were in charge of the household affairs (men were not counted). For several days the coaches, sedan chairs, and all necessary implements were packed and prepared. Yuanyang and Yuchuan did not accompany the group; they stayed behind to see to the house. Meanwhile, a few days’ prior, some of the younger wives and several men were sent out by carriage to the lower quarters, where they carefully laid out tents and arrangements. On the appointed day, Grandmother Jia herself, accompanied by the wife of Jia Rong, rode in a sedan chair; Wang Xifeng followed in another sedan chair; Jia Zhen led the household men on horseback to guard the procession; and several large carts—with old maids and attendants aboard, as well as extra garments and parcels for change—were also dispatched. That very day, Aunt Xue and Lady You led their people straight to the outer gate and then returned. Fearing inconvenience along the road, Jia Lian sent his own parents ahead to catch up with Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng’s sedan chairs, and he himself followed later with the household men. In the Rong Mansion, Lai Da had arranged for his men to lock up the two main halls for the night. Everyone entering or leaving was forced to use the small west side gate; at sunset the main ceremonial gate was closed, and no one was allowed to come or go. In the garden, the east and west corner gates were similarly bolted—except for the door behind Wang Xifeng’s main room (through which her sisters could come and go) and the east gate leading to Aunt Xue’s quarters; these two, being in the inner courtyard, were left unlocked. Inside, Yuanyang and Yuchuan had already closed up the upper rooms and sent the maidservants and old women to the lower quarters for rest. Every day, the family of Lin Zhixiao sent about a dozen elderly maids to stand guard through the night, and additional young attendants were posted in the corridors to sound the watch; everything was arranged with meticulous order. At dawn one morning, Baochai—still drowsy from a lingering spring sleep—awoke and, drawing aside the curtain from her bed, felt a slight chill. When she opened the door, she found the courtyard glistening with a fresh, moist, mossy green, for a light drizzle had fallen at the early watch. She then called for Xiangyun and others to help her wash and groom. Xiangyun remarked that her cheeks were itching, fearful it might trigger her habitual “peach-blossom” eczema, and inquired if Baochai had any rosewater salve.
Aunt Xue remarked, “Heavens above – it doesn’t suit your little group. I feel so constrained; perhaps I should retire to the hall and lie down for a while. I can’t eat much nor drink heavily, so it would suit me better there.” But Aunt You and the others insisted otherwise. Baochai said, “That’s fine; let Mother relax a bit in the hall. If she loves food, we can send some over, and then she’ll be content. Besides, no one is outside to watch.” Tanchun laughed, “In that case, obedience is as good as compliance.” They then escorted her into the meeting hall where, after the young maids had spread out a splendid brocade mat with cushions, Tanchun ordered, “Do be sure to massage the legs for the Mistress. Provide tea and water without any fuss. Once you’ve delivered the gifts, have the Mistress eat and reward you – but don’t stray from here!” The little maids all agreed, and Tanchun and the others then departed. Eventually, Baoyu, Xiangyun, and the others sat down at a table: Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Ping’er sat at one table (with Baoyu facing east and Ping’er west); Tanchun then brought Yuanyang to sit by her side. At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was arranged for Aunt You, Li Wan, with Xiren and Caiyun accompanying. A final table was for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun suggested they exchange toasts. Baoqin and the other four remarked, “With all this fuss, we can’t possibly sit still all day!” They soon finished. Two of the girls were to perform a song for the birthday, while the others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes – go upstairs and cheer up the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue. Baoyu said, “A proper seated celebration is dull – it is better if we perform our rituals.” Some suggested one kind of ritual, others another. Daiyu remarked, “I say we write out all the various decrees on brush and ink, form lots, and whoever’s drawn shall be the one – that will settle it!” Everyone agreed, “Splendid!” They fetched a set of brush, ink, and floral stationery. Recently, Xiangling had been learning poetry and calligraphy, and when she saw the brush and ink she eagerly volunteered, “Let me write!” After some discussion, they ended up with about ten lots. One by one, Xiangling wrote out her lot. They then tossed the lots into a bottle, and Tanchun ordered Ping’er to draw one. Ping’er mixed them up with a stick and plucked one out. When she opened it, it bore the two characters “She Fu” (meaning “to play a guessing game”). Baochai laughed, “You’ve drawn out the old decree! ‘She Fu’ has been around since ancient times, though it has long since fallen into disuse. This one is especially obscure – half the group will not know it. It might as well be discarded, and we should draw a new lot that both refined and popular can appreciate.” Tanchun laughed, “Once it’s drawn, how can we destroy it? If we draw another and it turns out well, let them perform that one instead.” She then had Xiren draw another lot – which turned out to be “Mu Zhan” (meaning “thumb battle”). Xiangyun laughed first, “That is sharp and brisk – suits my taste perfectly. I cannot abide ‘She Fu’ – it leaves me with a heavy heart; I’d rather simply play rock–paper–scissors.” Tanchun replied, “If he messes up the decree, Sister Baoqin should give him a cup!” Baochai, not willing to let it pass, quickly poured a cup for Xiangyun. Tanchun then said, “I’ll have a cup myself – I am the official in charge of these decrees; no need for a formal announcement – just listen as I assign them.
Xiuyun, Baoyu, and the others tossed, but none matched until Xiangling threw a three. Baoqin laughed, “Only in a sheltered home could spring be born indoors – if we were to mention the outdoors, it would be too disorderly.” Tanchun said, “Naturally. Anyone who fails three times in a row shall be penalized with a cup. Now, you respond to my decree.” Baoqin thought a moment and pronounced the word “Old.” Xiangling, however, having grown up with these decrees, could not immediately think of one – the room was silent as no familiar idiom linked with “old” came to mind. Xiangyun scanned the room and suddenly noticed on the door a plaque with the characters “Hong Xiang Pu” (Red Fragrance Garden), and realized that Baoqin must have meant the “garden” radical. Seeing that Xiangling could not guess, the others gently pulled her aside and taught her to say “Yao” (medicine) instead. Daiyu, however, observed, “Hurry, punish her – so that the scandal doesn’t spread!” Amid the uproar, they ended up penalizing Xiangling with a cup. Later, Baochai and Tanchun exchanged lots; Tanchun then drew the character “Ren” (person). Baochai laughed, “That character is too generic.” Tanchun replied, “If we add another, and then the two lots combine, it won’t be generic any longer.” She then declared another lot: “Chuang” (window). Baochai, upon reflecting, noticed that since there were chickens at the table, perhaps he was alluding to the famous idiom “Ji Chuang, Ji Ren” (the chicken window, the chicken person) – and he guessed “Shi” (a word meaning “threshold”). Tanchun, realizing his guess, smiled and took a sip from her cup. Soon Xiangyun and the others began playing an impromptu guessing game with fists. Outside, Aunt You and Yuanyang, separated by a table, began their own game, calling out numbers and gestures. Ping’er and Xiren paired up as well. The clinking of bracelets filled the air. Before long, Xiangyun won over Baoyu; Xiren bested Ping’er; and the rounds of drinking and toasting continued. Xiangyun then said, “The verse above must be recited – one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one from a domino name, one from a tune title, and one from a state decree – altogether forming a verse. And the drink’s toast must include the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so tiresome to recite! Still, it has a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed and said, “Who ever said that? Let me think for a moment…” Daiyu then interjected, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and listening, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies in company with the solitary falcon; The fierce wind sweeps the river and the sky, and geese cry in sorrow— Yet even a single fallen goose wing can break one’s stride, Stirring one’s heart time and again; such is the welcome of a wild goose.” Everyone laughed at the clever verse, exclaiming, “That string of lines is rather amusing indeed!” Daiyu then plucked a hazelnut kernel and recited as the toast:  “Hazelnuts, not from the distant courtyard’s mortar, Yet how come there are not the sound of a thousand households pounding clothes?” Thus the decree round was finished. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others all recited a well-known saying about “longevity,” each including the word “longevity” in their version, with no further elaboration. After some time, they took turns playing a rousing game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng absent, no one kept strict order – and everyone took their pleasure freely, shouting and calling out. The hall burst with red and green hues, with jade glinting and pearls rattling – it was an exceedingly lively scene. After a while, the group rose and dispersed. Suddenly, however, Xiangyun was nowhere to be seen.
Though the snow may never melt, tonight’s snowfall is plenty to admire.” She then proposed that each person contribute one or two taels of silver for the festivities, pointing to Xiangling, Baoqin, Li Wen, Li Qi, and Xiuyan, adding, “Not counting the two who are ill or on leave, if you all contribute your share, I guarantee that five or six taels in all will suffice.” Baochai and the others all agreed. Li Wan then said with a smile, “I’ve already decided in my heart. Tomorrow, when the time comes, we’ll see.” After some more idle chatter, they went to see Grandmother. That day, there was little more to say. The next morning, at dawn, Bao Yu—still troubled by a sleepless night—rose early. When he lifted the curtains expecting sunlight, he was astonished to see not the bright rays but a thick blanket of snow nearly a foot deep, swirling in the air like soft cotton. Overjoyed, he called his attendants. After quickly washing up, he dressed in an eggplant-colored wool coat trimmed with fox fur, over which he donned a “Sea-Dragon” jacket; he cinched his waist, then put on a jade-needle raincoat and a golden-tasseled hat. Wearing newly acquired tangwood clogs, he hurried off toward Lùxuě Ting. Stepping out of the courtyard, he looked around and saw only dark green pines and bamboo in the distance, as if he were enclosed in a glass bowl. Soon he reached the foot of a hill and, turning a corner, caught a crisp fragrance. Glancing back, he discovered that at Miaoyu’s Lóngcuì Nunnery, a dozen red plum blossoms—vivid as rouge against the snow—drew his eye with their spirited charm. Bao Yu paused to admire them before continuing. On a narrow bridge, he encountered someone with an umbrella—sent by Li Wan to fetch Fengjie. Bao Yu then proceeded to Lùxuě Ting, where he saw maids and old women busily clearing the snow and paving a path. The Lùxuě Ting was built on a riverside sandbank beneath a hillside, with several modest thatched structures, bamboo windows, and open thresholds from which one might fish; a winding path led through the reeds to the bamboo bridge of Lǒu Xiāng Xiè. The maids and old women, upon seeing Bao Yu in his raincoat and hat, laughed, “We were just saying we’re short one fisherman—and now he’s arrived!” Bao Yu, hearing this, had no choice but to retreat indoors. Shortly thereafter, Tan Chun emerged from Qiūshuǎng Zhai, draped in a large red cloak of orangish hue, carrying a small purse for Guanyin and supporting a little maid; behind him, a woman held a blue satin oil umbrella. Bao Yu, knowing Tan Chun was on his way to see Grandmother, waited by a pavilion until Tan Chun arrived, and then the two set out together toward the estate. Meanwhile, Baoqin was in her inner chamber, busy washing and changing. Soon all the sisters gathered, and Bao Yu began complaining about hunger, urging for food repeatedly. At long last the meal was served—the first dish being steamed lamb with milk—and Grandmother declared, “These are medicinal dishes meant for the elders; the young should not partake. Today, however, we have fresh venison instead—just wait and see.” The others assented, but Bao Yu, too impatient to wait, only sipped a bowl of rice-tea and nibbled on wild seeds before hastily finishing his meal. Grandmother remarked, “I see you’re preoccupied with other matters if you can’t even eat properly. Save the venison for your evening meal.” Fengjie quickly added, “That is fine—if there is any left, so be it.”  Xiangyun then proposed to Bao Yu, “Since there is fresh venison, why don’t we take a portion for ourselves—retrieve it from the garden and enjoy it together?” Bao Yu wholeheartedly agreed and ordered a matron to have the meat brought into the garden. After the meal, everyone dispersed and later reconvened in the garden near Lùxuě Ting, where Li Wan initiated a challenge by proposing an impromptu composition contest. Only Bao Yu and Xiangyun were absent.
In the entire household, except for the Old Lady and the Mistress, everyone dislikes Madam—only they put up a front. She sees no one as her equal, currying favor solely with the Old Lady and Mistress. Whatever she says is taken as fact; no one dares oppose her. She’s obsessed with hoarding money, trying to pile it up to impress the Old Lady and Mistress with her thrift. We underlings suffer for her ambition. Whenever there’s merit to be claimed, she rushes in first. If something goes wrong, or if it’s her own fault, she ducks away, shifting blame onto others and fanning the flames from the side. Even her own mother-in-law finds her irritating, calling her ‘the sparrow that always flies to the hottest spot’ and ‘the black hen that lays a whole nest of trouble,’ minding other people’s business instead of her own. If not for the Old Lady’s protection, she’d have been reined in long ago.”  Second Sister teased, “If you can speak of her like this behind her back, imagine what you might say about me someday. I’m even lower than she is, so you’ll have even more to say.” Alarmed, Xing’er knelt and cried, “Madam, if I slander you, may lightning strike me dead! If I’d been so fortunate that our Second Master had married someone like you, we’d have suffered far fewer beatings and scoldings and lived without so much anxiety. Now everyone who serves Second Master praises your kindness, saying they’d rather come serve you if Second Master moves out. We all hope for that day.”  Second Sister laughed, “You sly scamp! Get up. I was only joking. So you all stop by here sometimes, but I might just pay Lady Feng a visit.” Xing’er waved his hands emphatically, “Madam, you mustn’t! Let me warn you: it’d be better never to meet her at all. She’s all honeyed words and cruel intentions, two-faced and double-tongued—smiling at you but tripping you from behind, bright as a basin of fire while hiding a knife underneath. I doubt even Third Sister could match her in a quarrel. You’re gentle by nature—no match for her cunning.” Second Sister answered, “I would treat her with reason. Would she dare harm me?” Xing’er said, “Forgive my bluntness, I’ve had a bit too much wine. Even if you humble yourself before her, do you think she’d let you off easily, seeing you’re lovelier and more beloved than she is? She’s the queen of jealousy. If Second Master so much as glances at a maid, she’ll smash someone’s head on the spot. And though Ping Girl also belongs to her household, they’re together only once or twice a year, and Lady Feng still finds ten ways to complain. Ping Girl often ends up in tears, protesting, ‘I didn’t choose to be here; it was forced on me. If I don’t obey, I’m accused of rebellion; if I do, I’m still in trouble.’ Even so, Lady Feng needs Ping Girl’s help.”  Second Sister laughed, “I see. But I’ve heard you also have a young widow as well as several young ladies in your family. Are they not formidable enough to stand up to Lady Feng?” Xing’er clapped and laughed, “Ah, you don’t know, Madam. The widow you mention is the kindest soul alive. She doesn’t interfere in anything, just teaches the young ladies reading, writing, and needlework. A while back, when she briefly took charge due to an illness in the house, she followed the established rules without showing off. Our eldest girl is wonderful. Second Miss is nicknamed ‘Second Wood-Head.’ Third Miss is nicknamed ‘Rosebud’—so red and fragrant that everyone loves her, but she has thorns. Sadly, she’s not the Mistress’s own daughter, more like a phoenix hatched in a crow’s nest. Fourth Miss, still young, is actually Master Zhen’s sister, raised by our Mistress. She doesn’t meddle, either. Then there are two young ladies from outside our immediate household, truly unmatched in beauty and learning.
She inquired into his age and his family situation. Aunt Xue, reading his mind, guessed he was to be matched. However, having already promised him to the Mei family and with Grandmother Jia’s plans not yet clearly stated, she half-disclosed to Grandmother Jia, “It’s a pity this child has no fortune—his father passed away the year before last. Though he has seen much of the world from a young age—traveling to mountains and rivers with his father—his father, being fond of pleasure and engaged in trade, would travel with the family for a year in one province and then half a year in another. In all, out of ten journeys, there were five or six stops. That very year, he was betrothed to the son of the Mei Hanlin, yet the very next year his father died. Now, his mother suffers from a chronic phlegm illness.”  Before Aunt Xue could finish, Lady Phoenix stamped her foot and declared, “What a misfortune—I was just about to act as a matchmaker, but he is already promised to someone!”  Grandmother Jia laughed, “Who are you planning to match him with?”  Lady Phoenix replied with a smile, “Our Grand Matriarch need not be concerned. I have my eye on them—they are clearly meant for each other. Now that he’s spoken for, there’s no point discussing it further.”  Grandmother Jia, understanding Lady Phoenix’s meaning, upon hearing that someone had been chosen, dropped the matter. After more idle chatter, the gathering eventually dispersed, and the night passed in quiet. The next day the snow had cleared. After the meal, Grandmother Jia again instructed Xiangyun, “Regardless of the cold, you must resume your painting; hurry and finish it by New Year—even if it isn’t perfect, do not err.”  Xiangyun, though troubled by the task, agreed. In no time did everyone gather to see how her painting would proceed. Xiangyun, however, seemed lost in thought. Li Wan smiled at the gathering and said, “Let her muse in peace; in our discussion yesterday when the Grand Matriarch only mentioned lantern riddles, back at home when Qi’er and Wen’er couldn’t sleep, I composed two verses on the ‘Four Books.’ Each of them also composed two.”  Everyone laughed, “That is exactly what should be done. Now then, let’s guess them!”  Li Wan laughed, “‘Guanyin has no family pedigree in the world’—this is one verse on the ‘Four Books.’”  Xiangyun promptly said, “It must be ‘The way ends in utmost goodness.’”  Baochai smiled, “Think a bit about what ‘family pedigree’ might mean.”  Li Wan urged, “Think again.”  Daiyu laughed, “I’ll take a guess. Perhaps, ‘Though kind, none are verified?’”  Everyone laughed, “That’s it!”  Li Wan continued, “‘A pond of green grass—what is its name?’”  Xiangyun quickly added, “It must be ‘Pampas, of course; there is no alternative!’”  Li Wan smiled, “That one’s a stumper for you. And Wen’er’s riddle is, ‘Water flows from a stone’s edge, cold and clear’—it hints at an ancient name.”  Tan Chun, laughing, asked, “Is it ‘Shantao’?”  Li Wan replied, “Yes, it is.”  Li Wan then said, “And Qi’er’s is a single character, ‘Ying’—guess which one?”  After much guessing, Baoqin ventured, “Could it be the character for ‘flower’ as in blossoms?”  Li Qi laughed, “That’s exactly right.”  Everyone queried, “But what does ‘Ying’ have to do with ‘flower’?”  Daiyu smiled, “How clever—‘Ying’ can mean a transformed plant, not merely an insect’s glow!”  All understood and laughed, saying, “Splendid!”  Baochai remarked, “Although these are all fine, they do not suit the Grand Matriarch’s taste.
I haven’t even burnt the water for washing my face—what’s there to be upset about?” The old matron’s rebuke was not in jest; she would not tolerate any insolence. Jingwen then admonished her, “Madam, let this be. You cannot meddle in the children’s affairs all the time! Even if you beat them, you end up embarrassing yourself. They are not even your own; they belong to their mothers!” The assembled young women joked, “Who do you think you’re talking about? The one in question is our own Second Lady’s servant, Ping’er. If she speaks a few kind words, but if she turns sour, you’ll have no one to blame but yourself.” They laughed, and one of them remarked, “He’s a scoundrel—if you say a word to him, he’ll turn his face on you. You won’t be able to handle it.” Just then a little maid returned, saying, “Ping’er is currently busy; she asked what you need, and I told her. She said to first expel that fellow and then to instruct Lin Dajiang to administer forty strokes at the corner gate.” At these words the old matron burst into tears and pleaded with Xiren and the others, “I’ve worked so hard to come in here—remember, I am a widow from a humble home, with no malice in my heart, always faithfully serving the young ladies. If I am forced out, who knows what fate awaits me!” Xiren, softened by her words, scolded, “You are in our midst, yet you fail to follow proper order. How can we have someone as unruly as you? Constant bickering only brings ridicule.” Qingwen then added, “Who cares what he does? I say send him away and be done with it—why must you argue over every little word?” The old matron, now red-faced and resentful, could only sigh. Not long after, the Flower Official finished blowing on his soup. Baoyu said, “Now taste it—does it suit you?” The Flower Official, playing coy, smiled at Xiren and the others. Xiren urged, “Why not have a sip?” Jingwen then declared, “Watch me,” and took a sip herself. The Flower Official followed suit, saying, “It’s good.” He then passed the bowl to Baoyu, who drank half a bowl, ate a few slices of bamboo shoot, and half a bowl of porridge before finishing. The servants then cleared the table. The little maids washed their basins and rinsed up, and Xiren and the others went off to dine. Baoyu exchanged a knowing glance with the Flower Official; being clever and having studied the dramatic arts for years, he knew full well what was meant. So he feigned a stomach ache and refused to eat. Xiren said, “If you won’t eat, then stay inside for company. Leave the porridge; if you get hungry later, you can have some.” With that, she departed. Later, Baoyu recounted in detail what he had witnessed earlier with Lotus Officer—how he had fabricated lies to cover for him and how Lotus Officer had said, “Ask on my behalf.” Baoyu then asked, “For whom exactly were these offerings being burned?” The Flower Official, his eyes reddening and sighing deeply, explained, “He was offering sacrifices for the deceased Medicine Official.” Baoyu replied, “They were friends—this is only natural.” The Flower Official continued, “Friends? What sort of friends are those? They were nothing more than foolish notions. He, a young ‘sheng’ (male role), and the Medicine Official, a little ‘dan’ (female role), used to perform together and feign such intimacy on stage that over time they began to act as though they truly loved one another. When the Medicine Official died, he wept inconsolably and has not forgotten to this day—thus he burns paper offerings at every festival. Later, when Ru Official was added to the mix, and we saw him acting in a similar fashion, we asked, ‘Why, when you gain something new, do you cast aside the old?’ He replied, ‘It is not that I have forgotten. For instance, when a man remarries after his wife dies, he does not speak ill of his late wife—that, too, is an expression of deep affection.’ Don’t you think such foolishness is quite something?” Baoyu, hearing these absurd words, could only laugh at the silliness—feeling both joy and sorrow, marveling at their strangeness.
Now that we must appear together before the officials to clear our names, let’s all invite our kin and show them; then, if you issue me a letter of dismissal, I’ll leave immediately!” Amid her tears, Fengjie continued, “Sister, please understand my plight. I have arranged everything so that we, as sisters living together in harmony, can advise Second Master and manage affairs with care. If you were to live outside while I remain inside, how could I possibly bear it? And if outsiders were to hear, our reputations would be sullied—not only mine but yours as well. Second Master’s reputation is paramount; our squabbles over trifles are insignificant. As for the idle chatter of servants, it is natural—they say I run the household too strictly and then, behind my back, they add their own criticisms. Just imagine: if I were truly intolerable, how could I ever remain unchallenged in this household? If Second Master were to secretly marry a woman outside, I would never willingly go, and if Ping’er says so, I even advised Second Master to take her in. It is all too much for the gods to bear that such small people suffer because of my strict management, so that I become the scapegoat for their misdeeds!” Fengjie then burst into an outpouring of grief, wailing and pleading with Lady You to accompany her to the officials. Jia Huan, already on his knees, begged, “Aunt, please calm your anger!” Fengjie then scolded Jia Huan fiercely, “You wretched little brat! Don’t you know how high the heavens are and how deep the earth is? Every day you meddle and stir up trouble, leaving our family shamed and our fortunes ruined. Your own mother’s spirit, even in death, would not condone this, and our ancestors would not stand for it! Yet you persist—and I am at a loss! What have you done to deserve this? Are you so heartless as to contrive such misdeeds?” Jia Huan, on his knees, pleaded, “Aunt, please do not let your anger burst forth. I am but a foolish boy; if I cause even a little trouble, may you punish me harshly—but please, do not let it ruin our family’s honor!” He then began to beat himself with his own hand in remorse. The women around started laughing and urging him on, though none dared openly laugh. Fengjie then collapsed into Lady You’s arms, crying loudly and lamenting that even though she had not forced any marriage on him, he had still borne the disgrace. She declared, “If you send your brothers to marry, I am not angry—but why must you disobey our instructions and bear such disgrace? If we go to the officials, we will avoid the constabulary. Moreover, if we merely meet our kin, and I, being neither virtuous nor able to afford a concubine, receive nothing but a letter of dismissal, I would leave at once! I have personally taken in your sister to our household, fearing that Grandmother and Wang Xifeng would be upset if she returned. Now, with lavish feasts and an abundance of servants in our garden, I am forced to rearrange my quarters—all because I must maintain order. I never intended for such discord, but small-minded people have now caused trouble. I don’t even know what has happened to you! I fear that if I were to complain, our family’s honor would be tarnished, and I might be forced to use some of our silver to settle accounts!” As she cried and raved, she clutched Lady You’s face and cursed Jia Huan relentlessly. At length, the concubines, maids, and wives knelt in a mass, pleading in unison, “Second Grandmother, you are most magnanimous. Although our own Grandmother has suffered, she has borne it long enough—remember how kindly she has always treated us! Please, spare us further humiliation.” They then brought tea, and Fengjie, after a bout of tears and scolding, wiped her eyes, combed her hair, and admonished Jia Huan, “Go fetch your father so I may question him face-to-face about our situation! I must learn the extent of our filial merits and your arranged marriage—this matter, I truly know nothing; let me learn so I may instruct you!” Jia Huan knelt and repeatedly kowtowed, saying, “I beg your pardon, Aunt—please punish me if you must; I will accept any reproof.
Otherwise, if they get away with it, it will appear as if I have no way of getting to the bottom of it. Even after everything is settled, they might continue their thieving ways without accountability.”  Xiren and the others laugh, “Exactly—we must leave a record!”  So Ping’er calls for the two of them and says, “Don’t worry—the culprit has been identified.”  Yuchuan asks first, “Where is the culprit?”  Ping’er replies, “He’s in the second lady’s room—ask him about his answers. I know in my heart that it wasn’t he who stole it; poor fellow was so frightened he admitted it all. Now, Brother Baoyu only wishes to acknowledge half of it. I intended to speak up, but the thief in question is a sister with whom I have long been close; yet the mistress is as ordinary as can be—and harming a good person’s reputation puts me in a difficult position. We must persuade Brother Baoyu to approve so that everyone remains untroubled. Otherwise, if we insist on pursuing it, she will surely become angry.”  Hearing this, Caiyun blushes and, overcome with shame, says, “Sister, you needn’t be blamed—indeed, I must accept responsibility.”  Xiren and Ping’er quickly add, “If you acknowledge it, then we won’t have to report it to Aunt Zhao; otherwise, if Second Sister hears, she will be incensed. It would be better if Brother Baoyu himself acknowledges it so that no one else will know of our involvement. Moreover, if anything happens, we can all claim no responsibility. Even if the entire house were given over to someone else, it would not concern us.”  Caiyun, after some thought, lowers her head and finally assents. Thus, all matters are settled. Ping’er then takes Caiyun, Yuchuan, and the Flower Official into the night-shift room. She also summons Wu’er and discreetly instructs her to say that the poria snow was given by the Flower Official. Wu’er, deeply grateful, accepts. Shortly thereafter, Ping’er brings them over to her own side, where she sees that the Lin household has already arrived with several young wives—enough to secure the situation. The Lin official then tells Ping’er, “This morning I escorted her in, but I was afraid no one would be there to attend to breakfast, so I temporarily sent Qin Xian’s woman to serve the young ladies’ meal.”  Ping’er asks, “Who is Qin Xian’s woman? I don’t know her well.”  The Lin official explains, “She’s the one on duty at the south corner at night—quiet by day, so the young ladies might not know her. She’s tall, with a lean, graceful figure and bright, clear eyes—the very picture of efficiency.”  Yuchuan exclaims, “That’s right! Sister, how could you forget? She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient. Now that everything is coming to light—and even the item lost in the mistress’s room the other day has found an owner—it was when Baoyu came over with those two rascals (the culprits) who, not being cautious, inadvertently caused a stir. They panicked, and in the end Baoyu found out and brought the items out to me. That poria snow, too, was obtained by Baoyu from outside; it has been given to many people—not only in the garden but also to the older maids for their relatives. Xiren, too, once gave some to a worthy person. Their private dealings are nothing new. The two baskets displayed in the meeting hall the other day were left intact—so how did they come to be mixed up? I will explain it to the mistress once I return.”  After saying this, Ping’er slips away to her boudoir and relates the matter in detail to Feng Xifeng. Feng Xifeng remarks, “Even so, Baoyu is the sort who, regardless of right or wrong, loves to take charge of every affair.
After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and some went outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each doing as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess while Baochai and Xiuyun watched. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled together under a cluster of flowers, speaking softly among themselves. Soon a member of the Lin household arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps to kowtow. Tanchun, having just lost a chess game and counting her losses—ending up with “two eyes” (a game term)—kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing for chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there for a long time, and only when he later turned to ask for tea did he notice the situation. He then pointed to the young wife and said,  “This is Cai’er – the mother of the little maid Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. She speaks rather poorly; I only overheard a few words, and she didn’t dare answer the young mistress. She had to be brought forward to speak.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just then, Grandmother was seen going toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It doesn’t matter if we don’t report it—I’ll mention it. In any case, let’s expel her for now and wait until the mistress returns to decide.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing beneath the flowers, remarked: Daiyu said, “Your third maid is such a well-behaved child. Even though she’s tasked with certain duties, she barely steps out. If only she were allowed a bit more freedom, she’d command respect in no time.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—when you were ill, she handled several matters for us. Now this garden is divided among different managers; even a stray blade of grass is accounted for. They’ve even trimmed some responsibilities, leaving room for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan meticulously—how can they not be shrewd?” Daiyu said, “That is best. Yet we are spending too much effort. Although I do not meddle in these affairs, when I have free moments I tally things up; if the outgoings exceed the incomings, sooner or later there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us are never short.” Daiyu, upon hearing this, turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of fresh tea, and asked, “Where are you off to? I see you two haven’t had tea in quite a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then brought the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I will pour more.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just a little rinse is enough.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is more than enough. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s gone.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed. Baoyu nudged him, “Don’t sleep—let’s go have some fun outside.
Besides, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four pieces of cream-filled pastry, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such food?” He mixed the soup with rice and ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then ate half a bowl of porridge before ceasing. Baoyu, upon smelling the food, thought it tasted even better than usual, and so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found very fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the remaining items. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it isn’t enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “No need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve already eaten enough; there’s no need for more.” She then stood by the table, finishing her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we have wine, I want two bowls’ worth.” Baoyu laughed, “So you like wine too? Then later, let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen drink well too, though they’re always too shy—but today, since we’re breaking our fast together, it’s fine.” Baoyu then remembered another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s affair. Please speak with the Liu family and insist that she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it and that will be the end of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is a proper matter indeed.” Spring Yan then called two little maids to come in to wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she washed up and went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part needs no further detail). Baoyu then went out and continued his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters. The Flower Official followed, carrying his fan. Just as they left the door, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set the meal; we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted what had happened earlier at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company – it would add to the festivities.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox—where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you arrange it without telling us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow, if we all leave and leave the Flower Official alone, that will be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you, you simply cannot go!” Qingwen replied, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—even though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will fix it? Don’t go on about it. I’m not fussing over you—if you never help out, then what? You’ve been gone for days, nearly risking your life, yet still you come back empty-handed—what’s the point? Speak up already! Why act so foolishly and smile at me? That won’t do.” Qingwen spat as she laughed. Soon everyone made their way into the hall. Aunt Xue also arrived; all the ladies sat down in order and began to dine.
In the grand Jia household, there are many members—aside from your immediate family, others have only one father and one mother; truly, among our clans there is no one else. When we first came here, Grandmother pitied your youth. Although you had uncles, a parent’s love was incomparable—so we were received for several years. When grown, you would naturally be sent back to the Lin family; you could never remain a Lin daughter in the Jia household forever. Even if the Lin family were impoverished, they are a family of scholars and would never stoop to having their kin care for relatives, lest they be ridiculed. So, whether it is early next spring or later in autumn, even if we do not send her back here, someone from the Lin family will surely come to fetch her. Just last night, the young mistress told me to remind you: all those childhood playthings that he once gave you must be gathered and returned to him; then he will settle his own account with you.”  At these words, it was as if a clanging thunder had sounded over Baoyu’s head. Huizi looked at him expectantly, but after a long silence he said nothing. Just as she was about to ask again, Qingwen arrived saying, “Grandmother has called for you.”  Huizi laughed, “She’s asking about the young mistress’s ailment—I told her all I knew, but he wouldn’t believe me; now you must take him away.” With that she went back to her room. Qingwen, noticing Baoyu’s vacant stare, a sheen of cold sweat on his brow, and his numb, trembling hands, quickly led him by the arm all the way to the Yihong Courtyard. When Xiren saw him in such a state, she grew frantic, saying, “The heat must have caught you in the wind! I don’t think you’re seriously ill, but—your eyes are so fixed, and drool is forming at the corner of your mouth…!” Before anyone could fully grasp what was happening, someone brought a pillow, and as soon as Baoyu lay down he fell asleep; when he was helped to sit up, he would drink tea, and so on. Everyone was in a tizzy but dared not return to Grandmother Jia until they sent for Aunt Li. Soon Aunt Li arrived, examined him for a while, asked a few questions (of which Baoyu offered no answers), then felt his pulse and pressed firmly on the philtrum until deep marks were left—yet Baoyu seemed not to feel a thing. Aunt Li simply said, “This is very serious!” and then cried out loudly, clutching her head. Distressed, Xiren pulled at her, “Please, sir, aren’t you frightened? Tell us what happened so we can inform Grandmother and the mistress. Why did you begin crying so?”  Aunt Li pounded on the bed and shook her pillow, exclaiming, “This is utterly useless! I’ve wasted a lifetime of worry!”  Xiren, knowing Aunt Li to be wise with age, had invited her to see Baoyu. Now, upon hearing her words and seeing his condition, she believed every word and began to cry as well. Qingwen then recounted the earlier events to Xiren. Upon hearing this, Xiren rushed over to the Xiangxiang Chamber, where Huizi was busy helping Daiyu take her medicine. Without pause, she approached Huizi and said, “What exactly did you say to our Baoyu? Look at him! If you go back to Grandmother now, I can’t help it!” Then she sat down. Daiyu suddenly noticed that Xiren’s face was filled with urgent anger and tear tracks, and her demeanor had changed so much that she couldn’t help but ask what had happened. After a moment’s pause, Xiren wept, “I don’t know what words you, Sister Huizi, said—but that dullard’s eyes have gone wide, his limbs have turned cold, and he won’t say a word. Even when Aunt Li pinched him, it didn’t hurt—he’s nearly half dead! Even his own mother says he’s useless, and now she’s bawling her eyes out! I’m afraid he may very well die this moment!”  At this, Daiyu, who had long since accepted that Aunt Li’s ways were ineffective, burst into a cry as she spat out all the medicine she had taken, her body trembling as if her very entrails were in uproar.
Miaoyue laughed, “So our Yingying has turned into a tortured matchmaker! And now she isn’t even dressed up—still the same as ever?” Jingwen then went over, helped wash his hair, wrung his towel dry, and styled his hair in a messy bun before ordering him to dress and come over here. Soon the kitchen maid came out and asked, “Dinner is ready—shall I serve it?” A little maid, having heard this, entered and asked Xiren. Xiren smiled, “They’ve been quarreling for a while; did you hear the bell a few times?” Jingwen said, “This confounded thing is at it again, tidying up.” Taking a watch, she said, “Just wait another half a bell’s time for tea.” The little maid scurried off. Miaoyue laughed, “Speaking of mischief, the Flower Official surely deserves a good beating—yesterday he fiddled with that pendant for ages until it broke.” As they spoke, they prepared the tableware. Soon a little maid carried a box in, and Jingwen and Miaoyue opened it to find, to everyone’s amusement, it contained four small tea sets. Jingwen laughed, “It’s ready, but where are the two plain dishes? How long must we stew on this porridge with pickled vegetables?” While setting the table, she noticed that in the box there was also a bowl of fresh ham and bamboo shoot soup, which she quickly placed before Baoyu. Baoyu took a sip and exclaimed, “What a fine soup!” Everyone laughed, “Goodness gracious! Not having tasted meat and fish for so many days, you’re drooling like this.” As they spoke, he picked up the bowl and gently blew on it. Noticing the Flower Official beside him, Baoyu passed the bowl over and said, “You should try a bit, but be careful not to get your spit all over it.” The Flower Official, taking his advice, blew on the soup a few times and was satisfied. His adoptive mother meanwhile stood outside with the meal; then she hurried back in, laughing, “He isn’t mature at all—if I wait for him to knock over his bowl, I must hurry to blow on it first.” As she spoke, she promptly took the bowl. Jingwen then shouted, “Hurry out! If he ends up smashing the bowl, you won’t be able to help! You shouldn’t be running inside here empty-handed!” She scolded the little maids, “You fools! He doesn’t know—if you all talk, soon half the place will be in chaos, and before you know it, you’ll have to take the blame!” The little maids replied, “We tried to chase him out, but he wouldn’t believe us. Now we’re being blamed for it—what’s the point? Do you really believe it? In some places, half of what you get is yours, and half is unreachable. Besides, if you run off to places we can’t reach, then again you’re meddling with things!” As they spoke, they pushed him out. Several old maids waiting by the steps, holding empty boxes, laughed as he came out, “Our mistress hasn’t even checked herself in the mirror before coming in!” The old maid, both angry and resentful, could only silently endure. After the Flower Official had blown on the soup a few times, Baoyu said, “Taste it—does it suit you?” The Flower Official, playing coy, smiled at Xiren and the others. Xiren said, “Why don’t you taste a bit?” Jingwen then said, “Watch me—” and took a sip. The Flower Official followed and said, “It’s good.” He then handed the bowl to Baoyu, drank half a bowl, ate a few slices of bamboo shoot, then half a bowl of porridge, and that was that. The servants then cleared the table. The little maids washed their basins and rinsed up, and Xiren and the others went to have their meal. Baoyu, giving a conspiratorial glance to the Flower Official, knew well enough—being clever and having studied the dramatic arts for several years—that nothing could be hidden. So he pretended to have a stomach ache and refused to eat. Xiren said, “Since you won’t eat, then stay in the room as company.
Wang Xifeng then called, “Wang’er!” He answered and came forward. She stared at him grimly for a good few moments before saying, “Well, Wang’er—very good indeed. Now go. If I hear the slightest whisper outside, it’s all on you.” Wang’er bowed and backed away. Wang Xifeng commanded, “Bring me tea!” The young maids, perceiving her mood, left her alone. Then Wang Xifeng quietly said to Ping’er, “Did you hear it all? This is just splendid!” Ping’er said nothing, just offering a cautious smile. The more Wang Xifeng thought, the angrier she got. She leaned on a pillow, staring into space. Suddenly her brow furrowed, as though struck by an idea, and she called Ping’er over. Ping’er came at once. Wang Xifeng said, “I’ve thought of a way to handle this, and I won’t wait for your master to return before deciding.”  How precisely Wang Xifeng will proceed remains to be seen in the next chapter. Chapter 68 Bitter Youniang’s Entry into the Grand View Garden; Sour Fengjie’s Rowdy Uproar at the Ningguo Mansion  After Jia Lian left, the timing turned unfortunate—while he was away on border patrol for the Peace Festival for nearly a month, he had not received confirmation of his orders and was forced to remain in the lower quarters on standby. When he finally returned and met with everyone, all matters were arranged, though his journey back had stretched nearly to the two‐month limit. Unbeknownst to him, Fengjie had long since made up her mind. Even before Jia Lian’s departure, she had secretly ordered various artisans and laborers to remodel three rooms in the East Wing—fashioning them to match the standards of her own residence with fine decorations and furnishings. Fourteen days later she reported to Grandmother and Wang Xifeng that, on the fifteenth morning, she would lead a procession to the “Aunt’s Temple” (a relative’s temple) for an incense offering. Only four women were to accompany her—Ping’er, Feng’er, Zhou Rui’s wife, and Wang’er’s wife. Before boarding the carriage, she explained the plan to the assembled crowd and then ordered all the men, dressed in plain clothes and simple coverings, to come along immediately. Xing’er was appointed to lead the way, and they marched to the gate, knocking in turn. When the household of Bao Er (the second branch) opened the door, Xing’er laughed and called out, “Quickly, send word back to Second Grandmother—the elder has arrived!” Hearing this, the Bao household’s strong-willed head was startled out of his composure and hurried inside to inform Sister You (the second sister). Although You Er was also taken aback, she quickly arrived and, with proper decorum, greeted Fengjie. At the gate Fengjie herself stepped down from the carriage. You Er, noticing her impeccable attire—her head adorned with plain silver ornaments, her jacket made of moon-white satin, a blue satin vest embroidered with silver thread, and a simple white gauze skirt, with eyebrows curved like willow leaves and her eyes sparkling like phoenixes—marveled at her beauty, reminiscent of a peach in spring and a chrysanthemum in autumn. Soon the wives of Zhou Rui and Wang’er were led into the courtyard. You Er greeted Fengjie warmly, exclaiming “Sister!” and apologizing profusely for not having received her sooner, then kowtowed. Fengjie, laughing and gracious, quickly returned the greeting, taking You Er’s hand and leading her inside. Inside, as Fengjie sat in the main hall, You Er immediately ordered the maidservants to fetch cushions and then bowed, saying:  “My dear, now that you have come here, all matters are decided by Mother and our elder sisters. I am honored to meet you today. Should you not dismiss my humble state, I would be most grateful and would pour out my heart, ever ready to serve you.” After bowing, she stepped back. Fengjie, smiling, replied, “It is only because I too am young. I have always been advised by the women to caution Second Master against frolicking away his time among pretty girls—lest our elders become worried.
You’ve done so much for me. If you act uneasy, I feel guilty. I just hope you’ll treat me the same as always; otherwise, I’d rather never come here again.” He moved to kneel, and Jia Zhen hurriedly grabbed him and insisted, “Don’t say such things, brother. I’ve no choice but to accept your goodwill.”  Jia Lian then called, “Someone bring wine! Let me have a few cups with Elder Brother.” With a mischievous grin he said to Third Sister, “Why not drink a double-cup of wine with Elder Brother? I too want to toast you both and offer my congratulations!”  Third Sister leaped up onto the kang, pointing at Jia Lian with a mocking smile, “Don’t try your fancy talk on me! I’m too clearheaded for that. Better keep the show going without pricking the thin paper screen. Don’t imagine we’re ignorant of the doings in your mansion. You spend a little money, you two brothers treat my sister and me as though we were mere courtesans for your pleasure. You’ve made a mistake. I know all about your wife’s viciousness. Now you’ve tricked my sister into becoming your second wife, but like the proverb says, ‘A stolen drum can’t be beaten openly.’ I’d like to meet this Lady Feng and see if she has extra heads and extra arms. If she’s reasonable, fine; but if she dares act high and mighty, I’ll slice out the gall from you two dogs and then fight her to the death! Afraid of some wine? Let’s drink, then!”  With that, she picked up the wine pot, filled a cup, drank half, yanked Jia Lian toward her, and tried to pour the rest down his throat. Terrified, he sobered instantly. Jia Zhen, too, never expected Third Sister to be so blunt. The two men—normally so smooth in flirtation—were left speechless by this barrage. Seeing them tongue-tied only spurred Third Sister on. She shouted, “Bring my sister! If we’re going to have fun, let’s all have fun together—four of us! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing’s cheaper than family property.’ You two are brothers, we two are sisters; we’re not outsiders, so come on!” Mortified, Madam You felt this had gone too far. Jia Zhen tried to slip away, but Third Sister blocked him. Now Jia Zhen regretted getting involved. This fiery woman was no ordinary plaything, and he could no longer be frivolous around her. Third Sister proceeded to remove her ornaments and outer clothes. She gathered her hair loosely and wore only a red jacket, half open, deliberately revealing a bright green bodice and a glimpse of snowy skin below. She wore green trousers and red shoes, dazzling in contrast. She moved about, now laughing, now raging, utterly unladylike. Her dangling earrings swung like children on a swing. Under the lamplight, her willow brows appeared darker, her lips redder. Her eyes sparkled like autumn waters, and with a few more cups in her, they gleamed even more bewitchingly. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, both enthralled and terrified, didn’t dare approach yet couldn’t bear to leave, entranced and left gaping. To make matters worse, her scathing talk pinned them down. Both men, for once, had no witty repartee. She prattled away with coarse banter, openly mocking them until she’d had her fill of fun. Then, once she’d drunk her fill, she refused to let them stay longer, driving them out and bolting the door behind them. From that day forward, whenever Third Sister found them alone, she would curse Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and Jia Rong, calling them swindlers who preyed on a widow and her daughters. Jia Zhen, after that first debacle, didn’t dare come without reason. Sometimes, if she was in the mood, she would send a page to summon him; once he arrived, he could do nothing but sit there, gazing helplessly as she pleased. Reader, note that Third Sister You had a uniquely eccentric temperament. She was undeniably captivating and loved to dress in bold, striking styles unlike anyone else’s, displaying a charm that few men could resist.
Now they’re pointing fingers at me, wanting to dismiss me. I haven’t done anything wrong—what have I done to deserve this? Could it be that Grandmother or Wang Xifeng secretly instructed you to set up this trap to oust me? Now that we must appear together before the officials to clear our names, let’s all invite our kin and show them; then, if you issue me a letter of dismissal, I’ll leave immediately!” Amid her tears, Fengjie continued, “Sister, please understand my plight. I have arranged everything so that we, as sisters living together in harmony, can advise Second Master and manage affairs with care. If you were to live outside while I remain inside, how could I possibly bear it? And if outsiders were to hear, our reputations would be sullied—not only mine but yours as well. Second Master’s reputation is paramount; our squabbles over trifles are insignificant. As for the idle chatter of servants, it is natural—they say I run the household too strictly and then, behind my back, they add their own criticisms. Just imagine: if I were truly intolerable, how could I ever remain unchallenged in this household? If Second Master were to secretly marry a woman outside, I would never willingly go, and if Ping’er says so, I even advised Second Master to take her in. It is all too much for the gods to bear that such small people suffer because of my strict management, so that I become the scapegoat for their misdeeds!” Fengjie then burst into an outpouring of grief, wailing and pleading with Lady You to accompany her to the officials. Jia Huan, already on his knees, begged, “Aunt, please calm your anger!” Fengjie then scolded Jia Huan fiercely, “You wretched little brat! Don’t you know how high the heavens are and how deep the earth is? Every day you meddle and stir up trouble, leaving our family shamed and our fortunes ruined. Your own mother’s spirit, even in death, would not condone this, and our ancestors would not stand for it! Yet you persist—and I am at a loss! What have you done to deserve this? Are you so heartless as to contrive such misdeeds?” Jia Huan, on his knees, pleaded, “Aunt, please do not let your anger burst forth. I am but a foolish boy; if I cause even a little trouble, may you punish me harshly—but please, do not let it ruin our family’s honor!” He then began to beat himself with his own hand in remorse. The women around started laughing and urging him on, though none dared openly laugh. Fengjie then collapsed into Lady You’s arms, crying loudly and lamenting that even though she had not forced any marriage on him, he had still borne the disgrace. She declared, “If you send your brothers to marry, I am not angry—but why must you disobey our instructions and bear such disgrace? If we go to the officials, we will avoid the constabulary. Moreover, if we merely meet our kin, and I, being neither virtuous nor able to afford a concubine, receive nothing but a letter of dismissal, I would leave at once! I have personally taken in your sister to our household, fearing that Grandmother and Wang Xifeng would be upset if she returned. Now, with lavish feasts and an abundance of servants in our garden, I am forced to rearrange my quarters—all because I must maintain order. I never intended for such discord, but small-minded people have now caused trouble. I don’t even know what has happened to you! I fear that if I were to complain, our family’s honor would be tarnished, and I might be forced to use some of our silver to settle accounts!” As she cried and raved, she clutched Lady You’s face and cursed Jia Huan relentlessly. At length, the concubines, maids, and wives knelt in a mass, pleading in unison, “Second Grandmother, you are most magnanimous. Although our own Grandmother has suffered, she has borne it long enough—remember how kindly she has always treated us! Please, spare us further humiliation.” They then brought tea, and Fengjie, after a bout of tears and scolding, wiped her eyes, combed her hair, and admonished Jia Huan, “Go fetch your father so I may question him face-to-face about our situation! I must learn the extent of our filial merits and your arranged marriage—this matter, I truly know nothing; let me learn so I may instruct you!” Jia Huan knelt and repeatedly kowtowed, saying, “I beg your pardon, Aunt—please punish me if you must; I will accept any reproof.
Baoyu—having nothing further to discuss with Jia Huan and Jia Cong—laughed and asked the Flower Official, “What is that in your hand?” The Flower Official quickly offered it to Baoyu, saying, “It’s rosewater salve for treating spring eczema.” Baoyu smiled, “How thoughtful of him to think of that.” Jia Huan, overhearing, peered in and soon caught a faint fragrance; he bent over and fished out a scrap of paper from his boot, laughing and saying, “Good brother, give me half!” Baoyu had no choice but to agree. But the Flower Official, cherishing Ru Official’s gift, did not want to share his own supply; he quickly tried to block the request, laughing, “Don’t touch this—I’ll fetch some more separately.” Baoyu understood and replied with a laugh, “Then bundle it up and take it along.”  After accepting the package, the Flower Official went to secure his belongings from his chest of drawers. When he opened it, he found the small box empty. Puzzled, he wondered, “There were still some left this morning—how have they all vanished?” When he inquired, no one could say. Miaoyue commented, “Don’t worry about it now—it seems the people in this house have simply run short for the moment. No matter what you hand out, who can tell the difference? Hurry and send them off so we can have our meal.” Hearing this, the Flower Official repackaged some jasmine powder and brought it along. Jia Huan, upon seeing it, happily reached out to take it; but the Flower Official, protective of Ru Official’s gift, quickly tossed it onto the Kang (heated platform). Jia Huan merely stooped to pick it up, tucking it into his bosom before making his excuses and departing. In truth, Jia Zheng was away and neither Wang Xifeng nor the others were at home; Jia Huan had lately feigned illness to avoid school. Now that he’d received the “salve” (or so he thought), he went cheerfully to Caiyun. At that moment, Caiyun and Aunt Zhao were chatting idly when Jia Huan, grinning, said to Caiyun, “I’ve obtained a very fine package—please accept it to treat your face. You always say that rosewater salve is better than the silver nitrate sold elsewhere; see if this is so!” Caiyun opened it and laughed, “And from whom did you get it?” Jia Huan then recounted the earlier incident. Caiyun laughed, “They’re just teasing you, you country bumpkin. This isn’t salve at all—it’s jasmine powder.” Jia Huan inspected it; indeed it bore a slight reddish tint and a pleasing fragrance. He laughed, “Well, if it works like salve powder and is superior to what’s sold outside, then keep it for treating your face.” Caiyun could only accept it. Aunt Zhao then remarked, “So you got something good? Who told you to ask? How can you blame them for having fun with you? In my opinion, take it and use it on your face, and if need be, throw it at them. With all this commotion—those mourning processions, those bustle of the servants—if you stir things up, soon everyone will have a word to say. Perhaps in two months they’ll come back and ask you about it again. And you, my dear, will have something to say as well. Baoyu is your elder brother—you dare not confront him; don’t you think even the family’s cats and dogs would question you?” Jia Huan lowered his head. Caiyun hastily said, “Oh, why make such a fuss? Just bear with it.” Aunt Zhao added, “Don’t worry about it—it’s none of your concern. If you manage to get even a little satisfaction by scolding those shameless wench-like girls, all the better.” She then pointed at Jia Huan, “Pah! You lowlife without backbone—you’ll only ever have to suffer the wrath of those unruly maidservants! I once told you, if by any chance I mistakenly handed you something you weren’t meant to have, you’d immediately turn red in the face and start throwing a fit; and now you’re being toyed with by that little runt—so go on, say what you must.” Jia Huan, burning with indignation, flung the package and dashed off into the garden.
Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the remaining items. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it isn’t enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “No need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve already eaten enough; there’s no need for more.” She then stood by the table, finishing her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we have wine, I want two bowls’ worth.” Baoyu laughed, “So you like wine too? Then later, let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen drink well too, though they’re always too shy—but today, since we’re breaking our fast together, it’s fine.” Baoyu then remembered another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s affair. Please speak with the Liu family and insist that she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it and that will be the end of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is a proper matter indeed.” Spring Yan then called two little maids to come in to wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she washed up and went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part needs no further detail). Baoyu then went out and continued his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters. The Flower Official followed, carrying his fan. Just as they left the door, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set the meal; we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted what had happened earlier at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company – it would add to the festivities.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox—where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you arrange it without telling us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow, if we all leave and leave the Flower Official alone, that will be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you, you simply cannot go!” Qingwen replied, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—even though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will fix it? Don’t go on about it. I’m not fussing over you—if you never help out, then what? You’ve been gone for days, nearly risking your life, yet still you come back empty-handed—what’s the point? Speak up already! Why act so foolishly and smile at me? That won’t do.” Qingwen spat as she laughed. Soon everyone made their way into the hall. Aunt Xue also arrived; all the ladies sat down in order and began to dine. Baoyu served half a bowl of rice soaked in tea—merely symbolic of the celebration. After the meal, as everyone sipped tea and exchanged idle banter and jokes, outside a few young servants (Xiao Luo, Xiangling, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and a few others) played in the garden. They gathered flowers and plants, then sat amid them playing a game of “guess the plant.” One declared, “I have the Guanyin willow!” Another, “I have the Arhat pine!” A third said, “I have the Gentleman’s bamboo!” Yet another, “I have the Beauty’s calla!” Still another exclaimed, “I have the sparkling emerald!” One more, “I have the peony from The Peony Pavilion!” And yet another, “I have the pipa fruit from The Pipa Story!” Bean Official then said, “I have sisterly blossoms!” When no one else could top that, Xiangling said, “I have ‘Coupled Hibiscus’ (Hui of Husband and Wife).” Bean Official retorted, “I’ve never heard of ‘Coupled Hibiscus’!” Xiangling explained, “When a single arrow brings one flower, it’s called ‘Lan’; when an arrow brings several, it’s ‘Hui.’ If the blossoms are clustered on top, that’s ‘Brotherhood Hui’; when arranged side by side, it’s ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’ Mine, with two clusters side by side, is definitely ‘Coupled Hibiscus.’” Bean Official had no answer and got up laughing, “According to you, if one cluster is larger than the other, that would be ‘Old Man and Son Hui’!
He opened his eyes to find himself in a ruined temple, a lame Taoist sitting nearby picking lice off his robe. Xianglian stood, bowed, and asked, “Reverend, where is this place, and what is your name?” The Taoist laughed, “I, too, do not know where we are, nor who I am. I’m just resting here.” Hearing that, Xianglian felt an icy chill sink into his bones. He drew the male sword, hacked off his long hair—severing the roots of worldly sorrow—and followed the Taoist into parts unknown. If you wish to know the full story, you must wait for the next chapter. Chapter 67  When Third Sister You took her own life, Old Madam You, Second Sister You, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, and the others were all overwhelmed with grief. They quickly arranged for her remains to be placed in a coffin and sent outside the city for burial. Upon learning of Third Sister’s death, Liu Xianglian, still filled with longing and sorrow, was awakened from his infatuation by a few incisive comments from a wandering Daoist. He promptly cut his hair and became a monk, following the eccentric Daoist off to parts unknown. We shall leave them for now. Meanwhile, when Madam Xue heard that Xianglian had agreed to marry Third Sister You, she was delighted. She had been preparing to buy a house, furnish it, and select an auspicious date for the wedding, all to repay him for saving her son’s life. Suddenly, some page boys started shouting that “Third Miss has taken her own life.” A few servant girls overheard and reported this to Madam Xue, who, puzzled as to the cause, could only sigh. Just then, Baochai came in from the garden, and Madam Xue told her, “My dear child, have you heard? Your Cousin-in-law Zhen’s younger sister, Third Miss, was already promised to your brother’s sworn brother, Liu Xianglian. Somehow she took a sword to herself, and Xianglian has vanished. It’s all so strange, impossible to predict.”  Baochai was unconcerned and said, “As the saying goes, ‘Heaven is unpredictable, and so is human fate.’ It must have been decided by their past lives. A few days ago you were planning to repay him for rescuing my brother. Now one is gone, and the other has disappeared. In my view, it’s best to let it go; you needn’t grieve on their behalf. But since Brother came back from the south about ten days ago, the merchandise he brought must have been sold off. Those traveling merchants have just returned after several tough months on the road. You and Brother should discuss hosting a banquet to thank them properly, so no one can say we lack courtesy.”  Mother and daughter were still talking when Xue Pan entered, eyes red with tears. The moment he stepped in, he clapped his hands before his mother and said, “Mother, do you know about Second Brother Liu and Third Sister You?” Madam Xue replied, “I just heard the story and was discussing it with your sister. Have you also heard that Xianglian followed a Daoist and became a monk?” Madam Xue added, “That’s even stranger. How could a bright young man like Liu Xianglian, just on a whim, become so muddled as to go with a monk? The two of you were good friends, and he has no family here. You should search everywhere for him. How far can a Daoist take him? He can’t have gone beyond a nearby temple or monastery.”  Xue Pan said, “That’s exactly what I did. As soon as I heard, I took my page boys to search everywhere, but we found not a trace. We asked around too, and no one had seen him.” Madam Xue said, “At least you tried to find him as a true friend. Who knows—perhaps going off to be a monk will prove good for him. But now it’s time to mind your own affairs—tend to your business and start preparing for your marriage. Our family is small, and there’s a saying that a weak bird must fly early to avoid being unprepared and laughed at. Also, as your sister mentioned, you’ve been back over half a month, so the merchandise should be distributed by now. The men who traveled with you deserve a banquet in gratitude. They journeyed two or three thousand miles over four or five months of hardship, bearing all sorts of dangers on your behalf.”  Xue Pan said, “Yes, Mother, you’re perfectly right.
Fetch a dice bowl and let Sister Qin toss the dice. Whoever draws the number designated for ‘She Fu’ must accept the decree.” Baoqin tossed her dice and obtained a three. Xiuyun, Baoyu, and the others tossed but none hit the mark until Xiangling finally tossed a three. Baoqin laughed, “It seems that spring is born indoors—if we were to compare with the outside, it would be too chaotic.” Tanchun said, “Naturally. Anyone who fails three times in a row shall be penalized with a cup. Now, answer my decree.” Baoqin thought for a moment and pronounced the word “Old.” Xiangling, however, having grown up with such games, could not immediately think of an appropriate phrase—no idiom involving “old” came to mind. Xiangyun scanned the room and suddenly noticed on the door a plaque with the words “Hong Xiang Pu” (Red Fragrance Garden), and deduced that Baoqin must have meant the “garden” radical. Seeing that Xiangling could not guess, the others quietly urged her and taught her to say “Yao” (medicine) instead. Daiyu observed, “Quick—punish her! We must prevent this gossip from spreading!” Amid the commotion, Xiangling was penalized with a cup of wine. Later, Baochai and Tanchun exchanged lots. Tanchun drew the character “Ren” (person). Baochai laughed, “That character is too generic.” Tanchun replied, “If we add another character, the combined phrase won’t be so generic.” Then she declared another lot: “Chuang” (window). Baochai, pondering this, noted that since there were chickens present at the table, perhaps he was alluding to the idiom “Ji Chuang, Ji Ren” (“the chicken’s window, the chicken’s person”) – and he guessed the word “Shi” (threshold). Tanchun, realizing his meaning, smiled and took a sip of her drink. Soon Xiangyun and the others began a lively game with fists and guessing. Outside, Aunt You and Yuanyang, separated by a table, also played, calling out numbers. Ping’er and Xiren paired up, and the sound of clinking bracelets filled the room. Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu, and Xiren outdid Ping’er; rounds of toasts were exchanged. Xiangyun then declared, “For the verse on the wine’s surface, we need one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one from a domino name, one from a tune title, and one line from an official decree—all together forming a verse. And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal fruit or dish.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so tedious to recite—but there’s a charm to them.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, While fierce winds sweep the river and sky and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul over and over; such is the welcome of a returning guest.” Everyone laughed at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut kernel and recited for the base of the toast:  “Hazelnuts are not forged by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence then does the sound of laundry-pounding in countless homes come?” And that concluded the round. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting a common proverb, each version including the character “longevity,” with no further embellishment. After a while, they began to play a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng absent, no one kept strict order; everyone indulged freely—shouting, calling out, and laughing. The hall was a riot of red and green, with jade gleaming and pearls tinkling—a truly exuberant scene. After playing for a while, everyone began to disperse.
Xing, for her part, did not object. Meanwhile, as arrangements were made, news came that the Marquis of Zhongjing, Lord Shi Ding, had been transferred to a high-ranking post in another province and would soon leave with his family. Grandmother, unwilling to lose Xiangyun, kept him at home. Initially, she had ordered Fengjie to arrange a separate room for him, but Shi Xiangyun insisted on sharing with Baochai; and so that matter was dropped. At this point, the Grand View Garden was more bustling than ever. Under the leadership of Li Wan were Yingchūn, Tan Chun, Xi Shi, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Li Wen, Li Qi, Baoqin, and Xiuyan—a total of thirteen young ladies. As for their ages, apart from Li Wan (the eldest) and Fengjie (next), most were around fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen; even they themselves could scarcely tell who was older. Grandmother, Mrs. Wang, and the servants could only refer to them generically as “sisters” or “younger sisters.”  At this time, Xiangling was entirely absorbed in her desire to compose poetry but dared not pester Baochai too much. By chance, Shi Xiangyun arrived – a man who loved to talk and could not help but launch into lengthy discussions of poetry. His arrival lifted the mood; he talked animatedly day and night about literature. Baochai teased, “I truly cannot stand all this chatter. A proper maiden should treat poetry as a serious affair. If one babbles on endlessly, even the learned will laugh and say you lack propriety. And if Xiangling’s verses are muddled while you add your own commentary, it’s as if you’re nothing but a bag full of empty words. Look – our dear sister herself seems overly eager!” Xiangling’s cheeks flushed scarlet, and she retorted, “I only envy you – that is all. I long to learn!” Tan Chun and Daiyu laughed together, “Aren’t we all just playing? Do we really intend to become poets? If we did, we might end up laughing ourselves to death!” Bao Yu said, “That would be self-defeating. Just the other day, I discussed our poetry society with some officials; they heard of our plans and begged to see our manuscripts – I ended up composing a few verses for them. Who among them wasn’t truly moved? They even copied them!” Tan Chun and Daiyu eagerly asked, “Is that so?” Bao Yu laughed and replied, “The liar is that parrot on the beam!” Daiyu and Tan Chun exclaimed, “You’re simply kidding! Even if our verses are playful, our writings should not be disseminated beyond the family!” Bao Yu said, “What is there to fear? In olden days, the women of the inner quarters kept their writings secret – now no one would know.”  At that moment, Xiangyun called out, “Hurry along, let’s go! Who is the sponsor of our poetic gathering?” Li Wan answered, “It is my idea. I believe last night’s auspicious day passed on its own. But if we wait until tomorrow, when the weather clears, it won’t be as enjoyable. Though the snow may never melt, tonight’s snowfall is plenty to admire.” She then proposed that each person contribute one or two taels of silver for the festivities, pointing to Xiangling, Baoqin, Li Wen, Li Qi, and Xiuyan, adding, “Not counting the two who are ill or on leave, if you all contribute your share, I guarantee that five or six taels in all will suffice.” Baochai and the others all agreed. Li Wan then said with a smile, “I’ve already decided in my heart. Tomorrow, when the time comes, we’ll see.” After some more idle chatter, they went to see Grandmother. That day, there was little more to say. The next morning, at dawn, Bao Yu—still troubled by a sleepless night—rose early. When he lifted the curtains expecting sunlight, he was astonished to see not the bright rays but a thick blanket of snow nearly a foot deep, swirling in the air like soft cotton. Overjoyed, he called his attendants. After quickly washing up, he dressed in an eggplant-colored wool coat trimmed with fox fur, over which he donned a “Sea-Dragon” jacket; he cinched his waist, then put on a jade-needle raincoat and a golden-tasseled hat.
The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing beneath the flowers, remarked: Daiyu said, “Your third maid is such a well-behaved child. Even though she’s tasked with certain duties, she barely steps out. If only she were allowed a bit more freedom, she’d command respect in no time.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—when you were ill, she handled several matters for us. Now this garden is divided among different managers; even a stray blade of grass is accounted for. They’ve even trimmed some responsibilities, leaving room for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan meticulously—how can they not be shrewd?” Daiyu said, “That is best. Yet we are spending too much effort. Although I do not meddle in these affairs, when I have free moments I tally things up; if the outgoings exceed the incomings, sooner or later there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us are never short.” Daiyu, upon hearing this, turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of fresh tea, and asked, “Where are you off to? I see you two haven’t had tea in quite a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then brought the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I will pour more.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just a little rinse is enough.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is more than enough. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s gone.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed. Baoyu nudged him, “Don’t sleep—let’s go have some fun outside. Later, we’ll eat a proper meal.” The Flower Official replied, “You all drink wine and ignore me; I end up getting bored and sleep.” Baoyu pulled him up, laughing, “We’ll dine again tonight at home. When we return, I’ll ask Sister Xiren to bring you to the table—how about that?” The Flower Official said, “Neither Lotus Officer nor Ru Official are coming up; it would be awkward for me to be alone up there. I’m not fond of that noodle dish anyway—I couldn’t eat properly this morning. I’m already hungry. I had already told Aunt Liu to prepare a bowl of soup and half a bowl of polished rice for me, so that once I eat, that’s that. And if at night I’m allowed to drink without supervision, I’ll make sure I eat enough before then. I plan to enjoy a couple of jin of fine Huiquan wine at home later. These days, though some say that drinking too much will ruin your throat, in recent years I’ve never heard such a thing. Besides, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four pieces of cream-filled pastry, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such food?” He mixed the soup with rice and ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then ate half a bowl of porridge before ceasing.
Although you had uncles, a parent’s love was incomparable—so we were received for several years. When grown, you would naturally be sent back to the Lin family; you could never remain a Lin daughter in the Jia household forever. Even if the Lin family were impoverished, they are a family of scholars and would never stoop to having their kin care for relatives, lest they be ridiculed. So, whether it is early next spring or later in autumn, even if we do not send her back here, someone from the Lin family will surely come to fetch her. Just last night, the young mistress told me to remind you: all those childhood playthings that he once gave you must be gathered and returned to him; then he will settle his own account with you.”  At these words, it was as if a clanging thunder had sounded over Baoyu’s head. Huizi looked at him expectantly, but after a long silence he said nothing. Just as she was about to ask again, Qingwen arrived saying, “Grandmother has called for you.”  Huizi laughed, “She’s asking about the young mistress’s ailment—I told her all I knew, but he wouldn’t believe me; now you must take him away.” With that she went back to her room. Qingwen, noticing Baoyu’s vacant stare, a sheen of cold sweat on his brow, and his numb, trembling hands, quickly led him by the arm all the way to the Yihong Courtyard. When Xiren saw him in such a state, she grew frantic, saying, “The heat must have caught you in the wind! I don’t think you’re seriously ill, but—your eyes are so fixed, and drool is forming at the corner of your mouth…!” Before anyone could fully grasp what was happening, someone brought a pillow, and as soon as Baoyu lay down he fell asleep; when he was helped to sit up, he would drink tea, and so on. Everyone was in a tizzy but dared not return to Grandmother Jia until they sent for Aunt Li. Soon Aunt Li arrived, examined him for a while, asked a few questions (of which Baoyu offered no answers), then felt his pulse and pressed firmly on the philtrum until deep marks were left—yet Baoyu seemed not to feel a thing. Aunt Li simply said, “This is very serious!” and then cried out loudly, clutching her head. Distressed, Xiren pulled at her, “Please, sir, aren’t you frightened? Tell us what happened so we can inform Grandmother and the mistress. Why did you begin crying so?”  Aunt Li pounded on the bed and shook her pillow, exclaiming, “This is utterly useless! I’ve wasted a lifetime of worry!”  Xiren, knowing Aunt Li to be wise with age, had invited her to see Baoyu. Now, upon hearing her words and seeing his condition, she believed every word and began to cry as well. Qingwen then recounted the earlier events to Xiren. Upon hearing this, Xiren rushed over to the Xiangxiang Chamber, where Huizi was busy helping Daiyu take her medicine. Without pause, she approached Huizi and said, “What exactly did you say to our Baoyu? Look at him! If you go back to Grandmother now, I can’t help it!” Then she sat down. Daiyu suddenly noticed that Xiren’s face was filled with urgent anger and tear tracks, and her demeanor had changed so much that she couldn’t help but ask what had happened. After a moment’s pause, Xiren wept, “I don’t know what words you, Sister Huizi, said—but that dullard’s eyes have gone wide, his limbs have turned cold, and he won’t say a word. Even when Aunt Li pinched him, it didn’t hurt—he’s nearly half dead! Even his own mother says he’s useless, and now she’s bawling her eyes out! I’m afraid he may very well die this moment!”  At this, Daiyu, who had long since accepted that Aunt Li’s ways were ineffective, burst into a cry as she spat out all the medicine she had taken, her body trembling as if her very entrails were in uproar. Soon her face was flushed, her eyes puffy, and she could barely lift her head in gasping distress. Huizi quickly came over to pat her back.
Soon he reached the foot of a hill and, turning the corner, caught a whiff of a crisp fragrance. Looking back, he discovered that at Miaoyu’s Lóngcuì Nunnery there were a dozen red plum blossoms, as red as rouge, set against the snow—a sight so vibrant and spirited it was most amusing. Bao Yu paused to admire them before continuing. On the narrow Bǎng Bridge, a person with an umbrella was approaching—sent by Li Wan to fetch Fengjie. Bao Yu arrived at Lùxuě Ting and found the maids busy clearing snow and paving a path. The garden, known as Lùxuě Ting, stood on a riverside sandbank beneath a hill, with several modest thatched structures, bamboo windows, and open thresholds from which one could fish. A winding path led from among the reeds to the bamboo bridge of Lǒu Xiāng Xiè. The maids and old women, upon seeing Bao Yu in his raincoat and hat, laughed, “We were just saying that we’re short one fisherman—and now he’s arrived!” Bao Yu, hearing this, had no choice but to return indoors. Shortly thereafter, Tan Chun emerged from Qiūshuǎng Zhai, draped in a large red, orangish cloak, carrying a Guanyin purse and supporting a little maid. Behind him, a woman held a blue satin oil umbrella. Bao Yu, aware that Tan Chun was heading to Grandmother’s, waited by the pavilion until they arrived, and then the two set out together. Meanwhile, Baoqin was in her inner chamber, busy with her toilette. Soon all the sisters assembled. Bao Yu, feeling hungry, kept urging for the meal. At long last the meal was served; the first dish was steamed lamb on a bed of milk, and Grandmother declared, “These are medicines for the elders—things that the young should not consume. Today we also have fresh venison; wait and see.” The others agreed, but Bao Yu, unable to wait, grabbed his tea and hastily gobbled down his meal along with some wild seeds. Grandmother said, “I know you’ve got other things on your mind if you can’t even eat properly. Save the venison for your evening meal.” Fengjie quickly remarked, “And if it’s left over, so be it.”  Xiangyun then conferred with Bao Yu, “Since there’s fresh venison, why don’t we take a piece for ourselves—retrieve it from the garden and enjoy it ourselves?” Bao Yu agreed wholeheartedly and ordered a matron to send it into the garden. After the meal, everyone dispersed and later gathered in the garden to listen as Li Wan proposed a poetic challenge. Only Bao Yu and Xiangyun were absent. Daiyu remarked, “They never meet together; if they do, who knows what mischief might arise? Perhaps they’ve already schemed over that piece of venison!”  Just then a maid hurried in, and Daiyu, with a smile, commented, “Our dear maid has arrived!”  Xiangling’s face flushed red as she retorted, “So you’ve all colluded to frame me! Just wait until I get my chance to confront you and our master!”  Seeing Xiangling’s irritation, Ping’er, regretful for her loose tongue, pulled her aside under a maple tree on a stone seat and recounted in detail everything Fengjie had said earlier—every word, every cause and effect. Xiangling’s cheeks reddened further; she sneered bitterly at Ping’er, “I intend to keep this to myself—don’t mention it to Second Madam! For heaven’s sake, if the head of the household decides to marry me off as a concubine, I’ll never consent!”  Before Ping’er could respond, a burst of laughter came from behind the boulders. “So, you call yourself a shameless maid? Look at you—barefaced!” They all began laughing; in their merriment, they teased and scolded each other. Soon, Ping’er pulled Baochai aside in a low voice, “Sister, have you heard our latest news?”  Baochai replied, “I haven’t heard a word. My brother has been away these past days, so I’m out of the loop.”  Ping’er laughed, “Lord Jia beat Second Young Master something fierce—didn’t you hear?”  Baochai said, “I only caught a vague remark this morning and wasn’t sure.
She then recalled that Wang Xifeng was unwell and realized she hadn’t visited recently. Besides, with Jia Lian away, it seemed like a good opportunity to chat. She told Qingwen, “Stay in the room. Don’t all go off, or when the young master returns, no one will be here.” Qingwen retorted, “You’re the only one who cares about him? The rest of us are good for nothing, is that it?” Xiren smiled without responding and left. Strolling along the bank near Cleft Fragrance Bridge, she admired the lotus blossoms transitioning from summer to autumn, the mingled red and green foliage. Halfway down the path, she looked up and noticed an old maid named Granny Zhu under a grape arbor, waving a duster. Approaching, she greeted the woman, who replied, “What brings you out walking today, Miss?” Xiren said, “I’m heading to Mistress Lian’s. What are you doing here?” The older woman explained, “I’m chasing away wasps. Because this year’s rainy season was short, insects have infested the fruit trees, leaving worm-eaten, spotted fruit that’s falling everywhere. You might not know it, Miss, but wasps are the worst. They’ll pierce a few fruits, then the juice leaks onto others and rots the whole cluster. We just chatted a moment, and look how many have landed.” Xiren said, “No matter how much you swat, you can’t catch them all. Why not tell the buyers to sew little gauze bags for each cluster? They let in air but keep the fruit safe.” The old maid exclaimed, “That’s a fine idea! This is my first year on orchard duty, so I never knew such a trick.” She laughed. “Though some fruit is spoiling, the taste is good. Would you like me to pick one for you to try?” Xiren replied firmly, “That wouldn’t be right. Not only are they not fully ripe yet, but they also haven’t been offered at table. How can we eat them first? You’ve worked here a long time—surely you know this rule.” The old maid hurriedly apologized, “Yes, yes. I saw you looking fondly at them, so I overstepped. I must be getting senile.” Xiren said, “It’s fine—just make sure you older folks aren’t the first to break the rules.”  She continued out of the garden and arrived at Wang Xifeng’s courtyard. As soon as she entered, she heard Wang Xifeng exclaim, “Heaven help me—I’m roasting alive in here, practically like a thief!” Xiren realized something serious must have happened. She couldn’t leave after coming this far, yet she was uncomfortable going in, so she stamped her footsteps more audibly. Outside the window, she called, “Sister Ping, are you there?” Ping’er responded from inside and came out. Xiren asked, “Is Mistress Lian home? Is she feeling better?” With that, she walked in. Wang Xifeng had been lying down but stood up when she saw Xiren, smiling. “I’m better now, thank you for worrying. Why haven’t you come by the past few days?” Xiren said, “I knew you were unwell. I should have come daily to pay respects, but I worried you needed rest and that visiting might disturb you.” Waving a hand, Wang Xifeng said, “Disturb? Nonsense. It’s just that, in Master Bao’s household, though the staff is large, you’re the one who truly looks after him. He can’t do without you. I’ve often heard Ping’er say that you think of me behind my back, frequently asking after my health. That’s real devotion.” She told Ping’er to move a stool next to the bed and motioned for Xiren to sit. Feng’er brought tea, and Xiren gestured politely, “Let Sister Feng’er sit.”  They were chatting idly when a little maid tiptoed in from the outer room and whispered to Ping’er, “Wang’er is here, waiting by the second gate.” Ping’er quietly replied, “Got it.
Gradually, she began to feel better. At that moment several fruits and vegetables were selected and sent over to Sister Feng, who in turn sent a few items back. After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and some wandered outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish – each doing as they pleased while chatting and joking. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess, while Baochai and Xiuyun observed the board. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled under a cluster of flowers, murmuring softly to each other, content in their private world. Soon the Lin household people arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the hall but instead knelt at the steps and kowtowed. Tanchun, having lost a game of chess and calculating her losses, ended up with “two eyes” (a game term) and, still fixated on the board, extended one hand into the box, absentmindedly grasping at chess pieces. The Lin household person stood for a long while; only when he later turned to ask for tea did he notice the situation and inquired what was amiss. He then pointed at the young wife and said, “This is Cai’er – the mother of little Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden’s attendants. Her speech is poor; I only overheard her say something, and she wasn’t even willing to answer the young mistress. She had to be brought forward to speak.” Tanchun asked, “Why not report her to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just now Grandmother was seen going toward the mistress’s room; I already understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun asked, “Why not report to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er said, “It doesn’t matter if we don’t report – I’ll go and mention it. In any case, let’s expel her for now and wait until the mistress returns to decide.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. Meanwhile, the Lin official took the young wife out and did not mention it further. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing under the flowers, watched longingly. Daiyu said, “Your third maid is quite a well-behaved child. Although she is assigned to certain duties, she barely steps out – if only she were given more leeway, she’d soon command respect.” Baoyu replied, “You know not – when you were ill, she handled several matters. This garden has now been divided among various managers; even a stray blade of grass cannot be spared. They’ve already reduced a few responsibilities to make room for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan every detail – how could they not be cunning?” Daiyu said, “That is best. But we are spending too much effort. Although I do not meddle in affairs, when I have free moments I tally things up; if expenses exceed income, sooner or later there will be a shortage.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you calculate, our numbers are more than sufficient for the two of us.” Daiyu, upon hearing this, turned and went off to find Baochai and exchange smiles. Just as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small, linked lacquer tea tray holding two pots of freshly brewed tea, and asked, “Where are you off to? I see you two haven’t had tea in a long while – you’ve already poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot over to Baochai; she said, “Let whoever drinks first, drink, then I will pour more.” Baochai laughed, “I won’t drink much – just enough to rinse my mouth.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu replied, “You know my illness – the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is more than enough. Thank you.” She drank it dry and set the cup down. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been all this time? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside – and now he’s nowhere to be seen.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room, only to find the Flower Official asleep on the bed.
With that, both matters will be settled.”  Xiren replies, “That’s truly an ominous affair—if we preserve a reputation as ‘thieves who safeguard others,’ it might be acceptable. But if the mistress hears about it, she’ll say you’re childish and ungrateful.”  Ping’er laughs, “It’s a trivial matter anyway. Let’s instead have Caiyun and Yuchuan come over and clear it up. Otherwise, if they get away with it, it will appear as if I have no way of getting to the bottom of it. Even after everything is settled, they might continue their thieving ways without accountability.”  Xiren and the others laugh, “Exactly—we must leave a record!”  So Ping’er calls for the two of them and says, “Don’t worry—the culprit has been identified.”  Yuchuan asks first, “Where is the culprit?”  Ping’er replies, “He’s in the second lady’s room—ask him about his answers. I know in my heart that it wasn’t he who stole it; poor fellow was so frightened he admitted it all. Now, Brother Baoyu only wishes to acknowledge half of it. I intended to speak up, but the thief in question is a sister with whom I have long been close; yet the mistress is as ordinary as can be—and harming a good person’s reputation puts me in a difficult position. We must persuade Brother Baoyu to approve so that everyone remains untroubled. Otherwise, if we insist on pursuing it, she will surely become angry.”  Hearing this, Caiyun blushes and, overcome with shame, says, “Sister, you needn’t be blamed—indeed, I must accept responsibility.”  Xiren and Ping’er quickly add, “If you acknowledge it, then we won’t have to report it to Aunt Zhao; otherwise, if Second Sister hears, she will be incensed. It would be better if Brother Baoyu himself acknowledges it so that no one else will know of our involvement. Moreover, if anything happens, we can all claim no responsibility. Even if the entire house were given over to someone else, it would not concern us.”  Caiyun, after some thought, lowers her head and finally assents. Thus, all matters are settled. Ping’er then takes Caiyun, Yuchuan, and the Flower Official into the night-shift room. She also summons Wu’er and discreetly instructs her to say that the poria snow was given by the Flower Official. Wu’er, deeply grateful, accepts. Shortly thereafter, Ping’er brings them over to her own side, where she sees that the Lin household has already arrived with several young wives—enough to secure the situation. The Lin official then tells Ping’er, “This morning I escorted her in, but I was afraid no one would be there to attend to breakfast, so I temporarily sent Qin Xian’s woman to serve the young ladies’ meal.”  Ping’er asks, “Who is Qin Xian’s woman? I don’t know her well.”  The Lin official explains, “She’s the one on duty at the south corner at night—quiet by day, so the young ladies might not know her. She’s tall, with a lean, graceful figure and bright, clear eyes—the very picture of efficiency.”  Yuchuan exclaims, “That’s right! Sister, how could you forget? She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient. Now that everything is coming to light—and even the item lost in the mistress’s room the other day has found an owner—it was when Baoyu came over with those two rascals (the culprits) who, not being cautious, inadvertently caused a stir. They panicked, and in the end Baoyu found out and brought the items out to me. That poria snow, too, was obtained by Baoyu from outside; it has been given to many people—not only in the garden but also to the older maids for their relatives.
Seeing Xiangling falter, the others quietly coaxed her, teaching her to say “Yao” (medicine) instead. Daiyu then urged, “Quick—punish her! We must prevent these rumors from spreading!” Amid the commotion, Xiangling was penalized with a cup of wine. Later, Baochai and Tanchun exchanged lots; Tanchun drew the character “Ren” (person). Baochai laughed, “That character is too generic.” Tanchun replied, “If we add another character, the combined phrase won’t be so bland.” Then she declared another lot: “Chuang” (window). Baochai, pondering this, noted that since there were chickens at the table, perhaps it alluded to the idiom “Ji Chuang, Ji Ren” (“the chicken’s window, the chicken’s person”)—and he guessed the word “Shi” (threshold). Tanchun, realizing his intended meaning, smiled and sipped her drink. Soon Xiangyun and the others began a lively game of fist and guess. Outside, Aunt You and Yuanyang—seated separately—also played by calling out numbers. Ping’er and Xiren paired up as well, and the tinkling of bracelets filled the air. Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu, while Xiren outdid Ping’er; rounds of toasts were exchanged. Xiangyun then declared, “For the verse upon our toast, we require one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one drawn from domino names, one from tune titles, and one from an official decree—all to form a complete verse. And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so long-winded—but they have a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did so, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, Fierce winds sweep the river and sky as geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul time and again; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut and recited for the base:  “Hazelnuts are not produced by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence comes the clamor of a thousand households pounding laundry?” Thus the round was concluded. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting familiar proverbs—each including the character “longevity”—with no further embellishment. After a while, the group began playing a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Furen absent, no one kept strict order; everyone indulged freely—shouting, laughing, and calling out. The hall was awash in a dazzling interplay of red and green, with glimmering jade and tinkling pearls—a scene of exuberant merriment. After a time, as people began to disperse, Xiangyun was nowhere to be found. Assuming she had stepped out on her own, they waited; yet she did not return. Searches were conducted in every direction, but she was nowhere in sight. Soon after, members of the Lin household, accompanied by several elderly maids, arrived—both worried that urgent matters might arise and anxious that with Wang Furen absent the young maids might overindulge and lose their propriety. When Tanchun saw them, she smiled and said, “Come and see for yourselves—do not worry; we have not overdrunk, only used wine for amusement. Rest assured, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Although the Dowager insisted that the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses away, we simply had fun. We came to check on you. Moreover, as the day wears on and the young ladies continue their revelry, they might require some light snacks. Since they rarely indulge, a couple of cups of wine might not be enough nourishment.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were just about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids all agreed and hurried off to gather refreshments.
Zhao Yiniang quickly smiled and offered her a seat, then asked anxiously, “How is your grandmother faring? I was about to go see her but was pressed for time.” Li Wan, upon seeing Ping’er, asked, “What brings you here?” Ping’er replied with a smile, “Grandmother said that Zhao Yiniang’s brother has passed away, and she feared that neither she nor the young ladies would be aware of our old custom. Under normal circumstances, only 20 taels would be awarded—but now, please have the girls decide if a larger amount should be given.” Tan Chun, having just wiped away her tears, said, “What need is there to add any extra? Who was reared for 24 months? Otherwise, these are the expenses for those who marched off to battle or fled with their masters—no one is like that. Your master was so fortunate as to let me set up the precedent, so that when he does good, he can receive the money that Madam does not care to spend. If you suggest adding money, let him add it at his leisure when he’s well out and about!”   By this time, Ping’er had clearly understood the half of it. Seeing Tan Chun frown, she could only lower her head silently. At that moment, Baochai from the upper room entered, and Tan Chun and Li Wan quickly stood to offer seats. Before they could speak, one of the wives entered to inquire about something; because Tan Chun had been crying earlier, a few little maids soon followed with basin, handkerchiefs, and small mirrors and powder boxes. At that moment, Tan Chun—who was sitting cross-legged on a low wooden couch—had a maid approach with a basin. The maid knelt on both knees and presented the basin; two other little maids also knelt with handkerchiefs and small mirrors with powder and ornaments. Seeing that the official secretary was absent, Ping’er hurried over, helped Tan Chun remove her bracelets, and even handed her a large handkerchief to cover her exposed bosom. Only then did Tan Chun extend her hand to the basin to wash her face. The wife then remarked, “Madam, the annual allowance for those at Zhi Huan’s Academy—supporting Brother Huan and Brother Lan—is…”   Ping’er interrupted with a laugh, “What are you doing? I saw the young lady washing her face with your own eyes; if you do not go and attend to her, then you should be the one to speak up first! When Second Aunt is present, you should not behave so rudely! I must go back to Second Aunt and tell her that in your eyes, the young lady is not being valued—otherwise, you’ll be blamed for losing face!” The wife, taken aback, quickly apologized with a smile and withdrew. Tan Chun, after smoothing her face, glared coldly at Ping’er and said, “You’re a step behind—I barely caught the tail end of a laugh, and now someone else is making fun of us! Even Sister Wu, who has long been in charge, did not thoroughly investigate before joining us. Fortunately, when we inquired, he had the nerve to say ‘I forgot’—and I thought, ‘Has Second Aunt’s matter been so forgotten that we must search again?’ I doubt your master will have the patience to go and search for him!” Ping’er laughed, “If he were that insistent, I guarantee his leg tendons would have snapped by now. Do not trust them too easily. They are watching Second Aunt as if she were a bodhisattva, and you, being a bashful young lady, are merely riding on our coattails.” In a low voice, she added, “Now, go outside and let everyone frolic—when Grandmother is well, we shall discuss it further.” The wives outside all laughed. At that moment, Autumn (Qiu Wen) arrived. The wives quickly came forward to greet her, and she said, “Dear sisters, please rest awhile—the meal is being set out. Once the tables are cleared, we can resume our conversation.” Autumn laughed, “I have no time to wait!” and promptly headed for the main hall. Ping’er called out, “Come back quickly!” Autumn turned, saw Ping’er, and laughed, “What are you doing here, playing gatekeeper?” She then returned to sit on Ping’er’s mat.
Tan Chun’s anger gradually subsided, and she said to Ping’er, “I have a major matter that I have long meant to discuss with Grandmother. Once you have finished your meal, come quickly. Bao Yu’s dear sister is also here; let the four of us discuss it, and then ask Grandmother whether it is acceptable.” Ping’er agreed and went away. Fengjie then inquired, “Why should we take so long?” Ping’er, smiling, explained in detail the matter that had just occurred. Fengjie laughed, “Very good, very good! What a wonderful idea, dear Third Sister—but pity that fate has been so unkind, as if you were not born in Madam’s womb!” Ping’er replied with a smile, “Grandmother, you speak nonsense. She was not raised by Madam; can anyone dare to treat her differently from the others?” Fengjie sighed, “You do not understand! Although, in terms of being legitimate or otherwise, they are the same—but a daughter is never as good as a son. In marriage, there are those who are overly frivolous, and they are always quick to ask whether a girl is legitimate or not—dismissing the illegitimate at once. But little does anyone realize that a child born out of wedlock, if well-born in character, is worth a hundred times more than a legitimate child. Who knows? Perhaps an unfortunat­ely born one might choose wrongly, or a fortunate one might never choose the proper match.” She then leaned toward Ping’er and said, “You know, over these past few years I’ve invented so many cost-saving schemes that not a single family member has ever secretly resented me. Yet now I find myself riding a tiger—I see clearly but cannot help it. Moreover, with so many people leaving the house and so few returning, every little matter is still handled according to our ancestors’ old rules. And yet, the family’s revenue now is nowhere near what it once was; we have trimmed expenditures, and outsiders laugh at our thriftiness; even Grandmother and Madam feel slighted, and the servants grumble about our stinginess. If we do not quickly institute a regimen of frugality, in a few years we will have lost everything!”  Ping’er replied, “That’s exactly right! In the future there will be three or four daughters and two or three young masters—if one Old Lady is left, how can there be no more major affairs?”  Fengjie laughed, “I’ve thought of that too, and that is enough. Bao Yu and Lin Mei—if they marry, then there will be no need for official funds; Grandmother will provide enough. The Second Sister belongs to the eldest family branch and isn’t even counted here. That leaves three or four others; if we lavish each with 7,000–8,000 taels, and Brother Huan spends 3,000 taels on his wedding—if that isn’t sufficient, then trimming off even a penny will do. As for Grandmother’s own matters, everything will be provided, though miscellaneous expenses may total 3–5,000 taels. If we save even more, it will all come together eventually. I only worry that if more issues arise, it will be catastrophic. Let’s not worry about future matters—just eat your meal and listen to what they are discussing. This is my opportunity; I have long fretted over lacking someone to take charge. Although Bao Yu is here, he is not really one of us. Even the eldest sister is no help. The Second Sister is not even part of this household. Only the Fourth Sister remains. Lan and Huan are but scraggly little kittens that can only hide away in a warm kitchen or near a hearth. Truly, how can one have a respectable person born from one mother’s womb who behaves so outrageously? I cannot abide it! Now that he has that mindset, he must be aligned with him. Then, with him on our side, we won’t be alone. In terms of proper rites and the dictates of Heaven and human conscience, having him help out would ease our burden with Madam’s affairs. But if you take it as selfish scheming, I must retract and reconsider—if you pursue him relentlessly, people will eventually come to hate you. They will smile while hiding their knives, and if we—just four eyes and two hearts—are not cautious, we might inadvertently ruin everything. Seize the moment while it’s still swift; if he manages to make a move, then all our old resentments may be temporarily assuaged.
Gradually, she recovered. Meanwhile, a variety of fruits and vegetables were selected and sent over to Sister Feng, who returned a few items in kind. After the sisters had enjoyed their light refreshment, some sat, some stood, and others wandered outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each doing as they pleased while chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess, while Baochai and Xiuyun observed. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled beneath a cluster of flowers, murmuring softly to each other. Soon, a member of the Lin household arrived accompanied by a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the hall but instead knelt at the steps and kowtowed. Tanchun, having just lost a chess game and having accrued “two eyes” (a game term for losses), kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing for chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood for a long time; only when he later went to ask for tea did he notice the scene. He then pointed at the young wife and said, “This is Cai’er—the mother of little Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. Her speech is poor; I overheard a few words, and she dared not respond to the young mistress. She had to be brought forward for questioning.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just now, Grandmother was seen heading toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It matters not if we don’t report it—I’ll mention it later. In any case, let’s expel her for now and decide when the mistress returns.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing beneath the flowers, remarked quietly. Daiyu said, “Your third maid is so well-behaved—even though she is assigned certain duties, she hardly ever leaves her post. If only she were allowed a bit more freedom, she would soon command respect.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—when you were ill, she managed several matters for us. Now that this garden is divided among so many managers—even a stray blade of grass is accounted for—they have already reallocated several responsibilities just for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan every detail are most shrewd.” Daiyu said, “That is best. Yet we are expending too much effort. Although I do not meddle, when I have a moment, I tally things up; if expenditures exceed income, sooner or later there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us will never be short.” Daiyu then turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of freshly brewed tea, and asked, “Where are you two going? I see you haven’t had tea for a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I’ll pour more.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just enough to rinse my mouth is fine.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is plenty. Thank you.” She drank it all and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s nowhere to be seen.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed.
As for Grandmother’s own matters, everything will be provided, though miscellaneous expenses may total 3–5,000 taels. If we save even more, it will all come together eventually. I only worry that if more issues arise, it will be catastrophic. Let’s not worry about future matters—just eat your meal and listen to what they are discussing.

But if you take it as selfish scheming, I must retract and reconsider—if you pursue him relentlessly, people will eventually come to hate you.

Seize the moment while it’s still swift; if he manages to make a move, then all our old resentments may be temporarily assuaged. One more thing: I know you understand all this very well, though I fear you may not be able to keep it in your heart. Remember, even though he is a woman, she is exceedingly astute in all matters—she speaks with care. In fact, she is even more knowledgeable than I am. As the saying goes, ‘to capture a thief, one must first seize the ringleader.’ If she intends to set the rules, she will surely begin by targeting me; if she dares refute me, do not argue—simply be as respectful as possible and say that it is she who is being contradicted. Under no circumstances should you fear that I will lose face by confronting her.”  Before Ping’er could finish speaking, she burst out laughing, “You’ve completely got everyone confused! I was already ahead of the game, and now you’re just advising me!”  Fengjie laughed, “I only worry that your eyes and heart contain only me and nothing else, so I must remind you—now that you are already ahead, you understand better than I do. Isn’t it that you’re getting so worked up, talking ‘you’ and ‘I’ so much?”  Ping’er retorted, “You keep saying ‘you’! If you won’t listen, isn’t that akin to giving someone a good thrashing? Must I strike you again? Have you not tasted such blows on your face before?”  Fengjie laughed, “You little clumsy one—how many times must I hammer you? Look at how I am ill at the moment, yet you dare to sulk! Come, sit down; no one is around, and we’ll eat in proper fashion.”  With that, Fengjie motioned for Feng’er and two or three little maids to bring in a small low table. Xifeng herself ate only a bowl of bird’s-nest porridge accompanied by two dishes of exquisitely prepared small delicacies; the daily allowance of side dishes had been temporarily reduced. Then, Fengjie ordered Feng’er to serve Ping’er four standard side dishes on the table along with her rice. Ping’er bent one knee on the edge of the low platform, with half her body still standing below, and after eating and rinsing her mouth, she gave Feng’er some instructions before heading off to see Tan Chun. Soon after, the courtyard grew quiet as everyone dispersed. (To be continued in the next installment.)  Chapter 56  Investing in Improvements and Eliminating Shortcomings: Tanchun’s Initiative, Baochai’s Modest Contribution, All in Good Order  It happened that after Ping’er had eaten with Sister Feng and finished washing up, she went off to visit Tanchun. When she reached the courtyard she found it quiet—with every maid and old servant standing by the windows, attentively waiting. Entering the hall, she saw Tanchun, Li Wan, and a couple of other young ladies discussing household affairs.
If anything does happen, we cannot blame those outside.” Baoyu laughed, “So you know that recently our household has lost items?” Baochai replied, “You only know about the rose dew and poria snow—but there are others as well. In the future, if nothing goes missing, it will be our good fortune; if things do go missing, who knows how many will be implicated? You never meddle in these affairs, which is why I’m telling you now. Ping’er is very sensible—I already told her that with Grandmother away, she must be extra vigilant. If nothing untoward occurs, no one will lose face; but if something does, then the record will be set and Ping’er won’t be blamed. Just heed my words and be cautious. And don’t let this be told to a single other person.”  With that, they arrived at the Qin Fang Pavilion. There, by the edge of the pavilion, Xiren, Xiangling, the clerk, Qingwen, Miaoyue, the Flower Official, Ru Official, Lotus Officer, Bean Official, and several others were gathered watching the fish. When they saw them coming, someone called out, “The peony screen has been set up—hurry, take your seats!” Baochai and the others then led the group into one of the three small open halls of the Red Fragrance Courtyard, where even Aunt You had already been invited. Everyone was present except for Ping’er, who had gone out to receive gifts from the You, Lin, and other families; one gift followed another, as is the custom with the numerous relatives paying their respects. Ping’er busied herself distributing reward money and offering thanks; later she reported to Fengjie, accepting some items while refusing others, and giving away what she did accept. After a while—and only after Fengjie had finished her noodles—she changed clothes and returned to the garden. No sooner had she entered the garden than several maids came to fetch her; together they proceeded into the Red Fragrance Courtyard. The banquet was splendidly laid out on a tortoiseshell tray with lotus and hibiscus cushions, and everyone exclaimed, “The Longevity Star is complete!” At the top, four seats were reserved for four individuals, yet none would sit. Aunt Xue said, “Heavens, it does not suit your little group! I feel so constrained—I might as well retire to the hall and lie down for a while. I can’t eat much nor drink heavily; this arrangement is too awkward for me.” Aunt You and the others insisted otherwise. Baochai remarked, “That’s fine; let Mother relax in the hall. If she has an appetite, send some food over. Besides, no one outside is around to monitor.” Tanchun laughed, “In that case, obedience is as good as compliance.” They then escorted her to the meeting hall. After the young maids spread out a brocaded mat with cushions and pillows, Tanchun instructed, “Be sure to massage the Mistress’s feet. Provide tea and water without delay. Once you deliver the gifts, let the Mistress eat and reward you—and do not stray from here.” The little maids all agreed, and Tanchun and the others soon departed. Afterwards, Baoyu, Xiangyun, and the others sat at a table: Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Ping’er at one table (with Baoyu facing east and Ping’er facing west). Tanchun then called Yuanyang to join her side. At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was reserved for Aunt You and Li Wan, accompanied by Xiren and Caiyun. A final table was arranged for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun proposed that they perform a drinking game. Baoqin and four others remarked, “With all this commotion, we couldn’t possibly sit still all day!” Before long, two of the girls were scheduled to perform a song for the birthday, while others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes—go up and entertain the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue. Baoyu said, “A dignified seated celebration is dull—it is better to perform our ritual decrees.” Some suggested one type of decree; others suggested another.
Entering, he saw only Second Sister You with two maids, busy with needlework. Lady You and Third Sister were nowhere to be seen. Jia Lian quickly greeted her with a broad smile. Second Sister smiled in return and invited him to sit on the seat near the east wall, opposite her. After a few words of greeting, Jia Lian joked, “Where is Madam You? Where is Third Sister? I don’t see them.” Second Sister smiled, “They went to the back just a moment ago. They’ll be here soon.” While a maid went to fetch tea, Jia Lian stole glances at Second Sister. She lowered her head, smiling silently. Unsure whether to make a move, he asked coyly, “Could you spare a betel nut for me? I forgot my pouch today.” She replied, “I do have some, but I never give mine to others.” Jia Lian, grinning, leaned in to take it. Not wanting to seem improper if someone entered, she tossed him the pouch with a faint smile. Jia Lian took out the contents, finding half a chewed piece of betel nut, which he popped into his mouth. He stuffed the rest into his robe, intending to return the pouch in person. But the maids had arrived with tea, so he hesitated. While drinking, unnoticed by the maids, he slipped his own jade Nine-Dragon pendant onto her kerchief and slid it back to her. Second Sister kept her composure, leaving the kerchief where it lay, showing no reaction. Jia Lian began to panic, uncertain of her feelings, but before he could speak, Lady You and Third Sister arrived with two more maids. Jia Lian and Second Sister exchanged a parting glance, and he was relieved to see the kerchief had vanished. He rose to greet Lady You and Third Sister, then everyone sat and chatted politely. Jia Lian announced, “My sister-in-law said there was silver stored here a few days ago. Brother Zhen told me to come fetch it because we need to settle some debts.” Lady You asked Second Sister to bring the key to fetch the silver. Jia Lian explained, “I also wanted to pay my respects to Madam You and the two young ladies. I’ve been worried you might be inconvenienced living here.” Lady You smiled, “Don’t speak like that. We’re all close relatives. Whether we stay here or at home, it’s the same. Truth be told, ever since my late husband passed, we’ve relied on my son-in-law here. Now that the family is dealing with such a major event, how can we do anything but help? There’s no question of being inconvenienced.”  Second Sister soon returned with the silver and handed it to Lady You, who gave it to Jia Lian. He called a maid to summon an older woman and instructed, “Take this to Yu Lu—tell him to bring it to the other side and wait for me.” The woman obeyed and left. Moments later, Jia Rong’s voice was heard in the courtyard. He entered to pay his respects to his mother and aunts, then turned to Jia Lian, saying, “Father was asking for you just now, Uncle. He wondered if there was anything urgent. He was about to send someone for you.” Jia Lian rose at once. Jia Rong also teased his mother, “Last time, I told Grandmother that Father wanted to find a husband for Second Aunt just like Uncle here—Grandmother thought it was a good idea.” Laughing, he pointed at Jia Lian and nudged Second Sister with his eyes. Embarrassed, Second Sister said nothing. Third Sister, half-smiling and half-cross, scolded, “You little brat, you’re impossible! I can’t wait to tear your mouth off someday!” Jia Rong only laughed and ran off, with Jia Lian also smiling his farewells. Leaving the house, Jia Lian told the household stewards not to demand any “fees” from the merchants. He discreetly urged Jia Rong to talk to Jia Zhen about the proposal. He then caught up with Yu Lu, handed him enough silver to make up the debt, and headed off. After paying respects to Jia She and Grandmother Jia, he left the mansion. Jia Rong, finding himself free, returned inside to flirt with his two aunts. By evening he was back at the temple to report to Jia Zhen, “I’ve given the silver to Yu Lu.
If you’re forced to borrow money, you’ll be forever in debt—and our family’s honor would be at risk! How can you be so careless?” Jia Lian, stammering with both embarrassment and determination, replied, “Sister, if you have any silver to spare, even a few hundred taels would suffice. Surely, it won’t bring shame upon you!” Fengjie’s eyes flashed with indignation as she retorted, “Who cares about a few hundred taels? We must preserve my reputation at all costs. Besides, if our elders learn of this, I will be shamed for years to come!” At that moment, a servant came in with news: “Wang’er’s wife has arrived!” Fengjie then inquired, “Has it been settled?” The servant replied, “It has not worked out. I said that if our elders were to approve, it would be arranged—but they refused.” Jia Lian interjected, “It’s no big matter at all. It would be far better than what Cai’Xia (another candidate) offers.” Wang’er’s wife laughed, “Even though you say so, our family looks down upon us. After all, it is difficult to match a bride when one’s family is in such dire straits. It is hard enough to secure a proper match without interference.” Fengjie’s expression hardened as she exchanged looks with Jia Lian. “Then let us not delay—if our elders insist on it, we shall arrange it on my terms. Tomorrow, I will personally speak with them.” Jia Lian, concealing his inner thoughts, replied with a wry smile, “If you say so, I thank you.” Fengjie’s tone grew heated as she continued, “I don’t care if I must pay three or five thousand taels in silver. If it comes to it, I will settle every debt by any means necessary—nothing shall defame my reputation!” Jia Lian, half-chuckling and half-grimacing, said, “You speak as if you have no care in the world. But if you were to borrow silver—and if the sums ever exceed what we can repay—we might be in deep trouble!” Fengjie laughed scornfully, “You speak too lightly! I have a reputation to uphold. And what of it if I must spend three or five thousand taels? I am not afraid!” Jia Lian grinned ruefully, “I must admit, you have a way with money. But remember: if you end up owing too much, it may come back to haunt you. Better we settle matters now.” Fengjie dismissed him with a wave, “I won’t allow you to dictate my affairs! My reputation—and that of our family—must remain unsullied. Let the details be handled discreetly. Now, go, send the silver that our maids have hidden away, so we can cover the expenses.” At her bidding, Ping’er quickly retrieved a pair of gold neck rings from a small brocade box. When opened, one was a delicately wrought piece with strands of gold and pearls the size of lotus seeds; the other was inlaid with turquoise and embedded with precious stones. In short order, Ping’er returned with four hundred taels of silver. Fengjie then ordered the young pageboy to divide the amount, giving half to Wang’er’s wife so that it might be used for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The pageboy took his leave, and soon Jia Lian came out laughing, “When will these troubles ever end?” Fengjie replied coolly, “It is all unfolding so swiftly—just as if a fresh breeze has blown in.” Jia Lian mused, “Yesterday, Zhou the eunuch demanded one thousand taels; I hesitated, and he grew restless. In the future, if more trouble arises, it might be only a matter of a few tens of thousands.” He continued, “I refuse to borrow any money from you! Now, every word you utter seems to demand payment—what a burden!” Fengjie, unable to hide her exasperation, stood up abruptly and declared, “I will never spend my own money to cover your mistakes! Even if it means forfeiting every last penny, I will not allow our family’s honor to be sullied by your incompetence!” Jia Lian, trying to placate her, said, “Don’t be so harsh—if you decide to lend me a couple hundred taels, then we shall all be set.” Fengjie scoffed, “It is none of your concern!
Today, by chance, you discovered it; you must not tell a soul.” He then wept, “I cannot speak openly with you; just return and discreetly ask the Flower Official, and you’ll know.” With that, he left glumly. Puzzled by what he had heard, Baoyu slowly made his way back to the Xiangxiang Chamber. There he found Daiyu looking ever more fragile and pale; when he inquired, she admitted that although she felt better than before, memories of past events brought tears to her eyes. After a brief conversation, she urged Baoyu to rest and recuperate—and so he reluctantly returned. Still, he longed to ask the Flower Official for further explanation, but Xiangyun and Xiangling had arrived, chatting and laughing with Xiren and the Flower Official. Not wanting to be pestered again, Baoyu held his tongue. After a while, the Flower Official went with his adoptive mother to wash his hair; however, his adoptive mother insisted that her own daughter be washed first before calling for the Flower Official. Offended, the Flower Official remarked that she was being partial, “Using your daughter’s leftover water to wash me? My monthly allowance is all you withhold—and instead, you give me the scraps!” His adoptive mother, mortified and then angry, scolded, “You ungrateful wretch! No wonder everyone says that no actor in this trade is worth keeping. What good is there about you? Ever since you joined this line, you’ve gone to seed! Even a little brat could pick on you—your tongue is as sharp as a mule’s bite!” The two began to quarrel. Xiren quickly sent someone away, saying, “Stop all this clamor! Look—Grandmother is not home; if you all keep shouting, not even a word of calm can be heard!”  Jingwen then commented, “This is just the Flower Official being careless—he doesn’t know what he’s doing, pretending to be all theatrical, as if he has once captured a rebel king or caught a traitor.” Xiren retorted, “One hand alone can’t make a clap. The elders are too unjust, and the younger ones are just too hateful.”  Baoyu added, “It’s no wonder the Flower Official feels aggrieved. As the saying goes, ‘When things are not right, even things will cry out.’ He is orphaned and has no one to care for him, yet people take advantage of him and trample him—how can we blame him?” Then he leaned over to Xiren and said, “How much does he get a month, anyway? Perhaps you should take him in to care for him—it would simplify matters.”  Xiren replied, “I’d love to take care of him, but if I do, I’d have to extract his few coins as well—and that would only invite accusations.” With that she got up, went into another room, and returned with a bottle of floral oil, an egg, some scented soap, and a hair tie. She then summoned an old maid and said, “Take these to the Flower Official and tell him to fetch water and wash on his own—no more fussing!”  His adoptive mother, now thoroughly ashamed, told the Flower Official, “You heartless thing—you claim I withhold your money!” and proceeded to pat him a few times. The Flower Official burst into tears. Baoyu then stepped out, and Xiren tried to console, “What’s the matter? I’ll go and speak to him.” Jingwen rushed over and scolded his adoptive mother, “At your age, you really don’t know what you’re doing! If you don’t wash him properly, we end up having to provide him with extra things—and you, shameless as you are, still have the nerve to hit him! If he were still training in his art, would you dare strike him?”  The old maid retorted, “‘Once you call someone mother, they are yours for life.’ If he defies me, I’ll beat him.” Xiren then called to Miaoyue, “I’m not one to quarrel—quickly go over there and scare him a bit.” Miaoyue hurried over and said, “Don’t shout—I’ll ask you this: besides our own household, who here has ever been taught by their mistress in the master’s room?
And if I’m allowed to drink wine tonight without supervision, I’ll make sure I eat enough first. I plan to enjoy a couple of jin of fine Huiquan wine at home later. These days, though some claim that excessive drinking ruins the throat, I haven’t heard such a thing. Besides, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four cream-filled pastry pieces, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such food?” He mixed the soup with rice, ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then half a bowl of porridge, and stopped. Baoyu, smelling the food, thought it tasted better than usual, and so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found extremely fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the leftovers. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it’s not enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “There’s no need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve had enough; no more is needed.” She then stood by the table, finished her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for me.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen also drink well, although they’re usually too shy—today, since we’re breaking our fast together, it’s fine.” Baoyu then remembered another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s case. Please speak with the Liu household and insist that she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it, and that will be the end of it.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is indeed a proper matter.” Spring Yan then called in two little maids to help wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part need not be detailed further). Baoyu then resumed his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters, with the Flower Official following, carrying his fan. Just as they stepped out, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set up the meal—we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted his earlier encounter at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company—it would add to the merriment.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox, where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you manage it without informing us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow if everyone leaves and leaves the Flower Official alone, that’ll be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you simply cannot go!” Qingwen retorted, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will mend it? Don’t go babbling on. I’m not fussing over you—if you never help out, then what? You’ve been gone for days, nearly risking your life, yet still come back empty-handed—what’s the point?
Among themselves, they were all one family, so there was no need for formality. Bao Er approached to pay respects. Jia Zhen said, “You have a conscience; that’s why Second Master entrusted you to serve them. One day I’ll have even greater use for you. Don’t run around drinking and causing trouble. I’ll reward you when the time comes. If anything is lacking here, go tell me directly. We brothers are not like strangers.” Bao Er promised, “Yes, I understand. If I fail to do my best, may I lose my head.” Jia Zhen nodded with a smile, “It’s good that you know.”  Thus the four of them drank together. Second Sister, however, fearing that Jia Lian might suddenly appear and create an awkward situation, withdrew after two cups. Jia Zhen could do nothing about that and simply watched her leave. Madam You and Third Sister remained to keep him company. Though Third Sister would occasionally jest with Jia Zhen, she was not as agreeable and yielding as her elder sister, so despite his keen desire, Jia Zhen dared not push his luck and risk being rebuffed. Besides, with Madam You right there, he felt too self-conscious to act too forward. Meanwhile, the two young pages who had come with Jia Zhen were in the kitchen drinking with Bao Er. Bao Er’s wife, Mistress Duo, was busy at the stove. Suddenly two of Second Sister’s maids came in giggling, wanting a drink. Bao Er cautioned, “Girls, aren’t you supposed to be upstairs serving? You’re slipping away; what if someone calls you and no one’s there?” His wife scolded him, “You muddleheaded fool, you’ve drunk yourself stupid. What does it matter to you? If someone calls, I’ll handle it. Whatever storms blow, they won’t land on your head.”  Because Bao Er’s status before Jia Lian depended on his wife’s influence, he left everything to her. With that, he drank a bit more and went to bed. Mistress Duo then kept drinking with the maids and page boys, joking and flirting to please them, hoping this would help her curry favor with Jia Zhen. They were all enjoying themselves when suddenly came the sound of knocking at the gate. Mistress Duo hurried out to see who it was and found Jia Lian dismounting. He asked if anything was going on. She whispered, “The Master is here, in the west wing.” Jia Lian went at once to the bedchamber, where Second Sister was sitting with two young maids. Seeing him, her expression turned somewhat uneasy. Jia Lian pretended not to notice and said, “Bring wine quickly! Let’s have a couple of cups and then sleep. I’m quite worn out today.” Second Sister, with a forced laugh, helped him remove his coat, brought him tea, and asked about his day. Jia Lian was so enchanted by her attentions that his heart fluttered with pleasure. Not long after, Mistress Duo brought wine, and husband and wife drank face-to-face, the two maids serving on the floor beside them. Jia Lian’s personal page boy, Long’er, went to tie up his horse and noticed another horse already there. Examining it, he realized it belonged to Jia Zhen. Understanding the situation, he went to the kitchen, where he saw Xi’er and Shou’er, Jia Zhen’s two pages, drinking. They recognized what was happening and laughed. “You’ve come at just the right time. We couldn’t keep up with the Master’s horse and feared we’d be out after curfew, so we came here for a place to spend the night.” Long’er grinned, “Second Master sent me with his monthly silver for Madam. I’ve delivered it, and I’m not going back now.” Mistress Duo said, “No shortage of kangs here—why not all stay overnight?” Xi’er said, “We’ve had enough wine; you have some.” Long’er sat down with a cup, but just then the two horses in the stable began kicking at each other, refusing to share. Alarmed, the three set down their cups to separate the animals. Mistress Duo laughed, “Sleep well, all of you—I’m off.” The three tried to block her from leaving, pawing at her and joking rudely.
Then, Fengjie ordered Feng’er to serve Ping’er four standard side dishes on the table along with her rice. Ping’er bent one knee on the edge of the low platform, with half her body still standing below, and after eating and rinsing her mouth, she gave Feng’er some instructions before heading off to see Tan Chun. Soon after, the courtyard grew quiet as everyone dispersed. (To be continued in the next installment.)  Chapter 56  Investing in Improvements and Eliminating Shortcomings: Tanchun’s Initiative, Baochai’s Modest Contribution, All in Good Order  It happened that after Ping’er had eaten with Sister Feng and finished washing up, she went off to visit Tanchun. When she reached the courtyard she found it quiet—with every maid and old servant standing by the windows, attentively waiting. Entering the hall, she saw Tanchun, Li Wan, and a couple of other young ladies discussing household affairs. Their conversation turned to the upcoming banquet that the household was to host before the end of the year, and also the various happenings in the garden. Noticing Ping’er’s arrival, Tanchun ordered her to take a seat. “You see,” she began, “my concern is not for any grand matter but something as small as the two taels of oil and rouge we use each month. We already have two taels of monthly silver, and the maidservants receive their own pocket money separately. Isn’t that just like the eight taels we just talked about—layered upon one another? Though this seems trivial, given our limited funds it appears rather improper. Why didn’t your grandmother think of this?”  Ping’er smiled and explained, “There is a reason. The items the young ladies use should have a set allowance. Every month a designated buyer is commissioned to purchase them, and the women deliver the goods to us for safekeeping, strictly for the ladies’ use. They aren’t carrying cash around daily to buy these things. Instead, the outside buyer collects the funds from the women in each room every month. As for the two taels for the young ladies, it was never meant to cover these items; it was meant for those moments when the lady in charge is either away or too busy. It’s merely to ensure that the young ladies aren’t inconvenienced. Yet, looking around, I see that in many rooms our sisters are buying these items directly with cash. It appears that either the buyer is pocketing the money or is providing substandard goods.”  Both Tanchun and Li Wan laughed. “You’ve observed it well,” they said. “It isn’t that the buyer is ‘stealing’ the funds; it’s just that when pressed for time later on, they scramble to obtain something—anything—that merely carries a name. In truth, such items are unusable; we would still have to purchase fresh ones for two taels of silver, having someone else’s servant’s brother fetch them. Even if the official buyers were sent, they’d end up the same way—we just never know what scheme they’re up to.”  Ping’er added with a laugh, “What the buyers purchase is not what we need. When others buy genuine goods, the buyers refuse to accept them, accusing them of foul play and trying to wrest control of their commission. So they’d rather offend someone in-house than jeopardize their external business. If the young ladies were to use the servants’ own purchasing channels, then no one would dare criticize.”  Tanchun continued, “That unsettles my heart. We’re wasting two taels, and half of our supplies go to waste. Why not simply dispense with the buyer’s portion every month? That’s the first matter. The second is the banquet we’re to hold for everyone this year—and you shall be there too. Look at that small garden over there; how does it compare to ours?”  Ping’er laughed, “It isn’t even half the size of ours, and it has far fewer trees and flowers.”  Tanchun explained, “I was chatting casually with a girl from that household, and she mentioned that aside from the flowers they grow, they also harvest edible bamboo shoots, vegetables, fish, and shrimp from their garden. In fact, by year’s end there is a surplus amounting to two hundred taels of silver! From that day I learned that even a single broken lotus leaf or a withered blade of grass can be valuable.”  Baochai smiled and said, “Truly the language of refined luxury!
I cannot abide ‘She Fu’—it leaves me in low spirits; I’d rather play rock–paper–scissors.” Tanchun replied, “If anyone’s unable to recite the decree properly after three attempts, they must drink a cup as penalty!” Baochai, unwilling to let it drop, quickly poured a cup for Xiangyun. Tanchun then announced, “I will have a cup as well; I am in charge of these decrees. No elaborate proclamation is needed—just listen as I assign them. Fetch a dice bowl from the instrument table, and have Sister Qin toss the dice. Whoever draws the designated number for ‘She Fu’ must answer our decree.” Baochai tossed her dice and obtained a three. Xiuyun, Baoyu, and the others tossed, but none matched until Xiangling finally threw a three. Baochai laughed, “It seems that spring has been born indoors; if we compared with the outside, it would be chaos!” Tanchun said, “Naturally. Anyone who fails three times in a row shall be penalized with a cup. Now, respond to my decree.” Baochai thought for a moment and pronounced the word “Old.” Xiangling, however, having grown up with such games, could not immediately produce an appropriate phrase—no idiom involving ‘old’ came to mind. Xiangyun scanned the room and suddenly noticed on the door a plaque bearing “Hong Xiang Pu” (Red Fragrance Garden), deducing that Baochai must have intended the “garden” radical. Seeing Xiangling falter, the others quietly coaxed her, teaching her to say “Yao” (medicine) instead. Daiyu then urged, “Quick—punish her! We must prevent these rumors from spreading!” Amid the commotion, Xiangling was penalized with a cup of wine. Later, Baochai and Tanchun exchanged lots; Tanchun drew the character “Ren” (person). Baochai laughed, “That character is too generic.” Tanchun replied, “If we add another character, the combined phrase won’t be so bland.” Then she declared another lot: “Chuang” (window). Baochai, pondering this, noted that since there were chickens at the table, perhaps it alluded to the idiom “Ji Chuang, Ji Ren” (“the chicken’s window, the chicken’s person”)—and he guessed the word “Shi” (threshold). Tanchun, realizing his intended meaning, smiled and sipped her drink. Soon Xiangyun and the others began a lively game of fist and guess. Outside, Aunt You and Yuanyang—seated separately—also played by calling out numbers. Ping’er and Xiren paired up as well, and the tinkling of bracelets filled the air. Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu, while Xiren outdid Ping’er; rounds of toasts were exchanged. Xiangyun then declared, “For the verse upon our toast, we require one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one drawn from domino names, one from tune titles, and one from an official decree—all to form a complete verse. And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal dish or fruit.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so long-winded—but they have a certain charm.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did so, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, Fierce winds sweep the river and sky as geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul time and again; such is the welcome for a returning guest.” Everyone burst into laughter at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut and recited for the base:  “Hazelnuts are not produced by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence comes the clamor of a thousand households pounding laundry?” Thus the round was concluded. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting familiar proverbs—each including the character “longevity”—with no further embellishment.
She ordered Baoyu to turn away while she carefully untied and re-fastened it. Xiren said, “Hand this soiled skirt over to me and I’ll have it cleaned and returned to you. If you see it later, you can ask about it again.” Xiangling replied, “Very well, Sister—take it, but do not give it to that other girl. I’m done with it.” Xiren responded, “You are so generous!” Xiangling then knelt twice in thanks before Xiren took the muddy skirt away. Later, Baoyu was found squatting at a spot where, using a twig, he had dug a small pit. He had gathered fallen blossoms to line it, arranged the lotus and ‘Hui’ flowers, and then covered them with soil to press them down. Xiangling grabbed his hand and laughed, “What are you doing? Everyone says you’re such a sneaky little fellow who makes others blush. Look at your hands—they’re all muddied and slippery with moss; you’d better wash them off!” Baoyu laughed and got up to wash his hands. Xiangling then walked away. After a few steps, she turned back and called to Baoyu. Not sure what she wished to say, he approached with a playful smile and asked, “What is it?” Xiangling blushed deeply, laughing as she tried to speak but found no words. At that moment, a little maid named Zhen’er arrived and said, “Second Sister is waiting for you to speak.” Xiangling’s face grew even redder as she said to Baoyu, “Just do not mention this skirt matter to your brother—let’s leave it at that.” With that, she turned and left. Baoyu laughed, “Am I mad? You’re practically sticking your head into a lion’s den!” He then returned to his room. To learn the full details of these intrigues and playful exchanges, we must await the next chapter… Chapter 72 Wang Xifeng Uses Her Authority to Feign Illness and Humiliate Others; The Wife of Wang’s Associate Leverages Her Position to Force a Marriage  It all began when Yuanyang (Yuan‑niang) left through the side gate, her face still flushed and her heart pounding uncontrollably—a most unexpected turn of events. Fearing that if she were to speak of what had happened it might implicate others in scandalous misdeeds and endanger lives, she resolved to keep it to herself. Instead, she quietly returned to her room to carry out Grandmother Jia’s orders so that everyone might rest without further mention of the incident. Meanwhile, Sīqí—who, since childhood, had grown up playing with her male cousins—once in youthful jest had sworn never to marry. Now, having matured into a young woman of remarkable looks and charm, she and her cousin found themselves flirting in secret whenever they met. Yet both feared their parents’ disapproval, so they contrived to have the household maidservants keep watch at the door. On this eventful day, amid the usual bustle, Sīqí had come in from outside for the first time; though not yet officially paired, the two had exchanged private vows and affectionate promises, pledging everlasting devotion. But when Yuanyang inadvertently startled them, the young pageboy—who had been dashing along in the corridor—hurried out the door. Sīqí, unable to sleep that night and later regretful for not having followed through, became distraught. The next day, when she encountered Yuanyang again, her face alternated between embarrassment and distress; she could not bear the situation, and her heart grew heavy with dark thoughts. Her appetite vanished, and for two days she barely ate. Finally, one evening a servant woman slipped in a hushed message: “Your cousin has run off—no one has seen him for three or four days. They are sending people to search everywhere.” Sīqí was stricken with anger and sorrow; she bitterly mused, “Even if his scandal were to break out, he deserves to perish for his iniquity—truly, a man devoid of true feeling will flee at the first sign of trouble.” Her distress deepened until, on the following day, her heart grew so heavy that she could no longer bear it. Overwhelmed, she collapsed into bed, languid and stricken with illness. Word soon spread among the servants that a pageboy had inexplicably vanished and that Sīqí was gravely ill, prompting rumors that the two incidents were connected—a fact which the staff believed was hidden so as not to implicate them in further disgrace.
Although the external symptoms of the infection have lightened, the loss of proper nourishment from the sweating has upset her balance; this is not a trifling matter.” As he spoke, he stepped out and returned with a prescription. Bao Yu saw that many of the dispersing and exorcism-type drugs had been reduced, while tonics such as Poria, Rehmannia, and Angelica had been added to nourish the spirit and blood. Rushing to have the medicine decocted, Bao Yu sighed, “What shall we do? It seems, in the end, all is my own fault!”  Qingwen, lying on her pillow, replied, “Dear Second Young Master, you go on with your work. It is not as if I have contracted consumption!”  Bao Yu, at his wit’s end, had no choice but to leave. Later that afternoon, feeling that his condition was worsening, he returned. Although Qingwen’s illness was severe, her natural habit of exerting strength without engaging her heart—and her long-practiced, frugal diet which had protected her from hunger—meant that even the notorious “secret methods” in the Jia household, whether for the servants above or below, usually resulted only in a mild wind-cold or cough that was treated chiefly by fasting and modest medicine. Thus, when she had fallen ill the previous day, she had fasted for two or three days and taken her medicine very cautiously. Now, though fatigued by recent labors and having been under additional care for several days, she was gradually recovering. In recent days the sisters in the garden had been eating and enjoying their meals with ease—and Bao Yu himself could regulate his own broth without fuss (details need not be recounted). After Xiangren had seen off her own mother’s funeral, she had returned. Meiyue then informed her about the incident with the lost bracelet—how “Qingwen had been driven out by her and later Bao Yu had been told of it,” and so on. Xiangren merely remarked, “She is always so impatient.”  Meanwhile, Li Wan too had caught a cold from the wintry weather; Mrs. Xing was on high alert, and Yingchun and Xiuyan had all gone to attend to their medicines; while Aunt Li’s younger brother had taken Aunt Li, Li Wen, and Li Qi away to stay for a few days. With Xiangren so often melancholic over missing her own mother and Qingwen still not fully recovered, the poetry society had lost its usual lively spirit and a few gatherings were cancelled. Now it was the final month of the lunar year, and New Year’s was near. Mrs. Wang and Fengjie busied themselves with the year-end preparations. (Not to mention that Prince Zi had been promoted to a supervisory post over nine provinces, and Jia Yucun had been appointed as a high-ranking official—details need not be repeated.)  At Ningguo Mansion the ancestral shrine was being prepared: workers were busy cleaning and tidying the shrine, setting out the ritual implements, inviting the ancestral tablets, and arranging the upper halls so that the genuine portraits of the ancestors might be hung for the ceremony. At that moment both the Rongguo and Ningguo mansions, inside and out, were abuzz with activity. That day in the Ning Mansion, Mrs. You arose and, together with Jia Rong’s wife, arranged to deliver needlework gifts to Grandmother. At the same time a little maid arrived carrying a tea tray along with the New Year “money” (small ingots) as a token. She reported, “Xing’er has returned to Grandmother; also, that broken gold collection from before – altogether, it weighs 153 taels, 6 qian, and 7 fen, with pieces of varying purity – has yielded a total of 220 ingots.” She then handed them over. Mrs. You inspected the items and saw designs of plum blossoms, of begonia, of “Pen-Stroke Ruyi,” and of “Eight Treasures in Spring”; she ordered, “Pack these away and have Xing’er hurry and deliver the silver ingots.” The maid answered and went off. Before long Jia Zhen entered to eat. Jia Rong’s wife stayed aside. Jia Zhen then asked Mrs. You, “Have we received the New Year’s tribute for the spring sacrifice yet?” Mrs. You replied, “I have sent Rong’er away with it.” Jia Zhen said, “Even though our family does not require many taels of silver, we must accept the imperial grace.
In a few years, once you’re married, who will there be left in your eyes?”  Startled, Baoyu asked, “Who is arranged? Arranged with whom?”  Huizi smiled, “I heard that Grandmother plans to arrange a match for Sister Qin—would she not cherish her so much?”  Baoyu laughed bitterly, “Everyone calls me foolish—but you, you’re even sillier! It was just a throwaway remark. He’s already promised her to the Meihanglin family. If it is indeed arranged, then am I doomed to remain as I am? Didn’t I swear and curse, smashing this contraption—didn’t you try to dissuade me? I’ve only just recovered from these recent days of illness, and now you provoke me!” He went on, gritting his teeth, “I only wish that at this very moment I could die—the moment my heart bursts out, that you all may see it. Then, with both skin and bone reduced to ashes, blown away by a great gust of wind in all directions, it would be best!” Tears flowed once more. Huizi quickly grasped his mouth, wiping away his tears and laughing to explain, “There’s no need to be in such a hurry. It is merely that I was anxious about him, so I wanted to test you. Who would have thought you’d take it so seriously?”  Baoyu, astonished, asked, “What exactly are you anxious about now?”  Huizi smiled, “You know I am not from the Lin family—I’m in the same group as Xiren and Yuanyang. Yet Lin, of all people, has taken me under his wing; he is so dear to me—ten times better than the one he brought from Suzhou. We are inseparable by the hour. But now I am troubled: if he were to leave, I would have to follow him. I belong to my original family; if I do not go, it would betray our longstanding affection. But if I go, I would abandon my own family. I was in a quandary—which is why I told you that false story to see your reaction, and who knew you’d take it as truth!”  Baoyu laughed and said, “So it’s you who is troubled—and therefore you’re the foolish one! From now on, cease your worrying. I’ll tell you something emphatic: if we live, we live together; if we perish, may we both turn to dust and smoke, scattered by the wind in all directions—how about that?”  Huizi, taking his words to heart, secretly began to plan. Just then someone announced, “Huan Ye and Lan Ge are sending their regards.”  Baoyu said, “Tell them I’m having difficulty sleeping—no need for them to come in.” A maid went off to deliver the message. Huizi smiled and said, “You’re better now; it’s time for me to return and see what’s become of my own family.”  Baoyu replied, “That’s exactly it. I meant to call you last night but forgot. I’m quite well now—please go.”  Hearing this, Huizi went to pack her belongings—dress, jewelry, and the like. Baoyu, smiling, added, “I saw that among your writing utensils there are two or three small mirrors. Keep the one with the little diamond pattern for me. I’ll place it beside my pillow so that when I sleep I can see my reflection; and when I go out tomorrow it will be handy.”  Upon hearing this, Huizi had no choice but to leave one mirror with him. After sending her things away with servants, she bade farewell to everyone and returned to the Xiangxiang Chamber. In recent days, hearing of Baoyu’s strange condition had only added to Daiyu’s own ailments, and she wept several times. Today when Huizi came asking about the cause, she learned that although he was largely recovered, she still sent Amber to attend to Grandmother Jia. Later that night, when all was quiet and Huizi had disrobed and laid down, she whispered to Daiyu with a smile, “Baoyu’s heart is true—when he hears that we are coming, he falls ill like this.” Daiyu offered no reply.
Why not tell the buyers to sew little gauze bags for each cluster? They let in air but keep the fruit safe.” The old maid exclaimed, “That’s a fine idea! This is my first year on orchard duty, so I never knew such a trick.” She laughed. “Though some fruit is spoiling, the taste is good. Would you like me to pick one for you to try?” Xiren replied firmly, “That wouldn’t be right. Not only are they not fully ripe yet, but they also haven’t been offered at table. How can we eat them first? You’ve worked here a long time—surely you know this rule.” The old maid hurriedly apologized, “Yes, yes. I saw you looking fondly at them, so I overstepped. I must be getting senile.” Xiren said, “It’s fine—just make sure you older folks aren’t the first to break the rules.”  She continued out of the garden and arrived at Wang Xifeng’s courtyard. As soon as she entered, she heard Wang Xifeng exclaim, “Heaven help me—I’m roasting alive in here, practically like a thief!” Xiren realized something serious must have happened. She couldn’t leave after coming this far, yet she was uncomfortable going in, so she stamped her footsteps more audibly. Outside the window, she called, “Sister Ping, are you there?” Ping’er responded from inside and came out. Xiren asked, “Is Mistress Lian home? Is she feeling better?” With that, she walked in. Wang Xifeng had been lying down but stood up when she saw Xiren, smiling. “I’m better now, thank you for worrying. Why haven’t you come by the past few days?” Xiren said, “I knew you were unwell. I should have come daily to pay respects, but I worried you needed rest and that visiting might disturb you.” Waving a hand, Wang Xifeng said, “Disturb? Nonsense. It’s just that, in Master Bao’s household, though the staff is large, you’re the one who truly looks after him. He can’t do without you. I’ve often heard Ping’er say that you think of me behind my back, frequently asking after my health. That’s real devotion.” She told Ping’er to move a stool next to the bed and motioned for Xiren to sit. Feng’er brought tea, and Xiren gestured politely, “Let Sister Feng’er sit.”  They were chatting idly when a little maid tiptoed in from the outer room and whispered to Ping’er, “Wang’er is here, waiting by the second gate.” Ping’er quietly replied, “Got it. Have him wait outside for now. He can come back later—no need for him to hang around the doorway.” Xiren realized they had private matters to discuss, so after exchanging a few more words, she rose to leave. Wang Xifeng said, “Stay a while and chat, so I won’t be so bored.” Then she told Ping’er, “See her out.” Ping’er complied, escorting Xiren. They saw two or three little maids standing there, quiet and watchful. Wondering what was happening, Xiren went on her way. Ping’er returned and reported, “Wang’er came just now. I told him to wait outside because Xiren was here. Shall I call him right in, or wait?” Wang Xifeng said, “Bring him.” Ping’er ordered a maid to summon Wang’er. Meanwhile, Wang Xifeng asked Ping’er again, “Exactly what did you hear?” Ping’er answered, “Just what that little maid said: she was at the second gate and overheard two young men outside saying, ‘This new Second Madam is even prettier than our old Second Madam, and she’s nicer, too.’ Not sure who Wang’er is, but he scolded them, ‘What’s this talk of old and new Madams? Quiet down, or if the household hears, you’ll lose your tongues!’” Ping’er had just finished explaining when a maid came in announcing, “Wang’er is here.” Wang Xifeng gave a cold chuckle.
Once you deliver the gifts, let the Mistress eat and reward you—and do not stray from here.” The little maids all agreed, and Tanchun and the others soon departed. Afterwards, Baoyu, Xiangyun, and the others sat at a table: Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Ping’er at one table (with Baoyu facing east and Ping’er facing west). Tanchun then called Yuanyang to join her side. At another table, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Yingchun, and Xichun sat in order, with Xiangling and Yuchuan placed side by side. A fourth table was reserved for Aunt You and Li Wan, accompanied by Xiren and Caiyun. A final table was arranged for Ziyuan, Ying’er, Jingwen, Xiao Luo, and Siqi, who sat together in a circle. After a while, Tanchun proposed that they perform a drinking game. Baoqin and four others remarked, “With all this commotion, we couldn’t possibly sit still all day!” Before long, two of the girls were scheduled to perform a song for the birthday, while others said, “There’s no one here to listen to such rustic tunes—go up and entertain the Mistress instead.” Meanwhile, various delicacies were gathered and sent over to Aunt Xue. Baoyu said, “A dignified seated celebration is dull—it is better to perform our ritual decrees.” Some suggested one type of decree; others suggested another. Daiyu remarked, “I propose that we write down all these various decrees on brush and ink, draw lots, and whoever’s chosen shall be the one. That will settle it!” Everyone exclaimed, “Splendid!” and they fetched a set of brush, ink, and floral stationery. Recently, Xiangling had been learning poetry and calligraphy; when she saw the materials she eagerly volunteered, “I’ll write!” After a short discussion, they ended up with about ten lots. They tossed the lots into a bottle, and Tanchun ordered Ping’er to draw one. Mixing them up with a stick, Ping’er pulled one out; when unwrapped, it bore the two characters “She Fu” (meaning “to play guessing games”). Baochai laughed, “You’ve drawn the old decree—‘She Fu’ is an ancient game now lost to time. It is so obscure that half the people won’t understand it. It might as well be discarded; let’s draw a new one that everyone, both refined and popular, can appreciate.” Tanchun laughed, “Once one is drawn, how can we destroy it? If we draw another, and it turns out pleasing, then let that be our decree.” She then had Xiren draw another lot, which came out as “Mu Zhan” (“Thumb Battle”). Xiangyun laughed, “That is crisp and to the point—it suits my taste perfectly. I cannot abide ‘She Fu’—it leaves me gloomy; I’d rather simply play rock–paper–scissors.” Tanchun said, “If he fails to recite the decree properly, Sister Baoqin should penalize him with a cup of wine!” Baochai, not willing to let the matter drop, quickly poured a cup for Xiangyun. Tanchun then announced, “I will have a cup as well; I am the official in charge of these decrees. No formal announcement is needed—just listen as I assign them. Fetch a dice bowl and let Sister Qin toss the dice. Whoever draws the number designated for ‘She Fu’ must accept the decree.” Baoqin tossed her dice and obtained a three. Xiuyun, Baoyu, and the others tossed but none hit the mark until Xiangling finally tossed a three. Baoqin laughed, “It seems that spring is born indoors—if we were to compare with the outside, it would be too chaotic.” Tanchun said, “Naturally. Anyone who fails three times in a row shall be penalized with a cup. Now, answer my decree.” Baoqin thought for a moment and pronounced the word “Old.” Xiangling, however, having grown up with such games, could not immediately think of an appropriate phrase—no idiom involving “old” came to mind. Xiangyun scanned the room and suddenly noticed on the door a plaque with the words “Hong Xiang Pu” (Red Fragrance Garden), and deduced that Baoqin must have meant the “garden” radical.
According to the seasons, apart from what is allotted for household use, any surplus may be taken by you to earn a profit. At the end of the year we will settle accounts.”  Tanchun laughed, “I just recalled another matter. If we settle accounts at the year’s end, naturally the money will be funneled back into the treasury—adding yet another layer of control by those above, who will in effect take another cut. By initiating this project now and assigning you to manage it, we are effectively bypassing their control. I cannot help but feel that when you finally settle accounts at year-end they will still find ways to impose their schemes. Moreover, during the year, for any matter under management, the principal receives one share while they get half a share—this is the long-established custom known to all. Now, since the garden is my new creation, it would be best if the final accounts come out before they have their way.”  Baochai laughed, “In my opinion, there should be no need to settle accounts internally. If one person gets more and another less, it only creates more trouble. Why not simply ask who is responsible for each share, and let him take charge of that particular matter? After all, it concerns only the garden’s personnel. I have calculated that there are only a few categories—the oil, rouge, perfume, and paper—each young lady and her attendant have fixed allowances. In addition, there are brooms, dustpans, and brushes, as well as grain for the various birds and small animals. All these items have already been contracted out, and there is no need for the treasury to dispense money. Think of how much could be saved!”  Ping’er laughed, “Although these categories seem small, when totaled over the year they can save over four hundred taels of silver.”  Baochai smiled, “Indeed—four hundred a year, eight hundred in two years. With that sum, we could buy a few more rental houses or add several acres of sandy land. Admittedly, there may be some surplus, but having worked so hard all year, the workers deserve to keep a little extra for themselves. Though our project is one of prudence and profit, we cannot be too stingy; saving an extra two or three hundred taels at the expense of overall decorum would be unseemly. In this way, if the official treasury has four or five hundred taels less per year, it won’t seem excessively miserly; meanwhile, those inside will also get a modest bonus. The caretakers—these unprofitable old maids—will also be better off! The garden’s flowers and trees will be able to flourish year after year; and even you, the young ladies, will have items at your disposal. This approach does not compromise the overall dignity. If we were simply to pinch pennies, how could we possibly amass a significant sum? Once any surplus is diverted entirely to the officials, both inside and out there would be complaints—and our family’s reputation would suffer. Now, if these several dozen veteran maids in the garden are given only these few items, the remainder will surely be seen as unfair. I even propose that aside from these items, each one of you, regardless of whether you have a surplus or not, contribute a small amount of money—a “bit of hanging money,” so to speak—so that, pooled together, it can be distributed to these maids in the garden. Though they do not manage the accounts, they are ever present in the garden, keeping watch: those on duty open and close the gates, rising early and retiring late, in rain or snow, assisting the young ladies with carrying sedan chairs, operating boats, hauling beds—the heavy tasks all fall to them. After a hard year in the garden, since they have earned a share of the benefit, it is only proper that they receive something extra. Moreover, if you all enjoy surplus while giving them nothing, though they dare not openly complain, in their hearts they will feel aggrieved. All too often, by abusing their authority under the guise of public duty, they pick your fruits or pluck your flowers, leaving you with grievances that have no outlet. They too should partake in the profits, caring for those matters you might overlook.”  The old maids, upon hearing these discussions, went back to the treasury to accept their allocations. Not having to account with Sister Feng over the final sums, they each happily took home a small extra allowance—cheering in unison, “Agreed! It is far better than being pressed by them to surrender our money. The land managers, hearing that they will receive unearned money at the end of the year, will all be pleased—and they will say, ‘They have labored hard in tidying up; they deserve to keep a little for themselves.
My life belongs to you, and in death I’ll be your spirit. Now that we’re man and wife, you’re the one I rely on for all my days. How could I hide anything from you? Yes, I feel secure here, but what of my little sister? A setup like this can’t last forever. We need a plan for the long run.”  Jia Lian laughed, “Don’t worry—I’m not the jealous type. I know all about your earlier affairs, so don’t think you must hide them. Since you’ve come to me, naturally my elder brother must be discreet. In my view, why not let Third Sister marry my elder brother, so neither of you is hindered? We’d all share our good times together. Isn’t that best?”  Second Sister wiped her tears and said, “Though your intentions are kind, first there’s my third sister’s temper to consider; second, your elder brother might be embarrassed. It’s not so simple.” Jia Lian answered, “That’s no obstacle at all. Let’s settle it now. I’ll go over there right this moment and make things happen.”  Half-drunk with boldness, Jia Lian rose and headed to the west wing. Light shone through the window. He pushed the door open and called, “Elder brother, are you here? I’m here to greet you.” Jia Zhen, startled, turned pale at hearing Jia Lian’s voice. Seeing him come in, Jia Zhen felt a flush of shame. Madam You also looked mortified. Jia Lian laughed, “What’s there to feel awkward about? We’ve been like this for ages, as close as brothers can be. You’ve done so much for me. If you act uneasy, I feel guilty. I just hope you’ll treat me the same as always; otherwise, I’d rather never come here again.” He moved to kneel, and Jia Zhen hurriedly grabbed him and insisted, “Don’t say such things, brother. I’ve no choice but to accept your goodwill.”  Jia Lian then called, “Someone bring wine! Let me have a few cups with Elder Brother.” With a mischievous grin he said to Third Sister, “Why not drink a double-cup of wine with Elder Brother? I too want to toast you both and offer my congratulations!”  Third Sister leaped up onto the kang, pointing at Jia Lian with a mocking smile, “Don’t try your fancy talk on me! I’m too clearheaded for that. Better keep the show going without pricking the thin paper screen. Don’t imagine we’re ignorant of the doings in your mansion. You spend a little money, you two brothers treat my sister and me as though we were mere courtesans for your pleasure. You’ve made a mistake. I know all about your wife’s viciousness. Now you’ve tricked my sister into becoming your second wife, but like the proverb says, ‘A stolen drum can’t be beaten openly.’ I’d like to meet this Lady Feng and see if she has extra heads and extra arms. If she’s reasonable, fine; but if she dares act high and mighty, I’ll slice out the gall from you two dogs and then fight her to the death! Afraid of some wine? Let’s drink, then!”  With that, she picked up the wine pot, filled a cup, drank half, yanked Jia Lian toward her, and tried to pour the rest down his throat. Terrified, he sobered instantly. Jia Zhen, too, never expected Third Sister to be so blunt. The two men—normally so smooth in flirtation—were left speechless by this barrage. Seeing them tongue-tied only spurred Third Sister on. She shouted, “Bring my sister! If we’re going to have fun, let’s all have fun together—four of us! As the saying goes, ‘Nothing’s cheaper than family property.’ You two are brothers, we two are sisters; we’re not outsiders, so come on!” Mortified, Madam You felt this had gone too far. Jia Zhen tried to slip away, but Third Sister blocked him. Now Jia Zhen regretted getting involved.
Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of freshly brewed tea, and asked, “Where are you two going? I see you haven’t had tea for a while—you poured two pots, and then he left!” Baoyu said, “Is that not for him? Please deliver it to him.” With that, he took one pot for himself. Xiren then carried the other pot to Baochai, saying, “Whoever drinks first, take your share; then I’ll pour more.” Baochai laughed, “I’m not much for drinking—just enough to rinse my mouth is fine.” She took a small sip, leaving half a cup, and handed it to Daiyu. Xiren offered to pour another pot. Daiyu said, “You know my condition—the doctor forbids too much tea; this half cup is plenty. Thank you.” She drank it all and set the cup aside. Xiren then went to collect Baoyu’s cup. Baoyu asked, “Where has the Flower Official been? I haven’t seen him for hours!” Xiren looked around and said, “He was right here; a few people were playing with grass outside—and now he’s nowhere to be seen.” Alarmed, Baoyu hurried back to his room and found the Flower Official asleep on his bed. Baoyu nudged him, “Don’t sleep—let’s go have some fun outside. Later, we’ll have a proper meal.” The Flower Official replied, “You all drink wine and ignore me; I end up getting bored and fall asleep.” Baoyu pulled him up, laughing, “We’ll dine again tonight at home. When we return, I’ll ask Sister Xiren to bring you to the table—how about that?” The Flower Official said, “Neither Lotus Officer nor Ru Official are coming up; it would be awkward for me to be alone. Besides, I’m not fond of that noodle dish—I didn’t eat properly this morning. I’m already hungry. I had told Aunt Liu earlier to prepare a bowl of soup and half a bowl of polished rice for me, so that once I eat, it will be enough. And if I’m allowed to drink wine tonight without supervision, I’ll make sure I eat enough first. I plan to enjoy a couple of jin of fine Huiquan wine at home later. These days, though some claim that too much tea ruins the throat, I haven’t heard such a thing. Moreover, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four cream-filled pastry pieces, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such fare?” He mixed the soup with rice, ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then half a bowl of porridge, and ceased eating. Baoyu, upon smelling the food, thought it tasted better than usual, so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found extremely fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the leftovers. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it isn’t enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “There’s no need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve already had my fill; no more is needed.” She then stood by the table, finished her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for myself.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily.
Xiangren merely remarked, “She is always so impatient.”  Meanwhile, Li Wan too had caught a cold from the wintry weather; Mrs. Xing was on high alert, and Yingchun and Xiuyan had all gone to attend to their medicines; while Aunt Li’s younger brother had taken Aunt Li, Li Wen, and Li Qi away to stay for a few days. With Xiangren so often melancholic over missing her own mother and Qingwen still not fully recovered, the poetry society had lost its usual lively spirit and a few gatherings were cancelled. Now it was the final month of the lunar year, and New Year’s was near. Mrs. Wang and Fengjie busied themselves with the year-end preparations. (Not to mention that Prince Zi had been promoted to a supervisory post over nine provinces, and Jia Yucun had been appointed as a high-ranking official—details need not be repeated.)  At Ningguo Mansion the ancestral shrine was being prepared: workers were busy cleaning and tidying the shrine, setting out the ritual implements, inviting the ancestral tablets, and arranging the upper halls so that the genuine portraits of the ancestors might be hung for the ceremony. At that moment both the Rongguo and Ningguo mansions, inside and out, were abuzz with activity. That day in the Ning Mansion, Mrs. You arose and, together with Jia Rong’s wife, arranged to deliver needlework gifts to Grandmother. At the same time a little maid arrived carrying a tea tray along with the New Year “money” (small ingots) as a token. She reported, “Xing’er has returned to Grandmother; also, that broken gold collection from before – altogether, it weighs 153 taels, 6 qian, and 7 fen, with pieces of varying purity – has yielded a total of 220 ingots.” She then handed them over. Mrs. You inspected the items and saw designs of plum blossoms, of begonia, of “Pen-Stroke Ruyi,” and of “Eight Treasures in Spring”; she ordered, “Pack these away and have Xing’er hurry and deliver the silver ingots.” The maid answered and went off. Before long Jia Zhen entered to eat. Jia Rong’s wife stayed aside. Jia Zhen then asked Mrs. You, “Have we received the New Year’s tribute for the spring sacrifice yet?” Mrs. You replied, “I have sent Rong’er away with it.” Jia Zhen said, “Even though our family does not require many taels of silver, we must accept the imperial grace. Pack it up and send it to the old lady, so that our ancestors’ offerings may be properly prepared and we, in turn, may receive the Emperor’s blessings – for the benefit of our ancestors and to share in our clan’s fortune. Even if one were to spend ten thousand taels on the ancestral sacrifice, it is still more dignified and suffused with blessing than this. Moreover, among those impoverished, the hereditary officials, if they do not have this silver, how can they present a proper offering at New Year? Truly, the imperial grace is boundless – it must be thoroughly considered.” Mrs. You said, “That is so indeed.”  Just then someone announced, “The younger brother has arrived!” Jia Zhen ordered, “Bring him in.” Soon Jia Rong entered carrying a small yellow cloth pouch. Jia Zhen asked, “Why have you been away all day?” Jia Rong, smiling, replied, “Today I was not in the Ministry of Rites to collect my salary; I was at the Guanglu Temple treasury. When I reached Guanglu Temple, I managed to collect it. The old masters there all said, ‘We have missed you for many days,’ and truly they longed for your presence.” Jia Zhen laughed, “Do they long for me? Or do they long for your goods or for our shared drink?” As he spoke, he looked at the yellow pouch, which bore a seal reading “Imperial Grace Everlasting.” On the side were the marks of the Ministry of Rites. In small script it stated:   “By order of Ningguo Duke Jia Yan and Rongguo Duke Jia Fa, the New Spring Sacrifice shall receive an offering of silver equal to 2 fen – a net amount of so many taels – on [date], as attested by the official in charge of the Dragon Imperial Guards, Jia Rong.
The fan in her hand lay partly buried under fallen blossoms, while a swarm of bees and butterflies buzzed about. She even had a kerchief arranged as a pillow made of peony petals. Everyone was touched and amused; they quickly came forward to help her up. Xiangyun mumbled drunkenly about toasting and drinking, half-awake saying,  “The fragrant spring wine is chilled… let us stagger home together—may our dear friends be ever near.” They laughed and urged her, “Come on, wake up and eat. Don’t sleep here on these cold steps—you might catch a chill!” Slowly, Xiangyun opened her eyes and, seeing everyone, realized she was drunk. She had sought a quiet spot for refreshing herself and, having overindulged, had dozed off—feeling remorseful afterward. Earlier, a couple of little maids had brought a basin of water and mirrors, and after waiting, she freshened her face and tidied her hair. Soon she rose and, with assistance, made her way to the Red Fragrance Courtyard. After having two more cups of strong tea, Tanchun immediately sent her a small sobering stone to put in her mouth and then gave her a sour soup; gradually, she felt better. Meanwhile, a variety of fruits and vegetables were selected and sent over to Sister Feng, who in turn sent a few items in return. After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and some went outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each doing as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess while Baochai and Xiuyun watched. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled together under a cluster of flowers, speaking softly among themselves. Soon a member of the Lin household arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps to kowtow. Tanchun, having just lost a chess game and counting her losses—ending up with “two eyes” (a game term)—kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing for chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there for a long time, and only when he later turned to ask for tea did he notice the situation. He then pointed to the young wife and said,  “This is Cai’er – the mother of the little maid Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. She speaks rather poorly; I only overheard a few words, and she didn’t dare answer the young mistress. She had to be brought forward to speak.” Tanchun asked, “Why wasn’t she reported to Grandmother?” The Lin official explained, “Just then, Grandmother was seen going toward the mistress’s room; I understood and called the young mistress back.” Tanchun then asked, “Why not report her to Second Grandmother?” Ping’er interjected, “It doesn’t matter if we don’t report it—I’ll mention it. In any case, let’s expel her for now and wait until the mistress returns to decide.” Tanchun nodded and resumed her chess game. The Lin official then took the young wife out without further comment. Daiyu and Baoyu, standing beneath the flowers, remarked: Daiyu said, “Your third maid is such a well-behaved child. Even though she’s tasked with certain duties, she barely steps out. If only she were allowed a bit more freedom, she’d command respect in no time.” Baoyu replied, “You have no idea—when you were ill, she handled several matters for us. Now this garden is divided among different managers; even a stray blade of grass is accounted for. They’ve even trimmed some responsibilities, leaving room for me and Sister Feng. Truly, those who plan meticulously—how can they not be shrewd?” Daiyu said, “That is best. Yet we are spending too much effort. Although I do not meddle in these affairs, when I have free moments I tally things up; if the outgoings exceed the incomings, sooner or later there will be a shortfall.” Baoyu laughed, “No matter how you count, the two of us are never short.” Daiyu, upon hearing this, turned and went off to chat with Baochai. Just then, as Baoyu was about to leave, Xiren arrived carrying a small linked lacquer tea tray containing two pots of fresh tea, and asked, “Where are you off to?
And Li Wan, since Qi’er isn’t very adept, let’s have Sister Qin compose instead.”  Baochai had little choice but to agree. She then said, “We shall use the three words ‘Red,’ ‘Plum,’ and ‘Flower’ as our rhyme keys. Each person will compose a seven-character regulated verse: Sister Xing will use the ‘Red’ rhyme, you, Li, will use ‘Plum,’ and Qin’er will use ‘Flower.’”  Li Wan protested, “Spare poor Baoyu—I do not consent.”  Xiangyun quickly interjected, “What a fine title to command him!”  The others asked, “What title?”  Xiangyun replied, “Have him compose ‘Seeking Miaoyu for a Red Plum.’ Isn’t that delightful?”  Everyone agreed, “How amusing!”  Before the matter could be further discussed, Baoyu came in smiling and holding a red plum branch. The maids quickly accepted it and arranged it in a vase. “Come, let’s admire it!” everyone said. Baoyu laughed, “Now, as you all admire it, you cannot imagine how much effort I expended.”  Just then, Tan Chun passed around a cup of warm wine. The maids grabbed their straw raincoats and brushed off the snow. In each room, the maids began bringing extra garments, and even Xiren sent over a half-worn fox-button jacket. Li Wan ordered that a plate of steamed taro be served, and in another dish she had prepared tangerines, yellow oranges, and olives—all to be sent over to Xiren. Xiangyun recounted the earlier poem title to Baoyu, urging him to compose his verse quickly. Baoyu replied, “Dear sisters and ladies, allow me to use my own rhyme without restrictions.”  Everyone consented, “Go ahead.”  Meanwhile, they all admired the plum branch. It turned out that this branch was only about two feet high, with another branch stretching out diagonally for about two or three feet. Its small twigs diverged in various shapes—some like coiled dragons, some like stiff worms, some slim as a writing brush, and others densely clustered like a forest. Truly, the blossoms seemed to pour out rouge as if the flower itself exuded its own fragrance rivaling that of orchids and sweet-smelling herbs. All praised its beauty. Unexpectedly, Xiu Yan, Li Wen, and Baoqin had all finished their verses, and the assembled works were arranged in the order of the key words “Red,” “Plum,” and “Flower.” They read as follows:  “On Red Plums” by Xing Xiu Yan    Before the peach blossoms are in full bloom and the apricots yet to flush,   They welcome the east wind’s laughter amid the chill. Spirits soar on Gengling where spring is hard to tell apart,   And rosy clouds above Luofu conceal dreams untold. Emerald sepals add splendor to a treasure’s flame,   While fair immortals, tipsy, step across a broken rainbow. Surely these hues are not ordinary at all—   Their intensity, light or deep, arises from ice and snow. “On White Plums (Red Plums)” by Li Wen    The white plum, reluctant to mimic the red,   Exhibits its charm first before a drunken gaze opens wide. Cold cheeks bear the traces like scars of blood,   While a heart inebriated, with no regret, turns to ash. Mistakenly swallowing cinnabar, it alters its very essence,   Secretly slipping from the jade pool to shed its former shell. From north to south, spring is dazzling everywhere—   So tell the bees and butterflies to guess at will. “On the Plum Blossoms” by Baoqin    Sparse are the branches, yet the blossoms shine;   In spring, young ladies vie in lavish array. In quiet courtyards, no trace of lingering snow remains,   While on empty mountains, the falling glow rivals sunset. In dreams so chill, the sound of red-sleeved flutes drifts,   And the fragrance of wandering immortals fills a ruddy boat.
On the moon terrace, he respectfully bowed to Grandmother, Jia Zheng, Wang Xifeng, and others. In sequence, he went to the You household’s upper room, performed his rites and sat for a while, then proceeded to the Rong mansion. He visited Aunt Xue, then lingered at Xue Ke’s for a while before returning to the garden. Qingwen and Miaoyue accompanied him; a group of little maids escorted him from the Li household. One by one he visited all the rooms and then, after passing through the side gates, visited the four elder ladies before returning to his own room. Although many wished to pay their respects, none performed full kowtows—only a brief greeting was exchanged, as Wang Xifeng had decreed that young people should not receive formal kowtows lest it compromise their fortunes. Soon after, Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived. Xiren quickly pulled them aside for a brief sit-down, then they departed. Baoyu, laughing, said, “I’m exhausted from all this walking!” and slumped onto his bed. After half a cup of tea, voices and laughter were heard from outside—a group of maids (Cuimo, Xiao Luo, Cuilu, Ruhuahua, Zuan’er from Xing Xiuyan’s household, along with a milkmaid carrying Qiaojie, Cai Luan, and eight or nine others carrying red mats) had come in exclaiming, “The guests for the birthday have crowded the door—hurry, bring us noodles to eat!” Initially, Tanchun, Xiangyun, Baoqin, Xiuyun, and Xichun had all arrived. Baoyu hastily greeted them, laughing, “I dare not cause a scene. I went over to Sister Feng’s door and was told I wasn’t allowed to see her; so I sent for my sister instead.” Ping’er laughed, “I was busy having your sister’s hair done, so when she came out to ask for you, I couldn’t bear to face you—so I came to kowtow for Second Master.” Baoyu laughed, “I really can’t afford to be so formal.” Xiren had already arranged a seat by the door for him. Then Ping’er knelt in greeting; Baoyu bowed repeatedly; Ping’er knelt again; Baoyu resumed his bowing; Xiren helped him up; after a few more bows, Baoyu made one final gesture. Xiren urged, “Please, bow again!” Baoyu protested, “I’m finished already—why must I keep bowing?” Xiren laughed, “This is how they pay their respects to you on your birthday. Today is also your birthday, so you must receive their homage!” Delighted, Baoyu quickly bowed and said, “So today is also a happy day for my sister!” Ping’er and the others quickly reciprocated. Xiangyun then gathered Baoqin, Xiuyun, and the others, exclaiming, “The four of you must exchange birthday bows—if needed, for an entire day!” Tanchun then suddenly remembered, “I nearly forgot that Sister Xing’s birthday is also today! I must send a maid immediately to inform Second Grandmother so that a proper gift may be arranged for her room.” The maid hurried off. Xiuyun, upon hearing Xiangyun’s remark, felt obliged to visit each room to ensure proper greetings. Tanchun laughed, “It is rather amusing—twelve months in a year, each with its own birthday; when there are many people, some even share the same day—sometimes three on one day, sometimes two. Even New Year’s Day is not wasted; the elder sisters claim it. No wonder their luck is great—birthday celebrations always come first. Then there is also the ancestral birthday of our great-grandfather; after the Lantern Festival, it’s the mistress’s and Sister Bao’s birthdays, and on the first day of the third month it’s the mistress’s, while on the ninth it belongs to Brother Lian. February, however, is empty.” Xiren interjected, “But isn’t February 12th Lin’s birthday? Why does no one celebrate her? It isn’t part of our family.” Tanchun laughed, “Ah, my memory fails me sometimes.” Baoyu pointed at Xiren and said, “That’s why you and Lin share the same day—you remember well!” Tanchun laughed, “So the two of you share a birthday?
If you propose taking her as your second wife, I’m sure both my mother and father will consent. The only obstacle might be your own wife!” Hearing this, Jia Lian was overjoyed, so blinded by lust that he ignored his formal mourning status, his wife’s jealousy, and all the impropriety involved, seeing only a perfect plan. Little did he know Jia Rong had his own secret agenda: he had feelings for his aunt, but Jia Zhen’s presence had prevented him from acting. If Jia Lian took her as a concubine and kept her in an outside residence, Jia Rong would have opportunities for his own secret liaisons when Jia Lian was away. Jia Lian, suspecting nothing, thanked Jia Rong, “Good nephew! If you can arrange this, I’ll reward you with two lovely maids!”  They soon arrived at the gate of the Ning mansion. Jia Rong said, “Uncle, go in and ask Mother for that silver, then you can hand it over to Yu Lu. I’ll hurry to Grandmother’s to pay my respects.” Jia Lian laughed and warned him, “Remember, don’t tell her we came together.” Jia Rong replied, “I know,” and, making a quick private gesture to indicate Second Sister, he added, “Don’t be impatient if you see her. Don’t make a scene and spoil everything.” Jia Lian laughed, “Stop teasing. Off you go.”  Jia Rong left for Grandmother Jia’s quarters, while Jia Lian headed into the mansion. The household stewards bowed deeply to greet him, accompanying him to the main hall. Jia Lian asked them a few routine questions, then dismissed them and walked inside alone. In normal circumstances, since Jia Zhen and Jia Lian were close like brothers, there was no need for formal announcements. He reached the main house, and a maid lifted the curtain for him. Entering, he saw only Second Sister You with two maids, busy with needlework. Lady You and Third Sister were nowhere to be seen. Jia Lian quickly greeted her with a broad smile. Second Sister smiled in return and invited him to sit on the seat near the east wall, opposite her. After a few words of greeting, Jia Lian joked, “Where is Madam You? Where is Third Sister? I don’t see them.” Second Sister smiled, “They went to the back just a moment ago. They’ll be here soon.” While a maid went to fetch tea, Jia Lian stole glances at Second Sister. She lowered her head, smiling silently. Unsure whether to make a move, he asked coyly, “Could you spare a betel nut for me? I forgot my pouch today.” She replied, “I do have some, but I never give mine to others.” Jia Lian, grinning, leaned in to take it. Not wanting to seem improper if someone entered, she tossed him the pouch with a faint smile. Jia Lian took out the contents, finding half a chewed piece of betel nut, which he popped into his mouth. He stuffed the rest into his robe, intending to return the pouch in person. But the maids had arrived with tea, so he hesitated. While drinking, unnoticed by the maids, he slipped his own jade Nine-Dragon pendant onto her kerchief and slid it back to her. Second Sister kept her composure, leaving the kerchief where it lay, showing no reaction. Jia Lian began to panic, uncertain of her feelings, but before he could speak, Lady You and Third Sister arrived with two more maids. Jia Lian and Second Sister exchanged a parting glance, and he was relieved to see the kerchief had vanished. He rose to greet Lady You and Third Sister, then everyone sat and chatted politely. Jia Lian announced, “My sister-in-law said there was silver stored here a few days ago. Brother Zhen told me to come fetch it because we need to settle some debts.” Lady You asked Second Sister to bring the key to fetch the silver. Jia Lian explained, “I also wanted to pay my respects to Madam You and the two young ladies. I’ve been worried you might be inconvenienced living here.” Lady You smiled, “Don’t speak like that. We’re all close relatives. Whether we stay here or at home, it’s the same.
We have not overindulged; we merely used wine as an excuse to have fun. Don’t fret, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Even though the Dowager had the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses absent, we were simply having fun. We came to check on you, and also, as time goes by, the young ladies may need some light snacks. Since they don’t normally eat much, if you have only a couple of cups of wine, you might not be sufficiently nourished.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were just about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids agreed and hurried off to bring some treats. Tanchun then said, “You all rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I’ll have someone send over more wine for you.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” After a while they too departed. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My face is so warm now—I’m too embarrassed to face them. I say, let’s just drop it so as not to provoke them further.” Tanchun laughed, “No matter—you see, as long as we don’t drink seriously, it won’t matter.”  Just then a little maid came skipping in, laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a blue stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and sure enough, they found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step, fast asleep in her drunken stupor. Peony petals had clung to her all over, and her face and sleeves were sprinkled with red perfume. The fan in her hand lay partly buried under fallen blossoms, while a swarm of bees and butterflies buzzed about. She even had a kerchief arranged as a pillow made of peony petals. Everyone was touched and amused; they quickly came forward to help her up. Xiangyun mumbled drunkenly about toasting and drinking, half-awake saying,  “The fragrant spring wine is chilled… let us stagger home together—may our dear friends be ever near.” They laughed and urged her, “Come on, wake up and eat. Don’t sleep here on these cold steps—you might catch a chill!” Slowly, Xiangyun opened her eyes and, seeing everyone, realized she was drunk. She had sought a quiet spot for refreshing herself and, having overindulged, had dozed off—feeling remorseful afterward. Earlier, a couple of little maids had brought a basin of water and mirrors, and after waiting, she freshened her face and tidied her hair. Soon she rose and, with assistance, made her way to the Red Fragrance Courtyard. After having two more cups of strong tea, Tanchun immediately sent her a small sobering stone to put in her mouth and then gave her a sour soup; gradually, she felt better. Meanwhile, a variety of fruits and vegetables were selected and sent over to Sister Feng, who in turn sent a few items in return. After the sisters had their light refreshments, some sat, some stood, and some went outside to admire the flowers or watch the fish—each doing as they pleased, chatting and laughing. Tanchun then sat down with Baoqin to play chess while Baochai and Xiuyun watched. Daiyu and Baoyu huddled together under a cluster of flowers, speaking softly among themselves. Soon a member of the Lin household arrived with a young wife. This young woman, tearful and anxious, did not dare enter the main hall but instead knelt at the steps to kowtow. Tanchun, having just lost a chess game and counting her losses—ending up with “two eyes” (a game term)—kept her gaze fixed on the board while absentmindedly fishing for chess pieces from the box. The Lin household person stood there for a long time, and only when he later turned to ask for tea did he notice the situation. He then pointed to the young wife and said,  “This is Cai’er – the mother of the little maid Cai’er from Fourth Sister’s room, now one of our garden attendants. She speaks rather poorly; I only overheard a few words, and she didn’t dare answer the young mistress.
When we return, I’ll ask Sister Xiren to bring you to the table—how about that?” The Flower Official said, “Neither Lotus Officer nor Ru Official are coming up; it would be awkward for me to be alone. Besides, I’m not fond of that noodle dish—I didn’t eat properly this morning. I’m already hungry. I had told Aunt Liu earlier to prepare a bowl of soup and half a bowl of polished rice for me, so that once I eat, it will be enough. And if I’m allowed to drink wine tonight without supervision, I’ll make sure I eat enough first. I plan to enjoy a couple of jin of fine Huiquan wine at home later. These days, though some claim that too much tea ruins the throat, I haven’t heard such a thing. Moreover, I’m about to break my fast.” Baoyu replied, “That’s simple enough.”  Just then, someone from the Liu household delivered a small box. Spring Yan opened it and found inside a bowl of shrimp-and-chicken-skin soup, another bowl of wine-steamed duck, a plate of marinated rosy goose breast, a plate of four cream-filled pastry pieces, and a large bowl of steaming, glistening green rice made from fragrant polished rice. Spring Yan set the dishes on the counter, arranged small bowls and chopsticks, and served herself a bowl of rice. The Flower Official remarked, “It’s rather greasy—who would want to eat such fare?” He mixed the soup with rice, ate a bowl, selected two pieces of marinated goose, then half a bowl of porridge, and ceased eating. Baoyu, upon smelling the food, thought it tasted better than usual, so he ate a pastry roll. He then ordered Spring Yan to serve him another half bowl of rice with soup, which he found extremely fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Spring Yan and the Flower Official laughed together. After the meal, Spring Yan was about to return the leftovers. Baoyu said, “You eat; if it isn’t enough, we can always get more.” Spring Yan replied, “There’s no need—this is plenty. Earlier, Sister Miaoyue served us two plates of dim sum, and I’ve already had my fill; no more is needed.” She then stood by the table, finished her meal, and saved two pastry rolls, saying, “Keep these for Mother. Tonight, when we drink, I want two bowls’ worth for myself.” Baoyu laughed, “So you enjoy wine too? Then later let’s drink heartily. Sister Xiren and Sister Jingwen also drink well, though they’re usually too shy—but today, since we are breaking our fast together, it’s all right.” Baoyu then recalled another matter and said, “I nearly forgot about Wu’er’s case. Please speak with the Liu household and insist she come in tomorrow. I’ll announce it, and that will be that.” The Flower Official laughed, “That is indeed a proper matter.” Spring Yan then called for two little maids to come in and help wash hands and serve tea. After gathering her things and handing them to an old maid for safekeeping, she went off to speak with the Liu household person (this part need not be detailed further). Baoyu then resumed his rounds in the Red Fragrance Courtyard with his sisters, with the Flower Official following, fan in hand. Just as they stepped outside, Xiren and Qingwen returned hand in hand. Baoyu asked, “What are you two doing?” Xiren replied, “We’ve set up the meal—we’re waiting for you.” Baoyu laughed as he recounted his earlier encounter at Sister Feng’s door. Xiren laughed, “I say you’re as hungry as a cat! Still, you should go upstairs and keep them company—it would add to the merriment.” Qingwen teased, pointing at the Flower Official’s forehead, “You sly fox—where did you disappear to for the meal? How did you manage it without informing us?” Xiren said, “It was merely an accidental encounter—no appointment was made.” Qingwen replied, “Then we’re useless. Tomorrow, if everyone leaves and the Flower Official is left alone, that’ll be enough.” Xiren said, “We’ll all go, but you simply cannot go!” Qingwen retorted, “Only I am always the first to volunteer—even though I’m lazy, dull, and useless.” Xiren laughed, “If that peacock jacket ever gets a hole and you go, who will mend it?
They now lived outside. Jia Lian decided this couple was just right for managing the secret household. Bao Er and his wife, hearing of this opportunity, gladly accepted. As for Zhang Hua’s family, originally stewards of a grain-tax estate, they declined after misfortune. They had indeed betrothed their son Zhang Hua to Second Sister You in her infancy. But when they suffered lawsuits, they fell into poverty, unable even to afford a wedding. Meanwhile, Lady You had remarried, and for over ten years there had been no contact. Suddenly, men from the Jia family called them in and demanded they relinquish the engagement. Though they were reluctant, they feared the Jia clan’s power. The You family gave them twenty taels, and Zhang’s family wrote a formal release. Thus, that old betrothal was void. Jia Lian and the others were overjoyed, seeing no obstacle now. They fixed a wedding date—on the auspicious third day of the month—planning for a secret ceremony to bring Second Sister into the new house. Chapter 65  Jia Lian Secretly Marries Second Sister You; Third Sister You Desires to Wed Second Brother Liu  When Jia Lian, Jia Zhen, and Jia Rong had finished their discussions and made all the arrangements, on the second day of the month they first brought Madam You and Third Sister You to the new residence. Seeing the place, though not exactly as Jia Rong had described it in his persuasive talk, it was nonetheless quite well-furnished. Mother and daughter were both satisfied. Bao Er and his wife greeted Madam You as “Old Madam” or “Elder Lady” at every turn, and they addressed Third Sister You as “Third Aunt” or “Mistress.”  On the following day, at the fifth watch, a plain sedan chair carried Second Sister You to the new residence. All manner of incense, candles, paper offerings, bedding, and food and drink had long been made ready. Soon Jia Lian, dressed in mourning garb, arrived by a small sedan. After they bowed to Heaven and Earth and burned paper offerings, Madam You beamed with delight on seeing her daughter dressed head to toe in lovely attire—so different from how she had looked at home—and proudly led her into the bridal chamber. That night, Jia Lian and Second Sister consummated their union with every intimacy imaginable, which we need not describe in detail. The more Jia Lian looked at Second Sister, the more he admired her. He adored everything about her, unsure how to lavish enough favor on her to do her justice. He ordered Bao Er and the others never to speak of her as a mere second wife or concubine; they were to address her as “Madam.” He himself called her “Madam” too, effectively erasing Lady Feng from his mind. Whenever he went home, he would simply say he was busy at the Eastern Mansion. Because Wang Xifeng knew he often consulted with Jia Zhen, she suspected nothing. As for the household staff—though quite numerous—no one meddled in such matters. Even those idlers who made it their business to ferret out secrets found it more profitable to flatter Jia Lian and gain little advantages than to spread rumors. Naturally, they kept silent. Jia Lian felt deeply grateful to Jia Zhen for his help. He gave fifteen taels of silver each month for everyday expenses at the new house. If he did not come, mother and daughters dined together; if he did come, he and Second Sister ate by themselves while her mother and Third Sister withdrew to their own room. Jia Lian even handed over all the savings he had accumulated over the years, entrusting them to Second Sister’s care. He poured out for her everything about Wang Xifeng’s habits and ways, both in bed and out, insisting that once that “poisonous wife” died, he would bring Second Sister into the household. Hearing this, Second Sister was of course happy. Meanwhile, about ten people lived in the new house with more than enough money and supplies; their days were comfortable indeed. Nearly two months passed. One evening, Jia Zhen completed a Buddhist service at the Iron Threshold Temple and returned home. Long separated from his “younger sister,” he decided to pay her a visit, first sending a page boy to see whether Jia Lian was in or not. The boy returned saying Jia Lian was away, and Jia Zhen was delighted. He dismissed his attendants, keeping only two trusted young pages to lead his horse, and went quietly to the new house at lamp-lighting time.
I managed five poems when I got sleepy and left them there. Then along came Baoyu, rummaging through my things. It’s not that I mind his reading them, but I’m afraid he might copy them and show them to others.” Baoyu said at once, “When would I ever show them around? Yesterday I copied your ‘White Crabapple’ poems onto my fan, but that was because I admired them so. I only kept them on me to read. Do you think I don’t know that poems from a young lady’s hand must never be carelessly passed around? Since you scolded me last time, I haven’t once taken them outside the Garden.”  Baochai smiled, “Cousin Lin is right to be cautious. If you wrote them on a fan and happened to leave it in the schoolroom, someone might ask who wrote them, and the word would spread. That wouldn’t be good at all. It’s long been said that ‘a girl’s virtue is to be without talent.’ Above all, one must be chaste and quiet; needlework is secondary. Poems and lyrics are just amusements in the boudoir—nice to have or not. We young ladies of prominent families don’t need such reputations for literary talent.” She then turned to Daiyu and said, “But it’s all right if I read them, as long as they don’t leave your room.” Daiyu laughed, “Well, then maybe even you shouldn’t read them!” She pointed at Baoyu. “He’s already snatched them away.”  Hearing this, Baoyu took the paper from his robe and read it with Baochai. They saw five poems, each entitled with the name of a beauty:  Xishi “In one age of perfect beauty, she followed the waves into the swirl of fate; Empty were the courtiers of Wu, still longing for the girl from her home. Mock not the village girl trying to imitate her brow’s furrow— When hair is white, she still washes clothes by the stream.”  Yu Ji “At midnight, crows cry and the wind howls, tearing the heart, How can Yu’s hidden sorrow face those eyes with double pupils? Qing and Peng willingly fell to pieces in the future— Why not drink the sword’s edge under the Chu war tent?”  Wang Zhaojun “She astounded all with breathtaking splendor when she left the Han palace, Beauty doomed by fate, the same in ancient days and now. Even if the emperor scorned her charms, How could he hand over the power to a painter who decided her destiny?”  Green Pearl “Jade or common pebble, all are cast aside alike; When did Shi Wei ever prize a maiden’s grace? Her stubborn fortune must have been shaped in a previous life— At least, in the end, there was a shared end to console her loneliness.”  Hongfu (Red Whisk) “A long sword and bold talk—her manner was unique indeed, A beauty with discerning eyes recognized the despairing path. Lifeless bodies fill Lord Yang’s camp, How could they confine this girl with the heart of a hero?”  Baoyu was full of praise and suggested, “Why not call these five poems ‘Five Beauties in Verse?’” Without waiting for her to reply, he took a brush and added the title at the end. Baochai also commented, “When writing on well-known subjects, the challenge is to avoid repeating old ideas. If one merely follows in others’ footsteps, even if the wording is refined, it still lacks originality and can’t be counted among truly good poems. Take, for example, the many existing pieces on Wang Zhaojun: some lament her, some blame the painter Mao Yanshou, others criticize the Han emperor for failing to seek portraits of worthy ministers instead of beautiful women. There are endless variations. Later, Wang Anshi wrote, ‘For such grace and bearing, no brush could do her justice—back then they wrongfully killed Mao Yanshou.’ Ouyang Xiu wrote, ‘If even what one sees and hears can be distorted so, how could one control distant barbarians?’ Those verses each expressed fresh thoughts. Now your five poems truly show unique insights and open a new perspective.”  Before she could continue, someone came to report, “Second Master Lian has returned.
I’ll speak up about it—just say that I was merely teasing you all by ‘stealing’ the mistress’s dew in order to scare you. With that, both matters will be settled.”  Xiren replies, “That’s truly an ominous affair—if we preserve a reputation as ‘thieves who safeguard others,’ it might be acceptable. But if the mistress hears about it, she’ll say you’re childish and ungrateful.”  Ping’er laughs, “It’s a trivial matter anyway. Let’s instead have Caiyun and Yuchuan come over and clear it up. Otherwise, if they get away with it, it will appear as if I have no way of getting to the bottom of it. Even after everything is settled, they might continue their thieving ways without accountability.”  Xiren and the others laugh, “Exactly—we must leave a record!”  So Ping’er calls for the two of them and says, “Don’t worry—the culprit has been identified.”  Yuchuan asks first, “Where is the culprit?”  Ping’er replies, “He’s in the second lady’s room—ask him about his answers. I know in my heart that it wasn’t he who stole it; poor fellow was so frightened he admitted it all. Now, Brother Baoyu only wishes to acknowledge half of it. I intended to speak up, but the thief in question is a sister with whom I have long been close; yet the mistress is as ordinary as can be—and harming a good person’s reputation puts me in a difficult position. We must persuade Brother Baoyu to approve so that everyone remains untroubled. Otherwise, if we insist on pursuing it, she will surely become angry.”  Hearing this, Caiyun blushes and, overcome with shame, says, “Sister, you needn’t be blamed—indeed, I must accept responsibility.”  Xiren and Ping’er quickly add, “If you acknowledge it, then we won’t have to report it to Aunt Zhao; otherwise, if Second Sister hears, she will be incensed. It would be better if Brother Baoyu himself acknowledges it so that no one else will know of our involvement. Moreover, if anything happens, we can all claim no responsibility. Even if the entire house were given over to someone else, it would not concern us.”  Caiyun, after some thought, lowers her head and finally assents. Thus, all matters are settled. Ping’er then takes Caiyun, Yuchuan, and the Flower Official into the night-shift room. She also summons Wu’er and discreetly instructs her to say that the poria snow was given by the Flower Official. Wu’er, deeply grateful, accepts. Shortly thereafter, Ping’er brings them over to her own side, where she sees that the Lin household has already arrived with several young wives—enough to secure the situation. The Lin official then tells Ping’er, “This morning I escorted her in, but I was afraid no one would be there to attend to breakfast, so I temporarily sent Qin Xian’s woman to serve the young ladies’ meal.”  Ping’er asks, “Who is Qin Xian’s woman? I don’t know her well.”  The Lin official explains, “She’s the one on duty at the south corner at night—quiet by day, so the young ladies might not know her. She’s tall, with a lean, graceful figure and bright, clear eyes—the very picture of efficiency.”  Yuchuan exclaims, “That’s right! Sister, how could you forget? She is the aunt of Second Lady Siqi’s, and although her father is from the senior household, her uncle is one of ours.”  Hearing this, Ping’er suddenly remembers and laughs, “Oh, yes—you should have told me sooner, then I would have known!” She laughs further, “You are too impatient. Now that everything is coming to light—and even the item lost in the mistress’s room the other day has found an owner—it was when Baoyu came over with those two rascals (the culprits) who, not being cautious, inadvertently caused a stir. They panicked, and in the end Baoyu found out and brought the items out to me.
I don’t know what she’s been thinking about—she cried for a while by herself, then wrote a number of things. I can’t tell if they’re poems or lyrics. When she asked me to bring over these melons and fruit, she also told Zijuan to move the small table with the qin from the inner room, along with its decorations, and place it in the middle of the outer room. She told her to put the Dragon-Patterned Censer on it and get ready for the fruit when it arrived. If she were inviting someone over, there’d be no need to hastily set out a censer first. If she wanted to burn incense, she usually does that in the places she sits or sleeps. It’s not as if the maids or older women have made the room smell unpleasant and she needs incense to freshen the air. I really have no idea why. You should go see for yourself.” Baoyu lowered his head and pondered, “From what Xueyan says, there must be a reason. If it was just to sit with one of the other girls, she wouldn’t prepare a feast in advance. Could it be the memorial day for an aunt or uncle? But I recall that each year, on such a date, Grandmother would order special food and drink for Cousin Lin’s private observances—and that day has already passed. Probably she’s thinking of the upcoming seventh month, when people eat melons and fruit and also visit ancestral tombs in autumn. Perhaps she’s feeling sentimental, so she’s decided on a private offering, following the ‘spring and autumn offerings of seasonal food’ found in the Book of Rites. Yet if I go now and see her in grief, I’ll surely try to console her, and that might frustrate her need to give vent to her feelings. If I don’t go, though, I fear she might become too distressed and make herself ill. Neither option is good. Maybe I should first go to Sister Feng to see how she’s doing, then come back. If I see that Cousin Lin is upset, I’ll find a way to comfort her. That way, she can find some release but not let her sadness worsen to the point of harming her health.”  Having made up his mind, he said goodbye to Xueyan and left the Garden, heading directly to Wang Xifeng’s quarters. Just then, many old women were on their way out after reporting on various tasks. Wang Xifeng leaned against the doorway talking to Ping’er. Seeing Baoyu, she smiled, “You’re back? I was about to send Lin Zhixiao’s wife to tell your page boy that if there’s nothing urgent, you’d better come home to rest. With all those people at the other place, can you handle that atmosphere? I hadn’t expected you to come already.” Baoyu smiled, “Thank you for thinking of me. I had nothing urgent today, and I wanted to see how your health is doing, since you haven’t been to the other mansion lately.” Wang Xifeng replied, “It’s always the same—three days feeling alright, and two days not. With the Old Lady and the Mistress away, these madams at home aren’t behaving themselves. If they’re not quarreling, they’re fighting, and there have been two or three cases of gambling and stealing. Although Third Miss is helping, she’s still unmarried, so there are some things she can handle and some she can’t. I’ve had no choice but to press on, unable to get any peace. It’s no wonder my illness hasn’t improved—at least it hasn’t worsened.” Baoyu said, “Though you say so, Sister, please take care of yourself and worry less if you can.” After a bit of small talk, he said goodbye and returned to the Garden. Entering the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, he saw the incense burner emitting only faint smoke and the leftover offerings of jade-like wine. Zijuan was directing people to take down the table and decorations. Baoyu realized that Daiyu’s private service had concluded. Entering the house, he found Daiyu lying on her side, facing inward, looking frail and weary. Zijuan quickly said, “Master Bao is here!” Daiyu then slowly rose, smiling faintly to greet him. Baoyu asked, “Are you feeling better?
And now all the bamboo is entrusted to him. And that old ‘Tianmu’ originally specialized in farming—over in the Daoxia village, no matter the vegetables, rice, or weeds, even if they are minor produce, he still must tend to them carefully and add in proper cultivation at the right times. Wouldn’t that be even better?”  Tanchun laughed again, “It’s a pity that in the two grand estates of the Hengwu Courtyard and the Yihong Courtyard, there seems to be nothing of merit.”  Li Wan quickly laughed, “Hengwu Courtyard is even more promising. Nowadays, the spices and herbal condiments sold at the perfumery and at the major markets and temples are none other than these items. All in all, their returns are even greater. And as for Yihong Courtyard, not to mention other matters, just consider the roses in spring and summer alone—how many blossoms fall? Then there are also the wild roses, monthly roses, and clusters of candied flowers, golden and silver honeysuckle, and wisteria blossoms along the fence. Once dried and sold to tea and medicine shops, they fetch a good price.”  Tanchun nodded with a smile, “It’s just that there aren’t many who know how to work with these aromatic herbs.”  Ping’er laughed, “Bao’s friend, Ying’er’s mother, is exactly the person who can handle these. Last time she even gathered some, dried them, and made them into a flower basket and gourd for my amusement. Have you forgotten?”  Baochai laughed, “I was just praising you—and now you’re teasing me!”  The three were surprised and asked, “Why is that?”  Baochai explained, “It’s not acceptable to be so capricious. You already have enough personnel on hand, and now if I introduce someone new, they might even come to look down on me. I have an idea: In Yihong Courtyard there is an old woman named Ye—she is the one in charge of baking the tea. She is a trustworthy old soul and is especially favored by Ying’er’s mother. Why not entrust this matter to Old Ye? Even if she does not understand all the details, there’s no need for us to explain every point; she can simply confer with Ying’er’s mother. Even if Old Ye refuses altogether and delegates it to another, it is their own affair—and any idle gossip would not be directed at us. In this way, the work is fair and proper.”  Both Li Wan and Ping’er agreed, “Very well.”  Tanchun laughed, “Even so, I worry that once they see the profit they might forget their obligations.”  Ping’er smiled, “That won’t matter. Just the other day Ying’er even accepted Old Ye as her godmother, and both families are on very good terms.”  Satisfied with that, Tanchun then selected several more names, all of whom had long been regarded with a discerning eye. Using her brush she circled four names. Soon the old maids went back and forth. “The doctor has left,” they announced, having delivered the prescription upstairs. While some were sent outside to fetch the medicine and supervise its administration, Tanchun and Li Wan gathered the women and explained: “Each one of you shall be responsible for a certain area. According to the seasons, apart from what is allotted for household use, any surplus may be taken by you to earn a profit. At the end of the year we will settle accounts.”  Tanchun laughed, “I just recalled another matter. If we settle accounts at the year’s end, naturally the money will be funneled back into the treasury—adding yet another layer of control by those above, who will in effect take another cut. By initiating this project now and assigning you to manage it, we are effectively bypassing their control. I cannot help but feel that when you finally settle accounts at year-end they will still find ways to impose their schemes. Moreover, during the year, for any matter under management, the principal receives one share while they get half a share—this is the long-established custom known to all. Now, since the garden is my new creation, it would be best if the final accounts come out before they have their way.”  Baochai laughed, “In my opinion, there should be no need to settle accounts internally.
He also told Jia Rong, “Go and ask your second aunt: Has a date for the New Year’s banquet been fixed? If so, have the study issue an official list so that our invitation does not duplicate previous ones. Last year, by carelessness, we ended up inviting too many families—others might say we are insincere if we offer too much, as if two families had colluded to offer empty courtesy.” Jia Rong quickly agreed, and soon a schedule for the banquet was delivered. Jia Zhen then ordered, “Send it to Lai Sheng for inspection, so that no one over-invites.”  Meanwhile, in the main hall of the Ning Mansion, preparations were in full swing. Outside, at the main gate, new door gods, couplets, and plaques had been replaced. Newly painted peach talismans shone brilliantly. From the main gate through the ceremonial halls, the Ning Mansion was resplendent with decorations: red lanterns resembling giant golden dragons hung on the steps, and the walls bore inscriptions proclaiming the auspiciousness of the family. The next day, by order of Grandmother, an edict was issued for those of high rank to don court dress and proceed in an eight-person sedan chair with the rest of the clan to pay homage at the palace. After the audience, they returned to Ning Mansion, where they held an ancestral rite in the clan shrine. Now, regarding Baoqin: This was her first visit to the Jia family shrine. As she carefully observed the shrine, she discovered that on the west side of the Ning Mansion there was a separate courtyard enclosed by a dark oil-painted railing; inside were five large halls, above which hung a plaque reading “Jia Family Ancestral Shrine” with an inscription noting that it had been presented by the former Grand Tutor and overseer of the imperial academy, Wang Xī, and flanked by a long couplet:   “Devoted to our kin by heaven’s grace, their loyalty preserved by the benevolence of our ancestors;   Their fame ascends to the skies, and all posterity shall relish their splendor.” (Also inscribed by Wang Taifu.)  Inside the courtyard, a white stone walkway led past ancient pines and cypresses. On a raised terrace stood antique bronze cauldrons and other vessels. Facing the main hall, a golden plaque in the shape of nine dragons hung with the inscription “Assisted by Celestial Light” (an imperial inscription). On either side hung another couplet:   “Meritorious deeds shine forth like the sun and moon;   Fame and honor are unbroken for countless generations.” (Again, an imperial inscription.)  Before the five-hall central shrine, a plaque bearing the inscription “Mindful of the Departed” was hung, with a couplet on either side reading:   “May our descendants inherit eternal blessings;   Even now the common people speak of the glory of both the Ning and Rong mansions.” (All of which are imperial inscriptions.)  Inside, the lights burned brilliantly, and embroidered curtains and silk draperies festooned the space. Although several ancestral tablets were displayed, they were not in clear view. At that time the Jia family was busy organizing; young cousins and nephews were arranged in rows. Jia Jing served as the principal officiant, with Jia She assisting, Jia Zhen presenting the ceremonial ribbons, Jia Lian and Jia Cong offering silk, Bao Yu bearing incense, while Jia Chang and Jia Ling arranged the seating cushions and prepared the sacrificial wine. The musicians in blue played their instruments, and after the three offerings and the ritual, the ancestral tablets were burned, wine was poured, and a toast made. When the ceremony was over, all gathered around Grandmother in the main hall, where a grand brocade canopy was hung, with intricate screens and blazing incense. At the center, the portraits of the two founding ancestors of the Ning and Rong mansions were prominently displayed, resplendent in jade and embroidered with snakes. On either side hung several scrolls depicting the ancestors. Meanwhile, within the household, the younger servants and maids waited outside the ceremonial doors. Each dish, as it was brought out, was passed from the door to Jia Jing, then to Jia Lian, then to his wife, and finally to Mrs. Wang, who in turn handed it to Grandmother. Mrs. Wang then passed it along to the family elders, and all the children and servants followed suit. Eventually, after the food, drink, and New Year money (along with small ingots and pouches of gold and silver) were distributed, a festive banquet was set.
How laughable is that?” Ying’er interjected, “Others may not dare to pluck or break things, but I can. Ever since the land was divided among the households, each has a fixed allowance for flowers and plants: every day the maidservants and young ladies are to collect a few stems from each room—unless the young ladies themselves say, ‘We don’t need any more until we request it.’ Not once have we ever needed to ask. I am merely plucking a few now, and they cannot be too insistent.”  Before the conversation could be finished, Ying’er’s adoptive mother arrived with her cane. Ying’er and Chunyan quickly ushered her to sit. The old matron, upon seeing that Ying’er had gathered many tender willow twigs and Lotus Officer and the others had picked numerous fresh blossoms, felt that her own heart was not content. Looking at Ying’er’s braiding, she reproached Chunyan, “I told you to keep an eye on things, but you were too caught up in play. If you are summoned and then claim that I ordered you about like some invisible herb, you’ll have me to answer!” Chunyan retorted, “Aren’t you the one always bossing me around? Do you really intend to split me into eight pieces?” Ying’er laughed, “Madam, don’t believe everything Chunyan says. It is all in good fun—he merely picked the stems and pestered me to braid them, and though I tried to shoo him away, he persisted.” Chunyan laughed, “You must be careful! If you just continue to play, that fellow will take you seriously.” The old matron, a simple-minded, elderly woman who cared only for her own benefit and no sentiment, though her heart ached, felt utterly powerless. Hearing Ying’er speak thus, she resorted to her age-old ways, seizing her cane and tapping Chunyan a few times, exclaiming, “You little imp! I was addressing you, and you still talk back to me. Your mother is itching to tear you limb from limb, and here you stand like a wooden board!” Chunyan, mortified and chagrined, burst into tears, “Sister Ying’er, you’re just teasing—I’m not worth such punishment! Why should my mother be so angry? I haven’t even burnt the water for washing my face—what’s there to be upset about?” The old matron’s rebuke was not in jest; she would not tolerate any insolence. Jingwen then admonished her, “Madam, let this be. You cannot meddle in the children’s affairs all the time! Even if you beat them, you end up embarrassing yourself. They are not even your own; they belong to their mothers!” The assembled young women joked, “Who do you think you’re talking about? The one in question is our own Second Lady’s servant, Ping’er. If she speaks a few kind words, but if she turns sour, you’ll have no one to blame but yourself.” They laughed, and one of them remarked, “He’s a scoundrel—if you say a word to him, he’ll turn his face on you. You won’t be able to handle it.” Just then a little maid returned, saying, “Ping’er is currently busy; she asked what you need, and I told her. She said to first expel that fellow and then to instruct Lin Dajiang to administer forty strokes at the corner gate.” At these words the old matron burst into tears and pleaded with Xiren and the others, “I’ve worked so hard to come in here—remember, I am a widow from a humble home, with no malice in my heart, always faithfully serving the young ladies. If I am forced out, who knows what fate awaits me!” Xiren, softened by her words, scolded, “You are in our midst, yet you fail to follow proper order. How can we have someone as unruly as you? Constant bickering only brings ridicule.” Qingwen then added, “Who cares what he does? I say send him away and be done with it—why must you argue over every little word?” The old matron, now red-faced and resentful, could only sigh. Not long after, the Flower Official finished blowing on his soup.
After all, this room is far warmer than the others, and the chairs are quite comfortable.” He then sat in the spot where Daiyu usually sat, placing a small chair atop another. While doing so, he noticed an exquisite jade basin on display that held a single potted narcissus with delicate petals. Exclaiming, “What a beautiful flower! The warmer the room, the richer its fragrance. Why did I not see it yesterday?”  Daiyu smiled and said, “That was a gift from our chief steward; Aunt Lai sent two pots—one of narcissus for me and one of wax plum for Yun. I originally refused them for fear of offending her, but if you wish, I can pass one along to you.”  Bao Yu replied, “I already have two at home, though they pale in comparison to this one. How could I possibly re-gift something so precious? That wouldn’t be proper.”  Daiyu replied, “I spend so many days tending to my medicines that I can scarcely keep up with the fragrance of flowers—they eventually fade. It is better that you take it away, so that the flower’s scent remains pure and undisturbed.”  Bao Yu laughed, “You truly understand these things!”  Daiyu then said, “Tomorrow our poetry society shall have a new theme—let us compose odes to the narcissus and the wax plum.”  Bao Yu teased, “Enough, enough! I dare not compose any more; every time I do I am penalized and left feeling embarrassed.”  Daiyu covered her face in sorrow. Bao Yu said, “Why worry? I have no fear of embarrassment; you, however, seem to blush terribly.”  At that moment, Baochai proposed, “Next time I will host a session with four topics—four odes and four lyrical pieces. Each person must compose four poems and four lyrics. The first topic shall be ‘Ode to the Taiji Diagram,’ using the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme in a five-character regulated verse; not a single syllable of the ‘Yi Xian’ rhyme shall remain unused.”  Baoqin laughed, “That indeed is a challenge—it shows that our sister is not entirely sincere if she sets such hardships. Even if one forces words out, they may end up as a jumble of ‘I Ching’ phrases. I recall when I was eight and accompanied my father to the Western Sea to purchase Western goods—who would have thought that a girl barely fifteen, whose beauty resembled that of a Western painting (with golden hair, cascading ornaments, and a head adorned with agate, coral, cat’s-eye, and emerald), dressed in a brocade gown with embroidered sleeves and carrying a jeweled Wakizashi, could be so exquisite? They say she is well-versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics, and can compose verse. My father even pestered an official to write couplets for her!”  Everyone marveled. Bao Yu laughed, “My dear sister, show us what you have composed!”  Baoqin replied, “It is kept in Nanjing—I cannot retrieve it now.”  Bao Yu sighed in disappointment, “Alas, I have no chance to see such wonders!”  Daiyu teased, “Don’t try to fool us; I know that when you come you always bring these treasures from home. And yet you claim you have none—if they believe you, so be it; I, however, do not.”  Baoqin’s face flushed red, and she lowered her head demurely. Baochai said, “Your words betray your cleverness, though your tongue is too forthright. Our little Qinqi often spouts such things; you too have become quite sharp.”  Daiyu then said, “If you have brought them along, please recite something for us.”  Baochai replied, “Let’s wait—once we summon Yun, he too shall listen.”  And so a little maid was sent to fetch Yun. After a while, Xiangyun asked, “So tell us: Which foreign beauty has arrived?”  As she walked, she and Xiangling met. Everyone laughed, “We hear her voice before even seeing her!”  Baoqin and the others sat down, and the earlier conversation was recounted. Xiangyun said, “Hurry, recite for us!”  Baoqin then recited:   In the vermilion tower I dream at night,   Tonight I sing of a realm of water and mist.
Please, show me around.”  The maids laughed, “So it isn’t our Baoyu at all? He’s clean-cut and sensible. But you—what are you doing here, a stray servant calling yourself Baoyu?” They chided him, “Watch your mouth, or we’ll beat your rotten flesh to pieces!” One maid laughed, “Hurry along, let’s not let our Baoyu see us.” Another added, “After talking to that little rascal, we’re all stinking. Come on!”  As they spoke, they hurried off. Baoyu was puzzled, “Why would anyone treat me so harshly? Could it be that there really is someone exactly like me?”  Lost in thought, he ambled along until he reached another courtyard. “Besides the Yihong Courtyard, there is another one?” he marveled. Climbing the steps and entering a room, he saw a young man lying on a couch, with several girls nearby sewing or laughing and playing. The young man on the couch sighed; a maid asked with a smile, “Baoyu, you’re not sleeping—why the sigh? Surely you’re fretting over your sister’s illness again, aren’t you?”  Baoyu, startled by this, listened as the youth said, “I heard that our elderly matriarch mentioned that even in Chang’an there is a Baoyu of the same temperament as mine. I did not believe it until I dreamt that I had gone to a grand garden in the capital and met several older sisters who all called me a ‘stinking servant’ and ignored me. At length, I found his room—but he was asleep. All he had was a fine exterior; his true nature, I know not, has wandered somewhere.”  Baoyu cried out, “I came searching for Baoyu, and it turns out that you are Baoyu?”  The young man on the couch leaped up, grabbing him, laughing, “So you are Baoyu! This is no longer a dream?”  Baoyu exclaimed, “How can it be a dream? It is as real as can be!”  Before they could say more, someone called out, “Master calls for Baoyu!” Startled, both of them rushed out—one darting off, and the other calling, “Baoyu, come back! Baoyu, come back!”  Xiren, who had been listening to his self-address in his dream, hurriedly nudged him awake and asked with a laugh, “Where is Baoyu?” Though Baoyu was now awake, his mind remained hazy. He pointed toward the door and said, “He just went not far.”  Xiren laughed, “You must have been lost in your dream. Look carefully—you see your reflection in the mirror.”  Baoyu stepped forward to look and indeed saw his reflection in the large mirror mounted on the wall. He smiled. Already a maid had brought over a basin with tea and mouthwash so that he could rinse his mouth. Miaoyue remarked, “No wonder our elderly matriarch often says, ‘A child’s room should not have too many mirrors—when one is young the soul is not whole; too many mirrors and one may have wild dreams and wake in terror.’ Yet here you are, with a bed placed right before a large mirror! Sometimes one might put away the mirror cover, but on a hot, weary day, who would think of it? Perhaps earlier you forgot and lay down playing with your reflection, and when you closed your eyes you began to dream wildly. Otherwise, how would you hear your own name? It would be better to move the bed away to a more proper spot.”  Before she could finish her sentence, Wang Xifeng’s voice called for Baoyu. And with that, we leave the tale—until the next chapter. Chapter 57 Huizi’s Sincere Farewell Testing Mangyu; Ciyi’s Gentle Words Comfort Foolish Pensive  It happened that when Baoyu heard Wang Xifeng calling him, he quickly went forward—Wang Xifeng had come to take him to pay respects to Madam Zhen. Baoyu was naturally delighted; he hurried off to change clothes and then followed Wang Xifeng. In Zhen’s household he found that their situation was not much different from that of Rong and Ning—if anything, perhaps a little superior in a couple of respects.
Fengjie, observing Jia Lian’s expression, fell silent and her face grew troubled. Jia Lian, troubled but determined, said, “If we must, we shall let Zhang Hua be reinstated. But I fear what mark it will leave upon our family.” After much discussion, Jia Lian sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you possess sufficient silver, why must you insist on reclaiming your arranged wife? If you persist, you risk inciting such anger among our elders that you’ll be left with nothing. Simply return home with your silver—we can find a suitable match elsewhere.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his parents, agreed. The very next morning, at the break of dawn, he and his father departed for their native place with a sum of one hundred taels arranged. Jia Huan then reported the full details to Grandmother Jia and Fengjie. Pleased with the outcome, Jia Zhen awarded Jia Huan one hundred taels of silver and even arranged for a seventeen‑year‑old maid, Autumn Tong, to be given as a concubine. Jia Huan accepted with great joy. Yet when he later saw Fengjie, he couldn’t help but feel a tinge of guilt. Unexpectedly, Fengjie did not wear her usual calm expression. Instead, accompanied by Second Sister You, she met Jia Huan and exchanged cordial greetings. When Jia Huan mentioned Autumn Tong, a note of smugness crept into his tone. Fengjie quickly ordered that the household of Zhou Rui fetch Autumn Tong. Deep inside, Jia Huan worried how Zhang Hua’s return might affect the family’s reputation. He then discreetly sent word back to Zhang Hua: “Since you now have ample silver, why insist on reinstating the arranged match? If you persist, you risk angering our elders to the point of disgrace—return home, and I shall reward you with travel expenses.” Zhang Hua, after deliberation, agreed. Fengjie then returned, agitated, to Grandmother Jia, exclaiming, “It is all because Sister You did not cancel the engagement properly—now someone has filed a complaint, and the officials are on our case!” Grandmother Jia immediately summoned Second Sister You and asked, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now a complaint has been lodged, what is the meaning of all this?” Second Sister You replied, “They even collected the silver—but it was never formalized!” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now claims he saw neither the silver nor anyone removing him. Yet his father insists that our relatives once agreed, but then reneged when the relative died—leaving us with nothing conclusive. Fortunately, Second Master’s marriage was never consummated, so it matters not. But now that the news is out, how can we send him away without losing face?” Grandmother Jia mused, “Since no marriage was consummated and no one was forcibly deprived, our honor remains intact. Who, then, would dare accuse us?” Second Sister You added, “My mother paid him twenty taels on a certain day to cancel the betrothal, but in desperation he retracted his promise. My sister did nothing wrong.” Grandmother Jia sighed, “Truly, incorrigible wretches are hard to manage. Feng’er, see to it that this matter is resolved.” At her wits’ end, Fengjie sent for Jia Huan again. Jia Huan, knowing well what Fengjie intended, feared that if Zhang Hua were allowed to resume his claim it would bring shame upon the family. He then returned to Jia Zhen and discreetly sent word to Zhang Hua: “Now that you have plenty of silver, why insist on reinstating your arranged marriage? If you persist, you risk inciting our elders to anger—use your silver to return home; any decent man can be found.” Zhang Hua, after careful thought and consultation with his family, agreed. Soon, with the arranged sum, he and his father departed for their native home at daybreak. Later that evening, Fengjie went to see Grandmother Jia and recounted everything: “It is all due to Sister You’s mishandling—the engagement was never formally canceled, and now someone has filed a complaint, risking an official investigation!” Grandmother Jia summoned Second Sister You, asking again, “Since your childhood betrothal was never properly dissolved and now there’s a complaint, what is the meaning of it all?” Second Sister You explained, “They even took the silver—how could nothing have been formalized?” Fengjie interjected, “Zhang Hua now insists he saw no silver or anyone removing him, while his father said that our relatives had once agreed but then reneged upon a death.
When he finally returned and met with everyone, all matters were arranged, though his journey back had stretched nearly to the two‐month limit. Unbeknownst to him, Fengjie had long since made up her mind. Even before Jia Lian’s departure, she had secretly ordered various artisans and laborers to remodel three rooms in the East Wing—fashioning them to match the standards of her own residence with fine decorations and furnishings. Fourteen days later she reported to Grandmother and Wang Xifeng that, on the fifteenth morning, she would lead a procession to the “Aunt’s Temple” (a relative’s temple) for an incense offering. Only four women were to accompany her—Ping’er, Feng’er, Zhou Rui’s wife, and Wang’er’s wife. Before boarding the carriage, she explained the plan to the assembled crowd and then ordered all the men, dressed in plain clothes and simple coverings, to come along immediately. Xing’er was appointed to lead the way, and they marched to the gate, knocking in turn. When the household of Bao Er (the second branch) opened the door, Xing’er laughed and called out, “Quickly, send word back to Second Grandmother—the elder has arrived!” Hearing this, the Bao household’s strong-willed head was startled out of his composure and hurried inside to inform Sister You (the second sister). Although You Er was also taken aback, she quickly arrived and, with proper decorum, greeted Fengjie. At the gate Fengjie herself stepped down from the carriage. You Er, noticing her impeccable attire—her head adorned with plain silver ornaments, her jacket made of moon-white satin, a blue satin vest embroidered with silver thread, and a simple white gauze skirt, with eyebrows curved like willow leaves and her eyes sparkling like phoenixes—marveled at her beauty, reminiscent of a peach in spring and a chrysanthemum in autumn. Soon the wives of Zhou Rui and Wang’er were led into the courtyard. You Er greeted Fengjie warmly, exclaiming “Sister!” and apologizing profusely for not having received her sooner, then kowtowed. Fengjie, laughing and gracious, quickly returned the greeting, taking You Er’s hand and leading her inside. Inside, as Fengjie sat in the main hall, You Er immediately ordered the maidservants to fetch cushions and then bowed, saying:  “My dear, now that you have come here, all matters are decided by Mother and our elder sisters. I am honored to meet you today. Should you not dismiss my humble state, I would be most grateful and would pour out my heart, ever ready to serve you.” After bowing, she stepped back. Fengjie, smiling, replied, “It is only because I too am young. I have always been advised by the women to caution Second Master against frolicking away his time among pretty girls—lest our elders become worried. All this is born of our shared devotion. Who would suspect that, after marrying a younger wife as a second consort, Second Master would undertake such serious matters without consulting me? I even advised him to settle this matter promptly, for if he had produced a son or even a daughter later, I might have some claim of my own. Instead, Second Master, misinterpreting my intentions as jealousy, went ahead and acted on his own, leaving me with grievances I can scarcely express! My heart—only heaven and earth can bear witness. I heard of it in the first ten days, but fearing that Second Master might misread the situation, I dared not speak up until now, when, by fortune, he has already departed. That is why I have come personally to see you, imploring that you sympathize with my plight and arrange for us to be housed together at home. When sisters live together in harmony, offering advice and caring for one another, that is proper etiquette. If you remain away while I am here alone, how could I bear it? And if outsiders were to hear of it, not only would my reputation suffer, but yours as well. Besides, Second Master’s reputation is of utmost importance; our minor squabbles are trivial in comparison. As for the idle gossip of servants, it is only natural—they say I run the household too strictly, and they whisper behind my back. Think: since ancient times it has been said, “The head of the household is like a water jar”—if there is even a slight fault in our leadership, with several elders and sisters and daughters-in-law in the house, how can I possibly be held blameless?
Ping’er and Xiren paired up, and the sound of clinking bracelets filled the room. Before long, Xiangyun bested Baoyu, and Xiren outdid Ping’er; rounds of toasts were exchanged. Xiangyun then declared, “For the verse on the wine’s surface, we need one line from ancient literature, one from an old poem, one from a domino name, one from a tune title, and one line from an official decree—all together forming a verse. And for the base of the toast, we must mention the name of a seasonal fruit or dish.” Everyone replied, “Only his decrees are so tedious to recite—but there’s a charm to them.” They urged Baoyu to speak quickly. Baoyu laughed, “Who ever said that? Let me think…” Daiyu then said, “Drink another cup, and I’ll recite for you.” Baoyu drank heartily, and while he did, Daiyu recited:  “The setting sun flies with the solitary falcon, While fierce winds sweep the river and sky and geese cry in lament— Yet even a single broken wing of a wild goose can shatter one’s stride, Stirring the soul over and over; such is the welcome of a returning guest.” Everyone laughed at the clever verse. Daiyu then picked up a hazelnut kernel and recited for the base of the toast:  “Hazelnuts are not forged by the mortar outside the courtyard— So whence then does the sound of laundry-pounding in countless homes come?” And that concluded the round. Yuanyang, Xiren, and the others then took turns reciting a common proverb, each version including the character “longevity,” with no further embellishment. After a while, they began to play a lively game. With Grandmother Jia and Wang Xifeng absent, no one kept strict order; everyone indulged freely—shouting, calling out, and laughing. The hall was a riot of red and green, with jade gleaming and pearls tinkling—a truly exuberant scene. After playing for a while, everyone began to disperse. Suddenly, however, Xiangyun was nowhere to be seen. Assuming she had stepped outside on her own, they waited—but her figure did not reappear. They sent people in all directions to search, but she was nowhere to be found. Soon after, members of the Lin household, accompanied by several elderly maids, arrived—partly worried that there might be pressing business, and partly fearing that in the absence of Wang Xifeng the young maids might drink to excess and lose all decorum. When Tanchun saw them, she smiled and said, “Come and see—rest assured, we have not overindulged; we were merely jesting, using wine as a pretext. Do not worry, dear ladies.” Li Wan and Aunt You added, “Rest easy; we dare not let you drink too much.” The Lin household people laughed, “We understand. Even though the Dowager insisted the young ladies drink, they refused. With the mistresses absent, we simply had fun. We came to check on you. Moreover, as time goes on, if the young ladies party, they may need a snack. Since they seldom eat extras, if they have only a couple of cups of wine, they might not be nourished enough.” Tanchun laughed, “Mother said so, and we were about to eat.” Then she ordered, “Fetch some snacks!” The little maids all agreed and hurried off to gather some. Tanchun then said, “You all rest; or if you prefer, go chat with Aunt You. I will have someone send more wine for you.” The Lin household people replied, “We dare not accept any more.” After a short while they too left. Ping’er, rubbing her face, laughed, “My cheeks are burning—I’m too embarrassed to face them now. I say we let it be, so as not to provoke them further.” Tanchun laughed, “It matters not—as long as we don’t drink too heavily, nothing will come of it.”  Just then, a little maid bounded in, laughing, “Ladies, look—Miss Yun is so drunk she’s fallen asleep on a cool stone step behind the garden wall!” Everyone laughed, “Quiet now!” They all went to see, and indeed found Xiangyun lying on a secluded stone step against a rock, fast asleep in a drunken stupor.
Later, Bao Yu hurried to the Yíhóng Courtyard and, with a teasing smile, announced to Xiangren, Meiyue, and Qingwen: “Hurry along and go have a look! Who would have thought that our ‘precious sister’ Bao’s own dear kin should appear thus? Her uncles and brothers behave in such a peculiar manner—as if they were her true siblings. And while you always praise our stunning sister, now you see her with her two elder sisters! I find myself at a loss for words. Heaven above, how many brilliant and graceful souls there are! They say nothing is impossible for the determined – yet here, right in our midst, each one outshines the next. I feel I’ve learned something new today.” He chuckled to himself. Xiangren, sensing a mischievous glimmer in his tone, demurred from inspecting further. Qingwen and the others had already gone out and returned with laughter, teasing, “Look at that—a niece of the head of the household, a sister of Miss Bao, and even two sisters of our elder sister – all gathered together like a neat row of slender scallions!”  Before they had finished, Tan Chun entered laughing, “Our poetry society is flourishing!” Bao Yu replied, “Indeed. In a fit of merriment I founded a poetry society – and by some strange twist of fate, these people have gathered. But I wonder: has anyone here truly learned to compose? Tan Chun answered, “I have asked around; though they modestly claim ignorance, judging by their bearing, none are entirely unskilled. Even if some are inept, it is no great matter – just look at Xiangling!” Qingwen teased, “Among them, the younger sister of Miss Xue is even better. How about Third Sister?” Tan Chun replied, “Certainly. In my eyes, even her elder sister and the others pale in comparison.” Xiangren, both astonished and amused, said, “How strange – where else might one find such refined souls? I do long to see them for myself!” Tan Chun continued, “Grandmother will be delighted when she sees them. She has practically insisted that our madams treat these young ladies as proper ‘daughters.’ Grandmother intends to support them; and if any do not stay with us, we shall beg her to let them remain in the garden—thus adding even more delight to our days.” Bao Yu, delighted, quickly asked, “Is that really so?” Tan Chun replied, “When have I ever lied?” and then laughed, “Grandmother’s fondness for her great-grandchild nearly makes her forget about you, my dear.” Bao Yu smiled, “That’s fine – it is only proper to pamper the girls. Tomorrow, on the sixteenth day, we shall begin our society.” Tan Chun added, “But Lin has already awoken and Second Sister is ill; everything is in disarray.” Bao Yu replied, “Even if Second Sister does not compose poetry, what harm is there?” Tan Chun said, “Perhaps we should wait a few days until the new faces settle in, then invite them – our elder sister and our dear one will have renewed spirit, and our society will thrive. If Yun arrives and the newcomers become familiar, our gathering will be even more delightful.” Bao Yu, pleased, grinned broadly, “You truly understand! I have always been such a muddle-minded fellow – lost in frivolity – never thinking of these matters.” With that, the siblings set off together to see Grandmother. Indeed, Mrs. Wang had already recognized Xue Baoqin as her goddaughter. Grandmother was overjoyed and did not insist that they remain in the garden; that very evening she slept by Grandmother’s side. Xue Ke lodged in the study of Xue Pan’s residence. Grandmother and Mrs. Xing said, “Your niece need not return home; stay in the garden for a few days and enjoy yourselves.” Mrs. Xing’s family, having endured hardships, welcomed the arrangement. Mrs. Xing then handed Xiuyan over to Fengjie. Considering that there were many young ladies in the garden with differing temperaments—and that it would be inconvenient to set aside a separate room—Fengjie decided to send Xiuyan to stay with Yingchūn. In the future, if Xiuyan encounters difficulties, even if Mrs. Xing learns of it, it will not concern me.
Ask if she’s still taking medicine.” Jia Rong nodded and left with Jia Lian, accompanied by several pages, all on horseback. As they rode, uncle and nephew chatted idly. With a hidden motive, Jia Lian brought up Second Sister You, praising her beauty and gentle demeanor: “She’s so poised, so soft-spoken, so lovable in every way. Everyone talks about your aunt, but in my view, she can’t compare to your Second Aunt in any aspect.” Sensing his purpose, Jia Rong teased, “Uncle, if you’re that taken with her, I can propose a match for you—would you like her as your second wife?” Jia Lian laughed, “Are you joking or serious?” Jia Rong replied, “I’m quite serious.” Jia Lian laughed again, “I’d love that, but would your aunt allow it? And would your mother consent? Besides, I’ve heard that your Second Aunt is already spoken for.” Jia Rong said, “No problem. My father didn’t raise my two aunts; Mother brought them from a previous marriage. I heard that back in their old household, Mother had betrothed Second Aunt to the family of Zhang, a grain tax clerk, when both sides were still expecting. Later the Zhang family fell on hard times, and Mother then remarried elsewhere. Over the past ten-plus years, both sides lost contact. Mother has often grumbled about calling off that engagement. My father also wanted to find someone else for her. All he needs is to locate that Zhang family, pay them a few taels for compensation, and get a formal release from the engagement. The Zhangs are so poor, they’ll surely agree—and even if they didn’t, they wouldn’t dare oppose us. If you propose taking her as your second wife, I’m sure both my mother and father will consent. The only obstacle might be your own wife!” Hearing this, Jia Lian was overjoyed, so blinded by lust that he ignored his formal mourning status, his wife’s jealousy, and all the impropriety involved, seeing only a perfect plan. Little did he know Jia Rong had his own secret agenda: he had feelings for his aunt, but Jia Zhen’s presence had prevented him from acting. If Jia Lian took her as a concubine and kept her in an outside residence, Jia Rong would have opportunities for his own secret liaisons when Jia Lian was away. Jia Lian, suspecting nothing, thanked Jia Rong, “Good nephew! If you can arrange this, I’ll reward you with two lovely maids!”  They soon arrived at the gate of the Ning mansion. Jia Rong said, “Uncle, go in and ask Mother for that silver, then you can hand it over to Yu Lu. I’ll hurry to Grandmother’s to pay my respects.” Jia Lian laughed and warned him, “Remember, don’t tell her we came together.” Jia Rong replied, “I know,” and, making a quick private gesture to indicate Second Sister, he added, “Don’t be impatient if you see her. Don’t make a scene and spoil everything.” Jia Lian laughed, “Stop teasing. Off you go.”  Jia Rong left for Grandmother Jia’s quarters, while Jia Lian headed into the mansion. The household stewards bowed deeply to greet him, accompanying him to the main hall. Jia Lian asked them a few routine questions, then dismissed them and walked inside alone. In normal circumstances, since Jia Zhen and Jia Lian were close like brothers, there was no need for formal announcements. He reached the main house, and a maid lifted the curtain for him. Entering, he saw only Second Sister You with two maids, busy with needlework. Lady You and Third Sister were nowhere to be seen. Jia Lian quickly greeted her with a broad smile. Second Sister smiled in return and invited him to sit on the seat near the east wall, opposite her. After a few words of greeting, Jia Lian joked, “Where is Madam You? Where is Third Sister? I don’t see them.” Second Sister smiled, “They went to the back just a moment ago. They’ll be here soon.” While a maid went to fetch tea, Jia Lian stole glances at Second Sister.
I was about to ask your grandmother when you arrived. What exactly was he beaten for?” Ping’er gritted her teeth and cursed, “It’s all because of that damned Jia Yucun – that unruly, wild brat! In less than ten years he’s caused endless trouble. This spring, our master found some old fans; when he returned, he discovered that all the fine fans in the house had become useless, so he ordered a search. And who should appear but that insolent scoundrel known as ‘Stone Dullard’—so poor he could barely eat, yet he clings stubbornly to twenty old fans as if he’d never let them go! Our Second Young Master, after enduring so much hardship, invited him into his home and inspected the fans. According to him, these were priceless masterpieces – depicting Xiang Fei, bamboo, deer, and jade – authentic relics of antiquity. When our master heard of it, he offered as many silver taels as necessary. But that Stone Dullard insisted, ‘Even if I starve or freeze, I won’t sell them!’ Our master was beside himself, cursing Second Young Master for his failure. In the end, he promised 500 taels – first exchanging silver, then taking the fans – yet the scoundrel refused, declaring, ‘You must take my life before you can have my fans!’ Think about it – what absurdity is this?” Baochai, upon hearing this, ordered a maid, “Go ask our mother; if she approves, I won’t interfere.” Ping’er went off, and after a while returned, “Sister, did you hear?” Baochai said, “If that is so, then let’s not worry; our master is not one to be trifled with. Even if he suffers a few setbacks, it will eventually all balance out.”  Just then, a young relative arrived. Fengjie and the others quickly rose to greet her. Old Madam Lai sat down and cheerfully said, “I am delighted – were it not for our masters’ favor, where would my joy be? Yesterday, Grandmother even sent Cai Ge with gifts, and my grandson kowtowed at the door.” Li Wan asked with a smile, “How early did you leave last night?” Old Madam Lai sighed, “I can’t keep them in line – they do as they please. Just the other day, someone kowtowed for me at home, and I had nothing kind to say – I scolded him, ‘Boy, don’t think you’re above everyone else! You’re thirty now – even as a servant, your master’s favor should let you read and write like a young gentleman. Yet you don’t even know how to write the word ‘servant’! All you know is how to enjoy your blessings without remembering the hardships your grandfather and father endured – they toiled for generations for you, only for you to squander it away! And now, at twenty, you’ve been granted more, and you’re expected to support your future. Think of all those who starve while you, a mere sprout, are pampered! Now that you’ve been blessed for ten years, if you continue to beg for more, you’ll be the laughingstock of the household!’” Li Wan and Fengjie both laughed, “You exaggerate! We all know he does his best.” Then Old Madam Lai inquired, “But what of that Second Sister’s son? What misdeed has he committed that he must be expelled?” Fengjie laughed, “That is exactly what I was about to tell you. On my birthday the other day, when no one was outside to attend to affairs, that little fellow got drunk. The old lady’s household sent gifts, but he simply sat there cursing. When two women entered, he gathered the little ones inside. One of them dropped a box of steamed buns all over the courtyard. After everyone had gone, I sent Cai Ming to admonish him—and he ended up berating Cai Ming fiercely. That insolent wretch – why hasn’t he been expelled?” Old Madam Lai replied, “I know he is at fault. Beat him, scold him – teach him a lesson so that he may mend his ways. Expelling him outright would be too harsh, for he is not our own flesh and blood but merely the attendant of the madams.
