In the absence of conclusive evidence as to her ultimate fate, it would be futile for us to speculate on that subject. Instead, our narrative returns to the Hermitage. One of the old nuns who had her quarters to the rear of Adamantinas meditation chamber slept that night until four in the morning, when she was awakened by the sound of voices from the front room. Adamantina must be having a restless spell in her meditations, she concluded. But then afterwards she heard heavy and unmistakably male footsteps and the sound of doors and windows opening and closing. She would have risen to investigate, but her limbs had become quite weak and she could not so much as open her mouth to speak. No further sound came from Adamantinas room, and the old nun lay there till dawn in a stupor, with her eyes wide open. It was only then that her head began to clear she threw on some clothes and told the old matrons to heat the water for Adamantinas morning tea. Then she went to the front room, but to her alarm found no trace of Adamantina, and door and windows open wide. She began to have suspicions about the sounds she had heard in the night. Where could she have gone so early in the morning? she asked aloud. Walking out into the Garden, she saw a rope4adder hanging from the wall, and lying on the ground beneath it a scabbard and sash. Oh my goodness! It must have been a burglar last night! He must have put us all to sleep! She called the others to rise and make a search of the Hermitage. The main gate was still firmly closed. Oh dear, the fumes from the stove were terrible last night! grumbled the old matrons and young novices alike when they were summoned. None of us felt like getting up this morning. What do you want us for at this ungodly hour? Sister Adamantina has disappeared! exclaimed the nun. Shes probably in Our Lady Guan-yins chapel meditating. Youre all still dreaming! Come and have a look. The women finally roused themselves in a flurry of alarm, opened the main gate of the Hermitage and searched throughout the Garden. Then it occurred to them that Adamantina might have gone to visit Xi-chun, and they went in a body to knock at the side gate, only to receive another round of abuse from Bao Yong. We dont know where Sister Adamantina went last night, they said. Were looking for her. Open up, old fellow, and let us into the house. We just want to find out if shes been visiting there or not. She was the one who let the burglars in! cried Bao Yong. Now theyve got what they came for, and shes gone off with them to enjoy it! Holy name! exclaimed one of the women. Youll have your tongue cut out in hell for such wicked talk! Bao Yong vehemently Rubbish! Any more trouble from you and Ill have to use force. Women smiling obsequiously now and pleading Please sir, we beseech you, open the gate. Just let us have a look. If shes not there, well never bother you again. Bao Yong Very well. If you dont believe me, go in and look for yourselves. But if you dont find her, I shall want an explanation from you on your way back. He opened the gate and the women went into Xi-chuns apartment. Xi-chun was in very low spirits that morning, and was still brooding about what had happened the previous day Adamantina went home so early yesterday. I wonder if she heard what that servant Bao Yong said. If he has offended her again, shell never come and visit me and then I shall have lost my only real friend in the world. With Mother and Father both dead and my own sister-in-law hating me the way she does, I find it so hard to face other people. Before there was always Granny Jia, I knew I could count on her for affection. Now that shes gone too, Im utterly alone. What will become of me? She thought of the other girls and their various fates Ying-chun driven to her death Xiang-yun married to a consumptive Tan-chun living at the other end of the world ... Each one of them had her destiny, and each was powerless to change its course. Adamantina is the only free one among us, free as a wandering cloud or a wild crane. If I could only be like her, how happy I would be! But how can I hope to follow her example? I belong to a wealthy family! And now Ive let even my family down, and Im in complete disgrace. Neither Aunt Wang nor Aunt Xing understands how I feel. Theres no telling how life will turn out for me!
I shall find someone to inform Aunt Xing. Lady Wang nodded and left Bao-chai to proceed with her plan. Our story now turns to the Mongol prince himself. This gentleman was in fact doing no more than looking for a couple of presentable young concubines to add to his harem, and on the strength of a professional brokers recommendation had sent two of his women to examine Qiao-jie. When they returned, and when their master questioned them about the young ladys provenance, they did not dare conceal the truth. The prince was deeply shocked to learn that she was from such an old and noble family But this is monstrous! Such a thing is strictly forbidden! I have come close to committing a grave crime! Besides, I have already been received in audience by His Majesty and will shortly be choosing a suitable day to start on my return journey. If anyone should come to pursue this matter further, send him packing! This was precisely the day on which Jia Yun and Wang Ren were delivering Qiao-jies horoscope to the palace. When they arrived they met with a brusque reception His Highness has instructed that any person daring to misrepresent a member of the Jia family as a common citizen is to be arrested and dealt with according to due process of law! What an outrageous way to behave in these peaceful times! Wang Ren and Jia Yun skulked off at once with their tails between their legs, grumbling to themselves that someone had betrayed them and going their separate ways in extremely low spirits. Jia Huan was at home waiting for news, and had become very agitated when he received Lady Wangs summons. He saw Jia Yun returning home on his own, and rushed up to him Well? Is everything arranged? Jia Yun stamped his foot frantically Its terrible! Somethings gone badly wrong! I cant think who can have given us away. He told the whole story to Huan, who was at first speechless with rage, then burst out Only this morning I was at Aunt Xings singing the praises of this match now what am I supposed to do? Youre all trying to ruin me! Just as they were wondering how to save the situation, a confused hubbub reached them from the inner apartments. They heard their own names called, wanted by Their Ladyships, and slunk shamefacedly into Lady Wangs apartment. A fine mess youve made of things! exclaimed Lady Wang, waiting for them with fury written on her face. Well, now youve driven Qia-jie and Patience to their deaths! The least you can do is bring me back their corpses! They both knelt at her feet. Jia Huan did not dare to open his mouth, but Jia Yun bowed his head and said I would never have dared to do it myself. We only mentioned this match to you, Great-aunts, because Great-uncle Xing and Uncle Wang suggested it. It was all their idea. Then Great-aunt Xing agreed to it and asked me to write out the horoscope. Now the other party wants to back out. How can you accuse us of driving Qiao-jie to her death? Huan told your great-aunt Xing that they would be arriving in three days to take the girl away, said Lady Wang. Whoever heard of a proper wedding being conducted in such a hurry? I shall ask no more questions. Just give me back Qiao-jie. We shall see what Sir Zheng decides to do with you when he returns. Lady xing wept in silent shame. Lady Wang turned next on Jia Huan That harpy Aunt Zhao evidently left behind her a son every bit as vile as herself! She called one of her maids to support her and retired to her bedroom. Left on their own Jia Huan, Jia Yun and Lady Xing began to indulge in mutual recrimination, until finally one of them said Whats the use of blaming each other like this? The girl probably isnt dead at all. Patience has almost certainly taken her off to hide in the home of a relative. Lady Xing summoned the janitors from the front and rear gates and after giving them a good scolding asked them where Qiao-jie and Patience had gone. Its no good asking us, maam, they replied with one voice. Ask one of the stewards, theyre the ones who ought to know. We wouldnt advise you to make a scene, maam. If Lady Wang should choose to question us, theres plenty we could tell. And if one person is beaten or given the sack, it will have to be everyone. Since Mr Lian left its been a sheer disgrace what has been going on in the front of the mansion. We havent even received our wages or monthly grain allowance, but they ve been drinking and gambling away, fooling around with pretty little actors, inviting girls into the house--is that how masters of the family are supposed to behave?
I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know. How is Mrs Lian? Grandmother Jia asked her before shed finished speaking. Not at all well today, replied Lady Wang on Felicitys behalf. Ail exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet. These young people are the bane of my life! I can see they want to drive me into my grave! She asked her maids to assist her and announced her intention of paying Xi-feng a visit herself Jia Zheng hastened to detain her, and endeavoured to calm her down This has all been so distressing for you, Mother. You have already exerted yourself so much in finding a solution to our problems. You really must give yourself a bit of a rest. I am sure my wife can go over and see to Xi-feng. There is no need for you to expose yourself to any further upsets. If anything serious were to happen to you, how should I ever forgive myself. You may all leave now, ordered Lady Jia. Come back a little later. There are still a few things I want to say. Jia Zheng, his attempt at filial consolation having been thus peremptorily crushed, did not venture to say any more. He went out to superintend the practical arrangements for the convicts departure and instructed Jia Lian to choose some servants to accompany them. Faithful assembled a group of serving-women to carry Xi-fengs presents and to escort Grandmother Jia over to Xi-fengs apartment. Xi-feng was very weak and almost unconscious, while Patiences eyes were red and swollen from crying. When she heard that Lady Jia and Lady Wang, accompanied by Bao-yu and Bao-chai, were on their way, Patience hurried out anxiously to greet them. How is she now? asked Grandmother Jia the moment she saw Patience. Patience was afraid of frightening the old lady. A little better, maam. She escorted the party inside and hurrying over to Xi-fengs bed lightly drew aside the bed curtains. Xi-feng opened her eyes and, when she saw Grandmother Jia enter the room, was filled with shame. Earlier she had come to the conclusion-that the whole family had turned against her, that no one cared for her any more, that they were all indifferent whether she lived or died. And yet now Grandmother Jia had come to visit her personally. Her spirits were immediately restored, and she even struggled to sit up but Grandmother Jia ordered Patience to settle her down again. Dont you move, dear, she said to Xi-feng. Are you feeling a little better now? Oh yes, Grannie, I am. A lot better, replied Xi-feng, holding back her tears. But it grieves me when I think how you and Mother and Aunt Wang have loved me, ever since I came here as a young bride, and how little I have been able to return that love. How cruelly fate has possessed me, driving me quite out of my mind, making me fail in my duty to you and Aunt Wang, preventing me from ever winning your praise ... Yet still you trusted me, still you allowed me to play my part. And all Ive ever done is ruin things for everyone! How can I look you and Auntie in the face again? This visit is more than I deserve. Im afraid Heaven will punish me for it, by taking away most of the few days I may have left to live... She sobbed violently. This whole nonsense was started by the men, Grandmother Jia consoled her. It was nothing to do with you. I know some of your belongings have been taken, but dont you worry Ive brought you all sorts of presents - take a look and see. She instructed one of the serving-women to bring the presents forward and exhibit them. Possessions had always meant a great deal to Xi-feng, and the sudden loss of all of her worldly goods had dealt a severe blow to her morale. She had also been tormenting herself with the thought that everyone in the family secretly blamed her for what had happened, and as a consequence she had all but lost her will to live. This new evidence of Grandmother Jias affection was a much-needed tonic and it seemed that Lady Wang was not really so cross with her either, to judge from the fact that she had accompanied Grandmother Jia.
cried Ripple. Bringing Mr Bao here of all places! Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship are dreadfully worried and have sent everywhere to look for him. Just now the women on the side gate said theyd seen the two of you come in here. Their Ladyships had the fright of their lives when they heard! They scolded me and told me to form a search party and come straight here. Hurry up now, wed better be quick! Bao-yu was still sobbing pitifully, but Aroma and Ripple dragged him away, wiping the tears from his eyes and chiding him with a description of the anxiety his grandmother was suffering on his account. In the end he gave in and followed them back. Aroma could imagine only too vividly how worried Grandmother Jia would be and she took Bao-yu straight back to the old ladys apartment. None of the party had gone home they were all there waiting for Bao-yus return. Aroma! cried Grandmother Jia severely. I thought you were a sensible girl. Thats why Ive always trusted you with Bao-yu. How could you take him into the Garden? Hes only just beginning to get better, and a nasty experience might set him right back. And then where would we be? Aroma did not dare say a word in her own defence, but hung her head in shame. Bao-chai for her part was deeply shocked to see how pale Bao-yu seemed on his return. Bao-yu refused to watch Aroma take the blame, and spoke up on her behalf When we went in it was broad daylight, and there was nothing to be afraid of. I havent been for a walk in the Garden for such a long time, and today Id had a little wine at the party and was feeling in the mood for a stroll. Why did you think I would have a nasty experience? At this last remark of his, Xi-feng, who had herself been so badly scared in the Garden, shuddered and said Bao, you shouldnt be so reckless! Its not recklessness, countered Xiang-yun. Its devotion. He probably went there to find the Hibiscus Fairy. Or maybe it was some other sprite Bao-yu made no reply. Lady Wang seemed too agitated to speak. So there wasnt anything frightening in the Garden then? asked Grandmother Jia. Well, dont lets talk about it any more. But in future, if you want to go walking there, you must at least take more people with you. If it hadnt been for this little escapade of yours, our guests would have left long ago. Off you go now, all of you, and have a good nights sleep. Come back early in the morning. Tomorrow I shall make up for today and see that you enjoy yourselves properly. And this time we wont let him spoil things! They all said goodbye to Grandmother Jia and the party broke up. Aunt Xue stayed the night with Lady Wang, Xiang-yun with Grandmother Jia, while Ying-chun went to stay with Xi-chun. The others all returned to their respective apartments. When Bao-yu reached home, he was still a picture of misery. Bao-chai knew the cause of his endless sighing, and deliberately turned a deaf ear to it. She was concerned however that if he continued like this he might fall into a serious depression and revert to his old idiocy. Going into the inner room she called Aroma aside and questioned her in detail about Bao-yus excursion in the Garden. To learn of Aromas response, you must read the next chapter. CHAPTER 109 Fivey shares a vigil, and receives affection meant for another Ying-chun pays her debt to fate, and returns to the Realm of Primordial Truth Bao-chai, having extracted from Aroma a detailed account of what had happened in the Garden, feared that a fresh bout of grief might indeed cause Bao-yu to fall ill again. In an attempt to avert this she deliberately alluded to Dai-yus dying moments, in the course of an apparently casual conversation with Aroma. Human beings have certain feelings towards each other while they are alive, she went on to say. But after death a person enters a separate realm and becomes a different entity. Someone still alive may continue to be infatuated, but the dead person, the object of that feeling, will be quite oblivious of it. Besides, if Miss Lin has become a fairy, she must take a very dim view of lesser mortals and would hardly deign to mingle with them on this earthly plane. To start imagining such things is to invite trouble and to lay oneself open to possession by evil spirits. She was talking to Aroma, but her words were clearly intended for Bao-yus ears.
We are ruined! thought Lady Xing to hersel With my husband sent into exile in his old age, who can I turn to? Lian is supposed to be my son, but he has always attached himself more to his uncle Zheng than to his own father. Now that we are all dependent on Zheng, Lian and Xi-feng are bound to lean even more towards that side of the family. I shall be completely abandoned I have nothing to look forward to but loneliness and misery for the rest of my days. You-shi had always been in charge of Ning-guo House, and apart from Cousin Zhen she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff. She and Cousin Zhen had a happy marriage moreover. Now he was to be sent away in disgrace, every-thing they had was confiscated, and they would be obliged to look to the Rong-guo branch for support. Grandmother Jia loved her well enough, but still, she would be the recipient of charity, and she would have to bring Lovey and Dove along with her, not to mention young Rong and his wife, who were still too young to be independent. It was really Lians fault that my sisters came to such a wretched end, she reflected. And yet he and Xi-feng have survived unscathed, while we are reduced to this desperate state of affairs. Grandmother Jia was greatly affected by You-shis disconsolate sobbing, and she turned to Jia Zheng and asked him Now that their sentence has been pronounced, will your brother She and young Zhen be allowed to come home to say goodbye? Rong has been acquitted, so I assume that he will be set free. In the normal course of events such a visit would not be allowed, replied Jia Zheng. But I have already asked if as a personal favour Brother She and Cousin Zhen could be allowed home to make preparations for their departure, and the Board of Punishments has most graciously agreed to make this concession. I assume that Rong will be set free and will accompany them. Now, please dont you worry, Mother. I shall do all I can for them. Im growing old and senile, said Grandmother Jia. Its years since I last enquired about the familys finances. The Ning-guo side has had everything confiscated, I know, and that of course includes the house itself. On our side, your brother She and Lian have had their things taken too. Now, youd better tell me how much money do we have left? And what are our estates in the Eastern provinces worth? When those two have to go, we must give them a few thousand taels of silver to take with them. Jia Zheng saw himself caught. If I tell the truth, he thought to himself, I fear it will come as a great blow. But if I conceal it, heaven alone knows how we will be able to pay for our present needs, let alone manage in the future. Had you not asked, Mother, he began, I would never have bothered you with this. But since you have asked, and since Lian is present, I am bound to say that yesterday I examined the family accounts, and discovered the truth. Which is this our exchequer has for a long time been completely empty - in fact, more than empty. There are substantial debts. I must somehow find money, and without delay, to mollify the officials involved in Brother Shes case. Without such intervention I fear they will both suffer, despite His Majestys generous concern. I am still not certain how this money can be raised. The Eastern estates cannot be depended on for anything. The rents for the forthcoming year have long been borrowed against. Our only recourse will be to sell what clothes and jewellery they are lucky enough to have left in their possession, and to let Brother She and Cousin Zhen take the proceeds of that sale with them. How we ourselves will manage afterwards is another matter altogether. Grandmother Jia was once more reduced to floods of tears. Is it really so desperate? Can we have fallen so low? Ive never experienced anything like this. I can remember my own family in the old days they were ten times as grand as us, yet they managed to live beyond their means for years. And even in the end, no such calamity as this ever befell them. It was more gradual. It must have been a year or two before they were finished. But you seem to be saying that we may not even last another year! If only we still had the two hereditary state emoluments to fall back on, said Jia Zheng. Then we might be able to procure a loan. But as things stand, no one is going to lend us a penny. Even his cheeks were now streaming with tears.
She had collapsed on the kang, and was leaning on the little kang-table. Its no good hoping to snatch some rest now! exclaimed Jia Lian. Grandmother is sinking fast and you must be there. Hurry up and tell them to tidy things up in here. And pull yourself together! If the worst happens, we wont be able to get away for quite a while. Weve got nothing left to tidy up! said Xi-feng bitterly. Only a few odds and ends, nothing worth bothering about. You go on ahead, Sir Zheng may want you. Ill come as soon as Im properly dressed. J ia Lian returned to Grandmother Jias apartment and reported discreetly to Jia Zheng that all had been seen to and the various duties assigned. Jia Zheng nodded. The Imperial Physician was announced, and Jia Lian went out to receive him. Grandmother Jias pulses were taken and then the physician emerged to inform Jia Lian in hushed tones Lady Jias pulse-rate is very poor. You must be prepared for the worst. Jia Lian understood and passed the message on to Lady Wang and the others. Lady Wang beckoned Faithful with a meaningful glance and told her to prepare Grandmother Jias funeral clothes. Faithful went to fetch them. The old lady opened her eyes and asked for a drink of tea. Lady Xing brought her a cup of ginseng tea, and she put her lips to it. Not this! she protested. Give me a proper cup of tea! They dared not deny her this request, and promptly brought her a cup of real tea. She took one gulp, and then another, and then announced that she wanted to sit up. Mother, pleaded Jia Zheng on behalf of the others, whatever you want, you have only to tell us but please dont exhaust yourself by trying to sit up. Ive had a drink and I feel a bit better now, she replied. Id like to sit up and chat for a bit. Pearl and the other maids gently supported her with their hands. She seemed momentarily revived. Whether she was to live or die will be told in the next chapter. CHAPTER 110 Lady Jia ends her days, and returns to the land of shades Wang Xi-feng exhausts her strength, and forfeits the familys esteem Grandmother Jia sat up in bed and began to speak I have been part of the Jia family for over sixty years. I have had a long life and enjoyed my full share of happiness. I think I can say that all my children and grandchildren from Zheng downwards have turned out well. As for Bao-yu I have loved him so dearly and Her eyes searched the room for Bao-yu, and Lady Wang pushed him towards the bed. Grandmother Jia extended one hand from beneath the bedcovers and took hold of him My boy, you must promise to do your very best for the family! Yes, Grandma, choked Bao-yu, his eyes brimming with tears. He struggled to contain his weeping and stood listening to her, as she continued I want to see one of my great-grandchildren, and then I think I can set my heart at rest. Wheres my little Lan? Li Wan pushed Lan forwards. Grandmother Jia let go of Bao-yu and took Lan by the hand. You must be a good boy and always do your duty to your mother. And when youre grown up, you must win her honour and glory! Now, wheres Fengie? Xi-feng was standing by the side of the bed and hurried round to face Grandmother Jia. Here I am, Grandma. My child, said Grandmother Jia, your trouble is that youre too clever! Try to be more charitable in future and to make your peace with fate, I know Im not much of a one to talk the most Ive done in my life is try to be honest and to bear my misfortunes with patience. Ive never been the sort for fasting or prayer. The only good work I ever did was to have those copies of the Diamond Sutra made a year or so ago. I wonder if theyve all been distributed yet? Xi-feng informed her that the copies had not yet been distributed. The sooner that act of devotion is completed the better, said the old lady. I know my elder son She and Cousin Zhen are detained in exile, and cannot be here but how could that little devil Xiang-yun be so heartless? Why has she not come to see me? Faithful and her fellow maids knew the reason only too well, but said nothing. Grandmother Jia looked next at Bao-chai. As she did so, she sighed and a flush began to spread across her face. Jia Zheng knew this to be a sign of imminent death.
asked Jia Zheng. Earlier today, replied Xue Ke, I was at the Board of Punishments on business of my own. I was enquiring about Cousin Pans sentence, but while I was there I happened to hear of the indictments brought by two censors against Cousin Zhen. One was for corrupting the sons of noble families, encouraging them to gamble and that sort of thing. That was the lesser of the charges the other was for forcefully taking as a concubine the fiance of an innocent man when she resisted, or so the indictment reads, he subjected her to physical violence and drove her to her death. To corroborate the charges, the censor concerned has arrested a servant of ours named Bao Er and has also brought as witness a certain Mr Zhang. Even the Chief Censorate may be in trouble, as this fellow Zhang originally appealed to them some time ago and had his appeal quashed. Jia Zheng stamped his foot before Xue Ke had finished speaking. What have things come to! This is truly the end! He sighed, and his cheeks were wet with tears. Xue Ke tried to console him, and then went Out again to gather more news. Things look bad, he reported later that day. At the Board of Punishments, I could discover nothing about the two princes and their report to the throne. But I did learn something else. Early this morning a censor named Li presented an impeachment against the magistrate of Ping-an, accusing him of toadying to a metropolitan official, of pandering to his superiors and of Oppressing the common people - together with a whole string of serious related offences. What has that to do with us? replied Jia Zheng somewhat impatiently. What about our own people? The two cases are connected, said Xue Ke. The metropolitan official referred to in Censor Lis impeachment is in fact Uncle She which means that he is implicated in a miscarriage of justice - which is a serious offence. His friends at court want to keep their hands clean if they possibly can, and there is no one even willing to keep us informed. Its the same with the guests who fled from the party just now - they have either gone home, or found some other hiding place in which to lie low until the storm blows over. A few members of the clan are even publicly asking who will be the lucky one to get the title now that the family has been disgraced. They all have an eye on it ... Jia Zheng stamped his foot and interrupted him again This is all the consequence of my elder brothers folly! And of the disgraceful ways into which Ning-guo House had fallen! But enough of this. Who knows if Lady Jia and Lians wife are even still alive! You had best return and continue your enquiries, while I go and see how Lady Jia is. If you have any news, bring it as quickly as you can. As they were speaking, a confused cry was heard from within Her Old Ladyship is sinking! Jia Zheng hurried away in great alarm. To learn if she lived, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 106 Wang Xi-feng feels remorse for the consequences of her past misdeeds And Grandmother Jia prays for the familys deliverance from further calamity Jia Zheng hurried straight in to Grandmother Jias apartment. The shock of the days events had finally taken its toll, and she was unconscious again and breathing fitfully. Lady Wang, with the help of Faithful and the other maids, eventually brought her round. They persuaded her to swallow one of her combined dispersant and sedative boluses, which brought some slight relief. But she remained tearful and distraught. Jia Zheng stood by her side and tried to comfort her and rally her spirits It is Brother She and I who have brought this misfortune on the family and caused you all this distress, Mother. Please try to take heart a little. We will do our utmost to set things to rights. If you should suffer in any way, our burden of guilt will be unbearable! I am over eighty now, replied the old lady, and ever since the day I came here as a girl and was married to your father, I have led a sheltered life. I have been blessed and protected by the family ancestors. Ive never even heard of such terrible goings-on as these. I am too old for it all. I couldnt bear to see you punished. Id rather die, and be spared the ordeal. She burst into tears once again, and Jia Zheng grew more and more agitated about her condition. Suddenly a voice was heard outside calling News from court for the Master! Jia Zheng hurried out. The Prince of Bei-jings aide-de-camp was waiting for him in the main reception hall, and greeted him with the words Excellent news, sir! Jia Zheng thanked the aide for coming and begged him to be seated.
Course, now Im in a bit of a spot meseff, he doesnt want to know, does he! Bloody marvellous I call it! Im tellin you, if I want to, I can take those Jias and rub their snotty little noses in the mud where they belong! The women tried anxiously to forestall any more of his grandiose threats Drunk again, Dad! Youre out of your mind! The bottle was your undoing a couple of days ago, and you got a good hiding for it. And now hark at you! At it again, before your bruises have even had a chance to heal! Think a lickings going to scare me, do you? bragged Dime. All I needed was a lead. It was all I needed. And now Ive got one. Now I can nailem! Oh yes, I got pally with some fellers while I was inside, and I learnt a thing or two. Accordin to them, this countrys crawling with Jias of one breed or another, and a few days back there was a fair number of Jia servants taken in. I was pretty surprised to hear that. I mean, I knew the younger Jias and their servants were a bad lot, but Id always thought the older ones were all right. How come theyd got into trouble? In the end, turns out that these Jias they were talking about were all from out of town - course, theyre still related to the ones in. town. Anyway, theres been some sort of hoo-ha, so these servants have been sent here for trying. So now Ive got my lead! Im laughing! That little Yuns an ungrateful beggar, thats what he is! My mates and I can spread the word on his familys carry-on, the cheating and bullying, the lending money at wicked rates, the wife-snatching ... Oh, if that gets to the top, some headsll roll all right then! Thatll learn em who Dime is! Go to sleep, you drunken old pisspot! cried Dimes missus. Snatching whose wife, in the name of heaven? I never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life! Fat lot youd know, stuck at home all day! retorted Dime. Coupla years back, I was having a throw in one of the dens, met this young feller, name of Zhang, and he told me how his woman was taken off of him by the Jias. Asked me for some advice. I just told him to forget it. Dunno where he is now, havent seen him these two or three years. Next time I bump into that Zhang feller, Ill know what to tell him. Roast that little Yun alive! Make him crawl on his knees! Got my lead now... Dime promptly collapsed onto his bed in a stupor, mumbling incoherently to himself and was soon soundly asleep. His wife and daughter dismissed his threats as the ravings of a drunkard, and early the next morning Dime set off once more for his gambling haunts, where we must leave him. We return to Jia Yu-cun the morning after his return home, refreshed by a good nights sleep, he told his wife who, it will be remembered, had once been in service with the Zhen family in Soochow of his encounter with Zhen Shi-yin. She reproached him for his heartlessness Why did you not go back to look for him? If he has been burnt to death, we will be guilty forever of having done him a great wrong! She began to weep, and Jia Yu-cun tried to justify himself How could I have intervened? A being like that lives on a different plane from people like us. He would only have resented the interference. At that moment a message was brought in for Yu-cun The runner sent by Your Honour yesterday to investigate the fire at the temple has come to deliver his report. Yu-cun strolled out to receive the runner, who dropped one knee to the ground and said I went back as you told me to, sir. I braved the flames and went into the temple to see if I could find the Taoist. His hut was completely razed to the ground, even the wall behind it had collapsed, and there was no trace of the old man. He must have been roasted alive...... All that was left was his prayer-mat, and drinking-gourd somehow they both seemed to have survived intact. I looked all over the place for any human remains, but there was not so much as a bone to be seen. I was going to bring you the prayer-mat and gourd, to show you, in case you didnt believe me, sir but when I picked them up they lust turned to ashes in my hands.
Fools! exclaimed Xi-feng. This is your job! Of course youll get whatever you need! The servants reluctantly applied themselves to their impossible tasks, while Xi-feng went straight to the main apartment to seek Ladies Xing and Wangs permission for the necessary utensils. But there was still such a throng of guests around them that it was impossible for her to get a word in. Evening was drawing on, and in despair she went to see Faithful and asked her for the use of Grandmother Jias spare dinner service. Why come asking me for it? exclaimed Faithful. Mr Lian pawned it a couple of years ago! Youd better ask him if he ever redeemed it. I dont want the silver or gold, said Xi-feng. The regular service will do. What do you suppose Lady Xing and Mrs You have been using since they moved in? asked Faithful pointedly. Xi-feng knew she must be telling the truth, and left at once for Lady Wangs apartment, where she managed to talk Silver and Suncloud into lending her a service, had a quick inventory made by Sunshine, and told him to hand the things over to the servants. Faithful saw Xi-feng in this state of disarray, and although she did not call her back to complain, she thought to herself Why is Mrs Lan, who used to be so capable, bungling things so badly this time? The past couple of days have been a disgrace. Its poor gratitude for Her Old Ladyships love! She was not aware that Lady Xing was deliberately starving Xi-feng of funds. Jia Zhengs views on economy coincided neatly with Lady Xings own anxieties about the future, and she saw every tael saved on the funeral as a contribution not only to the familys reserves, but also to her own financial security. Her position in this was strengthened by the fact that strictly speaking it was Grandmother Jias eldest son who should have been in charge of the funeral. Jia She was not at home, but Jia Zheng was an incorrigible stickler for convention, and whenever consulted would reply Ask Lady Xing what she thinks. Lady Xing considered Xi-feng extravagant and Jia Lian untrustworthy, and consequently held tightly on to every penny of the funeral funds. Faithful however took it for granted that the money for the funeral had already been issued, and ascribing the present crisis to a lack of zeal and loyalty on Xi-fengs part, she redoubled her wailing before the coffin of her dead mistress. Lady Xing and Lady Wang knew only too well what Faithful was complaining about, but so far from acknowledging that the cause lay in their own refusal to equip Xi-feng properly for her task, they began criticizing Xi-feng out loud Faithful is right Feng is letting us down badly... In the evening, Lady Wang summoned Xi-feng and rebuked her We may be living in somewhat straitened circumstances, but we must maintain our standards none the less. During the past two or three days Ive noticed that the maids have not been looking after our guests properly. Clearly you have failed to give them adequate instructions. Please will you make more of an effort and show a little more family spirit. Xi-feng was speechless. She would have brought up the fact that she had not been issued with any money, but money was supposed to be Jia Lians province, whereas Lady Wang was complaining about the inside service. She dared not answer back. Strictly speaking, said Lady Xing, who was standing to one side, your Aunt Wang and I, as Lady Jias daughters-in-law, should be taking care of the reception, not a member of the junior generation but were very tied up with the mourning, and that is why we delegated the responsibility to you. You mustnt think you can be slack. Xi-feng blushed fiercely. She was about to say something in her own defence when she heard a drum begin outside it was time for the dusk offering of paper money. A wail rose from the assembled mourners and her chance to speak had gone. She thought she would wait till later, but after the offering Lady Wang urged her to hurry about her duties. We can take care of things here. You go and see to it that everything is in order for tomorrow. Xi-feng did not dare utter a word, but went out, containing her chagrin and her tears as best she could. She called another meeting of the staff and reminded them once more of their duties Ladies, dears, take pity on me I beg you! I am being blamed for everything by Their Ladyships, and its all because you are not doing your jobs properly. You are making a laughing stock of us.
On his arrival at the provincial capital, he reported to his superiors and immediately proceeded to his new yamen to take ceremonial possession of the official seal and to assume office. His first administrative action was to take stock of the grain lying in all the granaries of the sub-prefectures and shires under his jurisdiction. Jia Zhengs previous experience as an official had been mainly in the capital, and had been restricted moreover to the theoretical aspects of the metropolitan bureaucracy. His one provincial appointment had been as an Examiner, and his responsibilities then were of a purely academic nature. He therefore had no first-hand knowledge of the practicalities of provincial administration, let alone of the forms of corruption widely tolerated - the cuts taken by middlemen, or the extortion practised on the ignorant peasantry, to mention but two. He knew of such things in theory only, as evils to be avoided, and was adamant that his would be an incorruptible administration. On arrival he consulted with his private secretaries and issued a public notice strictly forbidding malpractice of any kind, and announcing that any instance of it would be investigated and reported to the authorities. At first the locally employed clerks were overawed and tried their utmost to ingratiate themselves with the new incumbent, only to discover that the man they were dealing with was totally inflexible. As for Jia Zhengs family servants, they, after years of unprofitable service in the capital, had rubbed their hands with glee at the news of their masters provincial posting and, on the strength of their anticipated profits, had borrowed money to buy clothes and equip themselves in a manner befitting their new station. Money would fall into the laps of a Grain Intendants staff. Or so they had assumed. But now all their plans were being foiled by their masters blind insistence on enforcing the regulations to the last letter and by his obstinate refusal to accept a single one of the bribes offered by the sub-prefects and magistrates. The porter, head clerk and other local staff in the yamen made a few mental calculations If this lasts another fortnight, well have pawned all our clothes, and our creditors will start to press for payment what will we do then? Theres good money staring us in the face Out there, if we could only lay our hands on it! When these locals voiced their concern to the newly arrived staff whom Jia Zheng had personally recruited in the capital, they met with an indignant response You havent staked your last penny on this venture - were the ones that should be complaining, not you! We paid money to get our jobs, and here we are after more than a month with nothing to show for it. At this rate we wont break even. We might as well hand in our notices tomorrow. Which is exactly what they did. The following day they went in a body and tendered their resignations to a bewildered Jia Zheng, who commented somewhat naively Very well. You were free to come. You are free to return. If you find it uncongenial here, please feel under no obligation to stay. This group went grumbling on their way. The family servants next held a council of war among themselves Its all very well for them. Theyre free to go. But what about us ? We cant leave even if we want to. Among these servants was a porter by the name of Li Shi Ten, who soon took a prominent part in the debate. You chickens! he scoffed. Dont be so helpless! While that contract mob was here I wasnt going to say anything but now that theyve pushed off I dont mind showing you a trick or two! Ill soon have that Master of ours eating out of the palm of my hand! But youve got to back me up. Stick together, and we can all go home with our pockets full. Of course, if youd rather keep out of this, thats all right by me. I can manage. I can get the better of you lot any day! Come on, Ten old mate! Were depending on you! groaned the others. You know youre the one the Master trusts. If you wont help us, were done for! All right. But you ve got to trust me too. Dont leave me to do all the dirty work and bring in the money, and then turn on me and say Ive taken more than my fair share. No chance of that. You know were broke. Anythings better than nothing. As they were speaking, the granary clerk came in, and asked for Mr Zhou. Ten, who was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and his chest puffed out, asked him what his business was with Mr Zhou. The clerk stood to attention with his hands at his sides and smiled uneasily. The new Intendant has been in office more than a month now, he replied, but not a single granarys been opened to take in the tax-grain.
What you said just now, Aroma, about the registers, has set me thinking. If I ever have a dream like that again, I must be more observant. I may see things and be able to predict the future. Hark at you! retorted Aroma. Its impossible to have a sensible conversation with you. You insist on taking a chance remark of mine in deadly earnest. Even supposing you could see into the future, what good would it do you anyway? It will probably never come to pass, replied Bao-yu. But if I ever did know the future, then at least it would mean an end to all the worries that plague me on your account. Bao-chai came up to them What are you two talking about? Bao-yu was afraid of being subjected to one of her inquisitions, and merely replied We were discussing Cousin Feng. There she is dying, exclaimed Bao-chai, and youre discussing her! You accused me last year of being unduly gloomy and bringing her bad luck but wasnt my interpretation of that oracle the right one after all? Bao-yu thought for a moment, then clapped his hands Of course! Of course you were right! Youre obviously the prophet in the family! Well, let me consult you myself. Whats in store for me? Off you go on one of your hobbyhorses again! Bao-chai chided him with a smile. Mine was simply an off-the-cuff explanation for the wording of the oracle. Theres really no need to take it seriously. Youre as bad as Xiu-yan. When you lost your jade, she asked Adamantina to consult the planchette, and the answer was totally unintelligible to everyone but that didnt stop Xiu-yan from talking to me in private about Adamantinas amazing powers of clairvoyance, saying how enlightened and advanced she was in her Zen practice. And yet look at this calamity thats befallen Adamantina now - why couldnt she have predicted that? What sort of clairvoyance is that supposed to be? Just because I said something once about Cousin Feng, that doesnt mean I ever claimed to see into her future, or into my own for that matter. Claims of that sort are fantastic and dont deserve to be taken seriously. All right, said Bao-yu, lets drop the subject. Tell me about Xiu-yan instead. Weve been so busy that her wedding seems to have passed us by altogether. That was an important event for your family, and yet it was celebrated with so little ceremony. Didnt you even invite any relatives and friends? Youve missed the point again, replied Bao-chai. My own familys dosest relatives are the Jias and the Wangs. Theres no one respectable left in the Wang family now, and the Jias werent invited because my mother knew wed be too busy with Grandmothers funeral. Lian lent a hand, and one or two other relations came - but you wouldnt know about that, as you werent there. If you think about it, things were much the same for Xiu-yan as they were for me. She was formally engaged to Cousin Ke, and Mama wanted a stylish wedding. But in the first place, Pan was still in gaol, so Cousin Ke wanted to keep it simple then there was Grandmothers funeral and Xiu-yan was having such a hard time at Aunt Xings, especially after the confiscation, when Aunt Xing became Stingier than ever. Poor Xiu-yan, she could hardly bear it. I talked to Mama, and in the end she decided to go ahead and make do with a simple ceremony. Xiu-yan seems a lot happier now and she is so good to Mama, far better than her real daughter-in4aw ever was. Shes a wonderful wife to Ke, and gets on very well with Caltrop. If Ke has to be away for some reason, the two of them still manage very happily together. They are a bit hard up, but Mama is a great deal more relaxed than she used to be. She still gets upset about Pan, and hes always writing to her from gaol and asking for more money. But luckily Cousin Ke has been able to collect some of the debts that were owing, and has sent Pan the money from that. Some of our town properties have had t6 be mortgaged too. We still have one house left, and thats where Mama is planning to move now. Whats the need? protested Bao-yu. Its so much more convenient for you to have them living close by. If they move so far away, it will be a whole days expedition to visit them. Even when families are as closely related as ours, said Bao-chai, its really much better in the long run to be independent.
One of the women told the tale, how they had heard sounds in the night, had been put to sleep by the incense, had found Adamantina missing in the morning and discovered the rope-ladder and scabbard by the Garden wall. Xi-chun was both distressed and puzzled. She recalled Bao Yongs accusations of the previous day, but dismissed them at once from her mind, reflecting that most probably the burglars had spotted Adamantina and come back during the night to carry her off. But she knew Adamantina surely a person of such chastity and pride would have died rather than submit to such indignity? Didnt you hear anything? she asked of the women. We heard, they replied. But we couldnt do anything. We could only lie there with our eyes wide open, unable to say a word. The burglars must have put us to sleep by burning some sort of incense. And Sister Adamantina must have been overcome with the fumes too. Thats why she couldnt speak either. Besides, there were probably a lot of them, armed to the hilt, so she would have been too scared to make a noise or cry out. Bao Yong could be heard yelling from the gate Get those stupid old hags out of here and close the gate at once! Landscape, who was afraid of causing fresh trouble, told the women to leave immediately and gave orders for the gate to be closed. Xi-chun was now more miserable than ever. Landscape and her other maids repeatedly urged her to take a more reasonable view, and persuaded her to put up the remaining portion of her hair. We mustnt spread the word about Adamantina, they all agreed. Even if it is true, we must behave as if we know nothing until Sir Zheng and Lady Wang come home. From this day, Xi-chuns determination to renounce the world was immovable. But of this no more at present. -1014 When Jia Lian returned to the Temple of the Iron Threshold, he reported t6 Jia Zheng that he had interrogated the men on night-duty and had seen to it that an inventory was prepared and delivered to the authorities. How did you manage with the inventory? asked Jia Zheng. Jia Lian showed him a copy of the list Amber had made up from memory, adding All Grandmothers presents from Her Grace are clearly indicated. Any other unusual or conspicuous items have been left off the list. When my period of mourning is over, I shall instigate a search for those items and am confident we shall find them. Jia Zheng thought this course of action wise, and nodded his silent approval. Jia Lian went in to see Ladies Xing and Wang, and begged them to urge Jia Zheng to return home as soon as possible. The longer they stayed away the greater the chaos would be when they got back. I quite agree, said Lady Xing. So long as we stay here, well only be in this dreadful suspense anyway. I would not dare suggest an early departure myself said Jia Lian. But if it came from you, Mother, I am sure Uncle Zheng would agree. Lady Xing discussed the matter with Lady Wang, and they both agreed that Lians suggestion was a good one. As it turned out, by the next morning Jia Zheng was himself anxious to return and sent Bao-yu into the ladies with this message I propose that we return today and resume our mourning here in two or three days time. I have given the necessary instructions to those of my servants who are staying behind would the ladies be so good as to do likewise? Lady Xing instructed Parrot and some of the other maids to stay as mourners, and left Zhou Ruis wife and a few of the older stewardesses in overall charge. Everyone else was to return home. There was an immediate bustle of activity as carriages were prepared and horses saddled, and Jia Zheng led the family in a final lamentation, bidding ceremonial farewell to Grandmother Jias mortal remains. They had all risen from their prostrations and were about to leave, when they noticed that Aunt Zhao was still down on her knees. Aunt Zhou thought she must still be weeping and came over to help her up. But something more than grief had incapacitated her she was foaming at the mouth, her eyes were fixed in a glassy stare, her tongue protruded from her face. The sight gave everyone a nasty turn, and Jia Huan came up to his mother crying frantically, which seemed to bring her round momentarily. I wont go home! she began babbling. Im going back to the South with Lady Jia! But why should Lady Jia need you to go with her? they asked. Ive been with her all my life. Sir She wanted to separate us and tried all manner of tricks to lay his hands on me.
It was Mrs Zhou who said to Jia Lian These people barged in, and without so much as a look at Mrs Pan this lady began to slander Mrs Xue. We tried to talk some sense into her, but then this ruffian butted in, and started using the most dreadful language in front of the young ladies. What a shocking way to carry on! Theres no point arguing with him now, replied Jia Lian. It would only be a waste of time. When they question him under torture, hell remember soon enough that the inner apartments are strictly reserved for women and that he has no right to be in here. His mother could surely have come to inspect her daughters corpse by herself. It will look extremely suspicious to the authorities, very much as if he had come to rob the place. Jia Lians men managed by one means or another to keep Xia San under control outside, while Mrs Zhou, emboldened by the presence of so many Jia supporters, began denouncing Mrs Xia in earnest Really, madam, you should know better. You should have found out the facts when you arrived. Your daughter must have poisoned hersel The only other person it could have been is Moonbeam. Why go slandering without bothering to find out the truth and without so much as seeing the corpse for yourself? Do you think ours is the kind of family to stand by and let a daughter4n-law die without discovering the cause of her death? Moonbeam and Caltrop have both been bound. Your daughter had asked for Caltrop to move into her room earlier, because she said she wanted to keep an eye on her illness. Thats why Caltrop was also there at the time of Mrs Pans death. We were hoping that you could be present at the inquest and hear the officer establish the truth of the matter. Jin-guis mother knew that she was beaten, and she followed Zhou Ruis wife into Jin-guis apartment. She saw her daughters corpse lying stiff on the kang, the face caked in dry blood, and at once broke down and began sobbing. Moonbeam, seeing someone from her side, cried out Madam was so kind to Caltrop! She even shared her own room with her! But Caltrop grabbed the first chance that came along of poisoning her! The Xue family and servants raised a cry of protest Nonsense! Who was it cooked the soup that Mrs Pan drank before she died? You! I cooked it and served it, said Moonbeam, but then I had to go out on an errand. Caltrop must have got up and put poison in the soup while I was out. Before Moonbeam could finish speaking Jin-guis mother lunged at Caltrop and could only be restrained by the concerted efforts of the servants. Aunt Xue spoke next This looks very much like a case of arsenic poisoning to me. We certainly dont keep any arsenic in the house. Whoever it was that did this must have commissioned someone else to buy the poison in town. The truth will come out at the inquest. Well, wed best tidy her up and lay her out properly now in readiness for the officer from the Board of Punishments. The old serving-women came forward, lifted Jin-gui up and laid her out. With so many men about, said Bao-chai, you had better clear away all those womens knick-knacks. As they were tidying up, a little crumpled paper package came to light beneath the mattress on the kang. Jin-guis mother spotted it and picked it up to inspect it more closely. It was empty and she threw it down again. Moonbeam saw it, however, and cried out Look! Theres evidence! I recognize that package. A few days ago we were having a lot of trouble with mice, and when Mrs Pan went on one of her trips home, she asked her brother to buy some poison. It was in that package. I remember her putting it away in one of her jewellery boxes when she got back. Caltrop must have seen it there and used it to poison Mrs Pan. If you dont believe me, have a look in the jewellery box and see if theres any left. Jin-guis mother did this. She opened the jewellery box, which was empty save for a few silver hairpins. What has become of all her jewellery? said Aunt Xue in surprise. Bao-chai told the servants to open the trunks and cupboards. All were empty. Who could have taken all these things? she asked. We had better question Moonbeam. Jin-guis mother seemed to become very apprehensive all of a sudden. Why should Moonbeam know about my daughters things? she protested. Come, maam, put in Zhou Ruis wife, thats hardly a very sensible question.
She set off in great haste with the two maids. She arrived to find Jia Lian already at home, and could tell from the expression on his face that he was in a worse humour than usual. Although she wanted to ask what the matter was, she reflected that she would only be scolded for her pains, and so went straight to bed. Next morning Jia Lian rose at dawn, intending to pay an early call on Qiu Shi-an, Eunuch Superintendent of the Inner Palace, to seek his help in connection with some personal matter. He had a little time to spare before setting off and began glancing through the copies of the Gazette that had been delivered the day before and were lying on his table. The first item he happened to read was a routine report from the Board of Civil Office, in which the Board requested an expedited appointment to the vacant position of Senior Secretary, and received imperial authorization to proceed according to precedent. The next report was from the Board of Punishments, and communicated a memorial from the Governor of Yunnan Province, Wang Zhong, concerning the arrest of a gang engaged in smuggling firearms and gunpowder. There were eighteen members of the gang in all, the ringleader being one Bao Yin, a domestic in the employment of Grand Preceptor Jia Hua, Duke of Zhen-guo. Jia Lian paused and appeared to be turning this last item of news over in his mind for a moment. Then he read on to the next item, an impeachment brought by Li Xiao, the magistrate of Soochow. The charge in this case was that a certain mandarin had indulged his household servants and allowed them to abuse their position in the maltreatment of soldiers and civilians. It referred in particular to the attempted rape and subsequent murder of an innocent married woman, and two other members of her family, committed by one Shi Fu, who claimed to be a servant in the household of Jia Fan, hereditary noble of the third degree. Jia Lian seemed especially troubled by this last report. He would have liked to read the sequel, but was anxious not to miss his appointment with the eunuch. Changing into formal attire and dispensing with breakfast though he did find time to take a couple of sips of the tea that Patience had just brought him, he left the house, mounted his horse and set off. Patience put away his clothes and went in to wait on Xi-feng, who was still in bed. I heard you tossing and turning last night, maam. You can hardly have slept a wink. Why dont I give you a rub, and then maybe youll be able to have a little nap? Xi-feng made no reply, and Patience, interpreting this as consent, climbed up onto the kang, sat down next to her and started to administer a gentle massage. Xi-feng was on the point of falling asleep when she heard Qiao-jie crying in the next room and opened her eyes again. Patience called out Nannie Li, what are you doing? Qiao-jies crying. Go and pat her on the back, you lazy old so-and-so! Nannie Li was rudely awakened from her slumbers, and vented her ill humour on Qiao-jie by giving her a few hefty spanks, muttering to herself Confound you, you wretched little brat! Youve not long to live anyway so just shut up and go to sleep, instead of carrying on as if your mother was dead, bawling at this ungodly hour! She gnashed her teeth and gave the child a pinch for good measure. Qiao-jie began bawling again at once. For heavens sake! Just listen to that! exclaimed Xi-feng. Shes torturing my little girl! You go and give her the thrashing of her life, the evil old strumpet! And bring Qiao-jie in here to me. Dont be too cross, maam, said Patience with a placatory smile. Nannie Li would never dream of doing Qiao-jie any harm. It must have been an accident. If we beat her, there will be no end to the gossip. I can just hear it Beating the servants before the days even dawned! After a long silence, Xi-feng heaved a deep sigh See what they get up to while Im still alive and kicking! When I die - which wont be long now - I dread to think what will become of my poor Qiao-jie! How can you speak like that, maam? said Patience, trying to smile again. Dont start the day off on such a gloomy note! Xi-feng smiled bitterly What makes you so optimistic? I wont last much longer. Ive known it for some time. When I look back over my twenty-five years, I really cant complain.
As he was speaking, another servant rushed in crying The monks gone berserk! Hes crashing his way in and none us can stop him! This is unbelievable! exclaimed Jia Lian. Send him packing this instant! When he learned what had happened, Jia Zheng was as flummoxed as Jia Lian. Meanwhile more cries came from within Bao-yu is sinking! Jia Zheng was growing desperate, when he heard the monks voice calling If you want the boy to live, just bring me the money! Jia Zheng suddenly thought It was a monk who cured Bao-yus earlier illness perhaps this monk can save him after all. But if the jade is genuine, how will we ever raise the money for it? After a moments reflection, he concluded to himself Oh well, we can think of that in due course. Lets cure him first, and bargain later. By the time he had reached this decision and despatched a servant with an invitation, the monk was already on his way, and without so much as a bow or a word of acknowledgement went striding into Bao-yus room. Jia Lian tried to restrain him, saying There are ladies in there! A tramp like you cant go barging in! Any delay, cried the monk, and it may be too late to save him! Jia Lian was too flustered to be able to do anything but follow him, calling out in confusion Quiet now! Stop your weeping! The monk has arrived! He continued calling out like this, but Lady Wang and the others were far too overwrought by Bao-yus condition to pay him any attention. When eventually they did look round, they were shocked to see the great burly figure of the monk descending on them, and at the last moment tried unsuccessfully to conceal themselves, while the monk made straight for the kang on which Bao-yu lay. Bao-chai withdrew to one side, but Aroma felt she should stay with Lady Wang, who had remained standing where she was. Ladies, I have brought the jade, proclaimed the monk. He held it up, as he continued Give me the money, and I can save the lad. Shock had utterly incapacitated Lady Wang, and she and the other ladies were certainly in no fit state to judge the authenticity of the stone exhibited to them. -294 Just save him, they cried, and the money will be yours! The monk laughed. I want it now! Dont worry, said Lady Wang. You shall have the money without fail, even if we have to pawn everything we have. The monk seemed to find this suggestion hysterically funny, and after a good deal of laughter he held the jade out in one hand, bent down and whispered in Bao-yus ear Bao-yu! Precious Jade! Your Stone has returned! No sooner had he spoken than Bao-yu opened his eyes a slit. He lives! cried Aroma ecstatically. Where is it? asked Bao-yu. The monk placed the jade in Bao-yus hand. At first Bao-ya clutched it tightly, then slowly he turned his hand palm upwards and brought the Stone up to eye-level. He peered at it closely and exclaimed Ah! We are reunited at last! Everyone began uttering fervent prayers to the Lord Buddha, and even Bao-chai now seemed oblivious of the monks male presence. Jia Lian came across to see what had happened, and the sight of a revivified Bao-yu brought momentary cheer to his heart too. Suddenly he slipped out , and without a word the monk raced after him and overtook him. Jia Lian had no choice but to escort the monk to the reception hall and then hurry over to inform Jia Zheng who was enormously relieved by the news, and sent for the monk straight away, bowing to him and expressing his profound thanks. The monk returned the salutation and sat down. Jia Lian thought himself apprehensively Now he wont budge till hes been paid... Jia Zheng scrutinized the monk. It was not, he concluded, one the two he had seen on the previous occasion. From which holy establishment do you hail? he enquired. And what pray is your reverends own name in religion? Where did obtain my sons stone talisman? How is it that the sight of it cured him so quickly? The monk greeted this stream of questions with an inscrutable smile Dont ask me. I have not the slightest idea. Just give me my thousand taels, and well call it a day. Jia Zheng could see he was dealing with rather a brusque sort of fellow, and was nervous of offending him The money? Why yes, of course you shall have it ...
The Viceroy has asked for his dismissal. Jia She was stunned This must surely be some idle rumour. Why, there was a letter from your uncle Zheng only the other day. Full of good news. He wrote that Tan-chun had arrived safely, and that he had chosen a suitable day to escort her to her future husbands family on the coast. The journey had passed off without mishap. Absolutely no cause for concern. Whats more, the Viceroy is supposed to be related to Tanchuns husband, and even gave a party to celebrate the wedding. How could the man impeach his own relative? Well, its no use speculating like this youd better go and see the Civil Office people. Find out what you can, and report straight back to me. Jia Lian departed at once, and returned a few hours later. Its as I feared, Father. Uncle Zheng has been impeached. However, as an act of Imperial clemency his case did not go through the normal channels, but was dealt with directly by His Majesty. I have the exact wording of the Imperial Rescript On account of Jia Zhengs failure to control subordinate officials, and on account of the extortionate levying of tax-grain and cruel exploitation of the common people perpetrated under his administration, he deserves to he dismissed altogether. But because this is his first provincial posting, and because he is inexperienced as an administrator and has in this matter been deceived by his own subordinates, he is only to be demoted three grades, and by a special dispensation will be reinstated as Under-Secretary in the Board of Works. He is to return at once to the capital. This news is official. While I was at the Board of Civil Office a county magistrate from Kiangsi came for an audience. He said he was indebted to Uncle Zheng in many ways and had a high opinion of him, but considered him an inept manager of people. His servants got up to all sorts of skulduggery behind his back, and were squeezing the local officials for all they were worth. Uncles reputation was already ruined. The Viceroy had known about it for some time, and he too was of the opinion that Uncle Zheng was basically a good man. I dont know quite why he brought the impeachment in the end. Perhaps he was afraid that things had got out of hand and that more serious trouble might lie ahead. In using this relatively minor charge as grounds for impeachment, maybe he was really trying to save Uncle Zheng from an even worse fate. Jia She interrupted Jia Lian Go and tell your aunt Wang about this straight away. But dont trouble your grandmother at present. So Jia Lian went to report to Lady Wang. For the sequel, please turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 103 Jin-gui dies by her own hand, caught in a web of her own weaving Yu-cun encounters an old friend in vain, blind to the higher truths of Zen Jia Lian gave Lady Wang a full account of Jia Zhengs misfortune. The next day he paid another call at the Board of Civil Office, and on his return reported once more to Lady Wang, assuring her that he had done his utmost to put in a word for Jia Zheng in the right quarters. So youre sure the news is genuine? she asked. Well, I dare say your Uncle Zheng will be none too displeased. In fact it will come as something of a relief to us all. He was never really suited to a provincial posting, and if he had not come home now Im afraid those rascals would one day have ruined him altogether! How is it that you are so well informed in this matter? asked Jia Lian. Ever since your uncle Zheng has been at this post, replied Lady Wang, not a penny has been remitted. On the contrary, He has been secretly sending here for considerable sums. You have only to look at the way the servants wives are already decking themselves out in all sorts of fancy gold and silver ornaments to know whats been going on. Its obvious that their husbands have been making money behind your uncle Zhengs back. He just lets them get away with it. If it had gone any further, not only would he have lost his job but the inherited family rank might have been forfeited as well! Youre quite right, Aunt, said Jia Lian. I confess that I was very shocked when I first heard the news. But now that I know the full facts of the case I feel considerably easier about it. It will be much better for Uncle Zheng this way. He will be able to work here in the capital in peace and quiet for a few years, without endangering his reputation any further. I think even Grandmother will be quite relieved when she hears the whole story. But I feel you should break it gently to her all the same.
I think all will be well. Doctor Wang left the room, accompanied by Jia Lian, to write out his prescription. Grandmother Jia could tell that this time Dai-yu was seriously ill, and as they left the room, she said to Lady Wang and Xi-feng I do not wish to sound gloomy or bring her bad luck, but I fear she has small hope of recovery, poor child. You must make ready her grave-clothes and coffin. Who knows, such preparations may even turn her luck. She may recover, which will be a mercy for us all. But it would be sensible anyway to be prepared for the worst, and not be taken unawares. We shall be so busy over the next few days. Xi-feng said she would make the necessary arrangements. Grandmother Jia then questioned Nightingale, but she had no idea who it was that had upset Dai-yu. The more she thought about it, the more it puzzled Grandmother Jia, and she said to Xi-feng and Lady Wang I can understand that the two of them should have grown rather fond of one another, after growing up together and playing together as children. But now that they are older and more mature, the time has come for them to observe a certain distance. She must behave properly, if she is to earn my love. Its quite wrong of her to think she can disregard such things. Then all my love will have been in vain! What you have told me troubles me. She returned to her apartment and sent for Aroma again. Aroma repeated to her all that she had told Lady Wang on the previous occasion, and in addition described the scene earlier that day between Dai-yu and Bao-yu. And yet, when I saw her just now, said Grandmother Jia, she still seemed able to talk sense. I simply cannot understand it. Ours is a decent family. We do not tolerate unseemly goings-on. And that applies to foolish romantic attachments. If her illness is of a respectable nature, I do not mind how much we have to spend to get her better. But if she is suffering from some form of lovesickness, no amount of medicine will cure it and she can expect no further sympathy from me either. You really shouldnt worry about Cousin Lin, Grandmother, said Xi-feng. Lian will be visiting her regularly with the doctor. We must concentrate on the wedding arrangements. Early this morning I heard that the finishing touches were being put to the bridal courtyard. You and Aunt Wang and I should go over to Aunt Xues for a final consultation. There is one thing that occurs to me, however with Bao-chai there, it will be rather awkward for us to discuss the wedding. Maybe we should ask Aunt Xue to come over here tomorrow evening, and then we can settle everything at once. Grandmother J ia and Lady Wang agreed that her proposal was a good one, and said It is too late today. Tomorrow after lunch, let us all go over together. Grandmother Jias dinner was now served, and Xi-feng and Lady Wang returned to their apartments. Next day, Xi-feng came over after breakfast. Wishing to sound out Bao-yu according to her plan, she advanced into his room and said Congratulations, Cousin Bao! Uncle Zheng has already chosen a lucky day for your wedding! Isnt that good news? Bao-yu stared at her with a blank smile, and nodded his head faintly. He is marrying you, went on Xi-feng, with a studied smile, to your cousin Lin. Are you happy? Bao-yu burst out laughing. Xi-feng watched him carely, but could not make out whether he had understood her, or was simply raving. She went on Uncle Zheng says, you are to marry Miss Lin, if you get better. But not if you carry on behaving like a half-wit. Bao-yus expression suddenly changed to one of utter seriousness, as he said Im not a half-wit. Youre the half-wit. He stood up. I am going to see Cousin Lin, to set her mind at rest. Xi-feng quickly put out a hand to stop him. She knows already. And, as your bride-to-be, she would be much too embarrassed to receive you now. What about when were married? Will she see me then? Xi-feng found this both comic and somewhat disturbing. Aroma was right, she thought to herself. Mention Dai-yu, and while he still talks like an idiot, he at least seems to understand whats going on. I can see we shall be in real trouble, if he sees through our scheme and finds out that his bride is not to be Dai-yu after all.
It is too large for anyone to buy. But I is a shame that a place with such potential for profit should have been so neglected. During the years that you have been away, sir, the staff there have been manufacturing all manner of frightening tales which have had the effect of deterring everyone from entering the place. All your troubles are, in short, the doing of the servants. You should make a thorough investigation, and dismiss any unsatisfactory elements among them. It is the only remedy that makes sense. My dear Cheng, replied Jia Zheng, nodding his head gravel you do not seem to realize I cannot even trust my own nephew, let alone the servants! And if I myself were to try to carry out a investigation such as you suggest, I could never hope to get to the root of the problem. Not that I could engage in such a thing anyway while still in mourning. Even if I did, I have never paid much attention to household details in the past, so I really have no what we are supposed to have and what we dont have. I would no know where to look. You are altogether too charitable and virtuous a man, sir, rejoined Cheng. In any other family of comparable position, even if things had reached this critical state, the masters would count on being able to stave off disaster for another five or ten years by asking their stewards for money. I understand that one of your men has even been appointed to a district magistracy ... No! cut in Jia Zheng firmly. When a man stoops to borrowing from his own servants, it is the beginning of the end. We shall simply have to draw in our belts a little. If we still own the property that is down on our books, well and good. But personally I am inclined to believe that there may be very little reality behind some of those entries. Precisely, sir, replied Cheng. That was my very reason for suggesting an inspection of the accounts. Why, have you heard something? asked Jia Zheng. Word has reached me of some of the iniquities perpetrated by those servants of yours, answered Cheng. But I hardly dare mention them in your presence, sir. Jia Zheng realized from Chengs tone of voice that he was speaking the truth. Alas! he sighed. Since my grandfathers day, we have always had a tradition in my family of being considerate and generous to our servants. We have never treated them harshly or given them cause for complaint. What is the present generation coming to! And if I were suddenly to start acting the strict master now, I hardly think I would be treated seriously. As they were talking, one of the janitors came in and announced that Excellency Zhen of the Nanking family had come to call. What brings him to the capital? asked Jia Zheng. I understand, sir, replied the servant, that he has been reinstated by Imperial favour. Show him in at once, said Jia Zheng. The servant went out to usher in the visitor. This Excellency Zhen was the father of Zhen Bao-yu his full name was Zhen Ying-jia, his courtesy name You-zhong Friend of the Loyal. The Zhens were, it will be remembered, like the Jias, an illustrious old family from Nanking, and the two families had a long-standing family connection and had always seen a good deal of each other. Zhen Ying-jia had lost his post a year or two previously for some misdemeanour, and the family property had subsequently been confiscated. Now His Majesty the Emperor had shown him a special favour as the descendant of a loyal and deserving subject, had restored him to his hereditary position and had summoned him to the capital for an audience. Knowing that Lady Jia had recently passed away, Zhen had prepared an offering and had chosen an auspicious day in the almanac on which to convey the offering to the temple where her remains were lying. Before so doing he called at Rong-guo House to pay his respects. Mourning etiquette prevented Jia Zheng from going out to greet his guest, but he welcomed him at the threshold of his outer study. When Zhen Ying-jia saw him, sorrow and joy mingled in his breast. Both gentlemen refrained from any elaborate display of ceremony, and instead clasped each other simply by the hand and exchanged greetings. They sat down at either side of a table, Jia Zheng offered his guest some tea and they continued to talk for some little while. When were you received by His Majesty? asked Jia Zheng. The day before yesterday, replied Zhen Ying-jia. His Majesty in his great kindness must surely have favoured you with some words of instruction. Yes indeed. His Majesty, whose kindness exceeds the heavens, has favoured me with a decree. May I enquire as to its import?
But as things stand, no one is going to lend us a penny. Even his cheeks were now streaming with tears. Its certainly no use turning to our own relatives for help, he continued. The ones that owe us a favour are penniless, and the ones that dont are unlikely to come forward and help us now. I did not examine the accounts in any detail yesterday, but I did glance at the register of household staf We can barely afford to keep ourselves alive, let alone such a host of servants. These final details in Jia Zhengs tale of financial woe plunged Grandmother Jia in still deeper gloom. Presently Jia She, Cousin Zhen and Jia Rong arrived and paid her their respects. The sight of them somehow brought home to her the true horror of their predicament. She took Jia She by one hand, Cousin Zhen by the other and burst out sobbing. The two men hung their heads in shame and, when she began weeping, fell to their knees and cried We have dishonoured the family! We have forfeited the glory won by our forefathers! We have brought you grief! We are not even worthy to be buried when we die! At this a chorus of wailing filled the room. Come on now, urged Jia Zheng. We must lose no time in thinking of a way to provide them with funds. They can stay with us only a day or two at the most. Grandmother Jia did her best to contain her grief. Go now, both of you, she said, holding back her tears, and speak with your wives. She turned to Jia Zheng There must be no delay, and I can see it would be futile trying to borrow. We have so little time. I shall have to do something mysel Oh dear, this is all so dreadfully confusing! Things mustnt be allowed to go on like this! She called Faithful to her and sent her off with some secret instructions. Jia She and Cousin Zhen meanwhile left the room and conversed tearfully with Jia Zheng outside, expressing their remorse for their past waywardness and anticipating with gloom the bitter exile that lay ahead. Then they went over and lamented with their wives. Jia She was growing old, and the prospect of separation was less harrowing for him and Lady Xing than it was for Cousin Zhen and You-shi. Jia Lian and Jia Rong held their fathers hands and wept at their side. Frontier service was a less severe punishment than military exile, but it would still be a long and painful ordeal. They could only try to steel themselves to it as best they could. Grandmother Jia told Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Faithful and a bevy of maids to look through every one of her trunks and boxes, and to take out all the personal belongings she had stored away over the years of her marriage. Then she summoned Jia She, Jia Zheng, Cousin Zhen and all the other menfolk to attend while she made a distribution. She began by giving Jia She three thousand taels of silver. You are to take two thousand with you, she said, for the journey and for any expenses afterwards, and leave one thousand here for your wife. This three thousand is for you, Zhen. You must take one thousand with you, and leave two thousand for your wife. In this way, although they will be living with us, they will still be independent and able to make separate catering arrangements. I shall provide for Xi-chuns marriage when the time comes. Now Xi-feng I feel sorry for her, she tried so hard for so long, and has ended up with nothing. She too shall have three thousand taels, and she is to keep all of it for her own use and not give a penny to Lian. I know she is much too ill now, and in no fit state to come and receive it herself, so Patience can take it to her. Here are some robes that once belonged to my husband, and some of the gowns and jewellery that I used to wear when I was young - I dont need them any more. The mens clothing can be divided between She, Zhen, Lian and Rong. Their wives can share the ladies things. This five hundred taels of silver is for Lian to pay for transporting Miss Lins coffin to the South next year. When this distribution was complete, she turned to Jia Zheng The debts you mentioned must be honoured at once. Take this gold and use it for that purpose. Their misdeeds have driven me to these drastic measures, but dont think I have forgotten that you too are my son. In due time you will receive your fair share. Bao-yu is married and can have what is left here - gold and silver worth several thousand taels.
Jia Zheng was visibly pleased by what he saw. The only blot on the landscape was Jia Huan. He did not seem to have changed in the slightest, and still failed to arouse in his father any flicker of paternal affection or pride. After a silence lasting several minutes Jia Zheng suddenly seemed to think of something. There seems to be one person missing. Lady Wang knew he must be thinking of Dai-yu, whose death she had refrained from mentionmg in any of her letters and as she did not wish to spoil the pleasure of his homecoming by breaking the news to him now, she replied that illness had prevented Dai-yu from being present. This act of deception cut Bao-yu to the quick, but he did his utmost to appear composed, out of respect for his father. Lady Wang invited all the children and grandchildren to the welcoming feast, and they drank to the Masters return. Xi-feng, although she was strictly the daughter-in-law of Jia She and Lady Xing, was also present by virtue of her role as manageress of the household, helping Bao-chai to pour the wine. Jia Zheng cut the party short, saying that after one more round they should all retire. The servants were also dismissed, with instructions to call on him the next day, after the ancestral sacrifice. Jia Zheng and Lady Wang were at last alone and able to talk together. Lady Wang was still reluctant to broach any serious topic when Jia Zheng referred to her brother Wang Zi4engs death, she did her best not to appear too distressed and when he mentioned Xue Pans fresh calamities, her only comment was that he had brought them upon himself. At an opportune moment however she broke the news of Dai-yus death, which seemed to come as a great shock to Jia Zheng, and to affect him deeply. Tears stole down his cheeks, and he sighed several times. Lady Wang herself could no longer contain her tears. Suncloud and her other maids who were standing close by gave her dress a discreet tug, and she quickly composed herself and steered the conversation towards a more cheerful subject. Soon afterwards they went to bed. Early next morning, a ceremony was performed in the ancestral shrine, in the presence of all the young male members of the family, and afterwards Jia Zheng received Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian in the gallery at the side of the shrine, where he asked them for a report of the household accounts, which Cousin Zhen supplied, albeit in a highly selective form. As I have only just returned home, commented Jia Zheng, I do not intend to subject you to an inquisition now, Zhen. But let me say this while I have been away, I have heard it said that you have been allowing standards to slip. You must exercise the utmost diligence and caution. You are older than the other members of your generation, and should set an example to the younger ones. There must be no offence caused to people outside. And that applies to you too, Lian. This is no routine homecoming homily. I have my reasons for warning you. There are things I have heard. I repeat you must both be more careful in future. Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian were by now bright red in the face, and all they could muster was a feeble, Yes, sir. Jia Zheng did not pursue the matter any further, but went in to his own reception hall, where all the menservants were waiting for him thence he proceeded to the inner apartments, to be welcomed by all the maids and serving-women. But we will not describe these events in any great detail. Our story returns to Bao-yu, and to the occasion on the previous day when he had been secretly so upset to hear Lady Wang speak of Dai-yus illness. Jia Zheng had finally granted him permission to leave the family gathering, and he returned to his apartment. He arrived, having cried most of the way there, to find Bao-chai and Aroma chatting together, and went off at once into an outer room to be on his own and nurse his grief in private. Bao-chai told Aroma to take him some tea, and then decided to go out herself and join him, surmising that he was nervous of an impending confrontation with his father, when his failure to make any progress in his studies would be discovered and no doubt punished. It was therefore her duty to offer him some comfort. Bao-yu turned the misunderstanding to his advantage Its all right. You can go to bed. I just need some time to concentrate and collect my thoughts. Lately my memory has been so poor, and there will be trouble if I make a fool of myself in front of Father. You go to sleep. Aroma can sit up and keep me company for a bit.
Now this affair has come to light, the people involved must all be busy covering up for each other. Theyre trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet. They want to make it seem like a minor case of negligence. Then the worst that can happen to them is that theyll lose their jobs. Theyd never want to admit to bribes being taken. Much too serious. Dont you worry about this one, sir, Ill get hold of the inside story. Wed best not keep the Viceroy waiting any longer ... You dont understand, said Jia Zheng. Its the local magistrate I feel sorry for. For doing us this favour, he has forfeited his job. And that may not even he the end of it for him. It wont do any good worrying about him, sir, said Li. Your attendants have been waiting for a long time. Youd best be going in to see the Viceroy now, sir. To learn what it was the Viceroy wanted of Jia Zheng, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 100 Caltrop disturbs an elaborate seduction and inspires bitter resentment Bao-yu learns of a distressing betrothal and laments an imminent departure Jia Zheng was with the Viceroy for a long time, and outside the yamen speculation mounted as to the reason for the summons. Li Ten, in the absence of any information, assumed that his master was wanted in connection with this latest trouble in the Gazette, and feared the worst. At last the interview was over, and Li hurried forward to meet Jia Zheng and accompany him home. He was too impatient to wait until their return, and as soon as they were alone he asked Jia Zheng What kept you so long, sir? Something of great importance, I suppose? Jia Zheng smiled. Not really. It turns out that the Commandant of the Haimen region, who has offered his sons hand in marriage to my daughter, is himself related to the Viceroy, and has written asking him to take a special interest in my well-being. The Viceroy was most affable, and even went so far as to say to me Now we are related too! Li rejoiced inwardly, seeing in this new turn of events cause to be bolder still in his own schemes. He encouraged Jia Zheng enthusiastically to proceed with the marriage. Communications between Kiangsi and the capital were slow, and it was hard for Jia Zheng to know whether or not he was personally implicated in Xue Pans troubles. At such a great distance it would be difficult for him to influence the course of events in Xue Pans favour. When he returned to his own yamen, he despatched a family servant to the capital to ascertain exactly what had happened, and at the same time to carry a message to Grandmother Jia, informing her of the marriage proposal. If she agreed, he suggested that Tan-chun should be sent straight away to join him, in preparation for the wedding. The servant set off with all speed for the capital. He reported first to Lady Wang, and then went to the Board of Civil Office, where his enquiries revealed that the only person to have suffered in the Xue Pan affair was the acting magistrate of Tai-ping, who had lost his job, and that Jia Zheng was not in any way implicated. The servant sent back a reassuring report to Jia Zheng, himself remaining behind to await further developments. It will be remembered to what lengths Aunt Xue had gone, and with what large sums of money she had bribed the various courts involved, to bring in a verdict of accidental homicide in the earlier stages of Xue Pans case. She had been proposing to raise the money for his fine by selling the family pawnshop business. Now when she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage. Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama! With the fortune that Grandpa left, he should have been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. But instead its been one disaster after another. First came Nanking and that disgraceful business over Caltrop. He was entirely to blame for that poor young mans death, and it was just lucky for him that we still had plenty of pull and money in those days, and were able to get him off. Youd have thought a scrape like that would have been enough to make him mend his ways. Youd have thought he might have taken life a bit more seriously after that and devoted more time to looking after his own mother. But no, as soon as we arrived here, it was the same story all over again.
I dont like your type, replied Bao Yong. I say you cant go, and thats final. Why, this is downright mutiny! the old matron retorted angrily and noisily. When Lady Jia was alive they never stopped us going anywhere. What kind of an upstart are you, to start throwing your weight around in this insolent manner? I dont care what you say, I will go out this way! She seized the door-knocker and struck it several times with all her might. Adamantina was speechless with rage as she listened to this exchange. She was on the point of going home when the old women on the other side of the gate heard the sound of an argument and opened up to investigate. Deducing that Adamantina must have been offended by Bao Yong, and knowing that she was on intimate terms with the ladies of the house, especially Miss Xi-chun, the women feared that at some later date she might report them for not letting her through, and thereby get them into serious trouble. They hurried after her We had no idea you were here, Your Reverence. Our apologies for being so slow in Opening the gate. Miss Xi-chun is at home, and would be so pleased to see you. Please come on in. That stupid caretaker is new here. He doesnt know anything. Well report him later to Her Ladyship and shell have him beaten and get rid of him. At first Adamantina refused to change her mind. But the old women kept on pestering her, begged her not to get them into trouble, were on the point of falling to their knees, until in the end she really had no choice but to turn back and follow them into the mansion. Bao Yong, Seeing how things stood, understandably made no further attempts at obstruction but went back to his room, scowling and fuming to himself. Adamantina went straight to Xi-chuns apartment. She offered her condolences and they chatted for a while. I still have a few more nights to last out before the others come home, said Xi-chun. Xi-feng is sick, and Im all on my own. Its so boring and lonely - and scaring! If only I had someone to keep me company! Now that youve come all this way, wont you stay the night? Please! We could play Go together and chat. At first Adamantina was reluctant. But she felt sorry for Xi-chun, and then at the mention of the game Go her eyes lit up and she agreed to stay, instructing the matron to return to the Hermitage and send one of the novices with her tea things, her clothes and her bedding. Xi-chun was delighted and for her part instructed Landscape to go and fetch some of the supply of the previous years rainwater, which had been stored and put aside for making tea. She made a point of saying that Adamantina would not be needing a cup, as she had her own set. The novice presently arrived with Adamantinas things, Xi-chun made the tea, and the two of them were soon carried away in a spirited conversation that lasted until eight oclock in the evening, when Landscape laid out the Go-board, and they settled down to play. Xi-chun lost the first two games, but then Adamantina gave her a handicap of four and she managed to win the next by half a point. Before they knew, it was two oclock in the morning. Outside, the night was breathlessly still. I must meditate at four, said Adamantina. You go in now and rest. My own girl can wait on me. Xi-chun was reluctant to go, but complied out of respect for Adamantinas religious practice. She was about to go into her bedroom when suddenly she heard a great cry coming from the women on night-watch in Grandmother Jias apartment, which was soon taken up by her own serving-women Help! Help! Someone has broken in! Xi-chun, Landscape and the other maids were scared out of their wits. Next they heard shouting coming from the men on night-duty in the outer apartments. Dear oh dear! exclaimed Adamantina. There must be burglars in the house! She hurriedly closed the door of the room and covered her lamp. Peeping through a hole in the window, she could see several men standing in the courtyard outside. Speechless at first with terror, she turned and crept quietly back into the room, gesturing with her hands and finally saying to the others Heaven save us! What great burly fellows there are out there! As she spoke, there was a clatter on the roof-top above her head and she heard the night-watchmen bursting into the courtyard with cries of Stop thief!
Silly me! Im not really supposed to be here at all, he rebuked himself. If I spend my time daydreaming like this and someone comes, Ill have wasted my chance to look through the rest. He continued his inspection of the albums. He did not allow himself time to linger over the next picture, but went straight to the poem, which ended with the words -1227 When hare meets tiger, your great dream shall end. They brought a sudden burst of illumination What a brilliant prediction! It must refer to the death of my eldest sister. If they are all as clear as this, I should copy them down and study them carefully. That way I can find out everything about my sisters and cousins, how long theyre going to live, whether they will fail or succeed in life, be wealthy or poor. At home I shall have to keep my knowledge a secret of course. But my inside information will at least save me a lot of unnecessary worrying .. He looked everywhere for writing implements, but could see neither brush nor inkstone, and fearing that someone might surprise him, he hurriedly scanned through the rest of the album. The next leaf bore an impressionistic representation of a figure flying a kite. He did not feel in the mood to dwell on the pictures but quickly read the remaining poems in the set of twelve. In some cases he was able to grasp the hidden meaning at a first reading, others required a moments reflection, while some remained obstinately unintelligible. He committed all of them carefully to memory none the less. With a sigh he took out the next album, labelled Supplementary Register No. 1, and began to read. He stopped at the lines You chose the player fortune favoured, Unmindful of your masters doom. At first they meant nothing to him. Then he studied the accompanying picture, a bunch of flowers and a mat painted in the same impressionistic style as the kite-flying girl. Suddenly he burst into tears. See Volume I, Appendix, p. 527. He was about to read further, when he heard a voice saying Daydreaming again! Come now, Cousin Lin wants to see you. The voice was very like Faithfuls, but when he turned to look, to his great bewilderment there was no one there. Then suddenly he saw Faithful again, standing outside the doorway and beckoning to him. He ran out after her in delight, but her shadowy form drifted constantly ahead of him and he was unable to overtake her. Dear Faithful! Please wait for me! he cried. She took no notice but hurried on ahead, while he ran panting after her. Suddenly another vista loomed in front of him, of high buildings and intricately carved roofs, among which he could dimly perceive the figures of palace ladies. In his eagerness to explore this new realm Bao-yu forgot Faithful completely. Wandering in through one of the gateways, he found himself among all sorts of strange and exotic plants and flowers, none of which he could identify. One in particular caught his eye, a herbaceous plant surrounded by a marble balustrade, the tips of its leaves tinged a faint red. What rare plant can that be, he wondered, to be accorded such place of honour? A gentle breeze had arisen and the plant fluttered its leaves with long drawn-out trembling motion. It was small and flowerless, its delicate charm held Bao-yus heart spellbound and enraptured soul. He was still staring at it dumbfounded when a voice beside hir -5947 spoke Where are you from, you great booby? And what do you thini youre doing peeping at our Fairy Plant? Startled from his reverie, Bao-yu turned to see a fairy maide -5947 standing at his side. He bowed and said in reply to her questions I came here to find Faithful. Excuse me if I have clumsily trespassed on your fairy domain. Please can you tell me, Sister Fairy, what this place is, and why Faithful said that Cousin Lin wanted to see me? Please will you explain? Sister this, Cousin that! Such names mean nothing td me! replied the fairy. All I know is that this Fairy Plant is my responsibility, and that it is strictly forbidden for mortals like you to loiter here. You must leave at once. Bao-yu could not bring himself to obey the fairys command. Sister Fairy! he pleaded once more. If you are in charge of a Fairy Plant, then you must be a Flower Fairy yourself. Can you tell me what is so special about this particular plant? Thats a very long story, replied the fairy. Once it grew by the banks of the Magic River and then it was called the Crimson Pearl Flower. It wilted and began to die, but was revived and given immortal life through the intervention of the Divine Luminescent Page-in-waiting, who generously watered it with sweet dew.
There was no reply. Faithful walked a little closer and could see now that it was not one of the maids from Grandmother Jias apartment. She looked more carefully. A chill breeze blew past her, and the ladys form vanished into thin air. Faithful stood there for a moment longer in a daze, then walked back into the outer room and sat down on the edge of the kang, lost in thought. Suddenly she exclaimed Of course! Thats who it was! Mr Rongs first wife, from Ning-guo House. But she died long ago. What was she doing here? I suppose she must have come to fetch me. But why was she going through the motions of hanging herself? After a few moments thought Thats it! She was showing me how! With this realization, the evil had entered the very marrow of her being, and her resolve was formed at last. She rose to her feet as if in a trance and went to her toilet box, opening it and weeping all the while. She took out the lock of hair that she had once cut from her head, and slipped it inside the bosom of her dress. She untied the sash from around her waist and looped one end of it over the beam where Qin Ke-qing had just stood. Then she gave herself up to one last fit of weeping. Hearing the guests leave in the distance, and fearing that someone might come in and surprise her before the deed was done, she quickly pulled the door to and fetched a footstool. Standing on the stool, she tied a slip-knot in the sash, put her head through the knot and kicked the stool away. Alas! The last breath was soon strangled from her throat, and her gentle soul fled its mortal frame. The wandering soul was still uncertain whither to proceed when it saw once more the faint form of Qin Ke-qing standing before it. Mrs Rong! it cried, advancing urgently towards the apparition. Wait for me! I am not Mrs Rong, came the reply. I am Disenchantments younger sister, Ke-qing. But youre most definitely Mrs Rong, protested Faithful. How can you deny it? Listen, replied the other. I will tell you the true story of all this, and then you will surely understand. I once occupied the highest seat in Disenchantments Tribunal of Love. My responsibility was the settlement of Debts of Passion. I went down into the human world, where naturally I was destined to become the worlds foremost lover, my mission being to draw lovesick lads and lovelorn maidens with all speed back to the tribunal and the settlement of their debts. As part of this mission it was my Karma to hang myself. I have now seen through the illusion of mortal attachment, and have risen above the Sea of Passion to return to the Paradise of Love. This leaves a vacancy in the Land of Illusion, in the Department of Fond Infatuation. You have been chosen by Disenchantment to take my place, and I have been sent to guide you there. But I am a most unpassionate person! protested Faithful. How can I be considered a lover? You dont understand, replied the other. Earthlings treat lust and love as one and the same thing. By this means they practise all manner of lechery and immorality, and pass it off as harmless romance. They do not understand the true meaning of the word love. Before the emotions of pleasure, anger, grief and joy stir within the human breast, there exists the natural state of love the stirring of these emotions causes passion. Our kind of love, yours and mine, is the former, natural state. It is like a bud. Once open, it ceases to be true love. Faithfuls soul signalled understanding with a nod, and followed Qin Ke-qing. When the wake was over, Ladies Xing and Wang began giving instructions to those of the servants who were staying behind to look after the house, and Amber went in search of Faithful to ask her whether their carriages had been hired for the next day. She looked in vain in the outer room of Grandmother Jias apartment, and then she noticed that the door to the inner room was on the latch, and putting her eye to the crack peered through into the half-lit interior. A flickering lamp filled the room with eerie shadows. No sound could be heard from inside and she retraced her steps, saying to herself Where can the wretched girl have disappeared to? On her way out she bumped into Pearl. Have you seen Faithful? she asked. No, replied Pearl. Ive been looking myself. Their Ladyships want to speak to her. Most probably shes fallen asleep in the inner room. Ive just had a look - she didnt seem to be there, said Amber.
He also has considerable literary talent. Grandmother Jia was very pleased with this description. It sounds most suitable I must say. Xiang-yun is a lucky girl. Her family and ours have always abided by the old Southern marriage customs, and that is why none of us have set eyes on the groom to this day. Only recently I was thinking about my own family, and particularly about Xiang-yun. She has always been my favourite. She used to spend over half the year with me when she was a little girl. I had meant to find a nice husband for her myself when she grew up, but with her uncle away from home I could hardly be the one to take the initiative. Well, fortune has smiled on her, and she has found a good match, so now I can set my mind at rest. I know that theyll be married within the month, and I would have so liked to drink a cup of wine at the reception - but even thats out of the question Im afraid. This latest upheaval has quite taken my strength away. Please give them my regards when you return, and say that we all send our very best wishes. And tell Miss Shi she is not to worry on my account. Im over eighty now, and if I die I shall have no cause to complain. I have had more than my share of blessings. My only prayer is that she and her husband may live happily together to a ripe old age. Then I shall rest content. As she spoke, Grandmother Jia could not help weeping. One of the Shi serving-women replied Please do not distress yourself Lady Jia. Once Miss Shi is married and has celebrated her Ninth Day, Im sure she and her husband will come here to pay you their respects. Then you will be able to see them yourself and that will make you happy. Grandmother Jia nodded. The women left. Bao-yu seemed to be the only person at all affected by the news of Xiang-yuns impending marriage. He looked somewhat bemused, and thought to himself Why is it that girls have to get married as soon as they grow up? Once theyre married, theyre bound to change. Even dear Yun has to obey her uncles will. Now if we meet again, it will never be the same. She is bound to be distant towards me. What is the point of living, if I am to be forever shunned like this? He felt himself becoming tearful again. But for Grandmother Jias sake he endeavoured not to weep and instead sat there brooding silently to himself. Jia Zheng was still concerned for Grandmother Jias health, and presently he came in to see how she was. Finding her somewhat improved he went out again and summoned the steward Lai Da, ordering him to bring the complete register of household servants employed in responsible positions. He went over this register with him entry by entry. Apart from Jia Shes servants, who had been taken away, there were more than thirty families on the register, with a total of two hundred and twelve male and female servants. Jia Zheng sent for the forty-one male servants at present employed in the mansion and interrogated them all about the accounts for the past years - checking with them the totals for income and expenditure in their various departments. The chief steward presented the ledgers for inspection, and Jia Zheng could see at a glance that none of the figures balanced. Expenditure outweighed income by far, and additional expenses had been incurred over several years in connection with Her Grace the Imperial Concubine. There were several entries revealing irregular loans raised outside. When he looked at the rents from the family estates in the Eastern provinces, he could see that in recent years income had shrunk to less than half what it had been in his grandfathers time, while the familys expenses were ten times as great. This palpable evidence of mismanagement came as a great shock to him, and he stamped his foot angrily This is monstrous! I thought Lian was competent to handle these things! And now I find that we have been mortgaging ourselves up to the hilt in order to keep up an empty show! Weve been living far beyond our means. This recklessness was bound to lead to ruin. And it is too late now for me to start introducing economies! He paced up and down with his hands behind his back, unable to devise a remedy for the familys deep-seated economic infirmity. His servants knew that their master had no head for business, and that he would only agitate himself to no avail on this score. Its no use worrying, sir, they advised him. Every household is the same. Even princes of the realm! If you could but see their accounts, youd find that they fail to balance their books too. They just keep up appearances and muddle along from day to day as best they can.
And it was a bitterly cold day! She broke down in front of them and begged them not to reveal her miserable plight to us at home. Its my fate to suffer like this, she said. And were not to send her any more clothes or food or anything. They never reach her, and her husband will only accuse her of complaining again and give her another beating. So you see, Mother, Ying may be close at hand, but the very closeness only makes her suffering harder for us to bear. Her mother turns a blind eye, and her father has refused to intervene at all. She is worse off than one of our lowest-grade maids! Although Tan is not my own daughter, Im sure Zheng wants to do the best for her. He has obviously seen the boy and must approve of him or he wouldnt be in favour of the match. So I hope youll agree, and then we can choose a lucky day for her to make the journey and send a proper escort to accompany her to Zhengs official residence. I am sure Zheng will see to it at his end that everything is done in a fitting manner. Very well then, Grandmother Jia concurred. Ill go along with Zhengs idea, and I leave it to you to make the necessary arrangements. Choose a suitable day in the almanac for travelling. There, the matter is settled now. Yes, Mother. Bao-chai heard all this clearly, and although she did not breathe a word of protest, she thought to herself sadly Tan is one of the very best of us. And now she is being married as well and sent away. One by one our numbers are dwindling. Seeing that Lady Wang had risen and was taking her leave, Baochai accompanied her out of the room and then returned immediately to her own apartment. She said nothing to Bao-yu of Tan-chuns engagement, but told Aroma later, when she found her sewing on her own. Aroma too was very unhappy at the news. Aunt Zhao, on the other hand, was positively delighted. The girls shown me nothing but disrespect, she thought to herself. No one would ever have guessed that I was her mother! I receive worse treatment at her hands than one of her maids! Shes always trying to better herself, and sides with anyone rather than her own mother or brother. With her in the way, Huan would never have been able to get anywhere. If her father has sent for her, then good riddance! Ive given up hoping for any respect from her. I hope shes as miserable as Ying is. Id be glad to see it happen. She hurried over to Tan-chuns apartment to offer her congratulations. You certainly are on your way up in the world, my dear! she crowed. Im sure life at your new home will be even more to your liking than it is here. You must be pleased. Now remember, I am your mother, for all the good its ever done me. So dont think of me as all bad. And dont forget about me altogether when youre gone. Tan-chun refused to respond to this display of Spite and kept her head bent silently over her needlework. Aunt Zhao was effectively snubbed and left the room in a state of high dudgeon. Tan-chun could see the ridiculous side of her mothers behaviour, but none the less it left her feeling both angry and wounded, and she sat for some time weeping quietly to herself. Eventually she walked out in a weary and dejected frame of mind, thinking she would like to drop in on Bao-yu. Tell me, Tan, he said, the moment she entered his apartment, I know that you were with Cousin Lin when she died, and that you heard music in the distance. Do you think there was some unexplained mystery behind it? Do you think Cousin Lin was really a fairy, and that at her death she was merely returning to her heavenly abode? Tan-chun smiled. That sounds like another of your fancies. It was a Strange night, though, thats certainly true and the music was unlike any that Ive ever heard before. Who knows, you may even be right. Bao-yu took this as confirmation of his hypothesis. He also recalled the words of the man he had encountered in his strange dream of a few months before, who had said that Dai-yu was no ordinary mortal and no ordinary shade, but a visitor from some immortal realm. This mingled in his mind with another vivid memory, that of the Moon Goddess in the play he had seen the previous year. The Goddess and Dai-yu possessed the same ethereal beauty, the same otherworldly charm ... After a while, when Tanchun had gone, he felt a sudden and overwhelming urge to have Nightingale close at hand, and asked Grandmother Jia to send her over to his apartment.
As the last dice continued to rattle in the dice-bowl, Faithful cried out Pray I dont get another five! Finally it came to rest there it was, five pips as plain as could be. Oh dear! exclaimed Faithful. Ive lost. Doesnt that have a name? asked Grandmother Jia. It does, said Faithful. But Ill never be able to think of a song to match it. Well, you tell us the name, and Ill try to think of something. This ones called Waves Sweep the Floating Duckweed. Theres nothing particularly hard about that, said Grandmother Jia. Heres a song for you Autumn Fish in a Den of Caltrops. Xiang-yun, who was sitting next to Faithful, proposed the line The white duckweed moans, as autumn descends on the southern river. Very apt! they all exdaimed. The games finished, announced Grandmother Jia. Lets all have two more cups of wine and then eat our dirmer. She looked round and noticed that Bao-yu was still absent. -294 Wheres Bayu gone? Why isnt he back yet? He went to change, Faithful informed her. Who went with him? Oriole came forward When I saw that Mr Bao was going out, I told Aroma to go with him. This set the ladies minds at rest. They waited a little longer for him to return, and then, since there was still no sign of him, Lady Wang sent one of the junior maids out to look for him. The maid went to his new apartment, but the only person there was Fivey, setting out candles. Wheres Mr Bao gone? the maid asked her. Hes over at Her Old Ladyships for the party, replied Fivey. No hes not. Ive just come from there. Her Ladyship sent me to fetch him. Shed hardly do that if he was there in the first place. Well, in that case, I dont know where he is. Youd better look somewhere else. The maid was obliged to return and on her way met Ripple. Did you see where Mr Bao went? Im looking for him too, said Ripple. Her Ladyship and the others are waiting for him so that they can start dinner. Where can he have got to? Youd better hurry back and report to Her Old Ladyship. Dont say we cant find him, just say the wine didnt agree with him and he wont be having any dinner. Say hell be over when hes had a little lie-down. Ask Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships to start without him. The junior maid carried Ripples message to Pearl, who passed it on to Grandmother Jia. He doesnt usually eat much anyway, commented the old lady. He may as well miss out on dinner then, and have a rest. Tell him he neednt come back at all today. His wife is here, and that will do. Is that clear? said Pearl to the junior maid. Yes, Miss Pearl, said the maid, not daring to explain what had really happened. She went out and walked around for a bit, then returned, claiming to have conveyed the message to Bao-yu. No one took a great deal of notice. They ate their dinner and then sat chatting. Our narrative leaves them and returns to Bao-yu. Overwhelmed by a sudden sense of grief, he had quit the party and was wandering aimlessly outside. Aroma hurried after him and asked what the matter was. Nothing really, he replied. I just feel very miserable all of a sudden. Why dont we go for a little stroll over to the apartment where Cousin Zhens wife is living, and leave them to their drinking? But Mrs Zhen is at the party, said Aroma. Who do you want to visit in her apartment? No one, replied Bao-yu. I just thought I might drop in on her for a second. Id forgotten she was at the party. Id still like to go and see what sort of an apartment it is that she is living in. Aroma went along with him, and the two of them talked as they went. They soon came to You-shis apartment, and noticed that the small side gate next to it leading into the Garden was half-ajar. Bao-yu did not go into You-shis apartment at all instead he went up to the two old serving-women in charge of the side gate, who were sitting there on the threshold having a conversation, and asked them Is this side gate kept open? Not usually, replied one of them. But today we were told that Her Old Ladyship might be wanting some fruit from the Garden, so its to be kept open in case. Bao-yu walked slowly up to the gate and, having confirmed for himself that it was open, made as if to go in but Aroma held him back anxiously.
Your wall cant be solid enough. Have a look at it for yourself, they insisted. The Village God went and did so. It certainly seemed a solid enough wall. All most puzzling. Then he felt it with his hand. Aaah! he exclaimed. No wonder! I meant a properly built wall. Any old thief could push down this false wall jia qiang. They all laughed, even Jia Qiang, whose name had provided the raw material for the joke. Come on, Dumbo! he protested. Be fair! I never called you names! Drink a forfeit, theres a boy! Dumbo, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, willingly complied. They all had a few more cups, and in the general state of intoxication Dumbo let fly a few barbed remarks about his sister Lady Xing, while Wang Ren had a go at desecrating the memory of his Xi-feng, both of them evincing great bitterness. Their example and the wine lent Jia Huan a little courage, and he too had his fling, complaining how heartless Xi-feng had been, and how she had tried to ruin so many of their lives. Yes, people ought to show a bit of common decency, they all agreed. The way she used Lady Jias influence to bully everyone was dreadful. Well, she died without giving birth to an heir she only ever had a daughter. Retribution in her own lifetime! Jia Yun, who remembered only too well how harsh Xi-feng had once been towards him, and how Qiao-jie had started bawling the instant she set eyes on him, allowed himself to wade into the general melee with some abuse of his own about the two of them. Jia Qiang tried to steer the party in a less vindictive direction Come on! Drink up! This gossip will get us nowhere! How old is the young lady you mentioned? enquired the two Singsong girls. Is she pretty? Oh yes, replied Jia Qiang. Extremely so. Shes about thirteen. What a pity, in that case, that she was born into a family like yours! the girls exclaimed. If 9nly she came from a more humble home, she could soon find herself in a position to bring all her family lots of jobs, and pots of money into the bargain! What do you mean? We know of a certain Mongol prince, replied the girls. Quite a ladies man he is. He is looking for a concubine, and the lady who fits the bill would be able to take her whole family along with her to live in the palace. What a marvellous stroke of luck that would be for somebody! None of them seemed to take much notice of this, except for Wang Ren, who looked very thoughtful. For the present he said nothing and continued drinking. A little later two young lads came in, younger sons of Stewards Lai and Lin. You seem to be having a fine time of it, sirs, by the looks of things! they exclaimed. Everyone rose to greet them. Why have the two of you been such a long time? Weve been expecting you for ages. They explained Early this morning we heard rather a disturbing rumour that out family was in some sort of official trouble again, so we hurried out to see what news we could glean at the Palace. It turned out to have nothing to do with our family after all. In that case, why didnt you come straight here afterwards? It wasnt exactly our family, but it was connected with us. It was that Mr Jia Yu-cun. When we were at the Palace we saw him bound in chains. They told us he was being taken to the High Court for questioning. We knew he was a frequent visitor here, and were afraid that the case might somehow involve us, so we followed them to see what happened. Good thinking, my man! exclaimed Jia Yun. We are most obliged to you. Sit down and have a drink, and then tell us all about it. The two sat down after a polite show of reluctance, and as they drank continued This Mr Yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow, and knows how to pull strings. Hed done extremely well until recently, in fact but greed was his downfall. There were several charges brought against him, avarice and extortion being two of them. As we all know, our present August Sovereign is exceptionally wise, compassionate and benevolent. There is one thing that stirs his wrath, however, and that is corruption, any form of tyrannical or bullying behaviour. So His Majesty decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial. If he is found guilty, things will look pretty grim for him if he is acquitted, then the men who brought the charges will be in for trouble.
Here I am, Grandma. My child, said Grandmother Jia, your trouble is that youre too clever! Try to be more charitable in future and to make your peace with fate, I know Im not much of a one to talk the most Ive done in my life is try to be honest and to bear my misfortunes with patience. Ive never been the sort for fasting or prayer. The only good work I ever did was to have those copies of the Diamond Sutra made a year or so ago. I wonder if theyve all been distributed yet? Xi-feng informed her that the copies had not yet been distributed. The sooner that act of devotion is completed the better, said the old lady. I know my elder son She and Cousin Zhen are detained in exile, and cannot be here but how could that little devil Xiang-yun be so heartless? Why has she not come to see me? Faithful and her fellow maids knew the reason only too well, but said nothing. Grandmother Jia looked next at Bao-chai. As she did so, she sighed and a flush began to spread across her face. Jia Zheng knew this to be a sign of imminent death. He came forward with the ginseng broth, but Grandmother Jias teeth were already tightly clenched. She closed her eyes, then opened them once more and gazed round the entire room. Lady Wang and Bao-chai came forward and supported her gently, while Lady Xing and Xi-feng dressed her. The old serving-woman prepared the bed where she was to be laid out, and arranged the coverlet. There was a faint rattle in her throat, a smile stole across her face, and she was gone. She was eighty-two years old. The serving-women hurried forward to lay her on the bed. Jia Zheng and the other menfolk knelt in the outer room, Lady Xing and the womenfolk knelt by the bed from both rose the first chorus of lamentation. The servants outside had all made their preparations, and as soon as word came from the inner quarters, every gateway was thrown open, from the main entrance to the inner gate leading to the ladies apartments, and white paper was pasted on every door. The funeral awning was raised over the courtyard, and a memorial archway erected outside the main entrance. Every member of the household immediately put on their mourning clothes. Jia Zheng reported his bereavement and the commencement of his three-year period of mourning to the Board of Rites, who submitted a memorial requesting the Emperors instructions in the matter. His Majesty, being a person of the profoundest compassion and kindliness, in consideration of the services rendered and distinctions obtained by previous generations of the family, and especially in view of the relationship of the deceased to the Imperial Jia Concubine, authorized a bounty of one thousand taels of silver and instructed officers from the Board of Rites to make offerings and do reverence before her coffin. Jia household servants were despatched to notify all relatives and family friends of Lady Jias death, and they all came to condole for while they knew that the Jias had come down in the world, they also saw that the family continued to enjoy the Emperors favour. An auspicious day was chosen for the encoffinment and subsequent lying-in-state. Since Jia She was away from home, Jia Zheng was acting head of the family. Two of Grandmother Jias grandsons, Bao-yu and Jia Huan, and her great-grandson Jia Lan, all of whom were too young to take part in the reception, mourned by the coffin. Her other grandson, Jia Lian, was busy organizing the servants, with the help of Jia Rong and various male and female relatives. Ladies Xing and Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-chai were supposed to be chief mourners and therefore in constant attendance on the coffin. Strictly speaking, one of the other ladies had to be chosen to orchestrate the reception. There were three immediate possibilities there was You-shi, who ever since Cousin Zhens departure and her installation in Rong-guo House as a dependant bad kept very much in the background, and was anyway unfamiliar with the workings of this side of the family there was Jia Rongs new wife, who was even less confident of her abilities in this respect and there was Xi-chun, who was still too young, and though she had grown up with the Rong-guo branch had remained totally ignorant of family practicalities. None of these was really a plausible candidate. The Only person for the job was Xi-feng. With Jia Lian in charge of the outside, it would make good sense for her to run the inside and look after the lady guests.
They persuaded her to swallow one of her combined dispersant and sedative boluses, which brought some slight relief. But she remained tearful and distraught. Jia Zheng stood by her side and tried to comfort her and rally her spirits It is Brother She and I who have brought this misfortune on the family and caused you all this distress, Mother. Please try to take heart a little. We will do our utmost to set things to rights. If you should suffer in any way, our burden of guilt will be unbearable! I am over eighty now, replied the old lady, and ever since the day I came here as a girl and was married to your father, I have led a sheltered life. I have been blessed and protected by the family ancestors. Ive never even heard of such terrible goings-on as these. I am too old for it all. I couldnt bear to see you punished. Id rather die, and be spared the ordeal. She burst into tears once again, and Jia Zheng grew more and more agitated about her condition. Suddenly a voice was heard outside calling News from court for the Master! Jia Zheng hurried out. The Prince of Bei-jings aide-de-camp was waiting for him in the main reception hall, and greeted him with the words Excellent news, sir! Jia Zheng thanked the aide for coming and begged him to be seated. What are my instructions from His Highness? he asked. My master and His Highness the Prince of Xi-ping presented a joint report to His Majesty, and spoke at some length on your behalf, sir, stressing your penitence and your great appreciation of the clemency shown to you by the throne. His Majesty was most sympathetic, and mindful of the recent demise of Her Grace, he has resolved not to punish you, but instead to restore you to your former post as Under-Secretary at the Board of Works. Of the family property held under restraint, only that portion belonging to Sir She is to be confiscated. The rest will all be returned to you. His Majesty urges you to resume your official duties with diligence. The matter of the promissory notes will be investigated personally by my master. Any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be confiscated outright according to the relevant statute notes negotiated at permissible rates, together with title-deeds of houses and land, will all be returned. Jia Lian is to be deprived of his position and rank, but otherwise will be exempted from further punishment and released. Jia Zheng rose from his seat and kowtowed in the appropriate direction for this act of Imperial clemency. He also bowed to the aide to express his profound gratitude for the princes intervention on his behalf. Be so good as to convey my thanks to His Highness. Tomorrow I shall attend court in order to express my gratitude to His Majesty in person, and shall also present myself at His Highnesss palace to make my kowtow. The princes aide took his leave. Shortly afterwards a court official arrived to proclaim the Edict, followed by the officers entrusted with its execution, who supervised the proceedings scrupulously, confiscating only what had been specified, and restoring everything else to its owner. Jia Lian was released, while Jia Shes domestic staff, men and women alike, were all taken away into public service. Jia Lians position was not to be envied. Some of the promissory notes and documents were returned, and none of his other property had been officially confiscated, but his apartment had been ransacked and nothing but the bare furniture had been left in place. His initial relief at being set free and escaping the punishment he feared soon gave way to a profound sense of loss, when he beheld his own and Xi-fengs possessions of a lifetime - altogether about sixty thousand taels worth - gone in a mornings work. His fathers imprisonment, Xi-fengs critical state of health the strain was almost more than he could bear. And now he had to face Jia Zheng, who summoned him and berated him, barely suppressing a sob I have, alas, been too busy of late with my official duties, and have paid insufficient attention to family matters. I thought I could rely on you and your wife I can hardly remonstrate with your father for his misconduct but this usury that has come to light - who in heavens name is responsible for that? Families like ours simply do not dabble in such things. The documents have been confiscated, and both principal and interest are forfeit but its not the money, its the appalling blow this will deal to our reputation! Jia Lian fell to his knees In managing our familys affairs, Uncle, I have never acted with a view to private gain. All the accounts have been kept by the stewards- Lai Da, Wu Xin-deng, Dai Liang and the others.
He was afraid wed try to put a stop to it so he never told us. The funeral donations brought him in several thousand taels, I can tell you. Uncle Zi-sheng was furious with him afterwards for cornering the market. This put your brother in a bit of a spot. So for his next little project he picked Uncle Zi-shengs birthday, the perfect opportunity to make some more money for himself, and placate old Zi-sheng into the bargain. He wasnt going to be held back by what the family or friends might say, or by the paltry fact that Uncle Zi-sheng.doesnt really have a birthday until next winter. Let people think what they like, he doesnt care! He doesnt know the meaning of the word pride! Now, on top of all this, let me tell you why I got up so early this morning. Recently theres been a memorial from the Censorate. Its in some way connected with the recent disturbances on the coast. The wording refers to the deficit left by Wang Zi-teng after his term of office and asks that this deficit be made good by his younger brother Wang Zi-sheng and by his nephew Wang Ren. The two of them got the wind up and asked me to try to pull a few strings for them. I agreed to do it for them. They seemed so pathetic and scared, and anyway I was afraid it might eventually affect you and Aunt Wang. I hoped old Qiu in the Inner Palace might see to it for me, perhaps get Uncle Zi-tengs successor to cook the books somehow. But I was late, damn it, hed already left for court. So there I was, up at dawn, tearing around for nothing, while they put on plays and hold a party! If that isnt enough to make a mans blood boil, tell me what is! Xi-feng still felt she must put some sort of a case for her brother, partly out of her constitutional need never to admit defeat, and partly out of loyalty to her own family However badly he may have behaved, hes still your brother4n-law. If you help him, youll be doing a good turn for both of my uncles, for the living and the dead. Our family honour is at stake so I implore you to help. Otherwise you know what will happen I shall be held responsible for your wrath, and theyll blacken my name for ever. Xi-feng burst into tears. Sitting up in bed, she began to comb her hair, and to throw on some clothes. Theres no need for you to react like that, said Jia Lian. Its your brother whos behaved so abominably Ive said nothing against you. And the servants-- when I had to go out this morning, I knew you were not well, so I didnt disturb you. But they just went on sleeping. Our parents never tolerated such behaviour. Youve grown too slack. You want to please everybody, thats your trouble. And the moment I say anything critical, you start hauling yourself out of bed in protest. If I give the servants a piece of my mind, I suppose youll stick up for them next. Its too absurd! Xi-feng dried her eyes. Its late, she said. I ought to be getting up anyway. After a pause, she continued Even if thats how you feel, please try to do what you can for my family, for my sake. And you know how grateful Aunt Wang will be. All right, all right, grumbled Jia Lian. Stop teaching your grandmother to suck eggs. Why are you getting up, maam? put in Patience. Its too early yet. And I dont see what you have to work yourself into such a terrible temper for, sir! Why take it all out on us? Hasnt Mrs Lian gone to enough trouble for you in the past? The number of times shes borne the brunt on your behalf! Perhaps I shouldnt say this, but in view of all that shes done for you, it doesnt seem very fair to make such a big fuss about this one favour, especially when you think how many other people are involved. Do you have no consideration for her feelings? Why should she take all the blame anyway? We were late getting up, and youre entitled to be angry with us -were only servants after all. But when you think how she has worked herself into the ground and ruined her health, it seems so unkind of you to pick a quarrel with her now! Patiences eyes filled with tears. Jia Lians original ill humour, strong though it had undoubtedly been, could not withstand the combined opposition of both his womenfolk - at once so appealing and so sharp-tongued. All right, forget it, he said, with a bitter smile. Shes hard enough to cope with on her own, without you leaping to her defence.
I never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life! Fat lot youd know, stuck at home all day! retorted Dime. Coupla years back, I was having a throw in one of the dens, met this young feller, name of Zhang, and he told me how his woman was taken off of him by the Jias. Asked me for some advice. I just told him to forget it. Dunno where he is now, havent seen him these two or three years. Next time I bump into that Zhang feller, Ill know what to tell him. Roast that little Yun alive! Make him crawl on his knees! Got my lead now... Dime promptly collapsed onto his bed in a stupor, mumbling incoherently to himself and was soon soundly asleep. His wife and daughter dismissed his threats as the ravings of a drunkard, and early the next morning Dime set off once more for his gambling haunts, where we must leave him. We return to Jia Yu-cun the morning after his return home, refreshed by a good nights sleep, he told his wife who, it will be remembered, had once been in service with the Zhen family in Soochow of his encounter with Zhen Shi-yin. She reproached him for his heartlessness Why did you not go back to look for him? If he has been burnt to death, we will be guilty forever of having done him a great wrong! She began to weep, and Jia Yu-cun tried to justify himself How could I have intervened? A being like that lives on a different plane from people like us. He would only have resented the interference. At that moment a message was brought in for Yu-cun The runner sent by Your Honour yesterday to investigate the fire at the temple has come to deliver his report. Yu-cun strolled out to receive the runner, who dropped one knee to the ground and said I went back as you told me to, sir. I braved the flames and went into the temple to see if I could find the Taoist. His hut was completely razed to the ground, even the wall behind it had collapsed, and there was no trace of the old man. He must have been roasted alive...... All that was left was his prayer-mat, and drinking-gourd somehow they both seemed to have survived intact. I looked all over the place for any human remains, but there was not so much as a bone to be seen. I was going to bring you the prayer-mat and gourd, to show you, in case you didnt believe me, sir but when I picked them up they lust turned to ashes in my hands. Yu-cun deduced from this account that Zhen Shi-yins departure from the scene of the fire had been no ordinary death, but rather some miraculous process of etherealization. He dismissed the runner, and went in again to his private apartment, where he made no mention to his wife of Shi-yins metamorphosis by fire, thinking she would fail to understand and would only be distressed instead he simply told her that no trace of the old man had been found, and that he had most probably escaped alive. Leaving his private apartment, Yu-cun went to his study, and was sitting there pondering the few words Zhen Shi-yin had spoken during their brief encounter, when one of his attendants came in to convey an Imperial summons to the Palace, to peruse certain state papers. Yu-cun hurriedly took a sedan-chair to the Palace. As he arrived he overheard someone say The Kiangsi Grain Intendant, Jia Zheng, has been impeached, and is at court to plead for clemency! Yu-cun pressed on into the Cabinet Office and greeted the various Ministers of State gathered there. He first performed his duty and glanced through the state papers which spelled out His Majestys displeasure with the state of the coastal defences, and then left the Cabinet Office at once to find Jia Zheng and to commiserate with him on his impeachment, expressing his relief that it was not too serious a charge, and asking if his journey to the capital had been a comfortable one. Jia Zheng replied with a detailed account of his misfortunes. Has your plea for clemency been presented to the throne yet? asked Yu-cun. It has, replied Jia Zheng. I am expecting to receive the Rescript when His Majesty returns from lunch. Even as they were speaking, Jia Zheng was summoned to the Imperial presence, and hurried in. Those senior ministers who were connected with him waited anxiously in one of the antechambers and when, after a lengthy audience, he finally emerged again, his face beaded with sweat, they all pressed forward to greet him.
Bao-yu is married and can have what is left here - gold and silver worth several thousand taels. And Li Wan she has always been such a dutiful granddaughter4n4aw to me, and little Lan is such a sweet child. Heres some for them too. There, Ive finished. Jia Zheng was moved to tears to see how clearly she had worked everything out. We have failed you, Mother! he sobbed, falling to his knees. We have not done our filial duty towards you in your old age and yet you shower us with such bounty! How can we ever outlive our shame! Oh poppycock! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Dont you worry, if it werent for this crisis I should certainly have kept it all for myself! But lets be serious our staff is much too large. You are the only one left with an official post, Zheng, so we dont need more than a few servants. Tell the stewards to call the staff together and make the necessary arrangements. Each establishment must make do with as few servants as possible. We would have had to manage with none at all if our household had been confiscated. The same goes for the ladies apartments. We must find husbands for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking. Its in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be Sent to take it back to them straight away. If anything else should happen to us, wed only involve them in a lot more trouble, push them out of the frying-pan and into the fire. Jia Zheng, who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters, mumbled a contrite Yes, Mother to all of these eminently practical instructions, thinking to himself What a flair she has for organization! And what worthless bunglers we all are by comparison! He could see that Grandmother Jia was tired, and begged her to lie down and rest. The little you see here is all I have left, she said. When I die, you can use some of it to pay for my funeral, and give the remainder to my maids. They found this mention of her death greatly upsetting, and all fell to their knees once more. Please set your mind at ease, Mother. In time to come, if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain His Majestys favour, then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors, to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year. If you can only somehow make amends, said Grandmother Jia, then perhaps I shall be able to face our ancestors with pride when I die. Dont think that I know only how to enjoy a comfortable life, and that I have no stomach for poverty! Thats not it at all. Its just that I am rather shocked by all this. During the past few years you have seemed so prosperous, and I was only too glad not to interfere to jolly along and mind my own business. I never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state. Ive always known that we were living beyond our means, of course, but I thought somehow wed manage to muddle through. I suppose we were dulled by habit we couldnt adjust, we were too used to things as they were. Well now we must use this opportunity to economize and set things to rights, or else our family will be the laughing-stock of the world. You may think its the poverty that appals me. But its not. What I have always cared about more than anything is our family tradition, our family honour. Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know. How is Mrs Lian? Grandmother Jia asked her before shed finished speaking. Not at all well today, replied Lady Wang on Felicitys behalf. Ail exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet.
he questioned him. Yes, sir, I did, replied the page. I saw you following them, so I came too. Then they disappeared and I could see no one but you. J ia Zheng wanted to continue, but all he could see before him was a vast expanse of white, with not a soul anywhere. He knew there was more to this strange occurrence than he could understand, and reluctantly he turned back and began to retrace his steps. The other servants had returned to their masters boat to find the cabin empty and were told by the boatman that Jia Zheng had gone on shore in pursuit of two monks and a Taoist. They followed his footsteps through the snow and when they saw him coming towards them in the distance hurried forward to meet him, and then all returned to the boat together. Jia Zheng sat down to regain his breath and told them what had happened. They sought his authority to mount a search for Bao-yu in the area, but Jia Zheng dismissed the idea. You do not understand, he said with a sigh. This was indeed no supernatural apparition I saw these men with my own eyes. I heard them singing, and the words of their song held a most profound and mysterious meaning. Bao-yu came into the world with his jade, and there was always something strange about it. I knew it for an ill omen. But because his grandmother doted on him so, we nurtured him and brought him up until now. That monk and that Taoist I have seen before, three times altogether. The first time was when they came to extol the virtues of the jade the second was when Bao-yu was seriously ill and the monk came and said a prayer over the jade, which seemed to cure Bao-yu at once the third time was when he restored the jade to us after it had been lost. He was sitting in the hall one minute, and the next he had vanished completely. I thought it strange at the time and could only conclude that perhaps Bao-yu was In some way blessed and that these two holy men had come to protect him. But the truth of the matter must be that he himself is a being from a higher realm who has descended into the world to experience the trials of this human life. For these past nineteen years he has been doted on in vain by his poor grandmother! Now at last I understand! As he said these words, tears came to his eyes. But surely, protested one of the servants, if Mr Bao was really a Buddhist Immortal, what need was there for him to bother with passing his exams before disappearing? How can you ever hope to understand these things? replied Jia Zheng with a sigh. The constellations in the heavens, the hermits in their hills, the spirits in their caves, each has a particular configuration, a unique temperament. When did you ever see Bao-yu willingly work at his books? And yet if once he applied himself, nothing was beyond his reach. His temperament was certainly unique. In an effort to restore his spirits, the servants turned the conversation to Jia Lans success in the exams and the revival of the family fortunes. Then Jia Zheng completed and sealed his letter, in which he related his encounter with Bao-yu and instructed the family not to brood over their loss too much, and despatched one of the servants to deliver it to Rong-guo House while he himself continued his journey by boat. But of this no more. When Aunt Xue heard of the general amnesty pronounced by the Emperor she sent Xue Ke to borrow money from wherever he could, to add to what she herself had collected for Xue Pans commutation fine. The Board of Justice finally gave its approval and agreed to receive the money in settlement, whereupon an official document was issued authorizing Xue Pans release. When he was reunited with his family, there was a great deal of news for him to catch p on, some of it sad, some more cheerful. But this we can safely leave to the readers imagination. Xue Pan for his part uttered a solemn vow If I ever behave like that again, may I be hacked to death piece by piece! Aunt Xue held her hand over his mouth Just make your mind up to mend your ways! Theres no need for all these blood-curdling oaths! But what are you going to do about Caltrop? Jin-gui died by her own hand, and though we may be poor, you can still afford to fill her place. After all Caltrop has been through on your account, I think you owe it to her to make her your proper wife. What do you think? Xue Pan nodded his head in consent, while Bao-chai gave Aunt Xues Suggestion her full support. Caltrop herself seemed overwhelmed and flushed a deep crimson Its the same to me if I continue to serve Mr Pan, she said.
Apart from all the money youve spent, youve never stopped asking for help and thinking of ways to get him out. You cant go on struggling with fate. Hell have to pay the price for his own misdeeds. Most parents look to their children for support in their old age, and even in poor families a man will do his best to earn his mother a bowl of rice. But what has Pan done? Squandered a ready-made fortune, and made your life a misery. I know I shouldnt say this, but the truth is, hes the bane of your life, an affliction sent to test you, not a real son to you. You refuse to accept the truth, and wear yourself out like this, weeping at all hours of the day and night. Youve got quite enough to cope with already, what with Jin-gui and her tantrums. It worries me so, seeing you in this state. I only wish I could be here with you all the time, and help keep the peace. But I cant. Bao-yu would never let me come back, however halfwitted he may be. The other day Sir Zheng sent a message home to say how shocked he was to read the report in the Gazette. He has already sent one of his men to try to intervene on Pans behalf. So you see - there are so many people trying to help Pan Out of this mess hes made. And thank goodness Im at least close by. I think if I were living a long way off and heard that this had happened, Id simply die worrying about you. Please, Mama, give yourself a moments respite. Be thankful that Pan is still alive. Use this opportunity to take stock. Ask one of the older men in the firm to find Out what we owe and what we are owed, and see exactly how much we have left. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue tearfully, the past few days I have been so preoccupied with your brother I simply havent had time to tell you of our own troubles. Whenever youve come to see me its either been you trying to cheer me up or me giving you the latest news from the yamen. I havent told you the worst. We have been struck off the register of court purveyors. Two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale, while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and were involved in another court case over that. Your cousin Ke has been out every day trying to collect some of the money owing to us. Our liabilities here will probably amount to several tens of thousands of taels, and we shall have to sell our share of the Nanking joint-stock business and some property as well, in order to meet our obligations. Two days ago I even heard a rumour that the pawnbroking side of the Nanking business has g6ne bankrupt and been closed down! If that turns out to be true, I really have come to the end of the road! Aunt Xue began weeping hysterically. Ba-chai was also in tears by now, but tried to comfort her Theres no sense in your distressing yourself about the finances, Mama. Let Cousin Ke take care of that. Though I must say it is distressing to see our employees abandon us and turn against us the moment were down on our luck. I can understand them wanting to save their own skins but I know that some of them are actually encouraging outsiders to cheat us out of our money. As for Pans friends, its a waste of time expecting any help from them. The only thing theyre any good for is parties. The first sign of trouble and theyre of. If you love me, Mama, please listen to my words of advice. At your age its time you took more care of yourself and worried about others less. Remember, even if the worst comes to the worst, youll manage somehow or other. Forget about the clothes and furniture. Let Jin-gui have them. Not many of the servants or serving-women will want to stay on, so you may as well let most of them go too. I feel sorry for Caltrop. After everything shes been through, I think you should keep her on with you. If you ever run short of anything, I can always help out, provided weve got it at home. Im sure he wouldnt mind. And Aroma is a decent sort of girl. She knows about our troubles in fact the slightest mention of your name brings tears to her eyes. He doesnt know that anythings the matter, so he hasnt been particularly worried. If he were to learn the truth, I think the shock might be too much for him. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue, not waiting for her to finish, whatever you do, dont tell him. He nearly died on account of Miss Lin.
To learn what was done with them, and whether or not any of the stolen goods were found, please turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 112 Adamantina discharges a karmic debt and receives a blow from the Hand of Providence Aunt Zhao concludes a deadly feud and sets out on the road to the Nether World The women on night-duty went down on their knees and begged Xi-feng to spare them, but Steward Lin and Jia Yun told them they were wasting their breath The Master left us to mind the house, and now that things have gone wrong, we must all take our share of the blame. You neednt think anyones going to bale you out. If Zhou Ruis adopted son is involved, then everyone - from Her Ladyship downwards - men and women, masters and servants, is under suspicion. Fate has brought this on us, said Xi-feng, struggling for breath. Why waste words? Just take them away. As for the stolen things, you must be sure to tell the police that they all belonged to Her Old Ladyship. Only the masters know the details. When weve sent word to them and they come home, then of course we can make out a list and hand it in to the police. The same statement must be made to the civil authorities. Yes, maam. Jia Yun and Steward Lin went out to execute these instructions. Xi-chun had said nothing throughout this, but now she began to whimper Ive never heard of anything so terrible in all my life! Why did it have to be us? When Uncle Zheng and Aunt Wang come home, how am I to face them? Theyll say they left the house in our hands, theyll blame us for this disaster. I shall die of shame! Xi-feng Its not our doing. The women on night-duty must take the blame. Xi-chun Its all very well for you to say that. You were ill anyway. But Ive got no excuse! Its exactly what my sister4n4aw planned! She wanted me to come to grief! She deliberately talked Aunt Xing into giving me this responsibility. Now Im quite disgraced! She broke down, sobbing violently. Xi-feng You mustnt take it like that. We are all in disgrace. If you adopt such a silly attitude, how am I to hold my head up? As they were speaking they heard a mans voice shouting in the courtyard I said we should have no truck with such women. Theyre witches and whores the lot of them! The Zhen family never allowed people like that in the house, and I didnt expect things to be so lax here! Her Old Ladyships funeral procession was hardly through the front entrance yesterday when that nun from that Hermitage place came pestering to be let in. I told her straight out that she couldnt, but then the old women on the side gate turned round and gave me some cheek, and begged her to come in. So some of the time the side gate was closed, some of the time it was open - who could tell what was going on! I lay awake worrying about it till two in the morning, and then I heard shouts coming from the house here. So I called at the gate, but they wouldnt open up, and as the shouting was getting worse I broke the gate down and came in. I saw some men in the west courtyard, chased them and killed one of them. I only found out today that the place I was in was the courtyard of Miss Xi-chuns apartment. So the nun was there with her at the very time the burglary took place. She slipped out this morning before dawn. She must have been the one who let the burglars in. Shes the traitor in our midst! Who is that insolent fellow? asked Patience. How dare he use such language with Mrs Lian and Miss Xi-chun here inside? He mentioned the Zhen family, said Xi-feng. It must be that vile servant they palmed off on us. Xi-chun had heard and understood Bao Yong only too clearly, and felt more wretched than ever as a consequence. Wasnt there something about a nun in his babblings? Xi-feng continued, turning to Xi-chun. How did you come to have a nun staying with you? Where did she spring from? Xi-chun told her that Adamantina had visited her, and that she had stayed on to play Go and keep her company during the night. Oh, Adamantina! exclaimed Xi-feng. How could she possibly have betrayed us! What a ridiculous idea! But still, it would be most unfortunate if this loathsome creatures accusations ever reached Sir Zhengs ears. The more Xi-chun thought about the possible consequences for Adamantina the more distressed she became.
She began to cough again and brought up another mouthful of blood. Snowgoose went to fetch some water, and Dai-yu rinsed her mouth and spat into the spittoon. Nightingale wiped her lips with a handkerchief. Dai-yu took the handkerchief from her and pointed to the chest. She tried to speak, but was again seized with an attack of breathlessness and closed her eyes. Lie down, Miss, said Nightingale. Dai-yu shook her head. Nightingale thought she must want one of her handkerchiefs, and told Snowgoose to open the chest and bring her a plain white silk one. Dai-yu looked at it, and dropped it on the bed. Making a supreme effort, she gasped out The ones with the writing on... Nightingale finally realized that she meant the handkerchiefs Bao-yu had sent her, the ones she had inscribed with her own poems. She told Snowgoose to fetch them, and herself handed them to Dai-yu, with these words of ad vice You must lie down and rest, Miss. Dont start wearing yourself out. You can look at these another time, when you are feeling better. Dai-yu took the handkerchiefs in one hand and without even looking at them, brought round her other hand which cost her a great effort and tried with all her might to tear them in two. But she was so weak that all she could achieve was a pathetic trembling motion. Nightingale knew that Bao-yu was the object of all- this bitterness but dared not mention his name, saying instead Miss, there is no sense in working yourself up again. Dai-yu nodded faintly, and slipped the handkerchiefs into her sleeve. Light the lamp, she ordered. Snowgoose promptly obeyed. Dai-yu looked into the lamp, then closed her eyes and sat in silence. Another fit of breathlessness. Then Make up the fire in the brazier. Thinking she wanted it for the extra warmth, Nightingale protested You should lie down, Miss, and have another cover on. And the fumes from the brazier might be bad for you. Dai-yu shook her head, and Snowgoose reluctantly made up the brazier, placing it on its stand on the floor. Dai-yu made a motion with her hand, indicating that she wanted it moved up onto the kang. Snowgoose lifted it and placed it there, temporarily using the floor-stand, -while she went out to fetch the special stand they used on the kang. Dai-yu, far from resting back in the warmth, now inclined her body slightly forward - Nightingale had to support her with both hands as she did so. Dai-yu took the handkerchiefs in one hand. Staring into the flames and nodding thoughtfully to herself, she dropped them into the brazier. Nightingale was horrified, but much as she would have liked to snatch them from the flames, she did not dare move her hands and leave Dai-yu unsupported. Snowgoose was out of the room, fetching the brazier-stand, and by now the handkerchiefs were all ablaze. Miss! cried Nightingale. What are you doing? As if she had not heard, Dai-yu reached over for her manuscripts, glanced at them and let them fall again onto the kang. Nightingale, anxious lest she burn these too, leaned up against Dai-yu and freeing one hand, reached out with it to take hold of them. But before she could do so, Dai-yu had picked them up again and dropped them in the flames. The brazier was out of Nightingales reach, and there was nothing she could do but look on helplessly. Just at that moment Snowgoose came in with the stand. She saw Dai-yu drop something into the fire, and without knowing what it was, rushed forward to try and save it. The manuscripts had caught at once and were already ablaze. Heedless of - the danger to her hands, Snowgoose reached into the flames and pulled out what she could, throwing the paper on the floor and stamping frantically on it. But the fire had done its work, and only a few charred fragments remained. Dai-yu closed her eyes and slumped back, almost causing Nightingale to topple over with her. Nightingale, her heart thumping in great agitation, called Snowgoose over to help her settle Dai-yu down again. It was too late now to send for anyone. And yet, what if Dai-yu should die during the night, and the only people there were Snowgoose, herself and the one or two other junior maids in the Naiads House?
I recognized the man myself. Jia Lian pondered for a minute. Of course! Wasnt it Zhou Ruis adopted son that Mr Zhen wanted to have flogged a year or so ago? Lin Thats right, sir. He was caught fighting with Bao Er. You must have seen him at the time. Jia Lian was made angrier still by this revelation, and wanted to beat the man on night-duty, but Steward Lin pleaded with him to abate his wrath. They had their orders, sir, and Im sure they did their duty. But it is a strict family regulation that men are not allowed beyond the inner gate. Even we are not allowed in unless expressly sent for. Master Yun and I did our rounds regularly in the outer apartments the inner gate was firmly closed, and none of the outer gates was left open. The burglars broke in from a back alley. Jia Lian Where are the women who were supposed to be on night-duty in the inner apartments? Lin informed him that on Xi-fengs instructions the women had all been detained and bound, and were waiting to be interrogated. Jia Lian And Bao Yong? Lin He has gone back to the Garden. Jia Lian Send for him. The pages went to fetch Bao Yong, and when he arrived Jia Lian praised him for his conduct Its a good job you were here! Otherwise I dare say everything in the house would have been taken! Bao Yong said nothing. Xi-chun was terrified that he was going to open his mouth and start abusing Adamantina. Xi-feng maintained an apprehensive silence. It was reported meanwhile that Amber and the other maids had arrived from the temple, and they entered and amid much weeping exchanged greetings with the rest of the household. On Jia Lians orders the servants searched Grandmother Jias apartment to see what if anything the burglars had left behind, and found nothing but clothes, a few lengths of fabric and some caskets of copper cash. Jia Lian was now more distraught than ever. The men working on the awning and the pall-bearers had not been paid, nor had the extra kitchen expenses for the funeral reception been met. Where was he to find the money now? He brooded morosely, while Amber and the other maids went into Grandmother Jias inner rooms and broke into a renewed fit of sobbing as they surveyed the havoc. The boxes and cupboards were all flung Open, and how could they possibly remember what had been in them? However, they eventually managed to concoct a list of sorts, which they handed to a servant to deliver to the authorities. Jia Lian issued instructions for that nights watch, and Xi-feng and Xi-chun went back to their rooms. Jia Lian thought it best not to spend the night at home, and did not even find time to reproach Xi-feng for her part in the affair. As soon as he could get away he mounted horse and galloped back to the temple. Xi-feng was still anxious that Xi-chun might be contemplating suicide, and sent Felicity over to comfort her. At ten oclock that night the gates were firmly barred - a somewhat superfluous precaution by now - and everyone lay in bed in a state of nervous wakefulness. But our narrative leaves Rong-guo House and returns to the nun-besotted burglar. He knew that the Hermitage occupied an isolated location in the Garden, and that the nuns only companions there were a few old matrons and novices, who would present no obstacle. He made his plans accordingly. At midnight, when all was quiet, equipped with a knife and a supply of potent narcotic incense, he scaled the Garden wall, and from his vantage point there he could see in the distance lamps burning in the Hermitage. He crept stealthily across and hid himself in an out-of-the-way corner. By two oclock, there was only a single night-light still burning. Adamantina was sitting cross-legged on her mat. She took a short break from her meditations, and after several gusty sighs reflected aloud to herself When I came to the capital from my old home on Mount Xuan-mu, I had hoped to make a name for myself. But then when the Jias invited me to stay here, I could hardly decline their invitation. And now I cant even do something as simple and innocent as paying a visit to Xi-chun without being heaped with abuse by some coarse creature. And later in the night I had such a fright! How nervous Ive been all day, ever since my return. I simply cant settle down properly and meditate. She usually meditated alone, and even today had not asked the others to Stay up with her.
Kindly go and examine your daughter for yourself and speak to Moonbeam first, before making such wild accusations! As Xia San was still there in the room, lurking in the background, Bao-chai and Bao-qin were unable to come to Aunt Xues defence and could only remain anxiously closeted in the inner room. By a fortunate coincidence, however, Lady Wang had just sent Zhou Ruis wife over to see how things were. When she came in and saw this elderly woman abusing and threatening Aunt Xue, she deduced that it must be Jin-guis mother and approached her at once Would you be Mrs Xia, maam? I suppose you know that Mrs Pan took poison? Thats how she died, and it has nothing whatever to do with Mrs Xue. There is really no call for you to slander her in this way! And who might you be? asked Jin-guis mother. Aunt Xue, her confidence a little restored by the arrival of reinforcements, answered for Mrs Zhou This good woman works for our relations the Jias. Oh! Does she now? sneered Mrs Xia. We all know about your wonderful relations! No doubt its thanks to them that you managed to get your own son locked up in gaol. And now I suppose you are hoping to get away scot-free with the murder of my daughter too! She seized Aunt Xue. Out with it! she cried. How did you do it? Let me see the body. Zhou Ruis wife attempted to pacify her By all means. Go and have a look. But kindly take your hands off Mrs Xue! She finally succeeded in puffing Mrs Xia away from Aunt Xue. Xia San now emerged from the shadows to leap to his mothers rescue Think you can attack my mother like this and get away with it just because youre one of their servants? He threw a chair at Mrs Zhou, which luckily missed. The servants who were with Bao-chai in the inner room heard this rumpus break out and came hurrying in to see what was happening. Fearing that Mrs Zhou might come off worst in the fray, they all surged forward and tried to calm the combatants down. Their threats and cajolements were in vain mother and son merely grew more strident in their protestations and more desperate in their actions. We dont need reminding how powerful your Rong-guo relations are! What do we care! Now that Jin-guis gone, we might as well fight it out to the death! Mrs Xia charged at Aunt Xue again with all her might. Despite their numbers, the servants could not withstand her. As the saying goes -1680 If a man stakes all on his attack, Ten thousand men wont hold him back. It was at this moment of crisis that Jia Lian returned, accompanied by seven or eight servants. Seeing how things stood, he ordered his men to drag Xia San outside, and told the ladies to stop fighting at once Surely you can settle your differences in a more civilized fashion? Now, tidy the place up. The officers from the Board of Punishments will be here any minute to conduct the inquest. Mrs Xia had been in full spate when Jia Lian made his entrance. She was somewhat overawed by this strange gentleman with his retinue of servants, some of whom were already barking orders while others stood respectfully to attention, and she wondered which member of the Jia family it could be. Then she saw her adopted son taken away, and heard that the Board of Punishments had been informed and would shortly be holding an inquest, which ruined all her plans. She had originally intended to inspect her daughters corpse, create a terrific fuss and go crying for justice but now they had beaten her to it, and the wind was quite taken out of her sails. Aunt Xue for her part was too frightened to do anything. It was Mrs Zhou who said to Jia Lian These people barged in, and without so much as a look at Mrs Pan this lady began to slander Mrs Xue. We tried to talk some sense into her, but then this ruffian butted in, and started using the most dreadful language in front of the young ladies. What a shocking way to carry on! Theres no point arguing with him now, replied Jia Lian. It would only be a waste of time. When they question him under torture, hell remember soon enough that the inner apartments are strictly reserved for women and that he has no right to be in here. His mother could surely have come to inspect her daughters corpse by herself. It will look extremely suspicious to the authorities, very much as if he had come to rob the place. Jia Lians men managed by one means or another to keep Xia San under control outside, while Mrs Zhou, emboldened by the presence of so many Jia supporters, began denouncing Mrs Xia in earnest Really, madam, you should know better.
Lady Wang still had not the slightest idea what she was talking about. Sort out what in heavens name? she asked impatiently. Its Mrs Pan! Shes dead! blurted out the old woman at last. Pfui! exclaimed Lady Wang when she heard this. So that baggage is dead! Is that what all the fuss is about? But it wasnt reglar, Your Ladyship. I mean, the way she died. Such a to-do! Please, Your Ladyship, send someone over right away! She set off back to the Xue compound. Lady Wang was both annoyed and amused Honestly, what a hopeless old woman! Lian, go and have a look will you? Its a complete waste of time trying to make head or tail of anything that old creature says. The first part, about going and having a look, failed to reach the old womans ears. She only caught the words a complete waste of time and went running home in a great huff to Aunt Xue, who was anxiously awaiting her return Well, who is Lady Wang going to send? The old woman sighed demonstratively Fat lot of use family are at a time of crisis, I must say! Her Ladyship wouldnt lift a finger for us! All she did was call me a stupid creature! This seemed to make Aunt Xue angry, and she became rather flustered If Her Ladyship wouldnt help, what about our own Mrs Bao? I didnt even bother to tell her, replied the old woman. How could she be expected to stand up for us if Her Ladyship wouldnt? Aunt Xue spat at her, and cried indignantly Are you out of your mind? Her Ladyship is one of the Jias but Bao-chai is my own child. She wouldnt let me down! The distinction suddenly seemed to dawn on the old woman. Lawks! Id better go back and find her right away! As they were speaking, Jia Lian came in. He paid his respects to Aunt Xue, and after expressing his condolences went on to explain to her When Aunt Wang heard that Mrs Pan was dead, she questioned your serving-woman but was unable to extract any sense from her at all. Aunt was very worried and sent me to find out what was going on and to give you a hand. If anything needs doing, Aunt Xue, just let me know and Ill do what I can. Aunt Xue had been working herself into a state of great indignation with the old woman, and had become so distraught she could do nothing but weep. On hearing Jia Lians words she became articulate once more Im most obliged to you, Lian. I was sure my sister would stand by me. Im afraid this old woman completely misunderstood you, and gave me a totally misleading impression. Now, please sit down and let me tell you the whole story. After a slight pause she continued How shall I put it...? Well, in a nutshell, my daughter-in4aw did not die a natural death. I suppose it was suicide? ventured Jia Lian. Was it despondency at Cousin Pans imprisonment that drove her to take her own life? If only it had been! Alas, no. Let me explain. For several months shed been rampaging about the whole time, barefoot and with her hair in a terrible state. When she heard that Pan was facing a death sentence, after an initial fit of weeping she began painting herself up dreadfully with rouge and powder. Any remonstrations on my part would only have led to more atrocious scenes, so I tried to turn a blind eye. Then suddenly one day, for some reason unknown to me, she came and asked me if she could have Caltrop to keep her company. I said to her Youve already got Moonbeam. Do you really need Caltrop as well? Youve never liked her, so why go asking for trouble? But she insisted, and I had no choice but to send Caltrop over to her room. The poor girl didnt dare disobey my orders and she went, ill though she was. Funnily enough, my daughter-in-law treated her very well. I was delighted and although Chai suspected some ulterior motive, I was prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, a few days ago, Caltrop fell ill again, and Jin-gui cooked her some soup. She even made a point of serving it to her with her own hands. Poor Caltrop! There was the most unfortunate accident. Jin-gui dropped the soup just as she was coming up to the bedside, scalded herself and broke the bowl as well. I would have expected her to have blamed Caltrop but no, she wasnt in the least angry, just went off at once to fetch a broom, swept up the pieces and gave the floor a good clean.
An immediate solution to these economic ills still failed to present itself to Jia Zhengs mind, and he sent the servants away. He had already resolved what general course of action to follow, but decided to wait first to see the nature of the sentence passed on Jia She and Cousin Zhen. A day or so later, he was in his study puzzling his head over some figures, when a servant came hurrying in to inform him that his presence was immediately required at court. Jia Zheng set off at once, in a state of extreme trepidation. To learn whether the outcome was favourable or otherwise, please turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 107 Impelled by family devotion, Grandmother Jia distributes her personal possessions Favoured with an Imperial dispensation, Jia Zheng receives his brothers hereditary rank Jia Zheng arrived at the Palace, and greeted the various princes and ministers of the Privy Council assembled there to meet him. His Majesty has instructed us to send for you, said the Prince of Bei-jing. He would like us to ask you one or two questions. Jia Zheng fell hastily to his knees, and the inquisition proceeded Were you aware that your elder brother had connived with a provincial official for personal gain? That he had abused his influence and bullied a defenceless citizen? That he had permitted his son to indulge in gambling and loose living, and that this same son forcefully took to his bed the fiance of an innocent person and drove her to her death when she would not gratify his desires? Were you aware of all this? Jia Zhen replied as best he could Upon the expiry of my term of office as Education Commissioner, an appointment I owed to the gracious favour of His Majesty, I was engaged at first in supervising relief measures, and then on my return home at the end of last winter I was deputed by my superiors to inspect reconstruction work and was subsequently appointed Grain Intendant for Kiangsi Province. From this last post I returned to the capital under impeachment, and have now resumed my former position at the Board of Works. I have truly endeavoured to be diligent in the performance of all these official duties, but I fear that I have completely neglected to keep my own household in order. For this inexcusable shortcoming on my part, for my abject failure to instruct my sons and nephews in the true principles of conduct, for my base ingratitude to the throne, I can only beg that His Majesty will punish me with fitting severity. The Prince of Bei-jing went in to communicate this to the Emperor, and after a short while returned with the Imperial Edict, which he declaimed to the assembled company We have received an indictment from the Censorate stating that Jia She connived with a provincial official and abused his own personal influence to bully a defenceless citizen. The provincial official named by the censor was the prefect of Ping-an. Jia She, so the impeachment reads, was in communication with this prefect with a view to perverting the true course of justice. When closely interrogated, however, Jia She testified that the prefect was in fact a relation of his by marriage and that their connection was a purely personal one. The censor has therefore been unable to substantiate this part of the charge. Another part, however, has been verified, namely that Jia She abused his personal influence in coercing the man named Stony to part with a set of antique fans. These fans were none the less trifles, and the case must therefore be distinguished from serious cases of extortion. Stonys subsequent suicide can also be ascribed to his own eccentricity, and he cannot be strictly considered to have been driven to his death. We see fit to show leniency to Jia She, and hereby sentence him to penal service at a military post on the Mongolian border, where he shall redeem himself by diligent service. With reference to the first charge brought against Jia Zhen, that he forcefully took to his bed the betrothed of an innocent citizen and drove her to her death when she would not gratify his desires upon consulting the original records at the Censorate, We find that the lady in question, a certain Miss You Er-jie, was betrothed to a certain Zhang Hua when both were still in their mothers wombs. The marriage was never solemnized, indeed Zhang himself wished to annul it on the grounds of his own poverty. The ladys mother was also quite willing for her daughter to be taken as a concubine, not by Jia Zhen himself but by his younger cousin. So clearly this was not a case of forceful appropriation. Then the case of Miss You San-jie the charge here is that following her suicide she was buried secretly and the facts of her death were concealed from the authorities. On further investigation it has been found that this Miss You San-jie was the younger sister of Jia Zhens wife, and that it was his original intention to arrange a marriage for her.
Poor Caltrop! There was the most unfortunate accident. Jin-gui dropped the soup just as she was coming up to the bedside, scalded herself and broke the bowl as well. I would have expected her to have blamed Caltrop but no, she wasnt in the least angry, just went off at once to fetch a broom, swept up the pieces and gave the floor a good clean. Afterwards the two of them still seemed on friendly terms. Then yesterday evening she told Moonbeam to go and make two bowls of soup, which she said she would drink with Caltrop. It was a little later that we heard this terrific hullabaloo coming from her apartment. First Moonbeam started screaming her head off, then Caltrop screamed too and staggered out, leaning on the wall for support and calling for help. I went in at once and found Jin-gui writhing on the floor, with blood streaming from her nose and eyes she was clutching feverishly at her stomach with both hands, and kicking both feet in the air. I was scared out of my wits. I asked her to tell me what had happened, but she was too far gone to answer, and after a few more minutes of agony she died. It looked very much like a case of poisoning to me. Then Moonbeam started wailing again and laid hold of Caltrop, claiming that it was her doing. But I hardly think Caltrop is that sort of person. Besides, she was almost too ill to get out of bed how could she have had the strength to do such a thing? Moonbeam insisted, however, and still insists, that Caltrop is the culprit. My dear Lian! What was I to do? In the circumstances I had no choice but to tell the old women to bind Caltrop, to hand her over to Moonbeam and to lock them both in the room. Bao-qin and I have been up all night keeping watch, and we sent word to you the moment the gates were opened this morning. Lian, you know about such things. Whats the proper course of action for me to take? Do Jin-guis family know yet? asked Jia Lian. I thought it better to try to disentangle the whole affair ourselves before letting anyone know. I would advise you to report whats happened to the authorities first and let them reach their own conclusions. Its only natural that we should suspect Moonbeam, but they might ask what Moonbeam would have stood to gain by poisoning her own mistress. And in a way it might almost seem more plausible to them that Caltrop should have done it. As they were speaking, some serving-women from Rong-guo House came in to announce the arrival of Bao-chai. Jia Lian decided that, although strictly speaking she was his younger cousins wife, he need not withdraw after all, she was also his cousin and he had known her from childhood. She greeted her mother and Jia Lian, and went in to sit with Bao-qin in the inner room. Aunt Xue joined her there and told her the story. Surely, by binding Caltrop we are virtually admitting her guilt? was Bao-chais immediate response. If Moonbeam made the soup, then she should be bound. And we must let the Xia family know, and report the death to the authorities. This seemed logical enough to Aunt Xue. She asked Jia Lian for his opinion Chai is absolutely right. Id better go and have a word with someone at the Board of Punishment, to make sure theres no trouble at the inquest. But I think it will be a bit hard to justify releasing Caltrop if we then bind Moonbeam instead. I never wanted to bind Caltrop in the first place, said Aunt Xue, but I was afraid that this unjust accusation, coming on top of her illness, might drive her to desperate measures. She might try to commit suicide, and then wed have another death on our hands. It was for her own safety that I tied her up and handed her over to Moonbeam. Quite, said Jia Lian. But still, we have rather played into Moonbeams hands. I think our principle now must be that, if one of them is bound, both must be bound if one is set free, both must be set free. They were both present at the time of Jin-guis death. Meanwhile we must send someone to comfort Caltrop. Aunt Xue told her serving-woman t6 open the door of Jin-guis apartment and go in, while Bao-chai ordered some of her own women to accompany them and help them tie up Moonbeam. When they arrived they found Caltrop sobbing her heart out and Moonbeam gloating over her. Moonbeam fought back tooth and nail when they laid hands on her, but the women were too strong.
You yourself, sir, hailing as you do from the realm of luxury and opulence, must surely have heard there of a person by the name of Bao-yu? Of course, replied Yu-cun. Recently I heard a rumour to the effect that he too has taken refuge in the dharma. I saw something of him in the past and it certainly never occurred to me that he would take a step like this. There is nothing unexpected about it, said Shi-yin. I have known of his strange destiny for many years. Ever since that day long ago, in fact, when I met you outside my abode in Carnal Lane and we had that little chat. I had already encountered him then. But the capital is a long way from your old home, said Yu-cun in great surprise. How could you possibly have set eyes on him at that time? We had long enjoyed a spiritual communion, replied Shi-yin darkly. In that case, sir, you must know of his present whereabouts? Bao-yu, replied the old man, is the Stone, the Precious Jade. Before the two mansions of Rong and Ning were searched and their worldly goods impounded, on the very day when Bao-chai and Dai-yu were separated, the Stone had already quit the world. This was in part to avoid the impending calamity, in part to permit the consummation of the union. From that moment the Stones worldly karma was complete, its substance had returned to the Great Unity. All that remained was for it to demonstrate some small fraction of its spiritual powers by achieving academic distinction and by leaving behind an heir to bring honour to the family name. Thus its precious nature, its magical power, its capacity for spiritual transformation, these were made manifest, and all could know that it was no ordinary stone of this world. To this end the Buddhist mah sattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso first brought it into the world, and now that its destiny is fulfilled it is they who will take it back once more to its place of origin. That is the sum of my knowledge concerning Bao-yu and, as you put it, his present whereabouts. Although Yu-cun could not take all of this in, he was able to follow about half. He nodded his head and sighed So that is the truth of the matter. And I never knew. But if Bao-yu is a person of such a remarkable spiritual pedigree, why did he first need to be blinded by human passion before he could reach enlightenment? Shi-yin smiled Even though I may seek to expound this, I fear you may never be able to understand it fully. The Land of Illusion and the Paradise of Truth are one and the same. Could two readings of the registers and a whole lifetimes experience fail to bring enlightenment? Could he fail to see the Alpha and the Omega? If the Fairy Flower regained its true primordial state, then surely the Magic Stone should do likewise? This time the hermits words were truly beyond Yu-cuns powers of comprehension. He knew only that they must contain some esoteric meaning, and did not venture to probe any further. It is so kind of you to tell me all this about Bao-yu, he said. But may I ask you another question why is it that of all the ladies in these noble families, none, including Her Grace the Imperial Jia Concubine, has come to more than an undistinguished end? On hearing this Shi-yin sighed Do not take my words amiss, sir! The fact of the matter is that all these noble ladies to whom you refer hail from the Skies of Passion and the Seas of Retribution. Since olden times their sex has been under a natural obligation to remain pure, pure from lust, pure even from the slightest taint of passion. Thus amorous beauties such as Cui Ying-ying and Su Xiao-xiao were fallen fairies, their celestial hearts polluted with the base desires of this world, while romantic poets such as Song Yu and Si-ma Xiang-ru sinned in like manner through the written word. Consider for a moment how can any being ensnared in human attachment hope to come to more than an undistinguished end, as you put it? As he listened to the hermits words, Jia Yu-cun found himself stroking his beard meditatively and heaving a long sigh. May I ask, sir, he ventured, whether the Ning and Rong houses will ever rise again to their former heights of prosperity? It is preordained that prosperity comes with virtue, and calamity with evil, replied Shi-yin. At present in these two houses the virtuous have turned to the true path, while the wicked have at least repented of their ways. In time to come, orchid and cassia will bloom, and the family fortunes will indeed prosper again.
Youd better watch your step. She was never very fond of you while she was alive, and youd be well advised not to go walking in the Garden alone after this, or her ghost may pounce on you and try to take its revenge! But she never bore a grudge against me, countered Xi-feng with a smile. It was Bao-yu she cursed with her dying breath. Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue took this to be another of her witticisms, and ignored it Dont talk such nonsense. Now off you go and find someone to choose a lucky day for your cousin Baos party. Yes, Grannie. After a little more chat Xi-feng went on her way. She despatched one of the servants to consult the almanac and on the chosen day, the family duly celebrated the formal if not actual consummation of Bao-yu and Bao-chais marriage, and entertained their guests with a banquet and plays. But of this our narrative omits further details. It turns instead to the convalescent Bao-yu. From time to time Bao-chai would pick up one of his books and engage him in conversation about it, and on these occasions Bao-yu was sufficiently compos mentis to sustain a desultory dialogue of sorts. But his mind was unquestionably duller than it had been, a deterioration he himself was unable to account for. Bao-chai argued with herself that the cause lay in the loss of his Magic Jade, but Aroma was less philosophical, and frequently took him to task Where have your wits fled to? If only it was that old weakness of yours that had left you! But you seem to have kept that and lost your wits instead! Bao-yu did not let remarks such as this rile him, and responded with an inane grin. If he ever showed signs of letting his wild streak get the better of him, he allowed himself to be restrained by Bao-chais good sense, while as time went by Aroma rebuked him less and less, and confined herself instead to ministering to his practical needs. His other maids had always respected Bao-chais quiet, demure manner, and now that she was their mistress her gentle and friendly nature won their willing obedience. Beneath this apparent calm, Bao-yu continued to feel a deep sense of restlessness, and in particular a recurring desire to visit the Garden. Grandmother Jia and the other ladies were afraid that such an expedition might expose him to a chill or fever of some kind, and that the Gardens surroundings would have too gloomy and depressing an effect on his spirits. Dai-yus coffin was already lodged in a temple outside the city walls, but the Naiads House and the memories associated with it would be sure to cause him renewed distress and bring on a relapse. So they forbade him to go. Most of the Garden was now deserted. Of Bao-yus cousins, Bao-qin had already moved out to live with Aunt Xue, while Shi Xiang-yun had gone home on her uncles return to the capital, and seldom visited the Jias now that the date of her own wedding had been settled. She had been present on Bao-yus wedding-day and more recently on the day of the party, but on both occasions she had stayed with Grandmother Jia and her awareness that Bao-yu was now a married man, and she herself betrothed, had inhibited her from indulging in any of her old high-spirited banter. When she saw the newly wed couple, she talked to Bao-chai but scarcely said more than a polite hello to Bao-yu. Xing Xiu-yan had moved in with her aunt Lady Xing after Ying-chuns marriage, while the two Li sisters only ever visited the Garden with their mother, and then would stay for a couple of days with Li Wan before returning home. The Only Garden residents proper were now Li Wan, Tan-chun and Xi-chun. Grandmother Jia had wanted the three of them to move in with her, but with Yuan-chuns death and all the subsequent family excitements of one kind or another, she had not been able to find time to make the necessary arrangements and now the weather was growing warmer daily and the Garden was beginning to seem less dreary, so she decided to leave things as they were until the autumn. But we anticipate. Jia Zheng had set off for his new provincial posting, travelling by day and resting by night, accompanied by the various aides and secretaries he had engaged before his departure. On his arrival at the provincial capital, he reported to his superiors and immediately proceeded to his new yamen to take ceremonial possession of the official seal and to assume office.
The old lady too found Bao-yus wordsboth funny and distressing. I heard you both myself, she said to Xi-feng. For the present, we must ignore it. Tell Aroma to do her best to calm him down. Come, let us go. Lady Wang joined them, and the three ladies went across to Aunt Xues. On arrival there, they pretended to be concerned about the course of Xue Pans affair. Aunt Xue expressed her profound gratitude for this concern, and gave them the latest news. After they had all taken tea, Aunt Xue was about to send for Bao-chai, when Xifeng stopped her, saying There is no need to tell Cousin Chai that we are here, Auntie. With a diplomatic smile, she continued Grandmothers visit today is not purely a social one. She has something of importance to say, and would like you t6 come over later so that we can all discuss it together. Aunt Xue nodded. Of course. After a little more chat, the three ladies returned. That evening Aunt Xue came over as arranged, and after paying her respects to Grandmother Jia, went to her sisters apartment. First there was the inevitable scene of sisterly commiseration over Wang Zi-tengs death. Then Aunt Xue said Just now when I was at Lady Jias, young Bao came out to greet me and seemed quite well. A little thin perhaps, but certainly not as ill as I had been led to expect from your description and Xi-fengs. No, it is really not that serious, said Xi-feng. Its only Grandmother who will worry so. Her idea is that it would be reassuring for Sir Zheng to see Bao-yu married before he leaves, as who knows when he will be able to come home from his new posting. And then from Bao-yus own point of view, it might be just the thing to turn his luck. With Cousin Chais golden locket to counteract the evil influence, he should make a good recovery. Aunt Xue was willing enough to go along with the idea, but was concerned that Bao-chai might feel rather hard done by. I see nothing against it, she said. But I think we should all take time to think it over properly. In accordance with Xi-fengs plan, Lady Wang went on As you have no head of family present, we should like you to dispense with the usual trousseau. Tomorrow you should send Ke to let Pan know that while we proceed with the wedding, we shall continue to do our utmost to settle his court-case. She made no mention of Bao-yus feelings for Dai-yu, but continued Since you have given your consent, the sooner they are married, the sooner things will look up for everyone. At this point, Faithful came in to take back a report to Grandmother Jia. Though Aunt Xue was still concerned about Bao-chais feelings, she saw that in the circumstances she had no choice, and agreed to everything they had suggested. Faithful reported this to Grandmother Jia, who was delighted and sent her back again to ask Mrs Xue to explain to Bao-chai why it was that things were being done in this way, so that she would not feel unfairly treated. Aunt Xue agreed to do this, and it was settled that Xi-feng and Jia Lian would act as official go-betweens. Xi-feng retired to her apartment, while Aunt Xue and Lady Wang stayed up talking together well into the night. Next day, Aunt Xue returned to her apartment and told Bao-chai the details of the proposal, adding I have already given my consent. At first Bao-chai hung her head in silence. Then she began to cry. Aunt Xue said all that she could jo comfort her, and went to great lengths to explain the reasoning behind the decision. Bao-chai retired to her room, and Baoqin went in to keep her company and cheer her up. Aunt Xue also spoke to Ke, instructing him as follows You must leave tomorrow. Find out the latest news of Pans judgement, and then convey this message to him. Return as soon as you possibly can. Xue Ke was away for four days, at the end of which time he returned to report to Aunt Xue. The Circuit Judge has ratified the verdict of manslaughter, and after the next hearing his final memorial will be presented to the Provincial Supreme Court for confirmation. We should have the commutation money ready. As for Cousin Chais affair, Cousin Pan approves entirely of your decision, Aunt. And he says that curtailing the formalities will save us a lot of money too. You are not to wait for him, but should do whatever you think best.
We have so little time. I shall have to do something mysel Oh dear, this is all so dreadfully confusing! Things mustnt be allowed to go on like this! She called Faithful to her and sent her off with some secret instructions. Jia She and Cousin Zhen meanwhile left the room and conversed tearfully with Jia Zheng outside, expressing their remorse for their past waywardness and anticipating with gloom the bitter exile that lay ahead. Then they went over and lamented with their wives. Jia She was growing old, and the prospect of separation was less harrowing for him and Lady Xing than it was for Cousin Zhen and You-shi. Jia Lian and Jia Rong held their fathers hands and wept at their side. Frontier service was a less severe punishment than military exile, but it would still be a long and painful ordeal. They could only try to steel themselves to it as best they could. Grandmother Jia told Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Faithful and a bevy of maids to look through every one of her trunks and boxes, and to take out all the personal belongings she had stored away over the years of her marriage. Then she summoned Jia She, Jia Zheng, Cousin Zhen and all the other menfolk to attend while she made a distribution. She began by giving Jia She three thousand taels of silver. You are to take two thousand with you, she said, for the journey and for any expenses afterwards, and leave one thousand here for your wife. This three thousand is for you, Zhen. You must take one thousand with you, and leave two thousand for your wife. In this way, although they will be living with us, they will still be independent and able to make separate catering arrangements. I shall provide for Xi-chuns marriage when the time comes. Now Xi-feng I feel sorry for her, she tried so hard for so long, and has ended up with nothing. She too shall have three thousand taels, and she is to keep all of it for her own use and not give a penny to Lian. I know she is much too ill now, and in no fit state to come and receive it herself, so Patience can take it to her. Here are some robes that once belonged to my husband, and some of the gowns and jewellery that I used to wear when I was young - I dont need them any more. The mens clothing can be divided between She, Zhen, Lian and Rong. Their wives can share the ladies things. This five hundred taels of silver is for Lian to pay for transporting Miss Lins coffin to the South next year. When this distribution was complete, she turned to Jia Zheng The debts you mentioned must be honoured at once. Take this gold and use it for that purpose. Their misdeeds have driven me to these drastic measures, but dont think I have forgotten that you too are my son. In due time you will receive your fair share. Bao-yu is married and can have what is left here - gold and silver worth several thousand taels. And Li Wan she has always been such a dutiful granddaughter4n4aw to me, and little Lan is such a sweet child. Heres some for them too. There, Ive finished. Jia Zheng was moved to tears to see how clearly she had worked everything out. We have failed you, Mother! he sobbed, falling to his knees. We have not done our filial duty towards you in your old age and yet you shower us with such bounty! How can we ever outlive our shame! Oh poppycock! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Dont you worry, if it werent for this crisis I should certainly have kept it all for myself! But lets be serious our staff is much too large. You are the only one left with an official post, Zheng, so we dont need more than a few servants. Tell the stewards to call the staff together and make the necessary arrangements. Each establishment must make do with as few servants as possible. We would have had to manage with none at all if our household had been confiscated. The same goes for the ladies apartments. We must find husbands for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking. Its in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be Sent to take it back to them straight away.
Lady Xing burst into tears. In Jia Shes absence she had to send Jia Lian to the Suns to represent the family. Grandmother Jia was so ill that no one dared break the news to her. Alas! What a cruel end for such a gentle creature, her flowerlike beauty crushed within a year of marriage! None of the Jias could leave home with Grandmother Jia as she was, and the Suns gave Ying-chun a predictably makeshift funeral. Grandmother Jia continued to deteriorate steadily, but still her only thought was for her granddaughters and great-nieces. On one occasion Xiang-yun was in the forefront of her mind, and she sent a maid to see how she was. The maid returned and tiptoed in to find Faithful. Faithful was at the bedside, as were Lady Wang and the other ladies and the maid, not wishing to disturb them, went round to the back to find Amber. Her Old Ladyship sent me to fetch news of Miss Xiang-yun, she told Amber, and I found her crying her heart out! Her husband has suddenly been taken ill, and the doctors say theres no hope for him. At the best it will turn into a consumption and he may last another four or five years! You can imagine how badly Miss Xiang-yun has taken it! Shes already heard about Her Old Ladyships illness, but now she simply cant leave home. She told me not to mention her husbands illness to Her Old Ladyship. If she does ask after Miss Xiang-yun, you must think of some way to explain her absence. Amber heaved a deep sigh, and after a long silence dismissed the maid. She too thought it unwise to inform Grandmother Jia, and went to her bedside with the intention of telling Faithful to invent some story. She found Grandmother Jia deathly pale, and everyone in the room whispering among themselves You can see shes going! Amber did not dare utter a word. Jia Zheng discreetly called Jia Lian over to whisper something in his ear, and Jia Lian tiptoed off to do his bidding. Outside he assembled the remaining household staff. Her Old Ladyship will soon be gone. You must make sure that everything is in order. First fetch out the coffin-boards for inspection, and measure them up for a lining. Go round all the apartments, take everyones measurements, and give the tailor a complete list, with instructions to make everyone a set of mourning clothes. Arrange for the funeral awning to be constructed in the courtyard and for coffin-bearers to be hired. And have extra staff put on duty in the kitchen. Mr Lian, replied Lai Da, on behalf of the others. You dont need to worry about these things. We have already thought of everything. But where is the money coming from? We wont need to borrow, said Jia Lian. Her Old Ladyship has made provision herself. The Master told me just now that he wants no expense spared. It must be done in style we must put on a good show. Yes, sir. Lai Da and the others went about their business at once, and Jia Lian returned to his own apartment. How is Mrs Lian? he asked Patience. Patience shot her mouth out towards the inner room Go and see for yourself. Jia Lian went in. Xi-feng was struggling to dress herself, but was too weak to do so. She had collapsed on the kang, and was leaning on the little kang-table. Its no good hoping to snatch some rest now! exclaimed Jia Lian. Grandmother is sinking fast and you must be there. Hurry up and tell them to tidy things up in here. And pull yourself together! If the worst happens, we wont be able to get away for quite a while. Weve got nothing left to tidy up! said Xi-feng bitterly. Only a few odds and ends, nothing worth bothering about. You go on ahead, Sir Zheng may want you. Ill come as soon as Im properly dressed. J ia Lian returned to Grandmother Jias apartment and reported discreetly to Jia Zheng that all had been seen to and the various duties assigned. Jia Zheng nodded. The Imperial Physician was announced, and Jia Lian went out to receive him. Grandmother Jias pulses were taken and then the physician emerged to inform Jia Lian in hushed tones Lady Jias pulse-rate is very poor. You must be prepared for the worst. Jia Lian understood and passed the message on to Lady Wang and the others. Lady Wang beckoned Faithful with a meaningful glance and told her to prepare Grandmother Jias funeral clothes.
Jia Zheng had remained in an outer room during all of this, and so had seen nothing to disillusion him of the reassuring impression he had received earlier on. The following day, as it happened, was the day selected according to the almanac for his departure to his new post. After a short rest, he took formal leave of the festivities and returned to his apartment. Grandmother Jia, too, left Baoyu sound asleep and returned to her apartment for a brief rest. The next morning, Jia Zheng took leave of the ancestors in the family shrine and came to bid his mother farewell. He bowed before her and said I, your unworthy son, am about to depart for afar. My only wish is that you should keep warm in the cold weather and take good care of yourself. As soon as I arrive at my post, I shall write to ask how you are. You are not to worry on my account. Bao-yus marriage has now been celebrated in accordance with your wishes, and it only remains for me to beg you to instruct him, and impart to him the wisdom of your years. Grandmother Jia, for fear that Jia Zheng would worry on his journey, made no mention of Bao-yus relapse but merely said There is one thing I should tell you. Although the rites were performed last night, Bao-yus marriage was not properly consummated. His health would not allow it. Custom, I know, decrees that he should see you off today. But in view of all the circumstances, his earlier illness, the luck turning, his still fragile state of convalescence and yesterdays exertions, I am worried that by going out he might catch a chill. So I put it to you if you wish him to fulfil his filial obligations by seeing you off, then send for him at once and instruct him accordingly but if you love him, then spare him and let him say goodbye and make his kotow to you here. Why should I want him to see me off? returned Jia Zheng. All I want is that from now on he should study in earnest. That would bring me greater pleasure by far. Grandmother Jia was most relieved to hear this. She told Jia Zheng to be seated and sent Faithful, after imparting to her various secret instructions, to fetch Bao-yu and to bring Aroma with him. Faithful had not been away many minutes, when Bao-yu came in and with the usual promptings, performed his duty to his father. Luckily the sight of his father brought him, for a few moments, sufficient clarity to get through the formalities without any gross lapses. Jia Zheng delivered himself of a few exhortatory words, to all of which his son gave the correct replies. Then Jia Zheng told Aroma to escort him back to his room, while he himself went to Lady Wangs apartment. There he earnestly enjoined Lady Wang to take charge of Bao-yus moral welfare during his absence. There must be none of his previous unruliness, he added. He must now prepare himself to enter for next years provincial examination. Lady Wang assured him that she would do her utmost, and without mentioning anything else, at once sent a maid to escort Bao-chai into the room. Bao-chai performed the rite proper to a newly-married bride seeing off her father-in-law, and then remained in the room when Jia Zheng left. The other women-folk accompanied him as far as the inner gate before turning back. Cousin Zhen and the other young male Jias received a few words of exhortation, drank a farewell toast, and, together with a crowd of other friends and relatives, accompanied him as far as the Hostelry of the Tearful Parting, some three or four miles beyond the city walls, where they bid their final farewell. -384 But of Jia Zhengs departure no more. Let us return to Bao-yu, who on leaving his father, had suffered an immediate relapse. His mind became more and more clouded, and he could swallow neither food nor drink. Whether or not he was to emerge from this crisis alive will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 98 Crimson Pearls suffering spirit returns to the Realm of Separation And the convalescent Stone-in-waiting weeps at the scene of past affection On his return from seeing his father, Bao-yu, as we have seen, regressed into a worse state of stupor and depression than ever. He was too lacking in energy to move, and could eat nothing, but fell straight into a heavy slumber. Once more the doctor was called, once more he took Baoyus pulses and made out a prescription, which was administered to no effect. He could not even recognize the people around him.
Heedless of - the danger to her hands, Snowgoose reached into the flames and pulled out what she could, throwing the paper on the floor and stamping frantically on it. But the fire had done its work, and only a few charred fragments remained. Dai-yu closed her eyes and slumped back, almost causing Nightingale to topple over with her. Nightingale, her heart thumping in great agitation, called Snowgoose over to help her settle Dai-yu down again. It was too late now to send for anyone. And yet, what if Dai-yu should die during the night, and the only people there were Snowgoose, herself and the one or two other junior maids in the Naiads House? They passed a restless night. Morning came at last, and Dai-yu seemed a little more comfortable. -But after breakfast she suddenly began coughing and vomiting, and became tense and feverish again. Nightingale could see that she had reached a crisis. She called Snowgoose and the other juniors in and told them to mount watch, while she went to report to Grandmother Jia. But when she reached Grandmother Jias apartment, she found it almost deserted. Only a few old nannies and charladies were there, keeping an eye. Where is Her Old Ladyship? asked Nightingale. We dont know, came the reply in chorus. That was very odd, thought Nightingale. She went into Bao-yus room and found that too quite empty, save for a single maid who answered with the same Dont know. By now Nightingale had more or less guessed the truth. How could they be so heartless and so cruel? And to think that not a soul had come to visit Dai-yu during the past few days! As the bitterness of it struck her with full force, she felt a great wave of resentment break out within her, and turned abruptly to go. I shall go and find Bao-yu, and see how he is faring! I wonder how he will manage to brazen it out in front of me! I remember last year, when I made up that story about Miss Lin going back to the South, he fell sick with despair. To think that now he should be openly doing a thing like this! Men must have hearts as cold as ice or snow. What hateful creatures they are! She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet within. Suddenly she realized Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where? She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yus page boy Inky rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale? I heard that Master Bao was getting married, replied Nightingale, and I wanted to watch some of the fun. But I can see Ive come to the wrong place. And I dont know when the wedding is taking place, either. If I tell you, said Inky in a confidential tone, you must promise not to tell Snowgoose. Weve been given orders not to let any of you know. The weddings to be tonight. Of course its not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside another apartment. Whats the matter? continued Inky, after a pause. Nothing, replied Nightingale. You can go now. Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and clenching her teeth, she said fiercely Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous way but when you are happily married, and have your hearts desire, you neednt think you can look me in the face again! As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the Garden. She was not far from the Naiads House, when she saw two junior maids standing at the gate, peeping out nervously. They saw her coming, and one of them cried out Theres Miss Nightingale! At last! Nightingale could see that all was not well. Gesturing to them anxiously to be silent, she hurried in, to find Dai-yu red in the face, the fire from her liver having risen upwards and inflamed her cheeks. This was a dangerous sign, and Nightingale called Dai-yus old wet-nurse, Nannie Wang, to come and take a look. One glance was enough to reduce this old woman tears. Nightingale had turned to Nannie Wang as an older person, who could be expected to lend them some courage in this extremity.
What a marvellous stroke of luck that would be for somebody! None of them seemed to take much notice of this, except for Wang Ren, who looked very thoughtful. For the present he said nothing and continued drinking. A little later two young lads came in, younger sons of Stewards Lai and Lin. You seem to be having a fine time of it, sirs, by the looks of things! they exclaimed. Everyone rose to greet them. Why have the two of you been such a long time? Weve been expecting you for ages. They explained Early this morning we heard rather a disturbing rumour that out family was in some sort of official trouble again, so we hurried out to see what news we could glean at the Palace. It turned out to have nothing to do with our family after all. In that case, why didnt you come straight here afterwards? It wasnt exactly our family, but it was connected with us. It was that Mr Jia Yu-cun. When we were at the Palace we saw him bound in chains. They told us he was being taken to the High Court for questioning. We knew he was a frequent visitor here, and were afraid that the case might somehow involve us, so we followed them to see what happened. Good thinking, my man! exclaimed Jia Yun. We are most obliged to you. Sit down and have a drink, and then tell us all about it. The two sat down after a polite show of reluctance, and as they drank continued This Mr Yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow, and knows how to pull strings. Hed done extremely well until recently, in fact but greed was his downfall. There were several charges brought against him, avarice and extortion being two of them. As we all know, our present August Sovereign is exceptionally wise, compassionate and benevolent. There is one thing that stirs his wrath, however, and that is corruption, any form of tyrannical or bullying behaviour. So His Majesty decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial. If he is found guilty, things will look pretty grim for him if he is acquitted, then the men who brought the charges will be in for trouble. It is certainly comforting to think what just times we live in! For those lucky enough to be officials in the first place! Like your elder brother, said one of the company, referring to Steward Lais eldest son, Lai Shang-rong. Hes a county magistrate. Done very nicely for himself. True enough, replied young Lal. But his conduct still leaves a lot to be desired, Im afraid. He may not last long at this rate. Has he been taking squeeze himself? Lai nodded and drained his cup. What other news did you pick up at the Palace? they asked them. Oh, nothing much. A number of criminals from the coast have apparently been arrested, and sent to the High Court. During their trial they revealed the whereabouts of several others of their kind, lying low here in the capital, watching and waiting for fresh opportunities for crime. Fortunately the present civil and military authorities have such a sound grip on the situation, and are so dedicated to the service of the throne, that these criminal elements will be effectively controlled. If youve heard of such cases, perhaps you have news of our burglary? asked one of the party. Im afraid not, came the reply. I heard something about a man from one of the inland provinces who got into trouble here in town for abducting a girl and running off with her to the coast. She put up a fight and he ended by killing her. They arrested him crossing the border, and executed him on the spot. Wasnt Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage abducted in similar circumstances? put in one of the others. Couldnt it have been her? Bound to have been! muttered Jia Huan. How could you know? they asked him. She was a sickening creature! said Jia Huan. Always giving herself airs and graces. She had only to set eyes on Bao-yu to get a big smile all over her face. But she wouldnt so much as acknowledge my existence! I hope it is her! Plenty of people are kidnapped all the time, someone commented. It could easily have been someone else. I can well believe it was her, said Jia Yun. The day before yesterday I heard that one of the sisters at the Hermitage had a dream in which she saw Adamantina being killed. This was greeted with derision You cant take dreams seriously! Dream or no dream, its all one to me, protested Dumbo. Lets get on with the real business of the evening, shall we? Eat up, everyone, and we can start tonights Big Game. This met with general approval, and as soon as they had finished their meal they began gambling in earnest.
Of course, we dont like to criticize her in front of you, miss. Who are we when compared with her, after all? Just ordinary, unrefined people we chant our liturgy, say our prayers, make intercession for the sins of others, and hope to earn ourselves a little merit, a little good karma. What does good karma really mean? asked Xi-chun earnestly. Well, miss, putting aside the truly virtuous families like your own, which have nothing to fear, of course - other noble ladies and young misses of good family can never be certain how long their prosperity will last. If calamity once strikes, then nothing can save them. Nothing, that is, except Our Lady of Mercy if Our Lady sees a mortal suffering, her infinite compassion moves her to try to guide that mortal towards salvation. That is why we all pray to her and say Hail, Lady of Mercy, Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion and Grace, Deliverer, Saviour, Hail! A nun leads a hard life, its true, harder than a young lady in a rich family. But were saved! Even if we cant hope to become Buddhas or Saints, at least by keeping up our devotions we may one day in another lifetime he reborn as men. And that would be sufficient reward in itsel At least then we would escape the endless trials and silent tribulations of womankind. You are still too young to understand, miss but let me tell you, when once a young lady leaves home and marries, it is all over with her. She must spend the rest of her days a slave to her husbands will. In the true religious life it is sincere devotion that counts. Sister Adamantina always thought herself so gifted and sensitive, so superior. To her we were always vulgar mortals. And yet ordinary folk like us can at least earn good simple karma, while look at this terrible thing that has befallen her. Their words found an all too receptive ear. Uninhibited by the presence of her maids, Xi-chun poured out the whole story of how badly You-shi had been treating her, and how she had been made to stay and look after the house, and the disastrous consequence. She showed them where she had already hacked off a part of her hair. You think Im just another worldling, trapped in the fiery pit of delusion! But youre wrong. Ive been wanting to be a nun for a long time myself. I just havent been able to think of a way of achieving my goal. The nuns feigned alarm Now, miss, dont you ever say such a thing again! If Mrs Zhen were to hear, shed give us the scolding of our lives and have us thrown out of the convent. Why, a young lady like yoursel bred in such a good family, youre sure to marry a fine young gentleman and enjoy a lifetime of luxury and ease ... The colour flew into Xi-chuns cheeks What makes you think my sister-in-law can have you sent away, and I cant? The nuns realized from this that she was in earnest, and decided to goad her on a little further Dont take offence, miss. But do you honestly believe that Their Ladyships and the young mistresses would let you have your way? You will only stir up a lot of unnecessary trouble for yourself. Its you were thinking of. We shall see, was Xi-chuns brief comment. Landscape thought this augured ill, and gave the nuns a meaningful glance. They took the hint, and too scared to lead Xi-chun on any further, made their farewells. Xi-chun did not detain them, but merely smiled scornfully after them and said Dont imagine yours is the only convent! The nuns thought it wiser not to reply. Landscape was worried by this latest turn of events, and fearing that she might be blamed if anything untoward occurred she crept off to inform You-shi Miss Xi-chun is still set on shaving her head and becoming a nun, maam. These past few days shes not been ill, shes been lying at home nursing her grievance. Perhaps it would be safer to take some precautions. If anything were to happen, we would be blamed ... She doesnt really want to leave home and take holy vows, said You-shi. She just thinks she can take advantage of Mr Zhens absence to challenge my authority. Well, so far as Im concerned, she can go ahead and good luck to her! Landscape continued none the less in her efforts to dissuade Xi-chun from her drastic course of action. But Xi-chun persisted in her fast, and her only thought now was to take the final step and cut off what remained of her hair. Landscape could bear it no longer, and went to tell Ladies Xing and Wang.
Im wondering now if you mightnt have fallen foul of some evil spirit, to have taken ill like this, maam? Patience was aware that Grannie Lius rustic superstitions were ill-timed, and gave her a meaningful tug from the rear. The old dame interpreted this correctly and fell silent. But her words had in fact found an echo in Xi-fengs own thoughts. Grannie, dear, she said, speaking with a great effort, youre a lady with years of experience, and what you say is true. Did you know that Aunt Zhao had died too? You met her when you were here, didnt you? Holy Name! exclaimed the old lady in the greatest Surprise. Fancy her dying, just like that! She was such a sturdy body. And shed a young son if I recall - what will become of him? Hell be all right, Patience consoled her. He still has the Master and Lady Wang to look after him. Thats as may be, replied Grannie Liu gravely. But can you be so sure, miss? I mean, its his own mother - however bad she may have been - as has died. Nobody can ever take a mothers place. This coincided with another of Xi-fengs keenest anxieties, and she broke down and began sobbing. They all rallied round to comfort her. When Qiao-jie heard her mother in such distress, she came to the kang, held her hand and burst into tears herself. Have you said hello to Grannie Liu? asked Xi-feng tearfully. No, Mama. She gave you your name, and is like a foster-mother to you. Give her a curtsey now. Qiao-jie went across to Grannie Liu and was about to curtsey when Grannie Liu seized her and said Holy Precious Name! Dont you go weighing me down with such honours - itll carry me to my grave! Miss Qiao-jie, its over a year since I last was here do you still remember me? Of course I do! That time when I saw you in the Garden I was still a very little girl. But I remember two years ago I asked you to bring me some big crickets. I can see you havent brought me any. You must have forgotten. Oh missie! exclaimed Grannie Liu. What a silly old soul I am! If you want crickets weve enough and to spare at home. But you never come and visit us. If you came, you could bring home a cartload of crickets if you so wanted. In that case, put in Xi-feng, why not take her home with you for a visit? How could I possibly, maam? said Grannie Liu laughing. Such a fine gentle young lady thats grown up wrapped in silks and satins and used to dainty things to eat - why, what would I give her to play with at home? What would I feed her with? Would you have me die of shame? She cackled and went on Mind you, I could act as a matchmaker for the young lady. Ours may only be a village, but weve wealthy folk there all the same, with land that spreads for thousands of acres around and hundreds of cattle and a fair bit of money too. Nothing to compare with the treasure youve got here, of course. In fact come to think of it youd probably not so much as glance at such folk really, maam. But to us country people theyre dwellers in heaven! By all means go ahead and propose the match, said Xi-feng. I should be only too pleased to give Qiao-jie in marriage to such a family. Come, maam, you must be joking. Why, I dare say youd be fussy about some great official family that lived in a big mansion, let alone simple country people. And even if you were willing, I hardly think Their Ladyships would be! Qiao-jie found the conversation embarrassing and had gone off somewhere to talk to Qing-er. The two girls were soon chatting away together, and gradually struck up a friendship. Patience was worried that Grannie Lius endless ramblings would wear Xi-feng out, and presently she took her aside and said Speaking of Her Ladyship, you still havent been to call on her. Ill find someone to take you over there. It would be a great pity not to see her now that youre here. Grannie Liu was about to set off, but Xi-feng called her back Whats the great hurry? Sit down, I want to talk to you. Tell me how things have been at home. Grannie Liu thanked Xi-feng profusely for her kind concern. If it werent for your help, maam, she began, pointing at Qing-er, her ma and pa would have starved to death by now.
He described how Bao Yong had given chase and had killed one of the robbers, and concluded by saying that the facts had already been laid before the police and civil authorities. Jia Zheng listened to all this aghast, while the ladies, who overheard with horror from the inner room, were also too shocked to speak and could only sob loudly. Eventually Jia Zheng composed himself sufficiently to ask What sort of an inventory has been made of the stolen items? Jia Yun None of the servants knew what was there, so the inventory has not been made yet. Jia Zheng A good thing too. After the confiscation, if we were to include things of value in the inventory, wed be guilty of a further infringement of the law. Tell Lian to come here at once. Jia Lian had gone with Bao-yu and some of the other young male Jias to make offerings in a different part of the temple, and hurried back on receiving Jia Zhengs summons. The news put him in a state of extreme agitation, and in front of Jia Zheng he began cursing and swearing at Jia Yun Miserable wretch! I entrust you with an important responsibility, and expect you to organize the night-watch properly, and look what you have gone and done! Are you half-dead or something? Im amazed you have the nerve to come here at all! He spat in his face. Jia Yun stood there with his hands hanging at his sides, not daring to breathe a word. Jia Zheng to Jia Lian Swearing at him wont achieve anything. Jia Lian falling to his knees What are we to do? Jia Zheng Theres nothing we can do, except wait and hope that the authorities apprehend the thieves. The trouble is we never opened any of Grandmothers boxes. When you came to me for money, I thought it improper to start taking her silver when shed only been dead a few days. I decided to wait until after the funeral and to settle all our accounts at once and invest any surplus in trust-estates here and in the South. So we dont even know exactly what she had left. Now the police want an inventory, and we can hardly include anything of value on it but at the same time well never get away with sundry quantities of gold and silver and various items of clothing and jewellery. Come on, what are you still kneeling down there for, you useless creature! Jia Lian did not dare say a word, but rose to his feet and began walking out of the room. Jia Zheng Where are you off to now? Jia Lian retraced his steps. I thought I should go home at once and try to sort this out properly. There was a hm from Jia Zheng signifying, I should think so too, and Jia Lian hung his head abjectly. Jia Zheng Report first to your mother. When you go home, take one or two of Grandmothers maids with you. Tell them to think carefully, and produce something in the way of an inventory... Jia Lian knew that Faithful had been in charge of all Grandmother Jias personal effects, and that now she was dead it would be useless to ask Pearl or the other maids to remember. But he hadnt the nerve to contradict Jia Zheng, and responding docilely to his instructions, he went to the inner room, where he had to endure the reproaches of Ladies Xing and Wang, and was then ordered to hurry home and bid the women on night-duty prepare themselves for their mistresses wrath. Assuring his mother and aunt with a somewhat ill grace that he would do as they commanded, Jia Lian went out and ordered one of his men to hire a carriage for Amber and Grandmother Jias other maids, while he himself mounted a mule and hastened home with a few of his pages. Jia Yun had no stomach for further confrontations with Jia Zheng, and he sneaked out in a sort of sideways slither, mounted horse and caught up with Jia Lian. Their ride into town passed uneventfully. Jia Lian was greeted at Rong-guo House by Steward Lin, who led him into Grandmother Jias apartment, where they found Xi-feng and Xi-chun waiting. Seething as he was with bitterness towards them both, Jia Lian restrained himself and turned to ask Lin Have the authorities had a look yet? Lin kneeling guiltily Both the police and the civil authorities have made an inspection, sir. They discovered the burglars tracks, and examined the corpse. Jia Lian with considerable surprise What corpse? Steward Lin told him how Bao Yong had killed one of the burglars, and that the dead man showed a strong resemblance to Zhou Ruis adopted son. Jia Lian Send for Jia Yun!
Jia Rong, who is too young to have been involved in these affairs, is acquitted. Jia Zheng has for many years held provincial posts in which he has served conscientiously and prudently, and he is absolved from the consequences of his failure to govern his household correctly. Jia Zheng responded to the Edict with tears of gratitude, and hastily kowtowed, first in the direction of the Imperial throne, then towards the prince, whom he begged to convey to the Emperor a humble plea of devotion. A simple kowtow will suffice, said the prince. There is no need of anything further. My gratitude to His Majesty, for so graciously absolving me of blame, and for restoring my portion of the family property, knows no bounds, said Jia Zheng. I feel a great sense of inner remorse. Please allow me to donate to the Imperial purse all my hereditary emoluments and accumulated property. His Majesty is indeed humane and compassionate towards His subjects, replied the prince. He is wise and discriminating in his judgements, and never errs, whether it be in recompensing virtue or in punishing vice. In having your property thus restored, you have been blessed with his exceptional favour. There is really no call for any further gesture on your part. The other gentlemen present concurred. So Jia Zheng kowtowed again, first towards the Emperor and then to the prince, and left the Palace, hurrying home to hear the news to Grandmother Jia, knowing the anxious suspense in which she would be awaiting his return. The entire Jia household, menfolk and womenfolk, were waiting anxiously at the entrance of Rong-guo House to learn the outcome of his interview, and breathed a huge sigh of relief when they saw him return safely home. None dared to question him as he hurried past them and on into Grandmother Jias apartment. He recounted to her the details of the latest Edict and Grandmother Jia, though pleased that some of the charges had been dropped, was understandably distressed to learn that the two titles were lost to the family and that both Jia She and Cousin Zhen were sentenced to penal servitude. Lady Xing and You-shi simply broke down when they heard the news. You must not distress yourself Mother, pleaded Jia Zheng. Al-though Brother She will have to work at the Mongolian frontier post, he will still be serving the nation, and will not be maltreated. If he acquits himself creditably, he may be fully reinstated. As for Zhen, he is still a young man and a bit of hard work certainly wont do him any harm. This is a lesson we would have had to learn sooner or later. We cannot rest for ever on the laurels of our forefathers. He added a few more words of this kind, which comforted Grandmother Jia. After all, she had never been particularly fond of Jia She, and Cousin Zhen was not her own grandson. But Lady Xing and You-shi were inconsolable. We are ruined! thought Lady Xing to hersel With my husband sent into exile in his old age, who can I turn to? Lian is supposed to be my son, but he has always attached himself more to his uncle Zheng than to his own father. Now that we are all dependent on Zheng, Lian and Xi-feng are bound to lean even more towards that side of the family. I shall be completely abandoned I have nothing to look forward to but loneliness and misery for the rest of my days. You-shi had always been in charge of Ning-guo House, and apart from Cousin Zhen she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff. She and Cousin Zhen had a happy marriage moreover. Now he was to be sent away in disgrace, every-thing they had was confiscated, and they would be obliged to look to the Rong-guo branch for support. Grandmother Jia loved her well enough, but still, she would be the recipient of charity, and she would have to bring Lovey and Dove along with her, not to mention young Rong and his wife, who were still too young to be independent. It was really Lians fault that my sisters came to such a wretched end, she reflected. And yet he and Xi-feng have survived unscathed, while we are reduced to this desperate state of affairs. Grandmother Jia was greatly affected by You-shis disconsolate sobbing, and she turned to Jia Zheng and asked him Now that their sentence has been pronounced, will your brother She and young Zhen be allowed to come home to say goodbye? Rong has been acquitted, so I assume that he will be set free. In the normal course of events such a visit would not be allowed, replied Jia Zheng.
Bravo! they cried and set to again. Next to lose was one of the girls. She sang a song called Little Miss Glamorous. Then it was Xing De-quan. Everyone wanted a song from him, but he protested that he was tone-deaf Ill tell a joke instead. If nobody laughs, Jia Qiang warned him, youll have to pay another forfeit. Xing downed his cup and began his story Ladies and gentlemen once upon a time, in a certain village, there were two temples - a big one, dedicated to the Great Lord of the North, and by its side a smaller one, dedicated to the Village God. The Great Lord was always inviting the Village God over for a chat. One day something was stolen from his temple, and he asked the Village God to look into the matter. But there are no thieves in this district, protested the lesser deity. It must be carelessness on the part of one of your door-gods. Someone must have sneaked in past them and stolen these things. Nonsense! replied the Great Lord. Youre in charge round these parts. If theres been a theft, then youre responsible. Whats the meaning of this? You should be trying to catch the thief, not accusing my door-gods of being careless! What I meant by careless, prevaricated the Village God, was that your temple must have been badly sited - you know, the Dragon Lines must be at fault I had no idea you could read fengshui, commented the Great Lord in a tone of disbelief. Allow me to take a look for you, offered the Village God, and see what I can see. He walked around the temple, peering into every nook and cranny, and after a while reported My Lord, behind your throne there is a double-leaved red door. An unfortunate oversight. Personally I have a good solid brick wall behind my throne, so naturally I never have things stolen. You can easily remedy the present situation by having a wall built in place of the door. This seemed plausible to the Great Lord, and he instructed his door-gods to call in builders and put up a wall. But we cant even afford a single candle or stick of incense in this temple! moaned the door-gods. How can we possibly buy bricks and mortar and hire the labour to build a wall? The Great Lord could think of no solution. He ordered them to find one, but they were stumped too. Just then the Tortoise General, whose recumbent stone form lay at the Great Lords feet, stood up and said Youre a useless lot! Ive got an idea pull down the red door, and use my belly to block up the doorway. Im sure that will do the job perfectly well. An excellent plan! cried the door-gods in chorus. Convenient, dependable and free! So the Tortoise General became Rear Wall, and peace prevailed - for a while. Then things began to disappear from the temple again. The door-gods summoned the Village God and complained You guaranteed our security if we built a wall, but look whats happened! Weve got a wall and still we re losing things! Your wall cant be solid enough. Have a look at it for yourself, they insisted. The Village God went and did so. It certainly seemed a solid enough wall. All most puzzling. Then he felt it with his hand. Aaah! he exclaimed. No wonder! I meant a properly built wall. Any old thief could push down this false wall jia qiang. They all laughed, even Jia Qiang, whose name had provided the raw material for the joke. Come on, Dumbo! he protested. Be fair! I never called you names! Drink a forfeit, theres a boy! Dumbo, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, willingly complied. They all had a few more cups, and in the general state of intoxication Dumbo let fly a few barbed remarks about his sister Lady Xing, while Wang Ren had a go at desecrating the memory of his Xi-feng, both of them evincing great bitterness. Their example and the wine lent Jia Huan a little courage, and he too had his fling, complaining how heartless Xi-feng had been, and how she had tried to ruin so many of their lives. Yes, people ought to show a bit of common decency, they all agreed. The way she used Lady Jias influence to bully everyone was dreadful. Well, she died without giving birth to an heir she only ever had a daughter. Retribution in her own lifetime! Jia Yun, who remembered only too well how harsh Xi-feng had once been towards him, and how Qiao-jie had started bawling the instant she set eyes on him, allowed himself to wade into the general melee with some abuse of his own about the two of them.
asked Li. Jia Zheng confided to Li his anxiety about the report in the Gazette. Dont you worry too much about that, sir, said Li. In fact, if you ask me, Mr Xue was quite lucky. Back in the capital I heard that he invited a lot of women along to that very inn and that they were all there together getting drunk and causing quite a rumpus on the very evening when he beat this waiter to death. And I heard that the local mandarin was not the only one to do the family a favour. Apparently Mr Lian spent a small fortune on the case, and sent bribes to every yamen concerned, to try to get Mr Pan off. Its funny the Board hasnt mentioned that in its report. I suppose in one way its only to be expected. Now this affair has come to light, the people involved must all be busy covering up for each other. Theyre trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet. They want to make it seem like a minor case of negligence. Then the worst that can happen to them is that theyll lose their jobs. Theyd never want to admit to bribes being taken. Much too serious. Dont you worry about this one, sir, Ill get hold of the inside story. Wed best not keep the Viceroy waiting any longer ... You dont understand, said Jia Zheng. Its the local magistrate I feel sorry for. For doing us this favour, he has forfeited his job. And that may not even he the end of it for him. It wont do any good worrying about him, sir, said Li. Your attendants have been waiting for a long time. Youd best be going in to see the Viceroy now, sir. To learn what it was the Viceroy wanted of Jia Zheng, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 100 Caltrop disturbs an elaborate seduction and inspires bitter resentment Bao-yu learns of a distressing betrothal and laments an imminent departure Jia Zheng was with the Viceroy for a long time, and outside the yamen speculation mounted as to the reason for the summons. Li Ten, in the absence of any information, assumed that his master was wanted in connection with this latest trouble in the Gazette, and feared the worst. At last the interview was over, and Li hurried forward to meet Jia Zheng and accompany him home. He was too impatient to wait until their return, and as soon as they were alone he asked Jia Zheng What kept you so long, sir? Something of great importance, I suppose? Jia Zheng smiled. Not really. It turns out that the Commandant of the Haimen region, who has offered his sons hand in marriage to my daughter, is himself related to the Viceroy, and has written asking him to take a special interest in my well-being. The Viceroy was most affable, and even went so far as to say to me Now we are related too! Li rejoiced inwardly, seeing in this new turn of events cause to be bolder still in his own schemes. He encouraged Jia Zheng enthusiastically to proceed with the marriage. Communications between Kiangsi and the capital were slow, and it was hard for Jia Zheng to know whether or not he was personally implicated in Xue Pans troubles. At such a great distance it would be difficult for him to influence the course of events in Xue Pans favour. When he returned to his own yamen, he despatched a family servant to the capital to ascertain exactly what had happened, and at the same time to carry a message to Grandmother Jia, informing her of the marriage proposal. If she agreed, he suggested that Tan-chun should be sent straight away to join him, in preparation for the wedding. The servant set off with all speed for the capital. He reported first to Lady Wang, and then went to the Board of Civil Office, where his enquiries revealed that the only person to have suffered in the Xue Pan affair was the acting magistrate of Tai-ping, who had lost his job, and that Jia Zheng was not in any way implicated. The servant sent back a reassuring report to Jia Zheng, himself remaining behind to await further developments. It will be remembered to what lengths Aunt Xue had gone, and with what large sums of money she had bribed the various courts involved, to bring in a verdict of accidental homicide in the earlier stages of Xue Pans case. She had been proposing to raise the money for his fine by selling the family pawnshop business. Now when she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage. Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama!
So some of the time the side gate was closed, some of the time it was open - who could tell what was going on! I lay awake worrying about it till two in the morning, and then I heard shouts coming from the house here. So I called at the gate, but they wouldnt open up, and as the shouting was getting worse I broke the gate down and came in. I saw some men in the west courtyard, chased them and killed one of them. I only found out today that the place I was in was the courtyard of Miss Xi-chuns apartment. So the nun was there with her at the very time the burglary took place. She slipped out this morning before dawn. She must have been the one who let the burglars in. Shes the traitor in our midst! Who is that insolent fellow? asked Patience. How dare he use such language with Mrs Lian and Miss Xi-chun here inside? He mentioned the Zhen family, said Xi-feng. It must be that vile servant they palmed off on us. Xi-chun had heard and understood Bao Yong only too clearly, and felt more wretched than ever as a consequence. Wasnt there something about a nun in his babblings? Xi-feng continued, turning to Xi-chun. How did you come to have a nun staying with you? Where did she spring from? Xi-chun told her that Adamantina had visited her, and that she had stayed on to play Go and keep her company during the night. Oh, Adamantina! exclaimed Xi-feng. How could she possibly have betrayed us! What a ridiculous idea! But still, it would be most unfortunate if this loathsome creatures accusations ever reached Sir Zhengs ears. The more Xi-chun thought about the possible consequences for Adamantina the more distressed she became. She rose to leave, but Xi-feng, though anxious herself to return to her own apartment, feared that Xi-chun might do something rash in her present state, and asked her to wait a little. Before we go, we must make sure they have sorted whats left of Grandmothers belongings and we must set a watch. Patience But nothing can be sorted before the authorities carry out their inspection. Till then we should leave everything as it is. Has anyone been sent to inform Sir Zheng? Xi-feng Youd better send one of the serving-women to find out. Presently the reply came back Steward Lin cant go himsel Most of the servants are needed to be in attendance for the inspection, and those that can be spared are incapable of explaining things clearly to the Master. So Young Master Yun has already gone. Xi-feng nodded, and sat down anxiously with Xi-chun to wait. The gang, who had been brought together by He San and his friend for the express purpose of burgling Rong-guo House, succeeded in laying their hands on a fair amount of gold, silver and valuables and had already passed it out before they were discovered. Even then they were able to see at a glance that their pursuers were nothing to be afraid of and therefore moved on to the west courtyard to investigate possibilities for burglary there. Through the window they spied two very attractive young ladies sitting together in the lamplight, one of whom was dressed in a nuns habit. Their baser instincts were immediately aroused, and they would have burst recklessly in had they not a moment later seen the figure of Bao Yong coming in hot pursuit. They then made a quick getaway, leaving the unfortunate He San behind to the fate we have already described, and reassembled afterwards in secret with their fence. The next day they learned that He San had been stopped and killed, and that the police and civil authorities had been alerted. It was no longer safe for them in town, and after some discussion they decided to make their way back without delay to their headquarters on the coast and rejoin their pirate friends. A general warrant for their arrest would soon be issued, after which it would be impossible for them to pass through the inspection posts. There was however one especially brazen character among them. Its all very well saying we ought to leave town, he said. But Ive still got my eye on that little nun. Beautiful little piece of work! I wonder which convent shes from, the luscious thing! Aiyo! exclaimed one of the others. Ive just remembered. She must be that nun who lives right on the premises, in Prospect Garden, in that place they call Green Bower Hermitage. Wasnt there a story going round a year or two ago about her and their Master Bao? She fell head over heels in love with him and in the end they had to call in the doctor. She must be the one!
Before Bao-chai could reply to this, Aroma put in her word I didnt really understand what Mrs Bao was saying about the sages of old. All I know is that weve all stuck with you through thick and thin since we were children, tending you with more devotion than I can say. Of course, I know thats only as it should be, but shouldnt you show us a little consideration in return? And look at the devotion Mrs Bao has shown to the Master and Her Ladyship, all for your sake! Even if you dont set great store by your marriage, surely you owe her a simple debt of gratitude for what she has done? As for all that stuff about immortality, thats just a lot of hot air. Who ever actually saw an immortal set foot in this world of ours? Some monk turns up from goodness knows where, talking a lot of rubbish, and you go and take him seriously! Youre an educated man, surely you dont give more weight to his words than you do to the Masters and Her Ladyships? Bao-yu bowed his head in silence. Aroma had more ammunition ready, but just then footsteps were heard outside, and a voice came through the window Is Uncle Bao at home? Bao-yu recognized Jia Lans voice, stood up and said pleasantly Come in! Jia Lan entered, his face wreathed in smiles. He paid his respects to Bao-yu and Bao-chai, and exchanged greetings with Aroma, before presenting Bao-yu with Jia Zhengs letter, which Ban-yu took from him and read. So my sister is coming back to town, then? Judging from the letter it seems more than likely, was Jia Lans reply. Bao-yu nodded his head in thoughtful silence, and Jia Lan continued You see at the end of the letter, Uncle Bao, Grandfather urges us to get down to some serious work. I dont suppose youve been doing many compositions recently, have you? Bao-yu laughed Id like to do a few, just to keep my hand in. Why not? May as well pull the wool over their eyes! In that case, suggested Jia Lan, why dont you propose a few themes, and well write them together. That will help us prepare for the exam. I certainly dont want to hand in a blank sheet and make a fool of us both. I know you will do nothing of the kind, said Bao-yu. Bao-chai asked Jia Lan to take a seat. Bao-yu sat down again himself in his original chair, while Jia Lan perched politely nearby, and they chatted for a while about their compositions, their conversation becoming quite animated. Bao-chai, seeing the two of them thus engrossed, discreetly withdrew, thinking to herself It almost seems as if Bao-yu may have seen the light. But I wonder what he meant just now by picking on my words never achieving anything else and repeating them so emphatically? She was still greatly puzzled. Aroma on the other hand was delighted to hear him talking about compositions and the examination. Praise be to Buddha! she exclaimed silently to herself What a sermon it took though, to bring him to his senses! The boys continued their discussion, and Oriole made them some tea. Jia Lan rose to his feet to receive his cup, and talked a little longer about the regulations governing the examination, adding that he would also like to invite Zhen Bao-yu over one day. Bao-yu seemed willing that he should do so. After a while, Jia Lan returned to his apartment, leaving Jia Zhengs letter behind with Bao-yu. Bao-yu read it through again, and with a smile on his lips went in and handed it to Musk to put away. Then he returned and removed his copy of Zhuang-zi from the table, collecting up at the same time some of his other favourite esoteric books a collection that included The Hermetic Clavicule, The Secret of the Primordial Flower and The Compendium of the Five Lamps. He gave instructions to Musk, Ripple and Oriole to store all of these away. Bao-chai was amazed to see him do this, and wished to sound out his true motives. Its very commendable of you to forgo reading such books, she said with a quizzical smile. But why do you have to move them out of sight altogether? Because now I understand, replied Bao-yu. None of those books is worth anything. It would be best to burn the lot and be rid of them once and for all! Bao-chai was delighted to hear him saying this. But the very next minute she heard him recite, as if to himself -1787 True Buddha Mind Within Is not in Sutras to be found Beyond the Crucible, There leads a path to Higher Ground.
This new evidence of Grandmother Jias affection was a much-needed tonic and it seemed that Lady Wang was not really so cross with her either, to judge from the fact that she had accompanied Grandmother Jia. And had Jia Lian not been acquitted, after all? Xifeng kowtowed to Grandmother Jia from her pillow Please dont worry on my behalf, Grannie. If I can continue to enjoy your blessing, and if I recover my health, Ill gladly be your lowliest maidservant and do any menial task, devote myself heart and soul for the rest of my life to serving you and Aunt Wang. This abject gratitude was too pitiful a sight for Grandmother Jia, and she broke down and wept. Bao-yu immediately followed suit. He had never witnessed anything resembling a family crisis. His life till recently had consisted for the most part of peaceful and pleasant pursuits, and he had been protected from too close an acquaintance with real suffering. But now wherever he turned he saw anguish and weeping. It had the effect of accentuating his imbecility and if he saw anyone else crying, he instantly responded by doing likewise. Seeing what low spirits her visitors were in, Xi-feng did her best to muster a few cheerful words, and then begged Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to return to their apartments, promising to come and kowtow to them as soon as she was well enough. She raised her head feebly from the pillow as she spoke. Look after her well now, Grandmother Jia enjoined Patience. And if youre short of anything, be sure to come and let me know. She took Lady Wang back with her to her own apartment. On the way, she could hear the sound of weeping coming from every quarter. It was more than she could bear. She sent Lady Wang away and told Bao-yu to bid his Uncle She and Cousin Zhen farewell and to return immediately afterwards. Left on her own, she sank onto her couch in tears. Faithful tried every way she knew of consoling her, and finally Grandmother Jia dozed off. Understandably Jia She and Cousin Zhen viewed the prospect of their exile with little relish. The men chosen to accompany them were equally reluctant to go, and complained bitterly of their lot. To be parted in life is in truth more painful than to be parted by death, and the witnessing of such a parting often more distressing than the parting itself. Rong-guo House, once a scene of such brilliance and distinction, now echoed with the sounds of wailing and lamentation. Jia Zheng had always been a great stickler for formalities, and despite everything he continued to observe towards Jia She the solemn respect prescribed towards an elder brother. The two brothers shook hands at home, and Jia Zheng then rode out ahead to beyond the city walls and there waited to drink the ritual farewell cup of wine. He exhorted Jia She to remember the compassion the state had shown him on his ancestors account, and to prove himself worthy of it. Jia She and Cousin Zhen wiped the tears from their eyes, and set off for their different destinations. Jia Zheng returned home with Bao-yu. As they neared the gateway of Rong-guo House they saw a crowd gathered outside and heard a confused hubbub of voices An Imperial Edict issued today! The Rong-guo hereditary rank and title to be passed on to Sir Zheng! The men in the crowd were demanding their statutory tip for bringing this good news, but the janitors were resisting vigorously The title belonged to the family in the first place, and was inherited by our masters. Thats not worth a tip! Come on! came the indignant reply. Think of the glory! A title like that is the most glorious thing there is - and your Sir She could never hope to get it back, not after what hes done. Now His Majesty, in his wisdom and mercy, greater than the sky is broad, has passed it on to Sir Zheng why, thats nothing less than a miracle for your family! Definitely worth a tip! Jia Zheng entered the house and received a full report on the matter from the janitors. His pleasure was inevitably mingled with shame that his own good fortune had been made possible only by his elder brothers disgrace. He was momentarily overwhelmed and wept tears of emotion. Then he hurried in to convey the news to Grandmother Jia, who took him delightedly by the hand and urged him to show himself worthy of this signal honour. Lady Wang was also present, anxious that Grandmother Jia might be souffrante and in need of consolation, and she too was delighted to hear Jia Zhengs news. Only Lady Xing and You-shi felt their own misfortune the more keenly, an emotion they took pains to conceal.
This deterioration continued daily, until he could no longer swallow medicine or water. Aunt Xue was there, and she and the other ladies in their frantic despair scoured the city for eminent physicians, without finding one that could diagnose the illness. Finally they discovered, lodging in a broken-down temple outside the city, a down-and-out practitioner by the name of Bi Zhi-an, who diagnosed it as a case of severe emotional shock, aggravated by a failure to dress in accordance with the seasons and by irregular eating habits, with consequent accumulation of choler and obstruction of the humours. In short, an internal disorder made worse by external factors. He made out a prescription in accordance with this diagnosis, which was administered that evening. At about ten oclock it began to take effect. Bao-yu began to show signs of consciousness and asked for water to drink. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and all the other ladies congregated round the sick-bed felt that they could at last have a brief respite from their vigil, and Aunt Xue was invited to bring Bao-chai with her to Grandmother Jias apartment to rest for a while. His brief access of clarity enabled Bao-yu to understand the gravity of his illness. When the others had gone and he was left alone with Aroma, he called her over to his side and taking her by the hand said tearfully Please tell me how Cousin Chai came to be here? I remember Father marrying me to Cousin. Lin. Why has she been made to go? Why has Cousin Chai taken her place? She has no right to be here! Id like to tell her so, but I dont want to offend her. How has Cousin Lin taken it? Is she very upset? Aroma did not dare tell him the truth, but merely said Miss Lin is ill. I must go and see her, insisted Bao-yu. He wanted to get up, but days of going without food and drink had so sapped his strength- that he could no longer move, but could only weep bitterly and say I know I am going to die! Theres something on my mind, something very important, that I want. you to tell Grannie for me. Cousin Lin and I are both ill. We are both dying. It will be too late to help us when we are dead but if they prepare a room for us now and if we are taken there before it is too late, we can at least be cared for together while we are still alive, and be laid out together when we die. Do this for me, for friendships sake! Aroma found this plea at once disturbing, comical and moving. Bao-chai, who happened to be passing with Oriole, heard every word and took him to task straight away. Instead of resting and trying to get well, you make yourself iller with all this gloomy talk! Grandmother has scarcely stopped worrying about you for a moment, and here you are causing more trouble for her. She is over eighty now and may not live to acquire a title because of your achievements but at least, by leading a good life, you can repay her a little for all that she has suffered for your sake. And I hardly need mention the agonies Mother has endured in bringing you up. You are the only son she has left. If you were to die, think how she would suffer! As for me, I am wretched enough as it is you dont need to make a widow of me. Three good reasons why even if you want to die, the powers above will not let you and you will not be able to. After four or five days of proper rest and care, your illness will pass, your strength will be restored and you will be yourself again. For a while Bao-yu could think of no reply to this homily. Finally he gave a silly laugh and said After not speaking to me for so long, here you are lecturing me. You are wasting your breath. Encouraged by this response to go a step further, Bao-chai said Let me tell you the plain truth, then. Some days ago, while you were unconscious, Cousin Lin passed away. With a sudden movement, Bao-yu sat up and cried out in horror It cant be true! It is. Would I lie about such a thing? Grandmother and Mother knew how fond you were of each other, and wouldnt tell you because they were afraid that if they did, you would die too. Bao-yu began howling unrestrainedly and slumped back in his bed. Suddenly all was pitch black before his eyes. He could not tell where he was and was beginning to feel very lost, when he thought he saw a man walking towards him and asked in a bewildered tone of voice Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am?
The future looks very bleak for her. The other day I was worried on her account and sent some of my women to call at the Sun home. Ying-chun was hiding in a side-room and wouldnt come out to see them. They insisted on going in, and found her freezing to death, poor thing, with nothing on but some threadbare old clothes. And it was a bitterly cold day! She broke down in front of them and begged them not to reveal her miserable plight to us at home. Its my fate to suffer like this, she said. And were not to send her any more clothes or food or anything. They never reach her, and her husband will only accuse her of complaining again and give her another beating. So you see, Mother, Ying may be close at hand, but the very closeness only makes her suffering harder for us to bear. Her mother turns a blind eye, and her father has refused to intervene at all. She is worse off than one of our lowest-grade maids! Although Tan is not my own daughter, Im sure Zheng wants to do the best for her. He has obviously seen the boy and must approve of him or he wouldnt be in favour of the match. So I hope youll agree, and then we can choose a lucky day for her to make the journey and send a proper escort to accompany her to Zhengs official residence. I am sure Zheng will see to it at his end that everything is done in a fitting manner. Very well then, Grandmother Jia concurred. Ill go along with Zhengs idea, and I leave it to you to make the necessary arrangements. Choose a suitable day in the almanac for travelling. There, the matter is settled now. Yes, Mother. Bao-chai heard all this clearly, and although she did not breathe a word of protest, she thought to herself sadly Tan is one of the very best of us. And now she is being married as well and sent away. One by one our numbers are dwindling. Seeing that Lady Wang had risen and was taking her leave, Baochai accompanied her out of the room and then returned immediately to her own apartment. She said nothing to Bao-yu of Tan-chuns engagement, but told Aroma later, when she found her sewing on her own. Aroma too was very unhappy at the news. Aunt Zhao, on the other hand, was positively delighted. The girls shown me nothing but disrespect, she thought to herself. No one would ever have guessed that I was her mother! I receive worse treatment at her hands than one of her maids! Shes always trying to better herself, and sides with anyone rather than her own mother or brother. With her in the way, Huan would never have been able to get anywhere. If her father has sent for her, then good riddance! Ive given up hoping for any respect from her. I hope shes as miserable as Ying is. Id be glad to see it happen. She hurried over to Tan-chuns apartment to offer her congratulations. You certainly are on your way up in the world, my dear! she crowed. Im sure life at your new home will be even more to your liking than it is here. You must be pleased. Now remember, I am your mother, for all the good its ever done me. So dont think of me as all bad. And dont forget about me altogether when youre gone. Tan-chun refused to respond to this display of Spite and kept her head bent silently over her needlework. Aunt Zhao was effectively snubbed and left the room in a state of high dudgeon. Tan-chun could see the ridiculous side of her mothers behaviour, but none the less it left her feeling both angry and wounded, and she sat for some time weeping quietly to herself. Eventually she walked out in a weary and dejected frame of mind, thinking she would like to drop in on Bao-yu. Tell me, Tan, he said, the moment she entered his apartment, I know that you were with Cousin Lin when she died, and that you heard music in the distance. Do you think there was some unexplained mystery behind it? Do you think Cousin Lin was really a fairy, and that at her death she was merely returning to her heavenly abode? Tan-chun smiled. That sounds like another of your fancies. It was a Strange night, though, thats certainly true and the music was unlike any that Ive ever heard before. Who knows, you may even be right. Bao-yu took this as confirmation of his hypothesis. He also recalled the words of the man he had encountered in his strange dream of a few months before, who had said that Dai-yu was no ordinary mortal and no ordinary shade, but a visitor from some immortal realm.
He wasnt going to be held back by what the family or friends might say, or by the paltry fact that Uncle Zi-sheng.doesnt really have a birthday until next winter. Let people think what they like, he doesnt care! He doesnt know the meaning of the word pride! Now, on top of all this, let me tell you why I got up so early this morning. Recently theres been a memorial from the Censorate. Its in some way connected with the recent disturbances on the coast. The wording refers to the deficit left by Wang Zi-teng after his term of office and asks that this deficit be made good by his younger brother Wang Zi-sheng and by his nephew Wang Ren. The two of them got the wind up and asked me to try to pull a few strings for them. I agreed to do it for them. They seemed so pathetic and scared, and anyway I was afraid it might eventually affect you and Aunt Wang. I hoped old Qiu in the Inner Palace might see to it for me, perhaps get Uncle Zi-tengs successor to cook the books somehow. But I was late, damn it, hed already left for court. So there I was, up at dawn, tearing around for nothing, while they put on plays and hold a party! If that isnt enough to make a mans blood boil, tell me what is! Xi-feng still felt she must put some sort of a case for her brother, partly out of her constitutional need never to admit defeat, and partly out of loyalty to her own family However badly he may have behaved, hes still your brother4n-law. If you help him, youll be doing a good turn for both of my uncles, for the living and the dead. Our family honour is at stake so I implore you to help. Otherwise you know what will happen I shall be held responsible for your wrath, and theyll blacken my name for ever. Xi-feng burst into tears. Sitting up in bed, she began to comb her hair, and to throw on some clothes. Theres no need for you to react like that, said Jia Lian. Its your brother whos behaved so abominably Ive said nothing against you. And the servants-- when I had to go out this morning, I knew you were not well, so I didnt disturb you. But they just went on sleeping. Our parents never tolerated such behaviour. Youve grown too slack. You want to please everybody, thats your trouble. And the moment I say anything critical, you start hauling yourself out of bed in protest. If I give the servants a piece of my mind, I suppose youll stick up for them next. Its too absurd! Xi-feng dried her eyes. Its late, she said. I ought to be getting up anyway. After a pause, she continued Even if thats how you feel, please try to do what you can for my family, for my sake. And you know how grateful Aunt Wang will be. All right, all right, grumbled Jia Lian. Stop teaching your grandmother to suck eggs. Why are you getting up, maam? put in Patience. Its too early yet. And I dont see what you have to work yourself into such a terrible temper for, sir! Why take it all out on us? Hasnt Mrs Lian gone to enough trouble for you in the past? The number of times shes borne the brunt on your behalf! Perhaps I shouldnt say this, but in view of all that shes done for you, it doesnt seem very fair to make such a big fuss about this one favour, especially when you think how many other people are involved. Do you have no consideration for her feelings? Why should she take all the blame anyway? We were late getting up, and youre entitled to be angry with us -were only servants after all. But when you think how she has worked herself into the ground and ruined her health, it seems so unkind of you to pick a quarrel with her now! Patiences eyes filled with tears. Jia Lians original ill humour, strong though it had undoubtedly been, could not withstand the combined opposition of both his womenfolk - at once so appealing and so sharp-tongued. All right, forget it, he said, with a bitter smile. Shes hard enough to cope with on her own, without you leaping to her defence. I know Im just an outsider here anyway, and youre both itching to have me dead and out of the way. Dont speak like that, said Xi-feng. Who knows what will happen to any of us? Very probably I shall die before you. The sooner I do, the sooner my heart will be at rest. She began to weep again, and Patience tried to comfort her. It was now broad daylight, and the sun was shining in at the window.
When she had learned earlier that day that Bao-yu and Bao-chai were to be married, the shock of knowing that what she had feared for so long was now about to come true, had thrown her into such a turmoil that at first she had quite taken leave of her senses. Now that she had brought up the blood, her mind gradually became clearer. Though at first she could remember nothing, when she saw Nightingale crying, Simples words slowly came back to her. This time she did not succumb to her emotions, but set her heart instead on a speedy death and final settlement of her debt with fate. Nightingale and Snowgoose could only stand by helplessly. They would have gone to inform the ladies, but were afraid of a repetition of the last occasion, when Xifeng had rebuked them for creating a false alarm. Ripple had already given all away, however, by the look of horror on her face when she returned to Grandmother Jias apartment. The old lady, who had just risen from her midday nap, asked her what the matter was, and in her shocked state Ripple told her all that she had just witnessed. What a terrible thing! exclaimed Grandmother Jia, aghast. She sent for Lady Wang and Xi-feng at once, and told them both the news. But I gave instructions to everyone to observe strict secrecy, said Xi-feng. Who can have betrayed us? Now we have another problem on our hands. Never mind that for the moment, said Grandmother Jia. We must first find out how she is. She took Lady Wang and Xi-feng with her to visit Daiyu, and they arrived to find her barely conscious, breathing in faint little gasps, her face bloodless and white as snow. After a while she coughed again. A maid brought the spittoon and they watched with horror as she spat out a mouthful of blood and phlegm. Dai-yu faintly opened her eyes, and seeing Grandmother Jia standing at her bedside, struggled to find breath to speak. Grandmother! Your love for me has been in vain. Grandmother Jia was most distraught. There now, my dear, you must rest. There is nothing to fear. Dai-yu smiled faintly and closed her eyes again. A maid came in to tell Xi-feng that the doctor had arrived. The ladies withdrew, and doctor Wang came in with Jia Lian. He took Dai-yus pulses, and said As yet, there is no cause for alarm. An obstruction of morbid humours has affected the. liver, which is unable to store the blood, and as a consequence her spirit has been disturbed. I shall prescribe a medicine to check the Yin, and to halt the flow of blood. I think all will be well. Doctor Wang left the room, accompanied by Jia Lian, to write out his prescription. Grandmother Jia could tell that this time Dai-yu was seriously ill, and as they left the room, she said to Lady Wang and Xi-feng I do not wish to sound gloomy or bring her bad luck, but I fear she has small hope of recovery, poor child. You must make ready her grave-clothes and coffin. Who knows, such preparations may even turn her luck. She may recover, which will be a mercy for us all. But it would be sensible anyway to be prepared for the worst, and not be taken unawares. We shall be so busy over the next few days. Xi-feng said she would make the necessary arrangements. Grandmother Jia then questioned Nightingale, but she had no idea who it was that had upset Dai-yu. The more she thought about it, the more it puzzled Grandmother Jia, and she said to Xi-feng and Lady Wang I can understand that the two of them should have grown rather fond of one another, after growing up together and playing together as children. But now that they are older and more mature, the time has come for them to observe a certain distance. She must behave properly, if she is to earn my love. Its quite wrong of her to think she can disregard such things. Then all my love will have been in vain! What you have told me troubles me. She returned to her apartment and sent for Aroma again. Aroma repeated to her all that she had told Lady Wang on the previous occasion, and in addition described the scene earlier that day between Dai-yu and Bao-yu. And yet, when I saw her just now, said Grandmother Jia, she still seemed able to talk sense. I simply cannot understand it. Ours is a decent family. We do not tolerate unseemly goings-on. And that applies to foolish romantic attachments. If her illness is of a respectable nature, I do not mind how much we have to spend to get her better.
Today this great blessing is mine, and lo, I see before me a reincarnation of the Great Bard, a second Li Bo! Zhen Bao-yu had also heard a great deal about his namesake, and found that the reality conformed pretty much to his expectations. He seems a passable companion in my studies, he thought to himself, but hardly someone to share my aspirations. And yet he has my name, and looks so like me we must be souls linked by some bond at the Rock of Rebirth. I have made some progress of late in the understanding of Higher Principles, and should therefore seek to impart to him something of what I have learned. Since this is only our first meeting, however, and since I am still ignorant where his sympathies lie, I should tread cautiously. He replied to Jia Bao-yus remarks in what he deemed to be a fitting vein Long have I known of your great gifts. I fear that, before a person of such egregious purity, refinement and grace, I am but an ordinary and foolish mortal, and that by sharing your name I do but tarnish its lustre. He seems a sympathetic enough character, pondered Jia Bao-yu upon hearing this. But why does he flatter me almost as if I were a girl? We are both of us men, and therefore creatures of impurity. Your praise is alas undeserved, he said. I am but a dull and foolish creature, a mere lump of senseless stone! How can I compare with a person of such quality and nobility as yourself? It is I who am unworthy of the name that we both bear. When I was young, mused Zhen Bao-yu aloud for his new friends benefit, I was blind to my own limitations and entertained ideas far above my station. But then my family fell on hard times, and we have all spent the past few years in greatly reduced circumstances. As a result, although I can hardly lay claim to a comprehensive experience of lifes vicissitudes, I feel I may have acquired some slight knowledge of the ways of the world, some meagre understanding of human nature. You, on the other hand, have lived in the lap of luxury all your life, you have lacked for nothing, and you have, I am sure, been able to achieve great distinction in your literary compositions and in the study of public affairs, a distinction that has caused your honourable father to hold you in high esteem, and to view you with great pride and affection. I say again, you are worthy of the fine name that we both bear. Jia Bao-yu recognized by now the telltale rhetoric of the career worm and fell silent, wondering how best to respond, while Jia Huan for his part began to feel uncomfortable at having been so entirely excluded from the conversation. Jia Lan, however, found Zhen Bao-yus little sermon most congenial You are altogether too modest, sir. Surely, in the fields of literary composition and public affairs of which you speak, it is precisely from long experience that true ability and knowledge are derived. I am of course too young to claim any knowledge of literary composition, but a careful perusal of the little that I have read has led me to the conclusion that external grace and meretricious refinement are of little worth when compared with the cultivation of a good character. Jia Bao-yu found his nephews remarks nauseatingly priggish, and wondered where on earth he had picked up this way of speaking. He attempted to forestall a reply in like vein from Zhen Bao-yu I had always understood from what I had heard of you that you condemned vulgar and commonplace notions, and had formed your own personal view of the world. I was so happy to have had this opportunity of meeting you today, and of learning from you something that would help me transcend this mortal realm we live in and enter a more spiritual plane. I felt sure that such an encounter would help to cleanse my heart of worldly desires, and open my eyes to a more profound view of life. Alas, it is clear from your words that you consider me a coarse creature, and have therefore treated me out of politeness to this rigmarole 6f worldly wisdom. Young Zhen reflected Clearly he has heard tales of me as a child, and therefore thinks that I was speaking out of mere politeness, masking my true nature. I must be frank with him. Who knows, he may even turn out to be a true friend. I fully appreciate the sincerity of your remarks, he began. When I was young, I too abhorred anything that smacked of the platitude and the cliche. But I grew older, and when my father resigned from his post and had little further inclination for social entertaining, the role of host devolved upon me. In the course of my duties I observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom I met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name.
He did not trouble any other relatives or friends. Now that Bao-yu had been given his orders to attend the next Civil Service examinations, Lady Wang began to apply more pressure and came constantly to see how his work was progressing, while Bao-chai and Aroma added their support in the form of periodic lectures. They observed the daily improvement in his spirits, b remained quite unaware that a great inner change had been wrought within him, drawing him in an unprecedented indeed for him almost perverse direction. In addition to his inveterate contempt for world success and advancement, he had of late begun to adopt an attitude of indifference towards the whole gamut of romantic attachmentin a word, towards love itself. But this radically new departure w hardly noticed by those around him, and he himself said nothing enlighten them. Nightingale was one of the few to detect the early symptoms this inner change, and she drew her own conclusions. She had j returned from accompanying Dai-yus coffin to the landing-stage and was sitting in her room brooding and weeping to herself. How cold-hearted Bao-yu is! It doesnt seem to have upset him in the slightest to see Miss Lins coffin taken away. He didnt so much as shed a single tear. He could see me crying my eyes out, and didnt even try to comfort me, but just stared at me and smiled. What a deceiver! All those fine things he used to say to us in the past were just meant to fool us. Thank goodness Id seen through him the other evening and didnt fall for it again! But theres still one thing I dont understand. He even seems to have become cold towards Aroma. I know Mrs Bao has never been a very warm 9r close person by nature - so she probably doesnt mind his change of heart. But what about Musk and the others, dont they feel hard done by? Theyve let their feelings make fools of them and have wasted half their lives over him, only to be forsaken like this! As she was brooding, she saw Fivey coming towards her. Youre not still weeping for Miss Lin, are you? asked Fivey, seeing Nightingales tear-stained face. If you want my opinion of Mr Bao, I think its high time we forgot about his reputation, and looked at what he really is. I was always being told how kind he was, especially towards girls. Thats why my mother tried so hard to get me into service with him. Since then Ive waited on him from the beginning of this illness of his. But now that hes better, I havent had so much as a kind word from him! In fact he wont even acknowledge my existence! Nightingale burst out laughing at this comical tale of woe. Pshh! Why, hark at you, you little vixen! she exclaimed. How do you want Mr Bao to treat you? Really, you should be ashamed of yourself! When hes not even interested in the maids that are closest to him, do you expect him to find time for you? She laughed again and drew a reproving finger across Fiveys face. What kind of a niche are you carving out for yourself in Bao-yus affections? Fivey blushed at her own foolishness. She was on the point of explaining that it wasnt so much her own treatment at Bao-yus hands that was worrying her as his whole attitude towards the maids, when they heard someone calling from outside The monk is back! And hes demanding his ten thousand taels! Her Ladyship doesnt know what to do and wanted Mr Lian to go and talk with him, but Mr Lians not at home! The monk is outside, ranting and raving. Her Ladyship wants Mrs Bao to go over and consult with her. To learn how they placated the monk, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 117 Two fair damsels conspire to save the jade, and forestall a flight from earthly bondage An infamous rogue takes charge of the mansion, and assembles a gang of cronies Lady Wang sent for Bao-chai to consult with her, while Bao-yu, hearing that the monk was outside, rushed to the front courtyard on his own. Where is my Master? he shouted. Finally, as there was no sign of the monk there, he went outside, where he found his groom Li Gui barring the monks way. My mother bids me invite His Reverence in, said Bao-yu. Li Gui relaxed his grip, and the monk went swaggering in. Bao-yu observed at once the resemblance between this monk and the guide in his dream, and the truth began to grow clearer in his mind. He bowed Master, please forgive your disciple for being so slow in welcoming you. I have no desire to be entertained, said the monk.
Well search the west One of Xi-chuns old women, hearing familiar voices, called out from inside Some of them have climbed up on our roof! Look! cried the night-watchmen. There they are! Up there! A confused hubbub ensued, several tiles came hurtling down from the roof, and none of the watchmen had the courage to climb in pursuit. They were all standing there rather helplessly when a fresh burst of noise came from the direction of the side gate to the Garden, followed by the sound of the gate itself being broken down, and in stormed a great hefty fellow with a wooden club in his hand. They all tried to hide, without any success. We must stop them all, every one of them! bellowed the new arrival. Follow me! They stood there paralysed with fear, while the club-wielding man continued to harangue them. One of the more perspicacious among them finally identified him as Bao Yong, and gradually the others regained their nerve and began saying shakily One of the thieves managed to escape altogether! But some of them are still up on the roo The instant Bao Yong heard this, he vaulted up onto the roof and went in hot pursuit. After the main part of their mission was accomplished, the thieves, knowing how unprotected the Jia mansion was, had been casually snooping around in Xi-chuns courtyard, and had caught a glimpse there of a very attractive young nun, which had put all sorts of mischievous ideas into their heads. They knew that the apartment was unguarded save by a handful of scared old women, and were about to kick the door in and put an abrupt end to Adamantinas meditations when they heard the sound of footsteps coming from outside and escaped onto the roof-top. They soon saw that they outnumbered their pursuers and had decided to fight it out when a man leapt up onto the roof and came after them. He was on his own and they therefore moved into the attack with short swords, only to find themselves quickly outmatched. With a few powerful and deftly placed strokes of his club, Bao Yong had soon despatched one of them off the roof, while the rest fled over the wall into the Garden, where others of the gang had been stationed to receive the stolen goods. These now drew their swords in defence of the returning party, and seeing there was only one man following them, they closed in on him. Petty thieves! stormed Bao Yong. Do you dare to do battle with me? They knocked one of us down! exclaimed one of the gang. He may not even be alive, but wed better try to get him out! Bao Yong moved into the attack, and four or five of the thieves formed a ring around him, brandishing their swords in a confused m6lee, which finally broke up when some of the night-watchmen plucked up enough courage to come to Bao Yongs aid, and the outnumbered thieves made good their escape. Bao Yong, still in hot pursuit, tripped over some unseen obstacle lying on the roof, and when he clambered to his feet and saw that it was a chest, he deduced that the thieves had failed to take their loot with them, and therefore abandoned his pursuit. They must anyway be well ahead and beyond reach by now, he reflected. He told the servants to fetch lights. On closer inspection he discovered that there were several chests and that they were all empty. He gave orders for them to be removed and himself headed back to the main apartment. His lack of familiarity with the lay-out of the mansion caused him to wander into Xi-fengs apartment, where all the lights were ablaze. Have the thieves been here? he asked. We havent opened the doors, came Patiences trembling voice from within. But we heard cries from the main apartments - youd better go there. Bao Yong had no sense of direction, but he saw the other watchmen in the distance and followed them to the main apartment, where he found doors and windows thrown open and the women on night-duty sobbing. Presently Jia Yun and Steward Lin arrived, appalled by the news of the burglary. They found Grandmother Jias door wide open and could see by the lamplight that the lock had been wrenched open and the chests and cupboards inside had all been broken apart. There were curses for the women on night-duty Are you all half-dead? Didnt you even know there were thieves in the house? Theres a roster for night-duty, came the tearful reply, and were on second and third watches. We never stopped on our rounds, we checked front and back. The thieves came during the fourth and fifth watches, just after we finished duty. We heard the shouting, but couldnt see anyone, and when we came to look, the things had already gone.
She did not dare say anything out loud, but whispered Mr Bao, please go ahead and rinse your mouth! He smiled and took the cup in his hand. She could not tell whether he ever did rinse his mouth or not, as the next she knew he was giggling and asking her Werent you friends with Skybright? Fivey didnt understand what he was getting at. Of course. We were all of us on good terms. Bao-yu lowered his voice to a whisper When Skybright was so very ill, I went to visit her. You were there, werent you? Fivey smiled and nodded her head. Did you hear her say anything? asked Bao-yu. No, replied Fivey, shaking her head. Bao-yu held Fiveys hand. He seemed to be completely carried away. She blushed fiercely and her heart missed a beat. Mr Bao! she whispered. Whatevers on your mind, just go ahead and say it. But please stop behaving like this. Bao-yu let go of her hand. If Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently Thats what Skybright said. Surely you must have heard? It seemed quite plain to Fivey what manner of different behaviour he had in mind. She felt she must protest If thats what she said, she should have been ashamed of herself! No decent girl would suggest a thing like that! Dont you start preaching at me too! snapped Bao-yu irritably. I was thinking how like Skybright you looked - thats the only reason I told you what she said. How dare you slander her! Fivey could no longer discern Bao-yus true intentions. Its late, she said. You really should go to sleep and not sit up like this. You might catch cold. Didnt you hear what Mrs Bao and Aroma said just now? Im not cold, said Bao-yu. As he said this, it suddenly struck him that Fivey was most inadequately clad, and that she might catch a chill just as Skybright had done. Why arent you wearing a proper robe? he asked her. You called, and it sounded important, she replied. I was hardly going to take time off to dress! I would have, mind you, if Id kndwn you were going to keep me talking this long. Bao-yu handed Fivey the pale blue silken padded jacket that was lying on the bed, and told her to put it on. But she refused. You keep it - Im not cold. And anyway, Ive a perfectly good robe of my own. She went across to her bed and put on a long robe. She listened out for a moment. Musk was sound asleep. She crossed slowly back to Bao-yu I thought you were supposed to be having a quiet night? Bao-yu smiled. To tell you the truth, that was never my intention. Actually, I was hoping to meet a fairy... His words strengthened her suspicions. Who do you mean? Ill tell you if you like, he replied. But its a long story. Youd better come up here and sit next to me... But youre all tucked up in bed! she protested, blushing again and smiling coyly. How can I possibly sit next to you? Why not? One night a year or two ago, when the weather was cold and Skybright stayed up to play a trick on Musk, I was afraid she was going to catch a chill, so I tucked her under my quilt to keep her warm. Whats wrong with it? People shouldnt be so prudish. Fivey thought he was merely putting ideas into her head. She did not know that he sincerely meant every word he said. She contemplated her dilemma. She could hardly escape and yet if she remained, it would be equally awkward for her to remain standing or to sit down beside him. She gave him a little glance and her face puckered into a smile Dont say such silly things! People might hear. No wonder you have such a reputation. How can you still need to go flirting, with two such beautiful ladies as Mrs Bao and Aroma by your side! Dont you ever suggest such a thing again, or Ill report you to Mrs Bao. And then youll have cause to be ashamed! As she was speaking there was a sudden noise outside, which startled them both, and shortly afterwards Bao-chai could be heard coughing in the inner room. Bao-yu made a quick motion with his lips, and Fivey hurriedly extinguished the lamp and stole back to bed. In fact, earlier that evening, both Bao-chai and Aroma had gone straight to sleep, exhausted after their previous sleepless night and the days exertions, and both of them had slept soundly through this conversation between Bao-yu and Fivey.
Bao-chai chided him with a smile. Mine was simply an off-the-cuff explanation for the wording of the oracle. Theres really no need to take it seriously. Youre as bad as Xiu-yan. When you lost your jade, she asked Adamantina to consult the planchette, and the answer was totally unintelligible to everyone but that didnt stop Xiu-yan from talking to me in private about Adamantinas amazing powers of clairvoyance, saying how enlightened and advanced she was in her Zen practice. And yet look at this calamity thats befallen Adamantina now - why couldnt she have predicted that? What sort of clairvoyance is that supposed to be? Just because I said something once about Cousin Feng, that doesnt mean I ever claimed to see into her future, or into my own for that matter. Claims of that sort are fantastic and dont deserve to be taken seriously. All right, said Bao-yu, lets drop the subject. Tell me about Xiu-yan instead. Weve been so busy that her wedding seems to have passed us by altogether. That was an important event for your family, and yet it was celebrated with so little ceremony. Didnt you even invite any relatives and friends? Youve missed the point again, replied Bao-chai. My own familys dosest relatives are the Jias and the Wangs. Theres no one respectable left in the Wang family now, and the Jias werent invited because my mother knew wed be too busy with Grandmothers funeral. Lian lent a hand, and one or two other relations came - but you wouldnt know about that, as you werent there. If you think about it, things were much the same for Xiu-yan as they were for me. She was formally engaged to Cousin Ke, and Mama wanted a stylish wedding. But in the first place, Pan was still in gaol, so Cousin Ke wanted to keep it simple then there was Grandmothers funeral and Xiu-yan was having such a hard time at Aunt Xings, especially after the confiscation, when Aunt Xing became Stingier than ever. Poor Xiu-yan, she could hardly bear it. I talked to Mama, and in the end she decided to go ahead and make do with a simple ceremony. Xiu-yan seems a lot happier now and she is so good to Mama, far better than her real daughter-in4aw ever was. Shes a wonderful wife to Ke, and gets on very well with Caltrop. If Ke has to be away for some reason, the two of them still manage very happily together. They are a bit hard up, but Mama is a great deal more relaxed than she used to be. She still gets upset about Pan, and hes always writing to her from gaol and asking for more money. But luckily Cousin Ke has been able to collect some of the debts that were owing, and has sent Pan the money from that. Some of our town properties have had t6 be mortgaged too. We still have one house left, and thats where Mama is planning to move now. Whats the need? protested Bao-yu. Its so much more convenient for you to have them living close by. If they move so far away, it will be a whole days expedition to visit them. Even when families are as closely related as ours, said Bao-chai, its really much better in the long run to be independent. Mama cant go on for ever living on charity. Bao-yu was about to expand on the reasons for their not moving when a final message came from Lady Wang, to say that Xi-feng passed away, and all the family had now arrived in her apartmen Would Bao-yu and Bao-chai please join them there? Bao-yu his foot and seemed about to burst into tears. Bachai too deeply moved, but controlled herself for fear of upsetting Bao-yu any further. We should keep our tears for later, she counselled. They both made their way directly to Xi-fengs room, where they found a weeping throng gathered. Bao-chai went forward to bedside, where Xi-fengs body was already laid out, and gave a great cry of grief. Bao-yu held Jia Lians hand and sobbed loudly, which set Jia Lian off again. Patience, seeing that no one else was capable of offering an? comfort, stepped forward, and tried to mask her own grief and urge moderation. Sounds of inconsolable weeping continued to fill the room none the less. Jia Lian was in a helpless dither. He sent for Lai Da, and told him to make whatever preparations were necessary for the funeral.
What hateful creatures they are! She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet within. Suddenly she realized Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where? She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yus page boy Inky rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale? I heard that Master Bao was getting married, replied Nightingale, and I wanted to watch some of the fun. But I can see Ive come to the wrong place. And I dont know when the wedding is taking place, either. If I tell you, said Inky in a confidential tone, you must promise not to tell Snowgoose. Weve been given orders not to let any of you know. The weddings to be tonight. Of course its not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside another apartment. Whats the matter? continued Inky, after a pause. Nothing, replied Nightingale. You can go now. Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and clenching her teeth, she said fiercely Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous way but when you are happily married, and have your hearts desire, you neednt think you can look me in the face again! As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the Garden. She was not far from the Naiads House, when she saw two junior maids standing at the gate, peeping out nervously. They saw her coming, and one of them cried out Theres Miss Nightingale! At last! Nightingale could see that all was not well. Gesturing to them anxiously to be silent, she hurried in, to find Dai-yu red in the face, the fire from her liver having risen upwards and inflamed her cheeks. This was a dangerous sign, and Nightingale called Dai-yus old wet-nurse, Nannie Wang, to come and take a look. One glance was enough to reduce this old woman tears. Nightingale had turned to Nannie Wang as an older person, who could be expected to lend them some courage in this extremity. But she turned out to be quite helpless, and only made Nightingale more distraught than before. Suddenly she thought of someone else she could turn to, and sent one of the younger maids to fetch her with all speed. Her choice might seem a strange one but Nightingale reasoned that as a widow, Li Wan would certainly be excluded from Bao-yus wedding festivities. Besides she was in general charge of affairs in the Garden, and it would be in order to ask her to come. Li Wan was at home correcting some of Jia Lans poems, when the maid came rushing frantically in and cried Mrs Zhu! Miss Lins dying! Everyone over there is in tears! Li Wan rose startled to her feet and without a word set off at once for the Naiads House, followed by her maids Candida and Casta. As she walked, she wept and lamented to herself When I think of all the times we have spent together - oh my poor cousin! So lovely, so gifted! There is hardly another like her. Only Frost Maiden and the Goddess of the Moon could rival her. How can she be leaving us at such a tender age, for that distant land from whence no travellers return And to think that because of Xi-fengs deceitful scheme, I have not been able to show myself at the Naiads House and have done nothing to show my sisterly affection! Oh the poor, dear girl! She was already at the gate of the Naiads House. There was no sound from within. She began to fret. I must be too late! She must have died already and they are resting between their lamentations. I wonder if her grave-clothes and coverlet are ready? She quickened her step and hurried on into the room. A young maid standing at the inner doorway had already seen her, and called out Mrs Zhu is here! Nightingale hurried out to meet her. How is she? asked Li Wan. Nightingale tried to answer but all she could muster was a choked sob. Tears poured down her cheeks like pearls from a broken, necklace, as she pointed silently to where Dai-yu lay. Realizing With a pang what Nightingales pitiable condition must portend, Li Wan asked no more, but went over at once to see for herself.
We country folk never fall ill, pronounced Grannie Liu. If happen we should, then we pray to the gods and make our vows. We never take medicines and the like. Im wondering now if you mightnt have fallen foul of some evil spirit, to have taken ill like this, maam? Patience was aware that Grannie Lius rustic superstitions were ill-timed, and gave her a meaningful tug from the rear. The old dame interpreted this correctly and fell silent. But her words had in fact found an echo in Xi-fengs own thoughts. Grannie, dear, she said, speaking with a great effort, youre a lady with years of experience, and what you say is true. Did you know that Aunt Zhao had died too? You met her when you were here, didnt you? Holy Name! exclaimed the old lady in the greatest Surprise. Fancy her dying, just like that! She was such a sturdy body. And shed a young son if I recall - what will become of him? Hell be all right, Patience consoled her. He still has the Master and Lady Wang to look after him. Thats as may be, replied Grannie Liu gravely. But can you be so sure, miss? I mean, its his own mother - however bad she may have been - as has died. Nobody can ever take a mothers place. This coincided with another of Xi-fengs keenest anxieties, and she broke down and began sobbing. They all rallied round to comfort her. When Qiao-jie heard her mother in such distress, she came to the kang, held her hand and burst into tears herself. Have you said hello to Grannie Liu? asked Xi-feng tearfully. No, Mama. She gave you your name, and is like a foster-mother to you. Give her a curtsey now. Qiao-jie went across to Grannie Liu and was about to curtsey when Grannie Liu seized her and said Holy Precious Name! Dont you go weighing me down with such honours - itll carry me to my grave! Miss Qiao-jie, its over a year since I last was here do you still remember me? Of course I do! That time when I saw you in the Garden I was still a very little girl. But I remember two years ago I asked you to bring me some big crickets. I can see you havent brought me any. You must have forgotten. Oh missie! exclaimed Grannie Liu. What a silly old soul I am! If you want crickets weve enough and to spare at home. But you never come and visit us. If you came, you could bring home a cartload of crickets if you so wanted. In that case, put in Xi-feng, why not take her home with you for a visit? How could I possibly, maam? said Grannie Liu laughing. Such a fine gentle young lady thats grown up wrapped in silks and satins and used to dainty things to eat - why, what would I give her to play with at home? What would I feed her with? Would you have me die of shame? She cackled and went on Mind you, I could act as a matchmaker for the young lady. Ours may only be a village, but weve wealthy folk there all the same, with land that spreads for thousands of acres around and hundreds of cattle and a fair bit of money too. Nothing to compare with the treasure youve got here, of course. In fact come to think of it youd probably not so much as glance at such folk really, maam. But to us country people theyre dwellers in heaven! By all means go ahead and propose the match, said Xi-feng. I should be only too pleased to give Qiao-jie in marriage to such a family. Come, maam, you must be joking. Why, I dare say youd be fussy about some great official family that lived in a big mansion, let alone simple country people. And even if you were willing, I hardly think Their Ladyships would be! Qiao-jie found the conversation embarrassing and had gone off somewhere to talk to Qing-er. The two girls were soon chatting away together, and gradually struck up a friendship. Patience was worried that Grannie Lius endless ramblings would wear Xi-feng out, and presently she took her aside and said Speaking of Her Ladyship, you still havent been to call on her. Ill find someone to take you over there. It would be a great pity not to see her now that youre here. Grannie Liu was about to set off, but Xi-feng called her back Whats the great hurry? Sit down, I want to talk to you.
Xi-feng was still anxious that Xi-chun might be contemplating suicide, and sent Felicity over to comfort her. At ten oclock that night the gates were firmly barred - a somewhat superfluous precaution by now - and everyone lay in bed in a state of nervous wakefulness. But our narrative leaves Rong-guo House and returns to the nun-besotted burglar. He knew that the Hermitage occupied an isolated location in the Garden, and that the nuns only companions there were a few old matrons and novices, who would present no obstacle. He made his plans accordingly. At midnight, when all was quiet, equipped with a knife and a supply of potent narcotic incense, he scaled the Garden wall, and from his vantage point there he could see in the distance lamps burning in the Hermitage. He crept stealthily across and hid himself in an out-of-the-way corner. By two oclock, there was only a single night-light still burning. Adamantina was sitting cross-legged on her mat. She took a short break from her meditations, and after several gusty sighs reflected aloud to herself When I came to the capital from my old home on Mount Xuan-mu, I had hoped to make a name for myself. But then when the Jias invited me to stay here, I could hardly decline their invitation. And now I cant even do something as simple and innocent as paying a visit to Xi-chun without being heaped with abuse by some coarse creature. And later in the night I had such a fright! How nervous Ive been all day, ever since my return. I simply cant settle down properly and meditate. She usually meditated alone, and even today had not asked the others to Stay up with her. But suddenly at four oclock she began to tremble with cold and was about to call out to one of her women when she heard a sound through the window. She thought immediately of what had happened the previous evening and gave a terrified cry for help! But it brought no answer. From where she sat she could detect a strange smell seeping right into her head, and she felt her limbs becoming gradually numb and incapable of movement, her mouth incapable of speech. Panic began to grip her. Helplessly she watched as a stranger entered her room, a man, with a knife glistening in his hand. Though she was paralysed, her mind was still clear, and thinking that she was about to be murdered she steeled herself mentally to her fate and found herself surprisingly free of fear. Then to her amazement the man slipped the knife back into the scabbard slung over his shoulder, came towards her and put both his arms softly round her. He fondled her briefly, then hoisted her up onto his back. By now Adamantina was too groggy to understand what was happening to her. The drugs had sent her into a profound stupor, and she surrendered her virginal body into the strangers hands, to do with as he pleased. With Adamantina on his back, the man made his way to the Garden wall, which he scaled with a rope-ladder, climbing down to where some of his accomplices were waiting with the getaway cart. They bundled her in and set off. The impressive-looking official titles inscribed on the carriage lanterns enabled them to pass through the district barricades, and by the time they reached the city gate it was opening time and the gatekeeper did not even bother to ask any questions, thinking they were on official business. Once out of the city, they pressed on to Seven Mile Bank, where they joined the rest of the gang and agreed to make their ways separately to the South coast. It is not known what eventually became of Adamantina whether she submitted willingly to her captors desires, or whether she resisted and died in so doing. In the absence of conclusive evidence as to her ultimate fate, it would be futile for us to speculate on that subject. Instead, our narrative returns to the Hermitage. One of the old nuns who had her quarters to the rear of Adamantinas meditation chamber slept that night until four in the morning, when she was awakened by the sound of voices from the front room. Adamantina must be having a restless spell in her meditations, she concluded. But then afterwards she heard heavy and unmistakably male footsteps and the sound of doors and windows opening and closing. She would have risen to investigate, but her limbs had become quite weak and she could not so much as open her mouth to speak. No further sound came from Adamantinas room, and the old nun lay there till dawn in a stupor, with her eyes wide open. It was only then that her head began to clear she threw on some clothes and told the old matrons to heat the water for Adamantinas morning tea.
I would want the best for any member of the family, and especially for Qiao-jie, for her parents sake. Think of the other girls. We arranged Xiu-yans marriage to your cousin Ke, and now look how happy they are together! And the Mei family into which Bao-qin has married are by all accounts very comfortably off, so theres no need to worry about her. Xiang-yun, I know, has not been quite so fortunate. That match was her own uncles idea in the first place, and it would have turned out well if her husband had not fallen ill of a consumption and died. Now the poor girl has vowed to spend the rest of her days a widow. If Qiao-jie falls into bad hands, I shall never forgive myself! As she was speaking, Patience came in to consult with Bao-chai and also to learn the results of Lady Wangs meeting with Lady Xing. Lady Wang told her what Lady Xing had said. After a thoughtful silence, Patience fell to her knees. Qiao-jies whole future now depends on you, maam! she pleaded. If we deliver her into the hands of those people, it will mean a lifetime of suffering for her. And what do you think Mr Lian will say when he comes home? You are an intelligent girl, said Lady Wang. Stand up now and listen to what I have to say. In the last resort, Qiao-jie is my sister-in-laws granddaughter, not mine. If Lady Xing wants to take a decision, how can I stand in her way? There is really no cause for concern, insisted Bao-yu. The important thing is to have a clear perception of destiny. Patience was afraid that Bao-yu would start raving again and commit some indiscretion, and she remained silent. She had said all that she wanted to say to Lady Wang, and now returned to her own apartment. Lady Wangs mental distress had brought on a pain in her heart. She summoned a maid to assist her and leaning heavily on her arm struggled back to her own room and lay down. She did not ask Bao- yu and Bao-chai to accompany her, saying that she would feel better after a sleep. But she found it impossible to shake off her troubled mood, and later when she heard that old Mrs Li had called, could not bring herself to rise from her bed and entertain her. Then Jia Lan came in to pay his respects and to deliver a message A letter has come from Grandfather. The boys at the gate have brought it in. Mother was going to give it to you, but as my Grandmother Li has just come, she asked me to bring it instead. Mother will be coming over shortly to talk to you, and bringing my Grandmother Li. He handed Lady Wang the letter. Lady Wang asked him, as she took it from him Why is your grandmother here? I dont know myself, replied Lan. I just heard say that theres a letter from Cousin Qis fiances family, the Zhens. Lady Wang knew that Li Qi had been promised to Zhen Bao-yu, and that the betrothal had already been sealed with the customary gift of tea. It must be that the Zhens wanted to proceed with the wedding, and old Mrs Li had come to discuss some last-minute details. She nodded, and opened the letter from Jia Zheng The canal is congested with boats bringing hack the army from its successful campaign on the coast, and my progress has thereby been greatly delayed. I have heard that Tan-chuns husband is travelling to the capital with his father, and wonder if you have heard anything from them? A day or two ago I had a letter from Lian, telling me of brother Shes illness. Is there any more news? The time is drawing near for Bao-yu and Lan to sit their examinations. They must study diligently and on no account must they be allowed to fritter their time away. It will be a few days before I can reach Nanking with Mothers coffin. I am in good health, so dont worry about me. Please pass on my instructions to Bao-yu and Lan. Zheng. Dated the day of the month PS Rong will be writing separately. After reading the letter, Lady Wang handed it hack to Jia Lan, saying Give this to Bao-yu and tell him to read it. And then give it back to your mother. While she was speaking, Li Wan and old Mrs Li came in and paid their respects. They seated themselves, and old Mrs Li spoke about the Zhens and Li Qis wedding. They discussed this for a while, and then Li Wan asked Lady Wang Have you read Fathers letter? I have. Jia Lan handed the letter to his mother, who read it herself and said Tan-chun has been away for over a year and not once come home.
Better than your cousin, anyway, forever boozing his way into trouble. At least your wife wont be left to sleep in an empty bed ... She narrowed her eyes at him suggestively, and her cheeks began to glow. Xue Ke saw serious danger ahead, and decided to make a dash for it while he still could. But he was too slow. Jin-gui was not going to let him slip through her fingers now! In a second she was on him and had him in her clutches. Sister-in-law! cried Xue Ke in consternation. This is most undignified! He was trembling all over. Jin-gui threw caution to the winds. Come in here with me. Theres something important I have to tell you. Things had reached this critical juncture when a voice behind her called Mrs Pan! Its Caltrop. Shes coming this way! Jin-gui glanced wildly behind her. Moonbeam had lifted the portiere to observe the course the interview was taking and then when she caught sight of Caltrop coming from the other direction, had hastened to warn Jin-gui. Jin-gui in her panic relaxed her grip, and Xue Ke seized his chance of escape. Caltrop herself had noticed nothing and had been walking innocently on her way until Moonbeam called out, when she looked round and to her horror saw Jin-gui dragging Xue Ke into her boudoir. Caltrop immediately turned about and, heart thumping, began walking back in the direction she had come from. Jin-gui stood there a while, and stared in angry dismay after the vanishing form of Xue Ke. Then she gave a snort of exasperation and withdrew to her apartment, smarting with thwarted desire. Caltrop, who had come through the side gate and was making her way to Bao-qins when she stumbled upon them, hurried back to her room. Resentment towards Caltrop now festered within Jin-guis bosom, and the poison worked its way into the very marrow of her being. Later that same day, Bao-chai was in Grandmother Jias apartment, and heard Lady Wang speaking of the betrothal Jia Zheng had proposed for Tan-chun. Im glad the boys from a Nanking family, said Grandmother Jia. But if he came here once before, I cant understand why Zheng has never mentioned it. We knew nothing about it either, said Lady Wang. I can see advantages in the match, said Grandmother Jia. The only objection is the dreadful distance involved. I know that Zheng is posted there at present. But supposing he is transferred later on, poor Tan will be so isolated. With official families, theres no telling where they may be posted, replied Lady Wang. The boys father may also be recalled to the capital. Even if he isnt, one way or another the falling leaf returns to the root, as they say theyre bound to come home sooner or later. Besides, Zhengs superior is in favour of the match, and it would be very difficult for him to refuse. I think he has more or less made up his mind already, and has only written to you for your formal approval, Mother. If you are both in favour of it, said Grandmother Jia, then well and good. It grieves me, though, to think how long it may be before Tan is able to come back and visit us. If it is more than a year or two, I fear I may no longer be alive to see her. She wept as she spoke. Marriage is something that happens to every girl once she grows up, said Lady Wang, and even if the husbands family is a local one, you can never be sure that the two of them will stay in the district. He may always be posted away from home. Thats one of the hazards of official life. The most important thing is that they should be happy together. Take Ying-chuns case. Her husband lives nearby. But that has not meant happiness for her. They never seem to stop fighting, and now he wont even feed her properly, and forbids her to touch any of the things we send. And from what I hear, things are getting worse. He wont allow her to come and visit us, and when the two of them quarrel, he pointedly reminds her that we owe his family money. Poor child! The future looks very bleak for her. The other day I was worried on her account and sent some of my women to call at the Sun home. Ying-chun was hiding in a side-room and wouldnt come out to see them. They insisted on going in, and found her freezing to death, poor thing, with nothing on but some threadbare old clothes. And it was a bitterly cold day! She broke down in front of them and begged them not to reveal her miserable plight to us at home.
Any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be confiscated outright according to the relevant statute notes negotiated at permissible rates, together with title-deeds of houses and land, will all be returned. Jia Lian is to be deprived of his position and rank, but otherwise will be exempted from further punishment and released. Jia Zheng rose from his seat and kowtowed in the appropriate direction for this act of Imperial clemency. He also bowed to the aide to express his profound gratitude for the princes intervention on his behalf. Be so good as to convey my thanks to His Highness. Tomorrow I shall attend court in order to express my gratitude to His Majesty in person, and shall also present myself at His Highnesss palace to make my kowtow. The princes aide took his leave. Shortly afterwards a court official arrived to proclaim the Edict, followed by the officers entrusted with its execution, who supervised the proceedings scrupulously, confiscating only what had been specified, and restoring everything else to its owner. Jia Lian was released, while Jia Shes domestic staff, men and women alike, were all taken away into public service. Jia Lians position was not to be envied. Some of the promissory notes and documents were returned, and none of his other property had been officially confiscated, but his apartment had been ransacked and nothing but the bare furniture had been left in place. His initial relief at being set free and escaping the punishment he feared soon gave way to a profound sense of loss, when he beheld his own and Xi-fengs possessions of a lifetime - altogether about sixty thousand taels worth - gone in a mornings work. His fathers imprisonment, Xi-fengs critical state of health the strain was almost more than he could bear. And now he had to face Jia Zheng, who summoned him and berated him, barely suppressing a sob I have, alas, been too busy of late with my official duties, and have paid insufficient attention to family matters. I thought I could rely on you and your wife I can hardly remonstrate with your father for his misconduct but this usury that has come to light - who in heavens name is responsible for that? Families like ours simply do not dabble in such things. The documents have been confiscated, and both principal and interest are forfeit but its not the money, its the appalling blow this will deal to our reputation! Jia Lian fell to his knees In managing our familys affairs, Uncle, I have never acted with a view to private gain. All the accounts have been kept by the stewards- Lai Da, Wu Xin-deng, Dai Liang and the others. Please summon them and hear the truth from their lips. These past few years, our expenditure has far exceeded our income, and there have been deficits in the accounts that I have simply been unable to make good, despite the numerous unsecured debts I have had to negotiate. Aunt Wang will be able to tell you all about it. As for the money loaned out, even I have no idea where that has come from. Youd better ask Zhou Rui and Brightie. So, you are telling me you dont even know what goes on in your own apartment, let alone the rest of the household! I shall not pursue this matter any further with you at present. Consider yourself extremely lucky to have been let off so lightly. Now youd better stir yourself and find out whats happening to your father and Cousin Zhen. Jia Lian felt very hard done by, but swallowed his tears and departed in obedience to his uncles instructions. Left alone, Jia Zheng ruminated on the familys misfortunes, heaving many a heartfelt sigh It was in vain that my grandfather and my great-uncle served the throne so loyally, winning the family great honour and two hereditary titles. Now both our houses have been disgraced, both titles have been stripped from us. And if I look further ahead, I can see no respite, no rising star in the younger generation capable of stemming this tide of degeneration! Great Heaven! That our noble line should have come to this! Thanks to an act of exceptional clemency on His Majestys part, I have been spared, and my property has been restored. But both households must now look to me for their daily sustenance, and how can I hope to support them all? This latest revelation of Lians is another grievous blow not only have we no reserves, we are seriously in debt. We have evidently been living under false pretences for years! And I have only my own stupidity to blame! How can I have been so blind? If only my eldest son were still alive! In Zhu I might at least have had some support. But Bao-yu, for all that he is my son, and now a grown man, can offer me no help whatsoever.
The women left. Bao-yu seemed to be the only person at all affected by the news of Xiang-yuns impending marriage. He looked somewhat bemused, and thought to himself Why is it that girls have to get married as soon as they grow up? Once theyre married, theyre bound to change. Even dear Yun has to obey her uncles will. Now if we meet again, it will never be the same. She is bound to be distant towards me. What is the point of living, if I am to be forever shunned like this? He felt himself becoming tearful again. But for Grandmother Jias sake he endeavoured not to weep and instead sat there brooding silently to himself. Jia Zheng was still concerned for Grandmother Jias health, and presently he came in to see how she was. Finding her somewhat improved he went out again and summoned the steward Lai Da, ordering him to bring the complete register of household servants employed in responsible positions. He went over this register with him entry by entry. Apart from Jia Shes servants, who had been taken away, there were more than thirty families on the register, with a total of two hundred and twelve male and female servants. Jia Zheng sent for the forty-one male servants at present employed in the mansion and interrogated them all about the accounts for the past years - checking with them the totals for income and expenditure in their various departments. The chief steward presented the ledgers for inspection, and Jia Zheng could see at a glance that none of the figures balanced. Expenditure outweighed income by far, and additional expenses had been incurred over several years in connection with Her Grace the Imperial Concubine. There were several entries revealing irregular loans raised outside. When he looked at the rents from the family estates in the Eastern provinces, he could see that in recent years income had shrunk to less than half what it had been in his grandfathers time, while the familys expenses were ten times as great. This palpable evidence of mismanagement came as a great shock to him, and he stamped his foot angrily This is monstrous! I thought Lian was competent to handle these things! And now I find that we have been mortgaging ourselves up to the hilt in order to keep up an empty show! Weve been living far beyond our means. This recklessness was bound to lead to ruin. And it is too late now for me to start introducing economies! He paced up and down with his hands behind his back, unable to devise a remedy for the familys deep-seated economic infirmity. His servants knew that their master had no head for business, and that he would only agitate himself to no avail on this score. Its no use worrying, sir, they advised him. Every household is the same. Even princes of the realm! If you could but see their accounts, youd find that they fail to balance their books too. They just keep up appearances and muddle along from day to day as best they can. You should think how lucky youve been. The Emperors been kind and allowed you to keep your part of the family property. Mind you, even if everything had been confiscated, you would still have been able to get by somehow or other! What nonsense you talk! cried Jia Zheng angrily. You servants are worthless rogues, every last one of you! When your masters prosper, you spend their money as you please and when theres nothing left to spend, you beat a retreat at the first opportunity. What is it to you if we live or die? You say we are lucky not to have had everything confiscated - but what do you know? Do you realize that with our reputation as it stands at present, well be hard put to it to avoid bankruptcy. And with you putting on airs, acting as if you were rich, talking as if you were important, swindling people left right and centre, we dont stand a chance. When calamity strikes, you are quite content to see us take all the consequences. I am informed that it was one of your number, a servant by the name of Bao Er, who spread the very rumours that have incriminated my brother and Mr Zhen. Why is his name nowhere to be seen on this register? Bao Er isnt officially on our books, sir, came the reply. He was originally on the Ning-guo register. Then he caught Mr Lians eye as a trustworthy sort of person, and both he and his wife were taken on by Mr Lian. His wife died, and after that he went back to Ning-guo House. Once when you were busy at the Board, sir, and Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships and the other young masters were all away mourning at the mausoleum, Mr Zhen came over to inspect things on this side, and brought Bao Er with him.
Now when she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage. Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama! With the fortune that Grandpa left, he should have been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. But instead its been one disaster after another. First came Nanking and that disgraceful business over Caltrop. He was entirely to blame for that poor young mans death, and it was just lucky for him that we still had plenty of pull and money in those days, and were able to get him off. Youd have thought a scrape like that would have been enough to make him mend his ways. Youd have thought he might have taken life a bit more seriously after that and devoted more time to looking after his own mother. But no, as soon as we arrived here, it was the same story all over again. I hate to think how much youve suffered on his account, Mama, how many tears youve shed. Then he got married, and at last we thought life might quieten down a bit for all of us. But fate evidently had something else in mind. Eventually that dreadful woman drove him away with her insufferable carryings on. And even that was not the end of it. As the saying goes Fate moves in a narrow lane, and collisions are hard to avoid! It was only a few days before he was mixed up in this new murder case! You and Cousin Ke have done everything you possibly could. Apart from all the money youve spent, youve never stopped asking for help and thinking of ways to get him out. You cant go on struggling with fate. Hell have to pay the price for his own misdeeds. Most parents look to their children for support in their old age, and even in poor families a man will do his best to earn his mother a bowl of rice. But what has Pan done? Squandered a ready-made fortune, and made your life a misery. I know I shouldnt say this, but the truth is, hes the bane of your life, an affliction sent to test you, not a real son to you. You refuse to accept the truth, and wear yourself out like this, weeping at all hours of the day and night. Youve got quite enough to cope with already, what with Jin-gui and her tantrums. It worries me so, seeing you in this state. I only wish I could be here with you all the time, and help keep the peace. But I cant. Bao-yu would never let me come back, however halfwitted he may be. The other day Sir Zheng sent a message home to say how shocked he was to read the report in the Gazette. He has already sent one of his men to try to intervene on Pans behalf. So you see - there are so many people trying to help Pan Out of this mess hes made. And thank goodness Im at least close by. I think if I were living a long way off and heard that this had happened, Id simply die worrying about you. Please, Mama, give yourself a moments respite. Be thankful that Pan is still alive. Use this opportunity to take stock. Ask one of the older men in the firm to find Out what we owe and what we are owed, and see exactly how much we have left. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue tearfully, the past few days I have been so preoccupied with your brother I simply havent had time to tell you of our own troubles. Whenever youve come to see me its either been you trying to cheer me up or me giving you the latest news from the yamen. I havent told you the worst. We have been struck off the register of court purveyors. Two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale, while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and were involved in another court case over that. Your cousin Ke has been out every day trying to collect some of the money owing to us. Our liabilities here will probably amount to several tens of thousands of taels, and we shall have to sell our share of the Nanking joint-stock business and some property as well, in order to meet our obligations. Two days ago I even heard a rumour that the pawnbroking side of the Nanking business has g6ne bankrupt and been closed down! If that turns out to be true, I really have come to the end of the road! Aunt Xue began weeping hysterically. Ba-chai was also in tears by now, but tried to comfort her Theres no sense in your distressing yourself about the finances, Mama.
He gave instructions to Musk, Ripple and Oriole to store all of these away. Bao-chai was amazed to see him do this, and wished to sound out his true motives. Its very commendable of you to forgo reading such books, she said with a quizzical smile. But why do you have to move them out of sight altogether? Because now I understand, replied Bao-yu. None of those books is worth anything. It would be best to burn the lot and be rid of them once and for all! Bao-chai was delighted to hear him saying this. But the very next minute she heard him recite, as if to himself -1787 True Buddha Mind Within Is not in Sutras to be found Beyond the Crucible, There leads a path to Higher Ground. Bao-chai did not catch every word, but Buddha Mind Within and Higher Ground were enough to fill her once more with gloomy forebodings. She watched him anxiously. He told the maids to prepare a quiet room for him, looked out all his old copies of books like Zhuciuss Neo-Confucian Primer, and collections of examination essays and verses, and assembled them all in his new room. Then he sat down in earnest and began quietly working. Bao-chai felt she could finally set her mind at rest. Aroma could hardly believe the evidence of her eyes and ears. She smiled conspiratorially at Bao-chai You certainly know how to talk him round, maam! Just that one lecture from you and hes a new man! I only hope he hasnt left it too late. The exams are looming very close. Bao-chai nodded and smiled These things are in the hands of fate. His success will not turn on how soon or late he begins preparing. I just hope that from now on he will learn to be more adult, and give up his old antics. Checking first that she and Aroma were alone in the room, she added in an undertone Im certainly very pleased at this change of heart. But there is still one thing that worries me. His old weakness. We ought to try to isolate him from our own sex. You are quite right, maam, said Aroma. So long as he was under the influence of that monk, he seemed to be quite indifferent to the girls around him. But now that hes changed course again, we must once more be on our guard for a revival of his old habits. I dont think hes likely to show much interest in either of us, maam. With Nightingale gone, that only leaves the four other maids. Fivey is the little vixen among them, but I hear that her mother has been asking for permission to take her out of service to get married, so shell be leaving in a few days time. Musk and Ripple have never been particularly close to Master Bao, but we shouldnt forget that they used to fool about with him when he was a child. That leaves Oriole. He doesnt seem at all interested in her, and shes a very dependable girl. I suggest that for day-to-day duties, like pouring tea and carrying water, Oriole should take charge, with a few of the junior maids to help her. What do you think, maam? I have been worrying about the same thing myself replied Bao-chai. Your proposal is a very sensible one. So from then on Oriole was put in charge. Bao-yu never left his room now. Every day he sent someone else to pay respects to his mother on his behalf. Lady Wangs delight at this new regime of his needs no description. -1536 When the third of the eighth came round Grandmother Jias birthday, Bao-yu went early in the morning to kowtow at her shrine and then returned to his quiet room. After breakfast, Bao-chai, Aroma and some of the maids had gone to sit in the front room and were chatting with Ladies Xing and Wang, and he was sitting alone in his room, deep in concentration, when Oriole carne in with a tray of sweetmeats. Her Ladyship asked me to bring these for you, she said. They are offerings left over from Her Old Ladyships sacrifice. Bao-yu rose to his feet to thank her and then sat down again. Put them over there, he said. As she placed the tray to one side, Oriole said to him in an undertone Her Ladyship has been speaking very highly of you in the front room. Bao-yu smiled. Oriole continued She said that now you are studying so hard, you are sure to pass your exam and then if you go on and become a Palace Graduate and an official, your parents hopes for you will not have been in vain.
She told a maid to bring them tea, but was otherwise decidedly offhand towards them, while Bao-yu, who would have liked to talk with the sisters, could tell that Bao-chai found their company distasteful and therefore refrained. The nuns for their part knew only too well that Bao-chai was unsympathetic to their cause, and after sitting for a short time they excused themselves. Wont you stay a little longer? asked Bao-chai somewhat disingenuously. We have so many calls to make, replied one of them. What with the masses weve been saying at the Temple of the Iron Threshold, weve been kept very busy and havent called on Their Ladyships and the young ladies in a very long while. Apart from your good self, weve already been to see Mrs Zhu and Their Ladyships, but we still have Miss Xi-chun to call on. Bao-chai nodded, and the nuns proceeded to Xi-chuns apartment. They asked Landscape, who received them, where her mistress could be found. My mistress hasnt eaten for days, exclaimed Landscape, and now she wont even get up from her bed. Why? Whats the matter? Oh, its a long story. Im sure shell tell you all about it when you see her. Xi-chun had heard them talking as they came in, and sat up at once. How are you both? she asked. I suppose youve stopped visiting us because our fortunes are so altered Holy Name! came the pious ejaculation. Benefactors are benefactors, whether they be rich or poor. Our convent was founded by your family, and we were always most generously provided for by Her Old Ladyship. We saw Their Ladyships and the young ladies at Her Old Ladyships funeral, but we didnt see you there, miss, and we were worried about you. Thats why weve come here specially to visit you today. Xi-chun asked after the young nuns at the temple. Ever since that scandal, was the reply, the gatemen wont let them so much as set foot in Rong-guo House. Talking of scandals, continued the same nun, is it true, what we heard the other day, that Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage has run off with a man? What utter nonsense! replied Xi-chun. People who tell such tales should beware of having their tongues cut out in hell! The poor girl was kidnapped by a gang of ruffians! How can anyone have the heart to spread such malicious gossip! Sister Adamantina was a strange one all the same, said the nun. We always thought she overdid it a bit. Of course, we dont like to criticize her in front of you, miss. Who are we when compared with her, after all? Just ordinary, unrefined people we chant our liturgy, say our prayers, make intercession for the sins of others, and hope to earn ourselves a little merit, a little good karma. What does good karma really mean? asked Xi-chun earnestly. Well, miss, putting aside the truly virtuous families like your own, which have nothing to fear, of course - other noble ladies and young misses of good family can never be certain how long their prosperity will last. If calamity once strikes, then nothing can save them. Nothing, that is, except Our Lady of Mercy if Our Lady sees a mortal suffering, her infinite compassion moves her to try to guide that mortal towards salvation. That is why we all pray to her and say Hail, Lady of Mercy, Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion and Grace, Deliverer, Saviour, Hail! A nun leads a hard life, its true, harder than a young lady in a rich family. But were saved! Even if we cant hope to become Buddhas or Saints, at least by keeping up our devotions we may one day in another lifetime he reborn as men. And that would be sufficient reward in itsel At least then we would escape the endless trials and silent tribulations of womankind. You are still too young to understand, miss but let me tell you, when once a young lady leaves home and marries, it is all over with her. She must spend the rest of her days a slave to her husbands will. In the true religious life it is sincere devotion that counts. Sister Adamantina always thought herself so gifted and sensitive, so superior. To her we were always vulgar mortals. And yet ordinary folk like us can at least earn good simple karma, while look at this terrible thing that has befallen her. Their words found an all too receptive ear. Uninhibited by the presence of her maids, Xi-chun poured out the whole story of how badly You-shi had been treating her, and how she had been made to stay and look after the house, and the disastrous consequence.
She is over eighty now and may not live to acquire a title because of your achievements but at least, by leading a good life, you can repay her a little for all that she has suffered for your sake. And I hardly need mention the agonies Mother has endured in bringing you up. You are the only son she has left. If you were to die, think how she would suffer! As for me, I am wretched enough as it is you dont need to make a widow of me. Three good reasons why even if you want to die, the powers above will not let you and you will not be able to. After four or five days of proper rest and care, your illness will pass, your strength will be restored and you will be yourself again. For a while Bao-yu could think of no reply to this homily. Finally he gave a silly laugh and said After not speaking to me for so long, here you are lecturing me. You are wasting your breath. Encouraged by this response to go a step further, Bao-chai said Let me tell you the plain truth, then. Some days ago, while you were unconscious, Cousin Lin passed away. With a sudden movement, Bao-yu sat up and cried out in horror It cant be true! It is. Would I lie about such a thing? Grandmother and Mother knew how fond you were of each other, and wouldnt tell you because they were afraid that if they did, you would die too. Bao-yu began howling unrestrainedly and slumped back in his bed. Suddenly all was pitch black before his eyes. He could not tell where he was and was beginning to feel very lost, when he thought he saw a man walking towards him and asked in a bewildered tone of voice Would you be so kind as to tell me where I am? This, replied the stranger, is the road to the Springs of the Nether World. Your time is not yet come. What brings you here? I have just learned of the death of a friend and have come to find her. But I seem to have lost my way. Who is this friend of yours? Lin Dai-yu of Soochow. The man gave a chilling smile In life Lin Dai-yu was no ordinary mortal, and in death she has become no ordinary shade. An ordinary mortal has two souls which coalesce at birth to vitalize the physical frame, and disperse at death to rejoin the cosmic flux. If you consider the impossibility of tracing even such ordinary human entities in the Nether World, you will realize what a futile task it is to look for Lin Dai-yu. You had better return at once. After standing for a moment lost in thought, Bao-yu asked again But if as you say, death is a dispersion, how can there be such a place as the Nether World? There is, replied the man with a superior smile, and yet there is not, such a place. It is a teaching, devised to warn mankind in its blind attachment to the idea of life and death. The Supreme Wrath is aroused by human folly in all forms - whether it be excessive ambition, premature death self-sought, or futile self-destruction through debauchery and a life of overweening violence. Hell is the place where souls such as these are imprisoned and made to suffer countless torments in expiation of their- sins. This search of yours for Lin Dai-yu is a case of futile self-delusion. Dai-yu has already returned to the Land of Illusion and if you really want to find her you must cultivate your mind and strengthen your spiritual nature. Then one day you will see her again. But if you throw your life away, you will be guilty of premature death self-sought and will be confined to Hell. And then, although you may be allowed to see your parents, you will certainly never see Dai-yu again. When he had finished speaking, the man took a stone from within his sleeve and threw it at Bao-yus chest. The words he had spoken and the impact of the stone as it-landed on his chest combined to give Bao-yu such a fright that he would have returned home at once, if he had only know which way to turn. In his confusion he suddenly heard a voice, and turning, saw the figures of Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Aroma and his other maids standing in a circle around him, weeping and calling his name. He was lying on his own bed. The red lamp was on the table. The moon was shining brilliantly through the window. He was back among the elegant comforts of his own home. A moments reflection told him that what he had just experienced had been a dream. He was in a cold sweat. Though his mind felt strangely lucid, thinking only intensified his feeling of helpless desolation, and he uttered several profound sighs.
Green Bower Hermitage in the Garden has been set aside for my sister Xi-chuns devotions. After a pause for reflection Jia Zheng gave them a long homily on their debt of gratitude to the throne for all these favours. Jia Lian took the opportunity of raising the issue of his daughters marriage Both Mother and Father are wiffing that Qiao-jie should be married to this Master Zhou. Jia Zheng had heard the full details of Qiao-jies story the previous evening, and replied If that is their decision, then so be it. There is nothing against a country life. What matters is that the family should be an honest one and the lad should be prepared to study and make his way in the -384 world. Not every official at court is from a city family, after all. Jia Lian replied appropriately and continued Father is advanced in years, and is moreover afflicted with a chronic phlegmatic condition. He plans to retire for a few years and leave everything in your hands, Uncle. A quiet retirement in the country would suit me well enough, commented Jia Zheng. But alas my obligations to the throne do not permit it. Jia Zheng went into see Lady Wang, while Jia Lian sent someone to invite Grannie Liu over. When she was informed that the match had been approved by the Master, she proceeded to favour Lady Wang and the other ladies with a long speech on the certain future success of the young man, how his family was sure to come up in the world, and what a prosperous multitude of sons and grandsons the couple were sure to breed. While she was talking one of the maids came in to announce that Hua Zi-fang, Aromas brother, had sent his wife to convey his respects. Lady Wang spoke to the woman and ascertained from her that a match had been proposed by the Hua family to a certain Mr Jiang living south of the city, a young man with property and land and a pawnshop business of his own. He was a few years older than Aroma but had never married and was exceptionally good4ooking. Lady Wang was satisfied with this description of the match. Tell them I agree, she said. In a few days time your husband can come and fetch his sister and take her away to be married. She also sent some of her own people to make discreet enquiries, and received confirmation of the mans character, whereupon she informed Bao-chai, and asked Aunt Xue to break the news gently to Aroma. Poor Aroma was inconsolable at the prospect of leaving Rong-guo House, but she could not offer any resistance. She remembered the visit Bao-yu had paid her at home many years previously, and the oath she had sworn afterwards, never to leave him even in death. Now Her Ladyship is making me do this against my will, and if I insist on remaining single and faithful to his memory, people will call me shameless. But if I do go, it is not of my own wishing. She wept until she was choking with tears. Aunt Xue and Bao-chai did their utmost to talk her round, and eventually she thought to herself If I were to die here, it would be a poor return for all Her Ladyships kindness to me in the past. I had best die at home. So she bade farewell to them all, her heart heavy with sorrow. It was equally painful for her to part from the other maids. Resolved to end her own life at the first opportunity, she mounted a carriage and set off for home. When she saw her brother and his wife, there were more tears, but she could not bring herself to say what was on her mind. Her brother showed her one by one all the presents sent by the Jiang family, and the trousseau that he himself had made ready for her, a part of which, he explained, had been given by Lady Wang, while a part he had provided himsel This kindness made it harder than ever for Aroma to express her sorrow, and after spending two days at her brothers home, she thought things over carefully again He has done everything so nicely for me. If I were to die here, wouldnt I be hurting him? She turned it over and over in her mind, and no course of action seemed easy and right. Her heart was wound into a tight knot. She could only bear her fate stoically and bide her time. The auspicious day in the almanac arrived for her to be taken to her husbands home, and not wishing to make a scene she concealed her grief and let herself be helped into the bridal sedan. At her new home, she thought to herself, she would make plans afresh. But once she arrived at the Jiang household, she found them so sincere and respectful towards her, deferring to her in every way as a young married lady, with the maids and serving-women all calling her Mrs Jiang the minute she set foot in the house, that death seemed impossible again to die there would be to do them a great injury, she thought to herself it would be a poor return for all their kindness.
Their heart of a new-born child was simply their spirit of compassion and concern for others. Whereas yours, it would seem, leaves you so blissfully unconcerned that you would be willing to forsake your own family. It doesnt make any sense to me. Bao-yu nodded and smiled Yao and Shun were not able to prevail upon Chao-fu or Xu You to abandon their mountain retreats nor could King Wu or the Duke of Zhou induce Bo Yi and his brother Shu Qi to involve themselves in the world... You are becoming more and more absurd! interrupted Bao-chai. If all the men of old had been hermits like those four you mention, then there would never have been sages like Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius. And besides, its ridiculous to compare yourself with Bo Yi. Both he and Shu Qi lived in the declining years of the Shang dynasty, and their lives were beset with difficulties of one kind or another. So they had a good pretext for escaping their responsibilities. But your case is totally different. Ours is a golden age, and we ourselves have received numerous favours from the throne, while our ancestors enjoyed lives of luxury. And you yourself have been treasured all your life, both by our late grandmother, and by Mother and Father. Reflect a little on what you said just now. Dont you think that Im right? Bao-yu listened in silence. His only response was to stare at the ceiling and smile. Since youre stuck for an answer, Bao-chai continued, you should listen to my advice. Pull yourself together from now on, and work as hard as you can. Do well in the examination, and even if you never achieve anything else in your entire life, that will at least be some return for Heavens favour and for your ancestors virtue. Bao-yu nodded and heaved a sigh Doing well in the examination is not that difficult. And what you say about never achieving anything else and making some return for Heavens favour and our ancestors virtue is very much to the point .. Before Bao-chai could reply to this, Aroma put in her word I didnt really understand what Mrs Bao was saying about the sages of old. All I know is that weve all stuck with you through thick and thin since we were children, tending you with more devotion than I can say. Of course, I know thats only as it should be, but shouldnt you show us a little consideration in return? And look at the devotion Mrs Bao has shown to the Master and Her Ladyship, all for your sake! Even if you dont set great store by your marriage, surely you owe her a simple debt of gratitude for what she has done? As for all that stuff about immortality, thats just a lot of hot air. Who ever actually saw an immortal set foot in this world of ours? Some monk turns up from goodness knows where, talking a lot of rubbish, and you go and take him seriously! Youre an educated man, surely you dont give more weight to his words than you do to the Masters and Her Ladyships? Bao-yu bowed his head in silence. Aroma had more ammunition ready, but just then footsteps were heard outside, and a voice came through the window Is Uncle Bao at home? Bao-yu recognized Jia Lans voice, stood up and said pleasantly Come in! Jia Lan entered, his face wreathed in smiles. He paid his respects to Bao-yu and Bao-chai, and exchanged greetings with Aroma, before presenting Bao-yu with Jia Zhengs letter, which Ban-yu took from him and read. So my sister is coming back to town, then? Judging from the letter it seems more than likely, was Jia Lans reply. Bao-yu nodded his head in thoughtful silence, and Jia Lan continued You see at the end of the letter, Uncle Bao, Grandfather urges us to get down to some serious work. I dont suppose youve been doing many compositions recently, have you? Bao-yu laughed Id like to do a few, just to keep my hand in. Why not? May as well pull the wool over their eyes! In that case, suggested Jia Lan, why dont you propose a few themes, and well write them together. That will help us prepare for the exam. I certainly dont want to hand in a blank sheet and make a fool of us both. I know you will do nothing of the kind, said Bao-yu. Bao-chai asked Jia Lan to take a seat. Bao-yu sat down again himself in his original chair, while Jia Lan perched politely nearby, and they chatted for a while about their compositions, their conversation becoming quite animated. Bao-chai, seeing the two of them thus engrossed, discreetly withdrew, thinking to herself It almost seems as if Bao-yu may have seen the light.
Bao-yu! How could you... Her whole body broke into a cold sweat and she could say no more. They tried to calm her down and support her. She sweated more and more profusely and became colder by degrees. Tan-chun and Li Wan told the maids to put up her hair and dress her in her and to be quick about it. Her eyes rolled upwards. Alas! Her fragrant soul disperses, wafted on the breeze Her sorrows now a dream, drifting into the night. The moment Dai-yu breathed her last was the moment that Bao-yu took Bao-chai to be his wife. Nightingale and Dai-yus other maids began to wail and lament Li Wan and Tan-chun recalled all their past affection for her, a memory made the more poignant by the lonely circumstances of her death, and they too shed many bitter and heartfelt tears. The wedding chamber was a off, and the guests heard nothing of the weeping, but from the Naiads House, in a brief interval of silence between their lamentations, they heard a faint snatch of music in the distance. They strained their ears to catch it, but it was gone. Tan-chun and Li Wan went out into the garden to listen again, but all they could hear was the rustling of the bamboos in the wind. The moonlight cast a wavering shadow on the wall. It was an eerie, desolate night. Presently they sent for Steward Lins wife and had Dai-yu properly laid out. Maids were set to watch the body. Early next morning they reported her death to who was now placed in an acute dilemma Grannie Jia and Lady Wang were both extremely busy and distraught, Jia Zheng was about to leave, Bao-yu in a worse stupor than ever if she broke the bad news to them now, she was afraid for Grandmother Jias and Lady Wangs health. They were already burdened with so many worries, and might not be equal to the shock. She decided to go to the Garden herself. When she arrived at the Naiads House and went inside, she could not help but weep. She spoke to Li Wan and Tan-chun, and learned that all the correct preparations had been made for the laying out. Good, she said, resuming her brisk tone of voice. But I wish you had told me earlier. I have been so worried. How could we? they replied. Sir Zheng was just leaving. Perhaps it was considerate of you, said Xi-feng, on reflection. Well, I must go back and see to the other half of this lovesick pair. I really do not know what to do for the best. I ought to tell them today. But if I do, I am afraid it may be too much for Grandmother. You do what you think best, said Li Wan. Xi-feng nodded and hurried back. She arrived to find the doctor with Bao-yu. Hearing him say that Bao-yus condition was nothing to worry about, and seeing that Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang were calmer as a consequence, she decided to tell them without further delay. She broke it to them as gently as possible, in a place where there was no chance of Bao-yu overhearing. The news had a shattering effect, and Grandmother Jia broke down in tears. I am to blame! I have brought this on her! But why did she have to be so obstinate and foolish? She wanted to go to the Garden to mourn, but was torn between that and her concern for Bao-yu. Lady Wang and the others all tried to dissuade her, containing their own grief as best they could, and saying You shouldnt go, Mother. You must take care of yourself. Grandmother Jia submitted to their counsel, and had to content herself with sending Lady Wang in her place. Give her spirit this message from me. Tell her It is not because I am hard-hearted that I have not come to bid you farewell, but because my grandson needs me. here. You are my daughters child, I know. But Bao-yu is a Jia, and I cannot leave him now. If I did and he were to die, how would I ever be able to look his father in the face again? The old lady broke down again. Lady Wang tried to console her We all know how much you loved Miss Lin, Mother. But the fates have decreed her an early death. She is dead now and there is nothing more we can do for her, except give her the best possible funeral. That at least will be some expression of our love for her, and will bring some peace to her departed spirit, and that of her dear mother.
It could be that she encountered some evil spirit on the way and is now possessed. I happen to know of an excellent fortune-teller in town, by the name of Half-Immortal Mao. He hails from the South, and is something of a specialist in The Book of Changes. I think we should ask him for a consultation first. See if he can shed any light on the matter. If that gets us nowhere, then lets by all means look for another doctor. Cousin Zhen agreed, and they sent for the fortune-teller at once. When he arrived, he and Jia Rong sat down together in the study and after drinking his tea Half-Immortal Mao began the consultation proper On what matter does my esteemed client wish me to consult the Changes? It concerns my mother, said Jia Rong. She has fallen ill. Could you please seek some illumination from the Changes on her behalf? Very well, replied Mao. First I shall require some clean water with which to wash my hands. Then, will you be so good as to light some incense, and to set up a small altar? And I shall proceed with the divination. The servants carried out these instructions, and Mao extracted the divining cylinder from within his gown, approached the altar, and after making a profound reverence began shaking the cylinder, intoning the following prayer In the name of the Supreme Ultimate, of the Yin and of the Yang, and of the Generative Powers of the Cosmos in the name of the Holy Signs made manifest in the Great River, which embody the Myriad Transformations of the Universe, and of the Saints who in their wisdom leave no sincere request unheeded here, in good faith, Mr Jia, on the occasion of his mothers illness, devoutly beseeches the Four Sages, Fu Xi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, to look down from above and vouchsafe an efficacious response to this his earnest supplication. If evil lies hidden, then bring the evil to light if good, then show the good. First we ask to be told the Three Lines of the Lower Trigram. He turned the cylinder upside down and the coins fell onto the tray. Ah! Most efficacious for the Prime we have a Moving Yin. The second throw gave a Yang At Rest, the third another Moving Yin. Picking up the coins, Half-Immortal Mao said The Lower Trigram has been communicated. Now let us ask to receive the Three Lines of the Upper Trigram, and thus complete the Hexagram. These fell as follows Yang At Rest, Yin At Rest, Yang At Rest. Half-Immortal Mao replaced the cylinder and coins inside his gown, and sat down. Pray be seated, he said. Let us consider this in greater detail. We have here the sixty-fourth Hexagram, Before Completion x-. The Line of most significance to you and to your generation is the Tertian, with Fire at the Seventh Branch Wu, and the SignatureRuin. This certainly indicates that Dire Misfortune lies in store. You have asked me to consult the Changes concerning your mothers illness, and great attention should therefore be paid to the parental Prime, which contains the Signature Spectre, as does the Quintal. It would seem that your mother is indeed seriously afflicted. But all will still be for the best. The present misfortune is concatenated with Water at the First Branch Zi and at the Twelfth Branch Hai but when this element wanes, with the Third Branch Yin comes Wood and thence Fire. The Signature Offspring at the Tertian also counteracts the Spectral influence, and with the regenerative effect of the continuing revolution of both the solar and lunar bodies, in two days the Spectre originally concatenated with Water at the First Branch Zi should be rendered void, and by the day Xu all will be well. But I see that the parental Prime contains further Spectral permutations. I fear your father may himself be afflicted. And your own personal Line has a severe concentration of Ruin. When Water reaches its zenith and Earth its nadir, be prepared for misfortune to strike. Mao sat back, thrusting his beard forward, as if to emphasize the authenticity of his prognosis. At the beginning of this rigmarole it was all Jia Rong could do to keep a straight face. But gradually Mao impressed him as a man who knew what he was talking about, and when he went on to predict misfortune for Cousin Zhen, Jia Rong began to take him rather more seriously. Your exposition is certainly very learned, he commented. But could you, I wonder, be more precise as to the nature of the illness that is affilicting my mother? In the Hexagram, replied Mao, Fire at the Seventh Branch Wu in the Prime changes to Water and is thus controlled.
He took a step towards her and said with a polite smile Of course not, sister-in-law. Now that the conversation was launched, Moonbeam disappeared inside and left them to it. Jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling, but there was something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly befuddled innocence in his eyes, that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled to the distant land of Java. She smiled. You mean, you have to be led to water .. Precisely. Im really no drinker. Im glad to hear it. Better than your cousin, anyway, forever boozing his way into trouble. At least your wife wont be left to sleep in an empty bed ... She narrowed her eyes at him suggestively, and her cheeks began to glow. Xue Ke saw serious danger ahead, and decided to make a dash for it while he still could. But he was too slow. Jin-gui was not going to let him slip through her fingers now! In a second she was on him and had him in her clutches. Sister-in-law! cried Xue Ke in consternation. This is most undignified! He was trembling all over. Jin-gui threw caution to the winds. Come in here with me. Theres something important I have to tell you. Things had reached this critical juncture when a voice behind her called Mrs Pan! Its Caltrop. Shes coming this way! Jin-gui glanced wildly behind her. Moonbeam had lifted the portiere to observe the course the interview was taking and then when she caught sight of Caltrop coming from the other direction, had hastened to warn Jin-gui. Jin-gui in her panic relaxed her grip, and Xue Ke seized his chance of escape. Caltrop herself had noticed nothing and had been walking innocently on her way until Moonbeam called out, when she looked round and to her horror saw Jin-gui dragging Xue Ke into her boudoir. Caltrop immediately turned about and, heart thumping, began walking back in the direction she had come from. Jin-gui stood there a while, and stared in angry dismay after the vanishing form of Xue Ke. Then she gave a snort of exasperation and withdrew to her apartment, smarting with thwarted desire. Caltrop, who had come through the side gate and was making her way to Bao-qins when she stumbled upon them, hurried back to her room. Resentment towards Caltrop now festered within Jin-guis bosom, and the poison worked its way into the very marrow of her being. Later that same day, Bao-chai was in Grandmother Jias apartment, and heard Lady Wang speaking of the betrothal Jia Zheng had proposed for Tan-chun. Im glad the boys from a Nanking family, said Grandmother Jia. But if he came here once before, I cant understand why Zheng has never mentioned it. We knew nothing about it either, said Lady Wang. I can see advantages in the match, said Grandmother Jia. The only objection is the dreadful distance involved. I know that Zheng is posted there at present. But supposing he is transferred later on, poor Tan will be so isolated. With official families, theres no telling where they may be posted, replied Lady Wang. The boys father may also be recalled to the capital. Even if he isnt, one way or another the falling leaf returns to the root, as they say theyre bound to come home sooner or later. Besides, Zhengs superior is in favour of the match, and it would be very difficult for him to refuse. I think he has more or less made up his mind already, and has only written to you for your formal approval, Mother. If you are both in favour of it, said Grandmother Jia, then well and good. It grieves me, though, to think how long it may be before Tan is able to come back and visit us. If it is more than a year or two, I fear I may no longer be alive to see her. She wept as she spoke. Marriage is something that happens to every girl once she grows up, said Lady Wang, and even if the husbands family is a local one, you can never be sure that the two of them will stay in the district. He may always be posted away from home. Thats one of the hazards of official life. The most important thing is that they should be happy together. Take Ying-chuns case. Her husband lives nearby. But that has not meant happiness for her. They never seem to stop fighting, and now he wont even feed her properly, and forbids her to touch any of the things we send. And from what I hear, things are getting worse.
By so doing she would at least have fulfilled her duty as a maid and died a noble death. In Bao-yus apartment she was doing little more than marking time. Although he was very considerate and affectionate towards her, she knew that nothing would ever come of it. All these thoughts added a note of personal grief to her lamentations. Lady Wang sent at once for Faithfuls sister-in-law. She told her to supervise the encoffinment, and after consulting with Lady Xing, issued her an allowance of one hundred taels from Grandmother Jias fund. She also promised to sort out all Faithfuls private effects and give them to her as soon as she had time. The sister-in-law kowtowed, and so far from exhibiting any signs of grief, seemed rather pleased. What wonderful courage Faithful showed! she exclaimed. And what a lucky girl she is, to have won such glory, and such a splendid funeral into the bargain! One of the serving-women nearby rebuked her Thats quite enough from you! A hundred taels is a poor bargain for your own sister-in4aws life! Think how much more profit youd have made out of her if youd only managed to flog her earlier on to Sir She! Then youd have had something to crow about! The words struck home, and Faithfuls sister-in4aw departed blushing. At the inner gate she met Steward Lin with a team of men carrying in the coffin and returned with them, helping them lay Faithfuls corpse in the coffin, and herself putting on a show of mourning. Since Faithful had died in the best Confucian tradition, Out of devotion to her mistress, Jia Zheng sent for incense and himself lit three joss-sticks before her coffin. For her loyalty and devotion, he said, having made a solemn bow, she deserves to be elevated above the rank of a mere maid. The younger generation must pay homage to her. Bao-yus delight knew no bounds. He came forward and with almost exaggerated reverence performed a series of full-blown kowtows. Jia Lian also recalled Faithfuls past kindnesses to him, and would have followed suit, but Lady Xing restrained him One of the masters is quite enough. Too much of this might ruin her chances of being born again... Jia Lian desisted. But Bao-chai felt uneasy at Lady Xings words. Strictly speaking, I shouldnt kowtow to her, she said. But this is a special case. We are all of us too bound by our commitments to the living to give in to any extreme display of grief. But Faithful has acted for us. She has given the fullest expression to our devotion, and now we should ask her to continue serving Grandmother in the next world on our behalf That would at least be a small token of our love! She walked forward on Orioles arm and poured a libation of wine before Faithfuls coffin, the tears streaming in profusion down her cheeks. When the libation was completed, she kowtowed several times in succession and sobbed emotionally. Some of the assembled company commented wryly that now Bao-yu and his wife were both demented others protested that their conduct evinced a sincere grief while some restricted themselves to observing that they had at least manifested a sense of what was right and proper. Jia Zheng, for his part, was pleased with them. He had by now settled the caretaking arrangements, and it was agreed that Xi-feng and Xi-chun would stay behind, while all the other ladies would take part in the procession. No one slept a great deal that night. At four in the morning, the cortege could be heard gathering outside, and by seven it was ready to move off, with Jia Zheng at the head, in full mourning attire and weeping profusely, as the rites demanded of a filial son. The street was lined with the funeral booths of countless families, which need not be described in detail here. At last they reached the Temple of the Iron Threshold and the coffins were set out, while the menfolk in mourning prepared to spend the night at the temple. -1536 At home, Steward Lin supervised the dismantling of the funeral awning, carefully bolted the doors and put up the shutters on the windows, swept the courtyard and appointed wardens for the nightwatch, to commence their duties that evening. It was a well-established rule at Rong-guo House that the innermost gate was closed at ten, and after that hour entrance to the inner apartments was strictly forbidden to males. Female domestics kept the watch inside. Xi-feng, despite a nights rest, had still not recovered from her attack, and although she seemed a little more composed, she was certainly not capable of getting about.
Sister Adamantina has disappeared! exclaimed the nun. Shes probably in Our Lady Guan-yins chapel meditating. Youre all still dreaming! Come and have a look. The women finally roused themselves in a flurry of alarm, opened the main gate of the Hermitage and searched throughout the Garden. Then it occurred to them that Adamantina might have gone to visit Xi-chun, and they went in a body to knock at the side gate, only to receive another round of abuse from Bao Yong. We dont know where Sister Adamantina went last night, they said. Were looking for her. Open up, old fellow, and let us into the house. We just want to find out if shes been visiting there or not. She was the one who let the burglars in! cried Bao Yong. Now theyve got what they came for, and shes gone off with them to enjoy it! Holy name! exclaimed one of the women. Youll have your tongue cut out in hell for such wicked talk! Bao Yong vehemently Rubbish! Any more trouble from you and Ill have to use force. Women smiling obsequiously now and pleading Please sir, we beseech you, open the gate. Just let us have a look. If shes not there, well never bother you again. Bao Yong Very well. If you dont believe me, go in and look for yourselves. But if you dont find her, I shall want an explanation from you on your way back. He opened the gate and the women went into Xi-chuns apartment. Xi-chun was in very low spirits that morning, and was still brooding about what had happened the previous day Adamantina went home so early yesterday. I wonder if she heard what that servant Bao Yong said. If he has offended her again, shell never come and visit me and then I shall have lost my only real friend in the world. With Mother and Father both dead and my own sister-in-law hating me the way she does, I find it so hard to face other people. Before there was always Granny Jia, I knew I could count on her for affection. Now that shes gone too, Im utterly alone. What will become of me? She thought of the other girls and their various fates Ying-chun driven to her death Xiang-yun married to a consumptive Tan-chun living at the other end of the world ... Each one of them had her destiny, and each was powerless to change its course. Adamantina is the only free one among us, free as a wandering cloud or a wild crane. If I could only be like her, how happy I would be! But how can I hope to follow her example? I belong to a wealthy family! And now Ive let even my family down, and Im in complete disgrace. Neither Aunt Wang nor Aunt Xing understands how I feel. Theres no telling how life will turn out for me! She was more resolved than ever to take the final, irrevocable step, to cut her hair and by so doing signal once and for all her entry into the religious life. Landscape and the other maids heard the snip of the scissors and hurried over, but they were too late. She had already removed a good half of her hair. Before one disaster is over, heres another! cried Landscape in alarm. What are we to do now? This was the state of disarray that prevailed in Xi-chuns apartment when Adamantinas old women arrived on their search. Landscape enquired what their mission was and was shocked to hear of Adamantinas disappearance. She left us early yesterday morning and hasnt been back since, she informed them. Xi-chun overheard from inside and asked in alarm Where has Adamantina gone? One of the women told the tale, how they had heard sounds in the night, had been put to sleep by the incense, had found Adamantina missing in the morning and discovered the rope-ladder and scabbard by the Garden wall. Xi-chun was both distressed and puzzled. She recalled Bao Yongs accusations of the previous day, but dismissed them at once from her mind, reflecting that most probably the burglars had spotted Adamantina and come back during the night to carry her off. But she knew Adamantina surely a person of such chastity and pride would have died rather than submit to such indignity? Didnt you hear anything? she asked of the women. We heard, they replied. But we couldnt do anything. We could only lie there with our eyes wide open, unable to say a word. The burglars must have put us to sleep by burning some sort of incense. And Sister Adamantina must have been overcome with the fumes too. Thats why she couldnt speak either. Besides, there were probably a lot of them, armed to the hilt, so she would have been too scared to make a noise or cry out.
Her heart ached with grief, tears poured down her cheeks and she began wailing despondently. Memories flooded back of the affection Bao-yu had shown her. I annoyed him sometimes, I know, and then hed be cross. But he always had a way of making it up. He was so kind to me, and so thoughtful. In heated moments he often would vow to become a monk. I never believed him. And now hes gone! It was two oclock in the morning by now, and still there was no sign of Bao-yu. Li Wan, afraid that Lady Wang would injure herself through excess of grief, did her best to console her and advised her to retire to bed. The rest of the family accompanied her to her room, except for Lady Xing who returned to her own apartment, and Jia Huan who was still lying low and had not dared to make an appearance at all. Lady Wang told Jia Lan to go back to his room, and herself spent a sleepless night. Next day at dawn some of the servants despatched the previous day returned, to report that they had searched everywhere and failed to find the slightest trace of Bao-yu. During the morning a stream of relations including Aunt Xue, Xue Ke, Shi Xiang-yun, Bao-qin and old Mrs Li came to enquire after Lady Wangs health and to ask for news of Bao-yu. After several days of this, Lady Wang was so consumed with grief that she could neither eat nor drink, and her very life seemed in danger. Then suddenly a servant announced a messenger from the Commandant of the Haimen Coastal Region, who brought news that Tan-chun was due to arrive in the capital the following day. Although this could not totally dispel her grief at Bao-yus disappearance, Lady Wang felt some slight comfort at the thought of seeing Tan-chun again. The next day, Tan-chun arrived at Rong-guo House and they all went out to the front to greet her, finding her lovelier than ever and most prettily dressed. When Tan-chun saw how Lady Wang had aged, and how red-eyed everyone in the family was, tears sprang to her eyes, and it was a while before she could stop weeping and greet them all properly. She was also distressed to see Xi-chun in a nuns habit, and wept again to learn of Bao-yus strange disappearance and the many other family misfortunes. But she had always been gifted with a knack of finding the right thing to say, and her natural equanimity restored a degree of calm to the gathering and gave some real comfort to Lady Wang and the rest of the family. The next day her husband came to visit, and when he learned how things stood he begged her to stay at home and console her family. The maids and old serving-women who had accompanied her to her new home were thus granted a welcome reunion with their old friends. The entire household, masters and servants alike, still waited anxiously day and night for news of Bao-yu. Very late one night, during the fifth watch, some servants came as far as the inner gate, announcing that they had indeed wonderful news to report, and a couple of the junior maids hurried in to the inner apartments, without stopping to inform the senior maids. Maam, ladies! they announced. Wonderful news! Lady Wang thought that Bao-yu must at last have been found and rising from her bed she exclaimed with delight Where did they find him? Send him in at once to see me! He has been placed seventh on the roll of successful candidates! the maid cried. But has he been found? The maid was silent. Lady Wang sat down again. Who came seventh? asked Tan-chun. Mr Bao. As they were talking they heard a voice outside shouting Master Lan has passed too! A servant went hurrying out to receive the official notice, on which it was written that Jia Lan had been placed one hundred and thirtieth on the roll. Since there was still no news of Bao-yus whereabouts, Li Wan did not feel free to express her feelings of pride and joy and Lady Wang, delighted as she was that Jia Lan had passed, could not help thinking to herself If only Bao-yu were here too, what a happy celebration it would be! Bao-chai alone was still plunged in gloom, though she felt it inappropriate to weep. The others were busy offering their congratulations and trying to look on the cheerful side Since it was Bao-yus fate to pass, he cannot remain lost for long. In a day or two he is sure to be found. This plausible suggestion brought a momentary smile to Lady Wangs cheeks, and the family seized on this opportunity to persuade her to eat and drink a little.
But I grew older, and when my father resigned from his post and had little further inclination for social entertaining, the role of host devolved upon me. In the course of my duties I observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom I met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name. All their written works or spoken words were of l6yalty and filial piety, their entire lives were devoted to virtue and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed upon them by their fathers and teachers alike. So gradually I cast off the intractable theories and foolish passions of my youth. I am still searching for teachers and friends of a like mind to instruct me and guide me out of my benighted ignorance, and I consider it a great blessing to have met you. I feel sure that I have much to learn from you. Believe me, what I said earlier was in earnest. The more Jia Bao-yu heard the more exasperated he felt. For politeness sake he mumbled something ambiguous in reply, and was saved from further embarrassment by a summons from the inner apartments If the gentlemen have eaten, would Mr Zhen please join the ladies? Bao-yu seized this opportunity, promptly inviting Zhen Bao-yu to lead the way, and they proceeded to Lady Wangs apartment, followed by the other boys. Seeing Lady Zhen seated in the place of honour, Jia Bao-yu paid her his respects, Jia Huan and Jia Lan followed suit, and Zhen Bao-yu likewise paid his respects to Lady Wang. At last the two ladies and their two jades were face to face. Although Jia Bao-yu was now married, Lady Zhen was old enough not to have to stand on ceremony on that account, especially as the connection between their two families was such a long-standing one. She saw how alike the two of them were, and could not help warming towards Jia Bao-yu with Lady Wang it was the same, she took Zhen Bao-yu by the hand and plied him with questions, finding him rather more mature than her own son. She glanced at Jia Lan, and reflected to herself that he too cut a fine figure though not quite on a level with the two jades, he could certainly hold his own in their company. Jia Huans uncouth appearance, on the other hand, aroused all her old antipathy. When it became known that both jades were present together, all the maids came to have a look. How extraordinary! they murmured to one another. Its one thing for them to have the same name but they even look alike - face, build, everything! Luckily our Bao-yu is dressed in mourning white or wed never be able to tell them apart! Nightingale in particular seemed momentarily quite stunned. She was thinking of Dai-yu If only she were still alive! They might have married her to this Bao-yu. I think shed have been willing enough..., Even as these thoughts were running through her head, she heard Lady Zhen say A few days ago, I believe my husband, who now considers our Bao-yu of an age to be married, asked Sir Zheng to look out for a suitable bride for him. Lady Wang was already much taken with Zhen Bao-yu and without any hesitation she replied I should be glad to act as a matchmaker for your son. Of our own girls, two have passed away, and one is already married. Cousin Zhen of Ning-guo House has an unmarried younger sister, but she is a few years too young for the match. I have another idea, though My elder daughter-in-law, a member of the Li family by birth, ha two cousins, both fine good-looking girls. The older of the two already betrothed, but the younger is not and would make an excellent bride for your son. I will make the proposal on your behalf. I ought perhaps to mention that their family circumstances are somewhat reduced. You are being unnecessarily polite, said Lady Zhen. Nowadays, we are nothing to boast about ourselves. In fact they may consider us beneath them. But your husband has been given this new commission, said Lady Wang, and I feel certain that in the future he will not only be restored to his former prosperity, but will rise to new heights of glory. Lady Zhen smiled I only hope your predictions come true. Well, in that case, I should be most grateful if you would propose the match on our behalf. Zhen Bao-yu, on hearing them broach the subject of his betrothal, excused himself and was escorted by Jia Bao-yu and the other boys back to the study, where they rejoined Jia Zheng and stood for a while talking.
The guests scented trouble in the air, and either sneaked out into the private apartments at the back of the mansion, or stood stock-still where they were, in an attitude of apprehensive respect. J ia Zheng managed to maintain an anxious smile, and was about to attempt a response to one of Zhaos pleasantries when a flustered servant entered the hall and announced His Highness the Prince of Xi-ping! Jia Zheng hurried out once again, to find the prince already entering the courtyard. Commissioner Zhao moved smartly forward ahead of Jia Zheng to salute the prince, and then gave his own aides their orders His Royal Highness has now arrived take your men and post yourselves at the front and rear gates of the mansion. Zhaos aides went off to do his bidding, while Jia Zheng and the other menfolk, filled with foreboding by this sinister turn of events, fell to their knees and kowtowed before the Prince of Xi-ping. The prince raised Jia Zheng with both hands and said with a reassuring smile I would not intrude on you at such a time did I not have special reasons I am entrusted with an Imperial Edict for your brother, Sir She. But I see that we have come upon you in the midst of a private gathering, and as it would hardly be fitting to proceed while your friends and relatives are still present, I would ask them to leave. Only the members of your own household need remain behind. A most gracious gesture, I am sure, interposed Commissioner Zhao sharply. But His Highness supervising operations at Ning-guo House is, I believe, taking this matter a little more seriously, and has already ordered every gate to be sealed. The guests learned from this that both mansions were in some sort of trouble, and began to fear that they themselves were trapped as well. The prince, however, seemed unperturbed, and announced smilingly Gentlemen, please consider yourselves free to leave. Send for some of my men to escort them out, he continued, addressing Zhao, and tell your own officers that these are all guests and are not to be bindered or subjected to any kind of search, but are to be let through without delay. As soon as they heard this, the guests vanished like a puff of smoke, leaving only Jia She, Jia Zheng and the immediate family, who stood there trembling and pale with fear. Shortly afterwards, constables swarmed in and stationed themselves at every doorway, thereby denying freedom of movement to masters and servants alike. Zhao turned to the prince, his face positively venomous Will Your Highness be so good as to read the Edict, so that we can proceed with our task? The constables hitched up their robes, rolled up their sleeves, and stood smartly to attention to hear the Edict. The prince began his preamble with great deliberation I am hereby instructed by His Majesty to proceed with Commissioner Zhao Quan of the Embroidered Jackets and to search, and take a complete inventory of the property of Jia She. Jia She cowered prostrate on the ground as the prince mounted the terrace and, facing south, began the proclamation of the Edict proper Hearken! Inasmuch as Our subject Jia She has connived with a provincial official and has used his influence to persecute a defenceless citizen, he has shown himself unworthy of Our favour, has disgraced his ancestors, and is to be deprived of his hereditary rank. By Imperial Decree. Arrest him! barked Zhao. Take the others away and put them under close guard! This referred to the other Jia menfolk present - Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Cousin Zhen, Jia Rong, Jia Qiang, Jia Zhi and Jia Lan. Bao-yu had somehow managed to slip out to Grandmother Jias apartment earlier, on the pretext of some indisposition or other, while Jia Huan hardly ever put in an appearance at such social gatherings. Zhao also told his aides to issue the junior officers and constables with their orders at once they were to divide up and search the mansion room by room, taking a detailed inventory as they went along. These orders, and the brisk matter-of-fact efficiency with which they were delivered, had a devastating impact on the morale of the Jia family, young and old alike. They looked at one another in terror as they were led away, while Zhaos constables and personal lackeys began rubbing their hands in gleeful anticipation. I understand, said the Prince of Xi-ping, that Sir Zheng and Sir She maintain separate establishments. Since the Edict only empowers us to search Sir Shes property, the other apartments should be locked and sealed, until such time as I have received further instructions from His Majesty. Zhao rose to his feet.
How can you talk like that? After being here all these months, surely you must know whats on my mind? And if none of the others will speak for me, wont you let me tell you myself? Do you want me to go on bottling it up inside for ever, and choke to death? He too began sobbing his heart out, when a voice was heard behind him, Saying Who, pray, should speak for you? Why drag others into it? Youve offended her, so you jolly well make it up. Its up to her to decide whether shell forgive you. Why put the blame on nobodies like us? Both Bao-yu on the outside of the window and Nightingale on the inside were greatly startled by this intruder - who turned out to be Musk. Bao-yu felt most embarrassed, as Musk continued What is going on here? One grovelling for forgiveness, the other refusing to take any notice. Come on now, you hurry up and apologize and as for you, Nightingale, youre being altogether too cruel! Its dreadfully cold out here, and hes been pleading with you for ages and not had so much as a breath of a response! She turned to Bao-yu Its late, and Mrs Baos been wondering where you are. To think that youve been here all along, standing out on your own under the eaves! What are you up to? Honestly! protested Nightingale from inside. This is ridiculous! I simply asked him to go away. I told him that whatever he had to talk about could wait till the morning. Whats the sense in all this? Bao-yu still wanted to speak to Nightingale, but now that they were no longer alone, he felt too embarrassed to continue. He resigned himself to returning with Musk, saying as he walked So be it! I shall never in this lifetime be able to prove my feelings! Heaven alone will know the truth! -320 Tears started suddenly to his eyes and rolled in torrents down cheeks. Mr Bao! said Musk. Take my advice and put the whole thing out of your mind. Youre wasting your tears. Bao-yu followed her silently to his room. Bao-chai was lying asleep, or rather, as he judged, feigning sleep, but Aroma greeted him with a rebuke Couldnt it have waited till tomorrow? Did you have to go storming out there and work yourself up into another... Whatever she had been about to Say, she thought better of it, and after a short pause went on to ask Are you sure youre not feeling poorly? Bao-yu said nothing, but shook his head. Aroma put him to bed and it goes without saying that he spent a sleepless night. Nightingale was most distressed by Bao-yus visit, and she too lay awake the whole of that night, weeping and reflecting deeply to herself It seems plain that the family conspired together and tricked him into the wedding at a time when he was too ill to understand. Then afterwards, when he knew what he had done , he suffered one of his attacks and thats why he hasnt been able to stop weeping and moping ever since. Hes obviously not the heartless, wicked person I took him for. Why, today his devotion was so touching, I felt really sorry for him. What a dreadful pity it is that our Miss Lin never had the fortune to be his bride! Such unions are clearly determined by fate. Until fate reveals itself, men continue to indulge in blind passion and fond imaginings then, when the die is cast and the truth is known, the fools may remain impervious, hut the ones who care deeply, the men of true sentiment, can only weep bitterly at the futility of their romantic attachments, at the tragedy of their earthly plight. She is dead and knows nothing but he still lives, and there is no end to his suffering and torment. Better by far the destiny of plant or stone, bereft of knowledge and consciousness, but blessed at least with purity and peace of mind! These philosophical reflections cooled the feverish turmoil in Nightingales mind, and she was tidying up and preparing to go to bed, when she heard a great rumpus break out in the direction of Xi-fengs apartment to the east. But to discover what this portended, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 114 Wang Xi-feng ends her lifes illusion and returns to Jinling Zhen Ying-jia receives the Emperors favour and is summoned to the Palace It was the middle of the night when Bao-yu and Bao-chai were awoken and informed that Xi-feng was dying. They rose from bed at once, a maid brought a lighted candle, and they were on their way out of the courtyard, when another message came from Lady Wang Mrs Lians condition is critical, but she is still alive, and Mr and Mrs Bao should wait a while.
All was silent in the inner room they must be asleep, he thought to himself. But he needed to discover if Musk was still awake. He called her name a couple of times, and there was no reply. Fivey heard, however What do you want, Mr Bao? Id like to rinse my mouth. Fivey could see that Musk was asleep, so she hurriedly rose from her bed, trimmed the wick in the lamp again and took Bao-yu a cup of tea, carrying the spittoon in her other hand. She was in too much of a hurry to change, and had nothing but a little pink silk jacket over her pajamas. Her hair was loosely coiled on top of her head. Looking at her, Bao-yu could almost imagine Skybright come back from the dead. Suddenly he remembered Skybrights dying words If Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently... He stared at Fivey in a besotted fashion, quite oblivious of the teacup in her outstretched hand. Ever since the departure of Parfume, Fivey had given up all idea of coming to serve at Green Delights but then, when Xi-feng gave orders for her to be taken into Bao-yus service, she was more excited about it than Bao-yu himself. To her surprise, after her arrival the generally distinguished and dignified manner in which Bao-chai and Aroma conducted themselves made a deep impression on her, and she found herself coming to respect and admire them greatly, whereas Bao-yu by contrast seemed to her to have degenerated into a complete idiot, and to be not half so handsome as he used to be. Besides she knew that Lady Wang had dismissed some of the maids for flirting with Bao-yu, and she therefore decided to dismiss any foolish and romantic notions she might previously have entertained concerning him. But now here he was, the simpleton, evidently taking a fancy to her she knew nothing of the process by which his feelings for Skybright had been transferred to her. Both her cheeks were burning. She did not dare say anything out loud, but whispered Mr Bao, please go ahead and rinse your mouth! He smiled and took the cup in his hand. She could not tell whether he ever did rinse his mouth or not, as the next she knew he was giggling and asking her Werent you friends with Skybright? Fivey didnt understand what he was getting at. Of course. We were all of us on good terms. Bao-yu lowered his voice to a whisper When Skybright was so very ill, I went to visit her. You were there, werent you? Fivey smiled and nodded her head. Did you hear her say anything? asked Bao-yu. No, replied Fivey, shaking her head. Bao-yu held Fiveys hand. He seemed to be completely carried away. She blushed fiercely and her heart missed a beat. Mr Bao! she whispered. Whatevers on your mind, just go ahead and say it. But please stop behaving like this. Bao-yu let go of her hand. If Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently Thats what Skybright said. Surely you must have heard? It seemed quite plain to Fivey what manner of different behaviour he had in mind. She felt she must protest If thats what she said, she should have been ashamed of herself! No decent girl would suggest a thing like that! Dont you start preaching at me too! snapped Bao-yu irritably. I was thinking how like Skybright you looked - thats the only reason I told you what she said. How dare you slander her! Fivey could no longer discern Bao-yus true intentions. Its late, she said. You really should go to sleep and not sit up like this. You might catch cold. Didnt you hear what Mrs Bao and Aroma said just now? Im not cold, said Bao-yu. As he said this, it suddenly struck him that Fivey was most inadequately clad, and that she might catch a chill just as Skybright had done. Why arent you wearing a proper robe? he asked her. You called, and it sounded important, she replied. I was hardly going to take time off to dress! I would have, mind you, if Id kndwn you were going to keep me talking this long. Bao-yu handed Fivey the pale blue silken padded jacket that was lying on the bed, and told her to put it on. But she refused. You keep it - Im not cold. And anyway, Ive a perfectly good robe of my own. She went across to her bed and put on a long robe. She listened out for a moment.
I think he has more or less made up his mind already, and has only written to you for your formal approval, Mother. If you are both in favour of it, said Grandmother Jia, then well and good. It grieves me, though, to think how long it may be before Tan is able to come back and visit us. If it is more than a year or two, I fear I may no longer be alive to see her. She wept as she spoke. Marriage is something that happens to every girl once she grows up, said Lady Wang, and even if the husbands family is a local one, you can never be sure that the two of them will stay in the district. He may always be posted away from home. Thats one of the hazards of official life. The most important thing is that they should be happy together. Take Ying-chuns case. Her husband lives nearby. But that has not meant happiness for her. They never seem to stop fighting, and now he wont even feed her properly, and forbids her to touch any of the things we send. And from what I hear, things are getting worse. He wont allow her to come and visit us, and when the two of them quarrel, he pointedly reminds her that we owe his family money. Poor child! The future looks very bleak for her. The other day I was worried on her account and sent some of my women to call at the Sun home. Ying-chun was hiding in a side-room and wouldnt come out to see them. They insisted on going in, and found her freezing to death, poor thing, with nothing on but some threadbare old clothes. And it was a bitterly cold day! She broke down in front of them and begged them not to reveal her miserable plight to us at home. Its my fate to suffer like this, she said. And were not to send her any more clothes or food or anything. They never reach her, and her husband will only accuse her of complaining again and give her another beating. So you see, Mother, Ying may be close at hand, but the very closeness only makes her suffering harder for us to bear. Her mother turns a blind eye, and her father has refused to intervene at all. She is worse off than one of our lowest-grade maids! Although Tan is not my own daughter, Im sure Zheng wants to do the best for her. He has obviously seen the boy and must approve of him or he wouldnt be in favour of the match. So I hope youll agree, and then we can choose a lucky day for her to make the journey and send a proper escort to accompany her to Zhengs official residence. I am sure Zheng will see to it at his end that everything is done in a fitting manner. Very well then, Grandmother Jia concurred. Ill go along with Zhengs idea, and I leave it to you to make the necessary arrangements. Choose a suitable day in the almanac for travelling. There, the matter is settled now. Yes, Mother. Bao-chai heard all this clearly, and although she did not breathe a word of protest, she thought to herself sadly Tan is one of the very best of us. And now she is being married as well and sent away. One by one our numbers are dwindling. Seeing that Lady Wang had risen and was taking her leave, Baochai accompanied her out of the room and then returned immediately to her own apartment. She said nothing to Bao-yu of Tan-chuns engagement, but told Aroma later, when she found her sewing on her own. Aroma too was very unhappy at the news. Aunt Zhao, on the other hand, was positively delighted. The girls shown me nothing but disrespect, she thought to herself. No one would ever have guessed that I was her mother! I receive worse treatment at her hands than one of her maids! Shes always trying to better herself, and sides with anyone rather than her own mother or brother. With her in the way, Huan would never have been able to get anywhere. If her father has sent for her, then good riddance! Ive given up hoping for any respect from her. I hope shes as miserable as Ying is. Id be glad to see it happen. She hurried over to Tan-chuns apartment to offer her congratulations. You certainly are on your way up in the world, my dear! she crowed. Im sure life at your new home will be even more to your liking than it is here. You must be pleased. Now remember, I am your mother, for all the good its ever done me. So dont think of me as all bad. And dont forget about me altogether when youre gone. Tan-chun refused to respond to this display of Spite and kept her head bent silently over her needlework.
The matter of the promissory notes will be investigated personally by my master. Any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be confiscated outright according to the relevant statute notes negotiated at permissible rates, together with title-deeds of houses and land, will all be returned. Jia Lian is to be deprived of his position and rank, but otherwise will be exempted from further punishment and released. Jia Zheng rose from his seat and kowtowed in the appropriate direction for this act of Imperial clemency. He also bowed to the aide to express his profound gratitude for the princes intervention on his behalf. Be so good as to convey my thanks to His Highness. Tomorrow I shall attend court in order to express my gratitude to His Majesty in person, and shall also present myself at His Highnesss palace to make my kowtow. The princes aide took his leave. Shortly afterwards a court official arrived to proclaim the Edict, followed by the officers entrusted with its execution, who supervised the proceedings scrupulously, confiscating only what had been specified, and restoring everything else to its owner. Jia Lian was released, while Jia Shes domestic staff, men and women alike, were all taken away into public service. Jia Lians position was not to be envied. Some of the promissory notes and documents were returned, and none of his other property had been officially confiscated, but his apartment had been ransacked and nothing but the bare furniture had been left in place. His initial relief at being set free and escaping the punishment he feared soon gave way to a profound sense of loss, when he beheld his own and Xi-fengs possessions of a lifetime - altogether about sixty thousand taels worth - gone in a mornings work. His fathers imprisonment, Xi-fengs critical state of health the strain was almost more than he could bear. And now he had to face Jia Zheng, who summoned him and berated him, barely suppressing a sob I have, alas, been too busy of late with my official duties, and have paid insufficient attention to family matters. I thought I could rely on you and your wife I can hardly remonstrate with your father for his misconduct but this usury that has come to light - who in heavens name is responsible for that? Families like ours simply do not dabble in such things. The documents have been confiscated, and both principal and interest are forfeit but its not the money, its the appalling blow this will deal to our reputation! Jia Lian fell to his knees In managing our familys affairs, Uncle, I have never acted with a view to private gain. All the accounts have been kept by the stewards- Lai Da, Wu Xin-deng, Dai Liang and the others. Please summon them and hear the truth from their lips. These past few years, our expenditure has far exceeded our income, and there have been deficits in the accounts that I have simply been unable to make good, despite the numerous unsecured debts I have had to negotiate. Aunt Wang will be able to tell you all about it. As for the money loaned out, even I have no idea where that has come from. Youd better ask Zhou Rui and Brightie. So, you are telling me you dont even know what goes on in your own apartment, let alone the rest of the household! I shall not pursue this matter any further with you at present. Consider yourself extremely lucky to have been let off so lightly. Now youd better stir yourself and find out whats happening to your father and Cousin Zhen. Jia Lian felt very hard done by, but swallowed his tears and departed in obedience to his uncles instructions. Left alone, Jia Zheng ruminated on the familys misfortunes, heaving many a heartfelt sigh It was in vain that my grandfather and my great-uncle served the throne so loyally, winning the family great honour and two hereditary titles. Now both our houses have been disgraced, both titles have been stripped from us. And if I look further ahead, I can see no respite, no rising star in the younger generation capable of stemming this tide of degeneration! Great Heaven! That our noble line should have come to this! Thanks to an act of exceptional clemency on His Majestys part, I have been spared, and my property has been restored. But both households must now look to me for their daily sustenance, and how can I hope to support them all? This latest revelation of Lians is another grievous blow not only have we no reserves, we are seriously in debt. We have evidently been living under false pretences for years! And I have only my own stupidity to blame! How can I have been so blind? If only my eldest son were still alive! In Zhu I might at least have had some support.
As she was speaking there was a sudden noise outside, which startled them both, and shortly afterwards Bao-chai could be heard coughing in the inner room. Bao-yu made a quick motion with his lips, and Fivey hurriedly extinguished the lamp and stole back to bed. In fact, earlier that evening, both Bao-chai and Aroma had gone straight to sleep, exhausted after their previous sleepless night and the days exertions, and both of them had slept soundly through this conversation between Bao-yu and Fivey. It was the sudden noise in the courtyard that had woken them too. They listened for any further sound, but all was quiet. Bao-yu meanwhile lay down in bed again, and was thinking to himself That noise must surely have been Cousin Lin! She came, and then, when she heard me talking with Fivey, she decided to give us both a fright. He lay there tossing and turning, a thousand wild fancies running through his head, and only nodded off some time after three in the morning. Bao-yus advances had left Fivey with a guilty conscience, and when Bao-chai coughed she feared that they had both been overheard, and lay awake worrying about it all night. Early the next morning she rose, and seeing Bao-yu still fast asleep, began quietly tidying the room. Musk was already awake. Why are you up so early? she asked Fivey. Dont tell me youve been awake all night... This led Fivey to suspect that Musk had overheard them too. She smiled awkwardly and said nothing. Presently Bao-chai and Aroma got up, opened the door and came into the outer room, where they were greatly surprised to find Bao-yu still asleep. It puzzled them that he should have slept there so soundly on two consecutive nights. When Bao-yu awoke and saw them all standing around him, he sat up at once and rubbed his eyes. He thought back over the night. No, there had still been no dream. He had met no one. He consoled himself with the words of the old saying -1707 Fairies and mortals tread different paths, And neer the twain shall meet. As he climbed slowly down from his bed, Fiveys words about Bao-chai and Aroma were still ringing in his ears two such beautiful ladies. Yes, she was right, he thought to himself, and proceeded to stare at Bao-chai. Bao-chai thought he was drifting into one of his brown studies, and felt certain it must be to do with Dai-yu again, though she still had not enquired whether his dream had been fruitful or not. She soon began to feel uncomfortable under his penetrating gaze, and finally asked Well, did you meet a fairy last night or not? Bao-yu concluded from this that she must have overheard his tte--tte with Fivey. He gave a nervous little laugh and replied with feigned surprise What do you mean? Fivey for her part was feeling more and more guilty and apprehensive, and silently observed Bao-chais reaction. Bao-chai turned to her next and asked with a smile Well, did Mr Bao talk in his sleep last night? At this Bao-yu, muttering some incoherent excuse, walked rather sheepishly from the room. Fivey blushed fiercely and replied as evasively as she could He said something or other early in the night, but I didnt quite catch it. Something about knowing in advance that things would be like this, and then something about behaving rather differently. I couldnt understand what he was trying to say, so I just told him to go back to sleep. Then I fell asleep myself, and if he said any more I certainly didnt hear it. Bao-chai lowered her head in thought Obviously something to do with Dai-yu. If I let him go on sleeping in the outer room hes bound to get more and more of these weird ideas into his head, and who knows what strange apparitions and flower fairies well have then. It is his weakness for our sex that has always been his vulnerable spot. How can I win him over myself? Until I can do that, this will never stop. A fierce and somewhat unmaidenly blush came to her cheeks, and she walked back into the inner room in something of a fluster to do her toilet. During the two-day birthday festivities, Grandmother Jia had over-eaten, and on the second evening she was a little off colour. The following day she had a painfully bloated feeling in her stomach, which Faithful wanted to report to Jia Zheng. But Grandmother Jia forbade her Ive just been a bit greedy over the past couple of days. A fast will soon put me right.
Youre all trying to ruin me! Just as they were wondering how to save the situation, a confused hubbub reached them from the inner apartments. They heard their own names called, wanted by Their Ladyships, and slunk shamefacedly into Lady Wangs apartment. A fine mess youve made of things! exclaimed Lady Wang, waiting for them with fury written on her face. Well, now youve driven Qia-jie and Patience to their deaths! The least you can do is bring me back their corpses! They both knelt at her feet. Jia Huan did not dare to open his mouth, but Jia Yun bowed his head and said I would never have dared to do it myself. We only mentioned this match to you, Great-aunts, because Great-uncle Xing and Uncle Wang suggested it. It was all their idea. Then Great-aunt Xing agreed to it and asked me to write out the horoscope. Now the other party wants to back out. How can you accuse us of driving Qiao-jie to her death? Huan told your great-aunt Xing that they would be arriving in three days to take the girl away, said Lady Wang. Whoever heard of a proper wedding being conducted in such a hurry? I shall ask no more questions. Just give me back Qiao-jie. We shall see what Sir Zheng decides to do with you when he returns. Lady xing wept in silent shame. Lady Wang turned next on Jia Huan That harpy Aunt Zhao evidently left behind her a son every bit as vile as herself! She called one of her maids to support her and retired to her bedroom. Left on their own Jia Huan, Jia Yun and Lady Xing began to indulge in mutual recrimination, until finally one of them said Whats the use of blaming each other like this? The girl probably isnt dead at all. Patience has almost certainly taken her off to hide in the home of a relative. Lady Xing summoned the janitors from the front and rear gates and after giving them a good scolding asked them where Qiao-jie and Patience had gone. Its no good asking us, maam, they replied with one voice. Ask one of the stewards, theyre the ones who ought to know. We wouldnt advise you to make a scene, maam. If Lady Wang should choose to question us, theres plenty we could tell. And if one person is beaten or given the sack, it will have to be everyone. Since Mr Lian left its been a sheer disgrace what has been going on in the front of the mansion. We havent even received our wages or monthly grain allowance, but they ve been drinking and gambling away, fooling around with pretty little actors, inviting girls into the house--is that how masters of the family are supposed to behave? Jia Yun and Jia Huan were silent. A servant arrived from Lady Wangs with renewed orders to hurry up and find Patience and Qiao-jie, which sent them into another flurry of desperate activity. They did not even bother to question the servants in Qiao-jies own apartment, knowing they would be too hostile to reveal the whereabouts of the missing pair though this was hardly something they could say to Lady Wang. Instead they had to go asking at the home of every relative, and still failed to unearth the slightest clue. Lady Xing in the inner apartments and Jia Huan in the outer spent a hectic few days and nights. At last came the day when the examinations were due to be concluded and the students released from their cells. Lady Wang was eagerly awaiting the return of Bao-yu and Jia Lan, and when midday came and there was still no sign of either of them, she, Li Wan and Bao-chai all began to worry and sent one servant after another to find out what had become of them. The servants could obtain no news, and not one of them dared to return empty-handed. Later another batch was despatched on the same mission, with the same result. The three ladies were beside themselves with anxiety. When evening came, someone returned at last it was Jia Lan. They were delighted to see him, and immediately asked Where is Bao-yu? He did not even greet them but burst into tears. Lost! he sobbed. For several minutes Lady Wang was struck dumb. Then she collapsed senseless onto her couch. Luckily Suncloud and one or two other maids were at hand to support her, and they brought her round, themselves sobbing hysterically the while. Bao-chai stared in front of her with a glazed expression in her eyes, while Aroma sobbed her heart out. The only thing they could find time to do between their fits of sobbing was to scold Jia Lan Fool!
Faithful fell to her knees, and Xi-feng held out her hands to prevent her. Come on! Whats the meaning of all this? If youve something on your mind, then just go ahead and say it! Faithful insisted on kneeling, and Xi-feng continued her attempts to pull her to her feet. Her Old Ladyships funeral has been placed entirely in your hands and Mr Lians, sobbed Faithful. Her Old Ladyship left a special sum of money to pay for it. While she was alive, Her Old Ladyship never wasted a penny on herself now that the time has come for her funeral, I beg you, maam, to do the right thing by her and give her a proper send-off! Just now I heard the Master talking about it The Book of Songs this, and Confucius that - I didnt understand a word of what he said. I caught one sentence, though In funerals, sincere grief is of more importance than outward show. I asked Mrs Bao to explain what he meant, and she said that the Master wants to keep the funeral a simple affair. He believes that heart-felt grief is the truest form of devotion, and that there is no need for extravagant display. But as I see it, for someone like Her Old Ladyship, things ought to be a bit grand. I know Im only a servant, and have no right to speak in these matters, but I feel that Her Old Ladyship loved us both during her lifetime, maam, both you and me, and now that shes dead we owe it to her to send her off with a bit of style! I know how good you are at that sort of thing, maam, and I wanted to ask for your support, so that we could decide together whats best. Ive been with Her Old Ladyship all my life, and death cannot part us! If I dont see this done properly, how am I ever to look her in the face again? Xi-feng found Faithfuls way of talking rather odd. Dont you worry, she replied. Of course everything will be done in proper style. Sir Zheng may talk of economy, but we have certain standards to maintain. Well spend every penny of the money on Lady Jia, if need be. Before she died, said Faithful, Her Old Ladyship said that everything left over after the family distribution had been made was to be given to us. If theres not enough money for the funeral expenses, maam, then take our share of Her Old Ladyships belongings and pawn them. Whatever the Master may say, he can hardly go against Her Old Ladyships last wishes. He was here himself when she divided everything up. Youve always been such a sensible girl, said Xi-feng. Whats got into you today? Nothings got into me, protested Faithful. I just know that Lady Xing doesnt care, and that the Master is being too cautious. It may be that you are of the same mind as the Master, maam. If youre afraid too, and think that a proper funeral will get us into trouble, then no one will dare to give Her Old Ladyship her due. That would be the most terrible thing! Im only a maid, so of course its no personal concern of mine. But think what a disgrace it would be for the family! I hardly need reminding of that, replied Xi-feng. Set your mind at rest. I shall take care of everything. Faithful once more entreated Xi-feng to do her utmost, and pledged her undying gratitude. What a strange creature! thought Xi-feng to herself, as she left Grandmother Jias apartment. I wonder what can be in her mind? Of course shes right Grannies funeral should be stylish. Oh dear! I cant pay too much attention to Faithfuls complaints. Id better just stick to the book and follow family precedent. She summoned Brighties wife, and sent her with a message to Jia Lian, asking him to come and see her. What do you want me for? he asked, when he arrived shortly afterwards. Just keep your end up on the inside. There should be no problems. If youre in any doubt, stick to Uncle Zhengs instructions. There you are, said Xi-feng. What you say only bears out Faithfuls fears. What fears are they? Xi-feng repeated the substance of her interview with Faithful. Who cares what the maids say? retorted Jia Lian. Ive just been in to see Uncle Zheng, and this is what he said Wed like to lay on something grand for Mothers funeral, but although some people will understand that its her money were using, less well-informed observers may suspect us of secretly holding on to some of our own resources.
True enough, replied young Lal. But his conduct still leaves a lot to be desired, Im afraid. He may not last long at this rate. Has he been taking squeeze himself? Lai nodded and drained his cup. What other news did you pick up at the Palace? they asked them. Oh, nothing much. A number of criminals from the coast have apparently been arrested, and sent to the High Court. During their trial they revealed the whereabouts of several others of their kind, lying low here in the capital, watching and waiting for fresh opportunities for crime. Fortunately the present civil and military authorities have such a sound grip on the situation, and are so dedicated to the service of the throne, that these criminal elements will be effectively controlled. If youve heard of such cases, perhaps you have news of our burglary? asked one of the party. Im afraid not, came the reply. I heard something about a man from one of the inland provinces who got into trouble here in town for abducting a girl and running off with her to the coast. She put up a fight and he ended by killing her. They arrested him crossing the border, and executed him on the spot. Wasnt Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage abducted in similar circumstances? put in one of the others. Couldnt it have been her? Bound to have been! muttered Jia Huan. How could you know? they asked him. She was a sickening creature! said Jia Huan. Always giving herself airs and graces. She had only to set eyes on Bao-yu to get a big smile all over her face. But she wouldnt so much as acknowledge my existence! I hope it is her! Plenty of people are kidnapped all the time, someone commented. It could easily have been someone else. I can well believe it was her, said Jia Yun. The day before yesterday I heard that one of the sisters at the Hermitage had a dream in which she saw Adamantina being killed. This was greeted with derision You cant take dreams seriously! Dream or no dream, its all one to me, protested Dumbo. Lets get on with the real business of the evening, shall we? Eat up, everyone, and we can start tonights Big Game. This met with general approval, and as soon as they had finished their meal they began gambling in earnest. They were still at it well after midnight, when suddenly they heard a great commotion coming from the inner apartments. They were eventually informed that Xi-chun had been arguing with You-shi, and the upshot of it was that she had cut all her hair off and gone running to Ladies Xing and Wang. There she kowtowed and begged them to relent and let her have her wish. If they would not, she threatened to put an end to her life there and then. The two ladies were at their wits end, and sent for Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to intervene. Jia Yun however knew that this was something Xi-chun had resolved to do long ago, at least since the fateful night of the burglary when she had been left in charge of the house, and to him there seemed little hope in trying to dissuade her now. He talked it over with Jia Qiang Lady Wang says she wants us to intervene, but I dont see how we can achieve anything. Its a heavy responsibility, and they want to off-load it onto us. Well have to put on a show of talking Xi-chun out of her decision, and then, when she refuses to listen, well have to pass the matter back to the ladies, and meanwhile write a letter to Uncle Lian, absolving ourselves from any blame. They both agreed on this strategy, called on Ladies Xing and Wang, and then went through the motions of trying to dissuade Xi-chun, who was every bit as adamant as they had predicted. If she could not take refuge in a convent outside the family mansion, then she said she would make do with a couple of quiet rooms within it, in which to recite her sutras and say her prayers. Eventually You-shi could see that the aunts were not prepared to take the responsibility her own feat that Xi-chun might commit suicide got the better of her and she forced herself to compromise. I can see I shall have to take the blame. Very well then. Let them say that it was I who could not tolerate my own husbands sister and drove her to a nunnery! What do I care! But I cannot allow her to leave home. That is out of the question. She will have to stay here. Aunts Xing and Wang, I call you to witness my decision. Qiang, you had better write a letter informing my husband and Cousin Lian of what has happened. Jia Qiang acquiesced in You-shis decision.
It was more than she could bear. She sent Lady Wang away and told Bao-yu to bid his Uncle She and Cousin Zhen farewell and to return immediately afterwards. Left on her own, she sank onto her couch in tears. Faithful tried every way she knew of consoling her, and finally Grandmother Jia dozed off. Understandably Jia She and Cousin Zhen viewed the prospect of their exile with little relish. The men chosen to accompany them were equally reluctant to go, and complained bitterly of their lot. To be parted in life is in truth more painful than to be parted by death, and the witnessing of such a parting often more distressing than the parting itself. Rong-guo House, once a scene of such brilliance and distinction, now echoed with the sounds of wailing and lamentation. Jia Zheng had always been a great stickler for formalities, and despite everything he continued to observe towards Jia She the solemn respect prescribed towards an elder brother. The two brothers shook hands at home, and Jia Zheng then rode out ahead to beyond the city walls and there waited to drink the ritual farewell cup of wine. He exhorted Jia She to remember the compassion the state had shown him on his ancestors account, and to prove himself worthy of it. Jia She and Cousin Zhen wiped the tears from their eyes, and set off for their different destinations. Jia Zheng returned home with Bao-yu. As they neared the gateway of Rong-guo House they saw a crowd gathered outside and heard a confused hubbub of voices An Imperial Edict issued today! The Rong-guo hereditary rank and title to be passed on to Sir Zheng! The men in the crowd were demanding their statutory tip for bringing this good news, but the janitors were resisting vigorously The title belonged to the family in the first place, and was inherited by our masters. Thats not worth a tip! Come on! came the indignant reply. Think of the glory! A title like that is the most glorious thing there is - and your Sir She could never hope to get it back, not after what hes done. Now His Majesty, in his wisdom and mercy, greater than the sky is broad, has passed it on to Sir Zheng why, thats nothing less than a miracle for your family! Definitely worth a tip! Jia Zheng entered the house and received a full report on the matter from the janitors. His pleasure was inevitably mingled with shame that his own good fortune had been made possible only by his elder brothers disgrace. He was momentarily overwhelmed and wept tears of emotion. Then he hurried in to convey the news to Grandmother Jia, who took him delightedly by the hand and urged him to show himself worthy of this signal honour. Lady Wang was also present, anxious that Grandmother Jia might be souffrante and in need of consolation, and she too was delighted to hear Jia Zhengs news. Only Lady Xing and You-shi felt their own misfortune the more keenly, an emotion they took pains to conceal. The familys sponging friends and relatives, who had kept well clear while times were hard, learned that Jia Zheng had now been given his brothers title and - deducing from this that the Emperor must still view the Jias with a favourable eye - flocked to Rong-guo House to offer their felicitations. But Jia Zhengs feelings were running along very different lines. He was by nature a man of such soul-searching integrity that, so far from congratulating himself on his good luck, he was greatly troubled at heart, and wondered how he would ever be able to show his gratitude sufficiently. The following day he went to the Palace to make a formal expression of thanks, and this time went so far as to submit a memorial begging that his restored residence, together with Prospect Garden, be accepted as a gift by the Emperor. An Edict was issued in reply to this request, dismissing it as quite superfluous and Jia Zheng, his conscience a little placated, returned home and applied himself with devotion and zeal to his official duties. The familys finances were still as precarious as ever. Income continued to fall far short of expenditure. Entertaining, making connections with the right people and winning favours were not Jia Zhengs strong point. The servants knew how incorrigibly upright he was, while Xi-feng was still sick and unable to apply her experience to the solving of the present crisis. The debts Jia Lian was forced to incur were mounting daily, and it seemed almost inevitable that he would have to mortgage still more property and sell still more land. The servants could see it coming. Some of them were quite wealthy themselves and were worried that Jia Lian might come to them for money. Some tried to keep out of harms way by feigning poverty, some asked for leave of absence and went looking for other employment.
Dai-yu has already returned to the Land of Illusion and if you really want to find her you must cultivate your mind and strengthen your spiritual nature. Then one day you will see her again. But if you throw your life away, you will be guilty of premature death self-sought and will be confined to Hell. And then, although you may be allowed to see your parents, you will certainly never see Dai-yu again. When he had finished speaking, the man took a stone from within his sleeve and threw it at Bao-yus chest. The words he had spoken and the impact of the stone as it-landed on his chest combined to give Bao-yu such a fright that he would have returned home at once, if he had only know which way to turn. In his confusion he suddenly heard a voice, and turning, saw the figures of Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Aroma and his other maids standing in a circle around him, weeping and calling his name. He was lying on his own bed. The red lamp was on the table. The moon was shining brilliantly through the window. He was back among the elegant comforts of his own home. A moments reflection told him that what he had just experienced had been a dream. He was in a cold sweat. Though his mind felt strangely lucid, thinking only intensified his feeling of helpless desolation, and he uttered several profound sighs. Bao-chai had known of Dai-yus death for several days. While Grandmother Jia had forbidden the maids to tell him for fear of further complicating his illness, she felt she knew better. Aware that it was Dai-yu who lay at the root of his illness and that the loss of his jade was only a secondary factor, she took the opportunity of breaking the news of her death to him in this abrupt manner, hoping that by severing his attachment once and for all she would enable- his sanity and health to be restored. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and company were not aware of her intentions and at first reproached her for her lack of caution. But when they saw Bao-yu regain consciousness they were all greatly relieved and went at once to the library to ask doctor Bi to come in and examine his patient again. The doctor carefully took his pulses. How odd! he exclaimed. His pulses are deep and still, his spirit calm, the oppression quite dispersed. Tomorrow he must take a regulative draught, which I shall prescribe, and he should make a prompt and complete recovery. The doctor left and the ladies all returned to their apartments in much improved spirits. Although at first Aroma greatly resented the way in which Bao-chai had broken the news, she did not dare say so. Oriole, on the other hand, reproved her mistress in private for having been, as she put it, too hasty. What do you know about such things? retorted Bao-chai. Leave this to me. I take full responsibility. Bao-chai ignored the opinions and criticisms of those around her and continued to keep a close watch on Baoyus progress, probing him judiciously, like an acupunturist with a needle. A day or two later, he began to feel a slight improvement in himself, though his mental equilibrium was still easily disturbed by the least thought of Dai-yu. Aroma was constantly at his side, with such words of consolation as The Master chose Miss Chai as your bride for her more dependable nature. He thought Miss Lin too difficult and temperamental for you, and besides there was always the fear that she would not live long. Then later Her Old Ladyship thought you were not in a fit state to know what was best for you and would only be upset and make yourself iller if you knew the truth, so she made Snowgoose come over, to try and make things easier for you. This did nothing to lessen his grief, and he often wept inconsolably. But each time he thought of putting an end to his life, he remembered the words of the stranger in his dream and then he thought of the distress his death would cause his mother and grandmother and knew that he could not tear himself away from them. He also reflected that Dai-yu was dead, and that Bao-chai was a fine lady in her-- own right there must after all have been some truth in the bond of gold and jade. This thought eased his mind a little. Bao-chai could see that things were improving, and herself felt calnaer as a result. Every day she scrupulously performed her duties towards Gran4mother Jia and Lady Wang, and when these were completed, did all she could to cure Bao-yu of his grief. He was still not able to sit up for long periods, but often when he saw her sitting by his bedside he would succumb to his old weakness for the fairer sex.
His heart sank as he hurried on into her apartment. He found her, however, to his great relief sobbing but alive and well. He turned to the assembled family and reproached them At a time like this, you should be comforting Lady Jia, not making matters worse with all this crying. There was a sudden silence, during which they all looked round at each other in amazement. Jia Zheng said a few soothing words to Grandmother Jia, then spoke to the others again before leaving. We came here to cheer Lady Jia up, they were thinking to themselves. We meant to comfort her. How could we forget ourselves like this and make matters worse! They were still in this state of bewilderment, when an old serving-woman arrived with two women from the Shi household. Having curtseyed to Grandmother Jia and greeted all the others present, they delivered their message Our Master the Marquis, Her Grace the Marchioness and Miss Shi have sent us with this message they have heard your news and want to assure you that this will be nothing more than a temporary setback. They were concerned that Sir Zheng and Their Ladyships might be unduly distressed, and asked us particularly to say that Sir Zheng should set his mind at ease. He himself is in no danger. Miss Shi would have come herself but she is being married in a few days time. Grandmother Jia felt a little awkward about expressing her gratitude to these serving-women. When you return, she said, please convey my regards to your Master and Mistress. What our family has suffered was decreed by fate. Another day I shall call in person to thank the Marquis and Marchioness for their concern. As for Xiang-yuns marriage, Im sure they must have found her a fine young man for a husband. I should be so pleased to know a little about his family. His family is not a particularly wealthy one, replied the women. But he is a very nice young man, and has such a gentle nature. We have seen him quite a few times, and he closely resembles your Master Bao. He also has considerable literary talent. Grandmother Jia was very pleased with this description. It sounds most suitable I must say. Xiang-yun is a lucky girl. Her family and ours have always abided by the old Southern marriage customs, and that is why none of us have set eyes on the groom to this day. Only recently I was thinking about my own family, and particularly about Xiang-yun. She has always been my favourite. She used to spend over half the year with me when she was a little girl. I had meant to find a nice husband for her myself when she grew up, but with her uncle away from home I could hardly be the one to take the initiative. Well, fortune has smiled on her, and she has found a good match, so now I can set my mind at rest. I know that theyll be married within the month, and I would have so liked to drink a cup of wine at the reception - but even thats out of the question Im afraid. This latest upheaval has quite taken my strength away. Please give them my regards when you return, and say that we all send our very best wishes. And tell Miss Shi she is not to worry on my account. Im over eighty now, and if I die I shall have no cause to complain. I have had more than my share of blessings. My only prayer is that she and her husband may live happily together to a ripe old age. Then I shall rest content. As she spoke, Grandmother Jia could not help weeping. One of the Shi serving-women replied Please do not distress yourself Lady Jia. Once Miss Shi is married and has celebrated her Ninth Day, Im sure she and her husband will come here to pay you their respects. Then you will be able to see them yourself and that will make you happy. Grandmother Jia nodded. The women left. Bao-yu seemed to be the only person at all affected by the news of Xiang-yuns impending marriage. He looked somewhat bemused, and thought to himself Why is it that girls have to get married as soon as they grow up? Once theyre married, theyre bound to change. Even dear Yun has to obey her uncles will. Now if we meet again, it will never be the same. She is bound to be distant towards me. What is the point of living, if I am to be forever shunned like this? He felt himself becoming tearful again. But for Grandmother Jias sake he endeavoured not to weep and instead sat there brooding silently to himself. Jia Zheng was still concerned for Grandmother Jias health, and presently he came in to see how she was. Finding her somewhat improved he went out again and summoned the steward Lai Da, ordering him to bring the complete register of household servants employed in responsible positions.
Its right and proper for a wife to exhibit loyalty to her husband, even when he is a true husband to her no longer. And a chamber-wife may do the same if she wishes. But Aroma was never formally declared to be Bayus chamber-wife, even though in fact we know that she was. Yes, I was thinking about this only a short while ago, said Lady Wang. I was waiting for a chance to talk it over with you in private. If we simply dismiss her from service, Im afraid she wont want to go, and may even try to take her own life. We could keep her on, but I am afraid Sir Zheng would not approve. It is a tricky problem. I hardly think Sir Zheng would want her to remain single and make a show of faithfulness to Bao-yu, said Aunt Xue. He doesnt even know that she was Bao-yus chamber-wife. He has always thought of her as just an ordinary maid, so it would seem rather absurd to him to want to keep her on. The only solution is for you to send for a member of her own family and impress upon them the importance of arranging a decent marriage for her. We can give her a generous send-off. She is a good-natured girl and still quite young. You should do what you can for her after all the years she has worked for you. Let me explain things carefully to her. Theres no need to let her know straight away. First we should get in touch with her family and let them arrange a match next we should make some enquiries ourselves and then if it seems that the prospective husbands family are in a position to support her properly, and if the young man himself seems suitable, we can let her leave and get married. Thats a very good idea. Youve thought it all out very well, replied Lady Wang. If we do not take the initiative, Sir Zheng may go ahead himself and deal with her in a very tactless way, and then I will be responsible for yet another misfortune. Exactly the same thought had occurred to me, said Aunt Xue nodding her head. After they had chatted a while longer, Aunt Xue took her leave and went to Bao-chais apartment. She found Aroma in floods of tears and did her best to console her, speaking so far as possible in vague generalities. Aroma was at heart a simple girl and not much of a talker, and she merely gave the appropriate responses to whatever Aunt Xue said. I am only a servant, she said in the end, and it is very kind of you to think to speak to me like this, maam. I have never dared to go against any wish of Her Ladyships. Theres a good girl! said Aunt Xue, more pleased than ever with her. Bao-chai added a few high-sounding words of her own and when she and Aunt Xue parted from Aroma their minds were considerably more at ease. A few days later Jia Zheng came home and was greeted on his arrival by all the family. Jia She and Cousin Zhen had also returned from their exile by now, and they spent some time with Jia Zheng, catching up on each others news. Then Jia Zheng went in to see the womenfolk. Bao-yus absence cast a shadow of gloom over the gathering, which Jia Zheng tried to dispel as best he could. There was a reason behind all this! he said. It is up to us men now to maintain a high standard of public life, and I hope that all of you meanwhile will lend us your support here at home. There must be no hint of any slipping back into the lax old ways. Each apartment can look after its own affairs, and weve no need of a general manager. Everything in our own apartment I leave to you this was addressed to Lady Wang, to deal with in a fitting manner. Lady Wang informed him that Bao-chai was with child, and that all Bao-yus maids would be dismissed. Jia Zheng nodded in silence. The following day he attended court to receive his instructions from the chief ministers. I am extremely grateful for His Majestys gracious favour, he said. But since this is still within my period of mourning, I beg you to instruct me how I should express my gratitude. The ministers offered to present a memorial on his behalf. The Emperor most magnanimously granted Jia Zheng a special audience, and after listening to his formal expression of thanks favoured him with several Imperial instructions and enquired after his son, the successful Provincial Graduate. Jia Zheng told him the full story of Bao-yus disppearance. The Emperor marvelled at it and declared that Bao-yus compositions had indeed manifested a remarkable originality, the very quality one would expect of a soul from another plane.
Presently lunch was served for the ladies. Jia Zheng, having witnessed for himself the physical resemblance between this Zhen Bao-yu and his own son, proceeded to test the young mans literary and scholastic abilities and was most impressed by the fluent answers that he gave. He sent for his own Bao-yu and the other two boys, in order to exhibit to them this paragon of virtue, as both stimulus and admonition, and in particular to afford Bao-yu an opportunity for salutary self-comparison. Bao-yu answered the summons promptly, and appeared in full mourning-dress, accompanied by Huan and Lan. When he saw Zhen Bao-yu for the first time, it seemed to him almost as if he were being reunited with an old friend, and the feeling of delight was apparently mutual. They bowed to each other, and Huan and Lan followed suit. Jia Zheng had been sitting on a mat on the floor, and had asked Master Zhen on arrival to sit at a chair, an invitation that Master Zhen had very properly declined, since his senior was seated at a lower level. Instead he installed himself on a cushion on the floor. Now that Bao-yu and the other two had joined the company, it would hardly be right for them to sit on the floor with Jia Zheng nor on the other hand could they remain standing while Master Zhen, their contemporary, was seated below. Jia Zheng resolved the dilemma by standing up himself, and after talking with them for a few minutes, he instructed the servants to serve lunch. I shall have to leave you now, he said to Master Zhen. Please excuse me. I hand you over to the younger generation, who will learn much from you. It is I, sir, replied Zhen, with polite modesty, who am most anxious to learn from these gentlemen. Jia Zheng said a few more words in reply, and then took his leave, politely preventing his young visitor from accompanying him, but allowing Bao-yu, Jia Huan and Jia Lan, who had preceded him and were waiting outside the threshold, to escort him into the irmer study. They returned, prayed Master Zhen to be seated again, and there was a certain amount of conventional chat, with references to this long-awaited and much anticipated meeting, details of which we need not record here. Jia Bao-yu, on seeing Zhen Bao-yu, had instantly been reminded of their earlier dream-encounter in the mirror. From what he knew by report of Zhen Bao-yu, he felt sure that this jade counterpart of his would be a person after his own heart, and that he was destined to find in him a true friend. However, since this was their first real meeting, and since Huan and Lan were present, he felt the need to be somewhat discreet, and therefore addressed him in the polite hyperboles customary on such occasions Long have I admired you from afar, but alas till now I have been denied the honour of a personal acquaintance. Today this great blessing is mine, and lo, I see before me a reincarnation of the Great Bard, a second Li Bo! Zhen Bao-yu had also heard a great deal about his namesake, and found that the reality conformed pretty much to his expectations. He seems a passable companion in my studies, he thought to himself, but hardly someone to share my aspirations. And yet he has my name, and looks so like me we must be souls linked by some bond at the Rock of Rebirth. I have made some progress of late in the understanding of Higher Principles, and should therefore seek to impart to him something of what I have learned. Since this is only our first meeting, however, and since I am still ignorant where his sympathies lie, I should tread cautiously. He replied to Jia Bao-yus remarks in what he deemed to be a fitting vein Long have I known of your great gifts. I fear that, before a person of such egregious purity, refinement and grace, I am but an ordinary and foolish mortal, and that by sharing your name I do but tarnish its lustre. He seems a sympathetic enough character, pondered Jia Bao-yu upon hearing this. But why does he flatter me almost as if I were a girl? We are both of us men, and therefore creatures of impurity. Your praise is alas undeserved, he said. I am but a dull and foolish creature, a mere lump of senseless stone! How can I compare with a person of such quality and nobility as yourself? It is I who am unworthy of the name that we both bear. When I was young, mused Zhen Bao-yu aloud for his new friends benefit, I was blind to my own limitations and entertained ideas far above my station.
Jia She now lacked the courage to go any further. He turned back and went home as quickly as possible, telling the boys who had accompanied him not to say anything about what had happened, but merely to let it be known that they had had an uneventful tour of the Garden. He himself needed no further convincing that the Garden was haunted, and began to think it might be advisable to apply to the Taoist Pontificate for priests to perform an exorcism. His servants, meanwhile, who were by nature fond of making trouble, saw how frightened their master was, and far from concealing the episode, retailed it with a great deal of gusto and embellishment, creating quite a sensation and eliciting a good deal of open-mouthed astonishment. In the end Jia She decided that there was no other recourse than to go ahead and hold a formal ceremony of exorcism. A suitable day in the almanac was chosen, and an altar was constructed in the Garden, on a dais in the main hall of the Reunion Palace. Images of the Three Pure Ones were set up, flanked by figures of the spirits presiding over each of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and of the Four Great Commanders - Ma, Zhao, Wen and Zhou. Further down the hall, the sacred precinct was made complete with a diagrammatic representation of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Generals. The air was heavy with flowers and incense, the hall blazed with lanterns and candles. Bells, drums, liturgical instruments and other paraphernalia were arrayed along both sides of the hall, and emblematic banners were hoisted at each of the Five Cardinal Points the Four Corners and the Centre. The Taoist Pontiff had delegated Forty-Nine Deacons for the ceremony, and they began by spending a whole day purifying the altar. Then three priests went the rounds of the hall, waving smoking bundles of joss-sticks and sprinkling holy water, and when this was done the great Drum of the Dharma thundered forth. The priests now donned their Seven Star Mitres and robed themselves in their chasubles emblazoned with the Nine Heavenly Mansions and the Eight Trigrams. Wearing Cloud-Mounting Pattens on their feet and holding ivory tablets in their hands, they addressed themselves in reverent supplication to the sages. For a full day they chanted the Arcanum Primordii, a text renowned for its efficacy in the dispelling of misfortune, the exorcizing of evil spirits and the general enhancement of propitious vibrations. Then they produced the Spirit Roll, which called on the Heavenly Generals to be present. It was inscribed with the following large characters A SUMMONS IN THE NAME OF THE THREE REALMS, THE ULTIMATE, THE PRIMORDIAL, AND THE PURE IN THE NAME OF THE SUPREME PONTIFF CHAPTER 102 AND THE TALISMANIC POWER VESTED IN HIM ALL ISENEVOLENT SPIRITS OF THE REGION ARE HEREBT CALLED TO THIS ALTAR TO DO SERVICE The menfolk of both Rong-guo and Ning-guo House had taken courage from the presence of the priests, and were gathered in the Garden to watch the demon-hunt. Most impressive! they all agreed. All those benevolent spirits and powers are bound to strike fear into the heart of even the most obdurate demon! They crowded in front of the altar to watch the rest of the proceedings. The young banner-bearing Deacons took up their positions in the hall, one group at each of the Five Cardinal Points, North, East, South, West and Centre, and awaited their orders. The three priests stood on the lower steps of the altar one held the Magic Sword and the Holy Water, one the black Seven Star Banner, and one the peach-wood Demon Whip. The music ceased. The gong sounded thrice, the monks intoned a prayer, and the cohorts of banner-bearers began performing circular gyrations. The priests then descended from the altar and instructed the Jia menfolk to conduct them to every storeyed building, studio, hall, pavilion, chamber, cottage or covered walk, every hillside and waters edge in the Garden. In each place they sprinkled the Holy Water and brandished the Magic Sword. On their return, the gong rang out again, the Seven Star Banner was raised aloft and consecrated, and as it descended the Deacons formed a phalanx around it with their lesser banners, and the Demon Whip was cracked three times in the air. This, thought the Jias, must be the climactic moment now at last the entire company of evil spirits would be routed and captured. They thronged forward to be in at the finish. But nothing seemed to happen. No apparition, no sound only the voice of one of the priests, ordering the Deacons to bring on the jars.
My only wish is that you should keep warm in the cold weather and take good care of yourself. As soon as I arrive at my post, I shall write to ask how you are. You are not to worry on my account. Bao-yus marriage has now been celebrated in accordance with your wishes, and it only remains for me to beg you to instruct him, and impart to him the wisdom of your years. Grandmother Jia, for fear that Jia Zheng would worry on his journey, made no mention of Bao-yus relapse but merely said There is one thing I should tell you. Although the rites were performed last night, Bao-yus marriage was not properly consummated. His health would not allow it. Custom, I know, decrees that he should see you off today. But in view of all the circumstances, his earlier illness, the luck turning, his still fragile state of convalescence and yesterdays exertions, I am worried that by going out he might catch a chill. So I put it to you if you wish him to fulfil his filial obligations by seeing you off, then send for him at once and instruct him accordingly but if you love him, then spare him and let him say goodbye and make his kotow to you here. Why should I want him to see me off? returned Jia Zheng. All I want is that from now on he should study in earnest. That would bring me greater pleasure by far. Grandmother Jia was most relieved to hear this. She told Jia Zheng to be seated and sent Faithful, after imparting to her various secret instructions, to fetch Bao-yu and to bring Aroma with him. Faithful had not been away many minutes, when Bao-yu came in and with the usual promptings, performed his duty to his father. Luckily the sight of his father brought him, for a few moments, sufficient clarity to get through the formalities without any gross lapses. Jia Zheng delivered himself of a few exhortatory words, to all of which his son gave the correct replies. Then Jia Zheng told Aroma to escort him back to his room, while he himself went to Lady Wangs apartment. There he earnestly enjoined Lady Wang to take charge of Bao-yus moral welfare during his absence. There must be none of his previous unruliness, he added. He must now prepare himself to enter for next years provincial examination. Lady Wang assured him that she would do her utmost, and without mentioning anything else, at once sent a maid to escort Bao-chai into the room. Bao-chai performed the rite proper to a newly-married bride seeing off her father-in-law, and then remained in the room when Jia Zheng left. The other women-folk accompanied him as far as the inner gate before turning back. Cousin Zhen and the other young male Jias received a few words of exhortation, drank a farewell toast, and, together with a crowd of other friends and relatives, accompanied him as far as the Hostelry of the Tearful Parting, some three or four miles beyond the city walls, where they bid their final farewell. -384 But of Jia Zhengs departure no more. Let us return to Bao-yu, who on leaving his father, had suffered an immediate relapse. His mind became more and more clouded, and he could swallow neither food nor drink. Whether or not he was to emerge from this crisis alive will be revealed in the next chapter. CHAPTER 98 Crimson Pearls suffering spirit returns to the Realm of Separation And the convalescent Stone-in-waiting weeps at the scene of past affection On his return from seeing his father, Bao-yu, as we have seen, regressed into a worse state of stupor and depression than ever. He was too lacking in energy to move, and could eat nothing, but fell straight into a heavy slumber. Once more the doctor was called, once more he took Baoyus pulses and made out a prescription, which was administered to no effect. He could not even recognize the people around him. And yet, if helped into a sitting position, he could still pass for someone in normal health. Provided he was not called upon to do anything, there were no external symptoms to indicate how seriously ill he was. He continued like this for several days, to the increasing anxiety of the family, until the Ninth Day after the wedding, when according to tradition the newly-married couple should visit the brides family. If they did not go, Aunt Xue would be most offended. But if they went with Bao-yu in his present state, whatever were they to say? Knowing that his illness was caused by his attachment to Dai-yu, Grandmother Jia would have liked to make a clean breast of it and tell Aunt Xue.
All right, all right, grumbled Jia Lian. Stop teaching your grandmother to suck eggs. Why are you getting up, maam? put in Patience. Its too early yet. And I dont see what you have to work yourself into such a terrible temper for, sir! Why take it all out on us? Hasnt Mrs Lian gone to enough trouble for you in the past? The number of times shes borne the brunt on your behalf! Perhaps I shouldnt say this, but in view of all that shes done for you, it doesnt seem very fair to make such a big fuss about this one favour, especially when you think how many other people are involved. Do you have no consideration for her feelings? Why should she take all the blame anyway? We were late getting up, and youre entitled to be angry with us -were only servants after all. But when you think how she has worked herself into the ground and ruined her health, it seems so unkind of you to pick a quarrel with her now! Patiences eyes filled with tears. Jia Lians original ill humour, strong though it had undoubtedly been, could not withstand the combined opposition of both his womenfolk - at once so appealing and so sharp-tongued. All right, forget it, he said, with a bitter smile. Shes hard enough to cope with on her own, without you leaping to her defence. I know Im just an outsider here anyway, and youre both itching to have me dead and out of the way. Dont speak like that, said Xi-feng. Who knows what will happen to any of us? Very probably I shall die before you. The sooner I do, the sooner my heart will be at rest. She began to weep again, and Patience tried to comfort her. It was now broad daylight, and the sun was shining in at the window. Jia Lian, who saw little prospect of steering the conversation out of this impasse, took his leave. Xi-feng was about to finish her toilet when one of Lady Wangs junior maids came in Her Ladyship says, will you be visiting your uncle today, maam, and if so would you take Mrs Bao with you? Xi-feng had found the recent scene thoroughly depressing. It was deeply mortifying that her own family should let her down so badly, on top of which she was still suffering from the shock of her encounter in the Garden the previous evening, and felt in no mood for an excursion. Tell Her Ladyship that I still have one or two things to see to, and wont be able to go today. Anyway the party theyre holding is not what I would call a genuine occasion. If Mrs Bao wants to go, she can go on her own. Yes, maam. The maid returned with this message to Lady Wangs apartment. When she had completed her toilet and dressed herself, Xi-feng reflected that even if she didnt attend the party, she ought at least to send a note. Besides, Bao-chai had not been married long, and would probably feel rather nervous about going by hersel She decided she should visit her, if only to offer moral support, and after a brief call on Lady Wang she excused herself on some pretext and made her way to Bao-yus apartment. He was reclining fully dressed on the kang, staring in a trance-like manner at Bao-chai, who was busy combing her hair. Xi-feng stood in the doorway for a while watching them. Bao-chai presently turned round and seeing her standing there promptly rose to her feet and asked her to be seated. Bao-yu also climbed down from the kang, as Xi-feng seated herself, with a playful smile on her face. Bao-chai scolded Musk -294 Why didnt you say that Mrs Lian was here? Musk laughed When Mrs Lian came in, she gave us a sign to be silent. Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu Well, what are you waiting for? Off you go! Honestly, Ive never set eyes on such a great big baby. A lady wants to do her toilet in private, and you have to climb up beside her and sit there staring! Heavens above, youre man and wife now, youve all day to gawp at her. And what about the maids? Dont you care if they make fun of you? Xi-feng giggled and eyed Bao-yu, clicking her tongue in mock-disapproval. Her words seemed to have little effect on him other than making him feel rather uncomfortable. Bao-chai, however, blushed a fierce crimson, ashamed at having to listen but too embarrassed to reply. Aroma came in with some tea and Bao-chai endeavoured to conceal her embarrassment by offering xi-feng a pipe of tobacco.
When he looked up, he saw before him a formidable figure barring his way with a large sword Where are you going? Bao-yu was frightened out of his wits, but managed to pluck up enough courage to take another l6ok. He was astonished, and then somewhat reassured, to find himself face to face with You San-jie. Oh Cousin! he begged her. Why are you after me too? You men, youre all the same! was her reply. Theres not a good one in your entire family. You ruin a girls reputation, then you destroy her marriage. Well Ive got you now, and you wont escape me! Bao-yu could tell that she was in deadly earnest and was beginning to panic when he heard another voice behind him saying Sister! Stop that man at once! He must not be allowed to leave! I have my orders from the Rivet Queen, replied San-jie, and Ive been waiting a long while for something like this. Now youre in my grasp, and with one blow of my sword I shall sever the ties that bind you to the mortal world. Bao-yu was terrified. He could not understand what she was saying, and turned and fled, only to see that the face from which the voice behind him had issued was that of Skybright. Joy and sorrow mingled in his heart. Im lost! he cried pathetically. Im all on my own and I seem to have run into the arms of the enemy. I wanted to escape and go home, but I couldnt find any of you to take me back. Now I shall be safe! Dear Skybright, please will you take me home now? You must not lose heart, replied the maiden. I am not Skybright. I have been specially commissioned by our Queen to escort you into her presence. I will not do you any harm. Bao-yu was now utterly bewildered You say your Queen sent you but who is your Queen? Dont ask now, replied Skybright. Soon you will see for your-self. Helplessly Bao-yu followed her, and as they walked he studied her more closely. She resembled Skybright in every detail. Her face, her eyes, her voice are all Skybrights! he reflected to himself. How can she say she isnt Skybright? Oh dear, Im in such a muddle. Id better take no notice of what she says. Whatever it is that Ive done wrong, when I am admitted into the presence of her Queen, I can ask her to help. Women have kind hearts, after all. She will surely forgive me. They had now reached a magnificent palace, lavishly and brilliantly appointed in every respect. In the courtyard before them grew a clump of bright green bamboo, while by the main doorway stood a row of dark pine-trees. There were several ladies-in-waiting standing under the eaves, dressed in fine palace robes, and when they saw Bao-yu come in they began whispering among themselves Is that the Divine Luminescent Page? Bao-yus attendant informed them It is, so youd better hurry in and announce his arrival. One of the ladies beckoned to Bao-yu with a smile, and he followed her in through several apartments, till finally they arrived at what seemed to be the entrance to the main hall of the palace. It was hung with a pearl blind. Stopping before this blind, the lady-in-waiting turned to Bao-yu and said Wait here for your instructions from Her Majesty. Bao-yu did not dare breathe a word, but waited obediently outside the doorway. Presently the lady-in-waiting returned and announced Will the Page please enter now for his audience? Another attendant began to roll up the pearl blind, and as she did so Bao-yu caught sight of a regal figure seated within, dressed in richly embroidered robes and wearing a crown of flowers on her head. Raising his head a fraction to look more closely, he saw that the Queen did indeed resemble Dai-yu and cried out impulsively Here you are at last, Coz! Oh how Ive missed you! The lady-in-waiting outside the blind whispered in a shocked tone Ill-mannered Page! Out with you at once! She had barely said this when the other attendant lowered blind again. Bao-yu was too scared to go in, and yet the though leaving was inconceivable. He wanted to ask one of the other lad in-waiting for an explanation, but when he looked round he realized that they were all of them strangers. They were forcing him out and he had no choice but to leave. He thought as a last resort trying to ask Skybright, but when he looked for her she was where to be seen.
Where her head lay on the embroidered pillow, with its border of fine brocade, was a patch the size of a small plate, wet with her tears and the copious effusions of her nose. When Li Wan called to her, she opened her eyes slowly, and raised herself slightly on the bed. Silly girl! Li Wan upbraided her. Is this a time for tears? Fetch Miss Lins grave-clothes and dress her in them. Are you going to leave it till it is too late? Would you have her go naked from the world? Would you ruin her honour? This released a fresh flood of tears on Nightingales part. Li Wan wept herself, fretfully wiping her eyes and patting Nightingale on the shoulder. Dear girl! Look how you are upsetting me now, and making me cry. Hurry and get her things ready. If we delay much longer, it will all be over. They were in this state of trepidation, when they heard footsteps outside, and someone came running into the room in a great flurry, causing Li Wan to start back in alarm. It was Patience. When she saw their tear-stained faces, she stopped abruptly and stared at them aghast for a while. Why arent you over there? asked Li Wan. What do you want here? As she spoke, Steward Lins wife also came into the room. Patience answered Mrs Lian was worried, and sent me to see how things were. As you are here, Mrs Zhu, I can tell her to set her mind at rest. Li Wan nodded. Patience went on I should like to see Miss Lin myself. So saying, she walked into Dai-yus bed-chamber, with tears on her cheeks. Li Wan turned to Steward Lins wife and said You have come just in time. Go and find your husband, and tell him to prepare Miss Lins coffin and whatever else is necessary. When everything has been satisfactorily arranged, he is to let me know. There is no need to go over to the house. Yes, maam, replied Lins wife, but made no move to go. Well? Is there something else? asked Li Wan. Mrs Lian and Her Old Ladyship, replied the stewards wife, have decided that they need Miss Nightingale in attendance over there. Before Li Wan could say anything, Nightingale spoke up for herself Mrs Lin, will you be so kind as to leave now? Cant you even wait until she is dead? We will leave her then, you need not fear. How can you be so... She stopped short, thinking it inadvisable to be so rude, and changing her tone somewhat, said Besides, after waiting on a sick person, I fear we would not be fit for such an occasion. And while Miss Lin is still alive, she may ask for me at any time. Li Wan tried to make the peace between them. The truth is, she said, that this maid and Miss Lin have an affinity from a past life. Snowgoose, I know, was Miss Lins original maid from home, but even she is not so indispensable as Nightingale. We really cannot separate them just now. Lins wife, who had been considerably put out by Nightingales outspoken response, was obliged to contain herself when Li Wan came to the maids defence. Seeing Nightingale reduced to floods of tears, she eyed her with a hostile smile and said I shall ignore Miss Nightingales rudeness. But am I to report what you have just said to Her Old Ladyship? And am I to tell Mrs Lian? As she was speaking, Patience came out of Dai-yus bedchamber, wiping her eyes Tell Mrs Lian what.? she asked. Lins wife told her the substance of their conversation. Patience lowered her head in thought. After a moment, she said Why cant you take Snowgoose? Would she do? asked Li Wan. Patience went up to her and whispered a few words in her ear. Li Wan nodded, and said Well in that case, it will be just as good if we send Snowgoose. Will Miss Snowgoose do? Lins wife asked Patience. Yes, replied Patience. She will do just as well. Then will you please tell her to come with me straight away, said Lins wife. I shall report to Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. I shall say that you are both responsible for the arrangement, mind. And later you can tell Mrs Lian yourself, Miss Patience. Of course, replied Li Wan curtly. Do you mean to say that someone as old and experienced as you cannot even take the responsibility for a small thing like this? Lins wife smiled. It is not that I cant take the responsibility.
Mr Bao! said Musk. Take my advice and put the whole thing out of your mind. Youre wasting your tears. Bao-yu followed her silently to his room. Bao-chai was lying asleep, or rather, as he judged, feigning sleep, but Aroma greeted him with a rebuke Couldnt it have waited till tomorrow? Did you have to go storming out there and work yourself up into another... Whatever she had been about to Say, she thought better of it, and after a short pause went on to ask Are you sure youre not feeling poorly? Bao-yu said nothing, but shook his head. Aroma put him to bed and it goes without saying that he spent a sleepless night. Nightingale was most distressed by Bao-yus visit, and she too lay awake the whole of that night, weeping and reflecting deeply to herself It seems plain that the family conspired together and tricked him into the wedding at a time when he was too ill to understand. Then afterwards, when he knew what he had done , he suffered one of his attacks and thats why he hasnt been able to stop weeping and moping ever since. Hes obviously not the heartless, wicked person I took him for. Why, today his devotion was so touching, I felt really sorry for him. What a dreadful pity it is that our Miss Lin never had the fortune to be his bride! Such unions are clearly determined by fate. Until fate reveals itself, men continue to indulge in blind passion and fond imaginings then, when the die is cast and the truth is known, the fools may remain impervious, hut the ones who care deeply, the men of true sentiment, can only weep bitterly at the futility of their romantic attachments, at the tragedy of their earthly plight. She is dead and knows nothing but he still lives, and there is no end to his suffering and torment. Better by far the destiny of plant or stone, bereft of knowledge and consciousness, but blessed at least with purity and peace of mind! These philosophical reflections cooled the feverish turmoil in Nightingales mind, and she was tidying up and preparing to go to bed, when she heard a great rumpus break out in the direction of Xi-fengs apartment to the east. But to discover what this portended, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 114 Wang Xi-feng ends her lifes illusion and returns to Jinling Zhen Ying-jia receives the Emperors favour and is summoned to the Palace It was the middle of the night when Bao-yu and Bao-chai were awoken and informed that Xi-feng was dying. They rose from bed at once, a maid brought a lighted candle, and they were on their way out of the courtyard, when another message came from Lady Wang Mrs Lians condition is critical, but she is still alive, and Mr and Mrs Bao should wait a while. There is something odd about Mrs Lians state from midnight until two oclock this morning she wouldnt stop talking, and we couldnt make head or tail of what she was saying. One minute she was demanding a boat, the next a sedan-chair then she was off to Jinling to be entered on the Register No one could understand a word, and she just kept on crying and wailing. There was nothing for it but for Mr Lian to go and get a paper boat and sedan made for her. He hasnt come back with them yet, and Mrs Lian is waiting for him, gasping for breath. Her Ladyship wants you both to wait and to come after Mrs Lian has finally passed away. How extraordinary! exclaimed Bao-yu. What does she want in Jinling? Didnt you see some registers in a dream once? whispered Aroma. Perhaps thats where Mrs Lian is going. Bao-yu nodded Yes! If only I hadnt forgotten what was written in them. Our lives are clearly preordained by destiny. I wonder where destiny has taken Cousin Lin? What you said just now, Aroma, about the registers, has set me thinking. If I ever have a dream like that again, I must be more observant. I may see things and be able to predict the future. Hark at you! retorted Aroma. Its impossible to have a sensible conversation with you. You insist on taking a chance remark of mine in deadly earnest. Even supposing you could see into the future, what good would it do you anyway? It will probably never come to pass, replied Bao-yu. But if I ever did know the future, then at least it would mean an end to all the worries that plague me on your account. Bao-chai came up to them What are you two talking about? Bao-yu was afraid of being subjected to one of her inquisitions, and merely replied We were discussing Cousin Feng.
asked Qiao-jie. The other evening replied Bao-chai, she wept herself into a terrible state and had a sudden giddy spell. Mother told one of the maids to help her up from the ground and in the end she went to sleep. There was so much else happening at the time that we never sent for a doctor. That must be what has brought this on. The doctor arrived presently, and the ladies withdrew. When he had taken Aromas pulses, he diagnosed her condition as the consequence of undue excitement and anger, wrote out a prescription accordingly and took his leave. Aroma had in fact overheard or thought she had overheard someone saying that if Bao-yu failed to return all of his maids would be dismissed. It was the shock of hearing this that had upset her and aggravated her illness. When the doctor had departed, and when Ripple went out to prepare her medicine, Aroma was left lying alone on her bed, and in her confusion she thought she could see Bao-yu standing before her. Then the dim figure of a monk appeared before her eyes, holding the pages of an album open in his hand and saying You are not destined to be mine. In days to come another will claim you for his own. Aroma was about to speak to him, when Ripple returned. Your medicines ready, she said. Youd better take it now. Aroma opened her eyes and knew that it had all been a dream. She did not confide in Ripple, but swallowed her medicine and lay there brooding to herself Bao-yu must have gone away with that monk. I remember that day when he tried to take the jade out and give it to the monk, he seemed bent on escaping. When I tried to stop him he wasnt his normal self, pushing and shoving me off like that. He didnt seem to care about me any more. And ever since then, he has been so cool with Mrs Bao, and quite indifferent towards the rest of us. I suppose you think this is enlightenment. But what sort of enlightenment is it, for you to abandon your own wife? Her Ladyship asked me to serve you, but although my monthly pay has been that of a chamber-wife, I have never been officially recognized as one. Now if the Master and Her Ladyship dismiss me and I insist on staying, out of respect to your memory, people will think me ridiculous. But how can I bear to leave, remembering how things were between us? She agonized over her dilemma, and recalling the ominous words Bao-yu had spoken to her in her dream she vowed to herself that if her destiny could not be shared with Bao-yu she would rather not live at all. With the medicine, however, the pain in her heart gradually subsided. She felt guilty to be lying down all the time, but forced herself to rest and struggled through the next few days until she was able to get up and about again and wait on her mistress. Bao-chai herself although she was constantly thinking of Bao-yu and shed many a tear in private over her own unhappy fate, was kept bus helping her own mother to arrange for the payment of Xue Pans commutation fine, by no means an easy task. But of this no more. Jia Zheng had arrived in Nanking with Grandmother Jias coffin, accompanied by Jia Rong and the coffins of Qin-shi, Xi-feng, Dai-yu and Faithful. They made arrangements for the Jia family members to be interred, and then Jia Rong took Dai-yus coffin to her owr family graveyard to be buried there, while Jia Zheng saw to the construction of the tombs. Then one day a letter arrived from home in which he read of the success achieved by Bao-yu and Jia Lan in their examinations - which gave him great pleasure - and of Bao-yus disappearance, which disturbed him greatly and made him decide to cut short his stay and hurry home. On his return journey he learned of the amnesty decreed by the Emperor, and received another letter from home telling him that Jia She and Cousin Zhen had been pardoned, and their titles restored. Much cheered by this news, he pressed on towards home, travelling by day and night. On the day when his boat reached the post-station at Piling, there was a sudden cold tarn in the weather and it began to snow. He moored in a quiet, lonely stretch of the canal and sent his servants ashore to deliver a few visiting-cards and to apologize to his friends in the locality, saying that since his boat was due to set off again at any moment he would not be able to call on them in person or entertain them aboard. Only one page-boy remained to wait on him while he sat in the cabin writing a letter home to be sent on ahead by land.
I shall say nothing of Cousin Huans conduct in this matter. I hardly need to. But so far as that creature Yun is concerned, the last time he was left in charge there was trouble, and now, in the few months that Ive been away, he has allowed the rot to set in. In my opinion he should be sent packing and never given a job of any kind here again. What about your own brother-in4aw, Wang Ren? exclaimed Lady Wang. What induced him to behave in such a despicable manner? Dont waste your breath on him, replied Jia Lian. I shall deal with him later. Suncloud came in to announce the arrival of Qiao-jie. When Lady Wang saw her, although the separation had not been a long one, the agonizing suspense of the days leading up to her escape flooded back into her mind, and she broke down and wept profusely. Qiao-jie cried a great deal herself. Jia Lian came over to thank Grannie Liu. Lady Wang bade her be seated, and together they discussed the whole adventure. When Jia Lian saw Patience again, he was overcome with gratitude for what she had done, and although he could hardly express his true feelings at such a family gathering, he could not help shedding a few tears. From this day on he held Patience in greater and greater esteem and resolved to promote her to the position of proper wife as soon as his father returned. But we anticipate. Lady Xing had been sure there would be trouble as soon as Jia Lian learned of Qiao-Jies disappearance. When she heard that he was at Lady Wangs she became most anxious and sent a maid to eavesdrop, who returned to inform her that Qiao-jie and Grannie Liu were both there talking, having just arrived back together. It suddenly dawned on Lady Xing what had happened. She knew that she had been hoodwinked and felt very peeved with Lady Wang Stirring up trouble between me and my son! I wonder who it was that told Patience our secret in the first place! At that moment she saw Qiao-jie and Grannie Liu come in, accompanied by Patience. Lady Wang followed them and spoke to her, laying the blame for everything on Jia Yun and Wang Ren You were taken in by what they said, Sister-in-law. You only meant the best. How could you have known the tricks and schemes they were up to! Lady Xing felt truly ashamed of herself. She saw that Lady Wang had acted rightly, and respected her for it. From now on relations between the two sisters-in-law became less strained. Patience spoke to Lady Wang, and then took Qiao-jie to say hello to Bao-chai. The two of them exchanged commiserations. With the Emperors favour now restored, said Qiao-jie, our family is sure to prosper once more. And surely Uncle Bao will come back. As they were talking, Ripple came running into the room in a great lather, crying Help! Aromas been taken poorly! But for the outcome, you must read the next chapter. CHAPTER 120 Zhen Shi-yin expounds the Nature of Passion and Illusion And Jia Yu-cun concludes the Dream of Golden Days As soon as she heard from Ripple that Aroma had been taken seriously ill, Bao-chai hurried in with Qiao-jie and Patience to see her. They found her lying unconscious on the kang, having had what seemed to be a heart seizure. They forced some cool boiled water through her lips and eventually she came round, whereupon they settled her down to sleep and sent for the doctor. How could Aroma have been taken like this so suddenly? asked Qiao-jie. The other evening replied Bao-chai, she wept herself into a terrible state and had a sudden giddy spell. Mother told one of the maids to help her up from the ground and in the end she went to sleep. There was so much else happening at the time that we never sent for a doctor. That must be what has brought this on. The doctor arrived presently, and the ladies withdrew. When he had taken Aromas pulses, he diagnosed her condition as the consequence of undue excitement and anger, wrote out a prescription accordingly and took his leave. Aroma had in fact overheard or thought she had overheard someone saying that if Bao-yu failed to return all of his maids would be dismissed. It was the shock of hearing this that had upset her and aggravated her illness. When the doctor had departed, and when Ripple went out to prepare her medicine, Aroma was left lying alone on her bed, and in her confusion she thought she could see Bao-yu standing before her. Then the dim figure of a monk appeared before her eyes, holding the pages of an album open in his hand and saying You are not destined to be mine.
Each establishment must make do with as few servants as possible. We would have had to manage with none at all if our household had been confiscated. The same goes for the ladies apartments. We must find husbands for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking. Its in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be Sent to take it back to them straight away. If anything else should happen to us, wed only involve them in a lot more trouble, push them out of the frying-pan and into the fire. Jia Zheng, who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters, mumbled a contrite Yes, Mother to all of these eminently practical instructions, thinking to himself What a flair she has for organization! And what worthless bunglers we all are by comparison! He could see that Grandmother Jia was tired, and begged her to lie down and rest. The little you see here is all I have left, she said. When I die, you can use some of it to pay for my funeral, and give the remainder to my maids. They found this mention of her death greatly upsetting, and all fell to their knees once more. Please set your mind at ease, Mother. In time to come, if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain His Majestys favour, then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors, to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year. If you can only somehow make amends, said Grandmother Jia, then perhaps I shall be able to face our ancestors with pride when I die. Dont think that I know only how to enjoy a comfortable life, and that I have no stomach for poverty! Thats not it at all. Its just that I am rather shocked by all this. During the past few years you have seemed so prosperous, and I was only too glad not to interfere to jolly along and mind my own business. I never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state. Ive always known that we were living beyond our means, of course, but I thought somehow wed manage to muddle through. I suppose we were dulled by habit we couldnt adjust, we were too used to things as they were. Well now we must use this opportunity to economize and set things to rights, or else our family will be the laughing-stock of the world. You may think its the poverty that appals me. But its not. What I have always cared about more than anything is our family tradition, our family honour. Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know. How is Mrs Lian? Grandmother Jia asked her before shed finished speaking. Not at all well today, replied Lady Wang on Felicitys behalf. Ail exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet. These young people are the bane of my life! I can see they want to drive me into my grave! She asked her maids to assist her and announced her intention of paying Xi-feng a visit herself Jia Zheng hastened to detain her, and endeavoured to calm her down This has all been so distressing for you, Mother. You have already exerted yourself so much in finding a solution to our problems. You really must give yourself a bit of a rest. I am sure my wife can go over and see to Xi-feng. There is no need for you to expose yourself to any further upsets. If anything serious were to happen to you, how should I ever forgive myself. You may all leave now, ordered Lady Jia. Come back a little later. There are still a few things I want to say. Jia Zheng, his attempt at filial consolation having been thus peremptorily crushed, did not venture to say any more.
He sent for Lai Da, and told him to make whatever preparations were necessary for the funeral. He himself reported Xi-fengs death to Jia Zheng and then went to see what other arrangements he could make. But there were simply no funds it was an impossible task. Fond memories of Xi-feng brought tears constantly to his eyes and his distress was made still more acute by the pitiful sight of Qiao-jie, crying her heart out for her mother. The weeping continued all that night. At dawn Jia Lian sent a messenger for Xi-fengs elder brother Wang Ren. The death of his older uncle Wang Zi-teng had left Wang Ren free to carry on very much as he pleased. Zi-sheng, the surviving younger uncle, was too ineffective a character to control him, and Wang Ren had already by his behaviour succeeded in causing considerable discord in the family. Now, learning of the death of his younger sister, he hurried over with a slightly ill grace to perform his duty as a bereaved brother and mourn for her. On his arrival he observed immediately how makeshift the funeral arrangements were and voiced his indignation in no uncertain terms Years my sister toiled for you, did a fine job of it too. The least you owe her is a proper funeral. You should be ashamed of yourselves, making such a poor show of it! Jia Lian had never been on good terms with his brother-in-law, and, when he heard him blustering on like this, turned a deaf ear. Wang Ren next called Qiao-jie aside. My girl, he said to her, while your mother was alive, she had one shortcoming she was too anxious to please Lady Jia, and as a result she neglected her own family. But youre old enough now to make decisions yourself, my dear! Look at me, have I ever tried to profit from you? Now that your mother is dead, you must look to me and do as I tell you. Your great-uncle and I are your mothers family. I know your father, hell go out of his way to bow and scrape to anyone, rather than take any notice of us. When that fancy woman of his, that Auntie You, died, I wasnt in town, but I heard that a lot of money was spent on her. And now hes Scrimping on your own mothers funeral. Dont you think you ought to have a word with him about it, and make him see sense? Father would like nothing more than to have a nice funeral, said Qiao-jie. But things have changed. We havent enough money, so of course we have to be a bit careful. What about your own things? pursued Wang Ren relendessly. Surely youve something left yourself? It all went in the raid last year, said Qiao-jie. Ive got nothing left at all. Are you trying me on too? expostulated Wang Ren. I know that Lady Jia gave away all sorts of things. You ought to produce your share now. Qiao-jie could not bring herself to admit that her father had already taken her share and sold it, and so pretended not to understand what he was referring to. I know! exclaimed Wang. Youre keeping it for your trousseau! Qiao-jie refused to say another word. Wang Ren had already offended her with his remarks and she began to sob until she was almost choking with emotion. If you have anything else to say, sir, protested Patience heatedly, please wait until Mr Lian comes back. Miss Qiao-jie is much too young to understand. As for you, youve just been itching for my sister to die, havent you! sneered Wang Ren. The lot of you! So you could step into her shoes ... Im not asking for much just a decent funeral. Surely you dont want to disgrace your own family? He sat himself down in a surly fashion. Qiao-jie was feeling very miserable. I know Father does care, she was thinking to herself. And besides, when Mother was alive, Uncle Ren sneaked off with all sorts of stuff of hers himself, so hes got no right to complain. In her eyes Wang Ren was rather a despicable sort of person. He for his part secretly reckoned to himself that Xi-feng must have kept her own private hoard, and that despite the raid there was bound to be silver somewhere in her apartment - and a fair amount of it too. They probably think Ive come to Sponge, and the girl is trying to protect them. She wont be any use to me, the little wretch! He began to conceive an intense dislike for his niece. Jia Lian was far too busy trying to rustle up money for the funeral to take in all these complications.
He moored in a quiet, lonely stretch of the canal and sent his servants ashore to deliver a few visiting-cards and to apologize to his friends in the locality, saying that since his boat was due to set off again at any moment he would not be able to call on them in person or entertain them aboard. Only one page-boy remained to wait on him while he sat in the cabin writing a letter home to be sent on ahead by land. When he came to write about Bao-yu, he paused for a moment and looked up. There, up on deck, standing in the very entrance to his cabin and silhouetted dimly against the snow, was the figure of a man with shaven head and bare feet, wrapped in a large cape made of crimson felt. The figure knelt down and bowed to Jia Zheng, who did not recognize the features and hurried out on deck, intending to raise him up and ask him his name. The man bowed four times, and now stood upright, pressing his palms together in monkish greeting. Jia Zheng was about to reciprocate with a respectful bow of the head when he looked into the mans eyes and with a sudden shock recognized him as Bao-yu. Are you not my son? he asked. The man was silent and an expression that seemed to contain both joy and sorrow played on his face. Jia Zheng asked again If you are Bao-yu, why are you dressed like this? And what brings you to this place? Before Bao-yu could reply two other men appeared on the deck, a Buddhist monk and a Taoist, and holding him between them they said Come, your earthly karma is complete. Tarry no longer. The three of them mounted the bank and strode off into the snow. Jia Zheng went chasing after them along the slippery track, but although he could spy them ahead of him, somehow they always remained just out of reach. He could hear all three of them singing some sort of a song On Green sickness Peak -2507 I dwell In the Cosmic Void I roam. Who will pass over, -2507 Who will go with me, Who will explore The supremely ineffable Vastly mysterious -2507 Wilderness To which I return! Jia Zheng listened to the song and continued to follow them until they rounded the slope of a small hill and suddenly vanished from sight. He was weak and out of breath by now with the exertion of the chase, and greatly mystified by what he had seen. Looking back he saw his page-boy, hurrying up behind him. Did you see those three men just now? he questioned him. Yes, sir, I did, replied the page. I saw you following them, so I came too. Then they disappeared and I could see no one but you. J ia Zheng wanted to continue, but all he could see before him was a vast expanse of white, with not a soul anywhere. He knew there was more to this strange occurrence than he could understand, and reluctantly he turned back and began to retrace his steps. The other servants had returned to their masters boat to find the cabin empty and were told by the boatman that Jia Zheng had gone on shore in pursuit of two monks and a Taoist. They followed his footsteps through the snow and when they saw him coming towards them in the distance hurried forward to meet him, and then all returned to the boat together. Jia Zheng sat down to regain his breath and told them what had happened. They sought his authority to mount a search for Bao-yu in the area, but Jia Zheng dismissed the idea. You do not understand, he said with a sigh. This was indeed no supernatural apparition I saw these men with my own eyes. I heard them singing, and the words of their song held a most profound and mysterious meaning. Bao-yu came into the world with his jade, and there was always something strange about it. I knew it for an ill omen. But because his grandmother doted on him so, we nurtured him and brought him up until now. That monk and that Taoist I have seen before, three times altogether. The first time was when they came to extol the virtues of the jade the second was when Bao-yu was seriously ill and the monk came and said a prayer over the jade, which seemed to cure Bao-yu at once the third time was when he restored the jade to us after it had been lost. He was sitting in the hall one minute, and the next he had vanished completely. I thought it strange at the time and could only conclude that perhaps Bao-yu was In some way blessed and that these two holy men had come to protect him. But the truth of the matter must be that he himself is a being from a higher realm who has descended into the world to experience the trials of this human life.
Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know. How is Mrs Lian? Grandmother Jia asked her before shed finished speaking. Not at all well today, replied Lady Wang on Felicitys behalf. Ail exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet. These young people are the bane of my life! I can see they want to drive me into my grave! She asked her maids to assist her and announced her intention of paying Xi-feng a visit herself Jia Zheng hastened to detain her, and endeavoured to calm her down This has all been so distressing for you, Mother. You have already exerted yourself so much in finding a solution to our problems. You really must give yourself a bit of a rest. I am sure my wife can go over and see to Xi-feng. There is no need for you to expose yourself to any further upsets. If anything serious were to happen to you, how should I ever forgive myself. You may all leave now, ordered Lady Jia. Come back a little later. There are still a few things I want to say. Jia Zheng, his attempt at filial consolation having been thus peremptorily crushed, did not venture to say any more. He went out to superintend the practical arrangements for the convicts departure and instructed Jia Lian to choose some servants to accompany them. Faithful assembled a group of serving-women to carry Xi-fengs presents and to escort Grandmother Jia over to Xi-fengs apartment. Xi-feng was very weak and almost unconscious, while Patiences eyes were red and swollen from crying. When she heard that Lady Jia and Lady Wang, accompanied by Bao-yu and Bao-chai, were on their way, Patience hurried out anxiously to greet them. How is she now? asked Grandmother Jia the moment she saw Patience. Patience was afraid of frightening the old lady. A little better, maam. She escorted the party inside and hurrying over to Xi-fengs bed lightly drew aside the bed curtains. Xi-feng opened her eyes and, when she saw Grandmother Jia enter the room, was filled with shame. Earlier she had come to the conclusion-that the whole family had turned against her, that no one cared for her any more, that they were all indifferent whether she lived or died. And yet now Grandmother Jia had come to visit her personally. Her spirits were immediately restored, and she even struggled to sit up but Grandmother Jia ordered Patience to settle her down again. Dont you move, dear, she said to Xi-feng. Are you feeling a little better now? Oh yes, Grannie, I am. A lot better, replied Xi-feng, holding back her tears. But it grieves me when I think how you and Mother and Aunt Wang have loved me, ever since I came here as a young bride, and how little I have been able to return that love. How cruelly fate has possessed me, driving me quite out of my mind, making me fail in my duty to you and Aunt Wang, preventing me from ever winning your praise ... Yet still you trusted me, still you allowed me to play my part. And all Ive ever done is ruin things for everyone! How can I look you and Auntie in the face again? This visit is more than I deserve. Im afraid Heaven will punish me for it, by taking away most of the few days I may have left to live... She sobbed violently. This whole nonsense was started by the men, Grandmother Jia consoled her. It was nothing to do with you. I know some of your belongings have been taken, but dont you worry Ive brought you all sorts of presents - take a look and see. She instructed one of the serving-women to bring the presents forward and exhibit them. Possessions had always meant a great deal to Xi-feng, and the sudden loss of all of her worldly goods had dealt a severe blow to her morale. She had also been tormenting herself with the thought that everyone in the family secretly blamed her for what had happened, and as a consequence she had all but lost her will to live.
He reported first to Lady Wang, and then went to the Board of Civil Office, where his enquiries revealed that the only person to have suffered in the Xue Pan affair was the acting magistrate of Tai-ping, who had lost his job, and that Jia Zheng was not in any way implicated. The servant sent back a reassuring report to Jia Zheng, himself remaining behind to await further developments. It will be remembered to what lengths Aunt Xue had gone, and with what large sums of money she had bribed the various courts involved, to bring in a verdict of accidental homicide in the earlier stages of Xue Pans case. She had been proposing to raise the money for his fine by selling the family pawnshop business. Now when she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage. Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama! With the fortune that Grandpa left, he should have been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. But instead its been one disaster after another. First came Nanking and that disgraceful business over Caltrop. He was entirely to blame for that poor young mans death, and it was just lucky for him that we still had plenty of pull and money in those days, and were able to get him off. Youd have thought a scrape like that would have been enough to make him mend his ways. Youd have thought he might have taken life a bit more seriously after that and devoted more time to looking after his own mother. But no, as soon as we arrived here, it was the same story all over again. I hate to think how much youve suffered on his account, Mama, how many tears youve shed. Then he got married, and at last we thought life might quieten down a bit for all of us. But fate evidently had something else in mind. Eventually that dreadful woman drove him away with her insufferable carryings on. And even that was not the end of it. As the saying goes Fate moves in a narrow lane, and collisions are hard to avoid! It was only a few days before he was mixed up in this new murder case! You and Cousin Ke have done everything you possibly could. Apart from all the money youve spent, youve never stopped asking for help and thinking of ways to get him out. You cant go on struggling with fate. Hell have to pay the price for his own misdeeds. Most parents look to their children for support in their old age, and even in poor families a man will do his best to earn his mother a bowl of rice. But what has Pan done? Squandered a ready-made fortune, and made your life a misery. I know I shouldnt say this, but the truth is, hes the bane of your life, an affliction sent to test you, not a real son to you. You refuse to accept the truth, and wear yourself out like this, weeping at all hours of the day and night. Youve got quite enough to cope with already, what with Jin-gui and her tantrums. It worries me so, seeing you in this state. I only wish I could be here with you all the time, and help keep the peace. But I cant. Bao-yu would never let me come back, however halfwitted he may be. The other day Sir Zheng sent a message home to say how shocked he was to read the report in the Gazette. He has already sent one of his men to try to intervene on Pans behalf. So you see - there are so many people trying to help Pan Out of this mess hes made. And thank goodness Im at least close by. I think if I were living a long way off and heard that this had happened, Id simply die worrying about you. Please, Mama, give yourself a moments respite. Be thankful that Pan is still alive. Use this opportunity to take stock. Ask one of the older men in the firm to find Out what we owe and what we are owed, and see exactly how much we have left. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue tearfully, the past few days I have been so preoccupied with your brother I simply havent had time to tell you of our own troubles. Whenever youve come to see me its either been you trying to cheer me up or me giving you the latest news from the yamen. I havent told you the worst. We have been struck off the register of court purveyors. Two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale, while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and were involved in another court case over that.
Ill drop in at Rong-guo House, mention it to them, and the matter will soon be settled. This Mayor Jia owes everything to his connection with the Rong-guo Jias. One word from them and Dime will be a free man again! Dimes wife and daughter returned home in high spirits and with great expectations. They went to visit Dime in the yamen where he was being held prisoner, and told him the good news, that thanks to 3 the intervention of Jia Yun and the Jia family he would shortly be set free. Dime was greatly relieved. Unfortunately Jia Yun, having had his previous overtures rebuffed by Xi-feng, had been too cowed to visit her again, and since that day had hardly set foot inside Rong-guo House. The men on the Rongguo gate treated callers strictly according to their standing with the family. If the family were known to have received a person with cordiality and respect, that person was welcomed and announced immediately if on the other hand, a person had once been cold- shouldered, the servants were quick to take their cue. If such a person called again, even if he were a relative, they would refuse to report his arrival and would send him away without more ado. So, when Jia Yun turned up and asked to pay his respects to Jia Lian, he got a very cool reception at the gate Mr Lian is not in. When he comes home, we will inform him that you called. Jia Yun would have persisted and asked to see Mrs Lian, but he was afraid to provoke the gatemen any further, and with some reluctance turned about and went home. He had to face renewed importuning from Dimes wife and daughter the next day But Mr Yun! We thought you said the Jias could get anything they wanted out of anyone! Youre one of the family, and this isnt a big thing to ask. You cant have failed! You cant let us down like this! Jia Yun felt thoroughly humiliated, and tried to bluff his way out Yesterday my relatives were too busy to send anyone. But Im sure they will do something about it today, and then Dime will be set free. Theres really no need to worry. Dimes wife and daughter waited to see how things would turn out. Jia Yun, having failed to gain access by the front entrance of Rong-guo House, now tried the back, thinking he might be able to get in touch with Bao-yu in the Garden. To his surprise he found the garden gate locked, and was obliged to return home once more, dejected and crestfallen. It was only a few years ago that Dime lent me that money, he thought to himself. I used it to buy Mrs Lian a present of camphor and musk, and as a result she gave me the tree-planting job. But this time, just because I cant afford presents, I get the brush-off. Shes got nothing to be proud of lending out money - money thats been handed down in the family - while poor householders like us cant even borrow a tael when we need it. I suppose she thinks shes being clever, that this is a nice little nest-egg, a clever way to protect her own future. She doesnt know what a stinking reputation shes earned for herself. If I keep my mouth shut, well and good but if I tell people what I know, shell have more than one life to answer for in court! He found Dimes wife and daughter waiting for him when he got back, and this time he had to admit, albeit in a modified form, that his mission had not borne fruit The Jias did send someone to put in a word for Dime, but Im afraid Mayor Jia wont set him free. You might have more luck if you try Mr Leng Zi-xing. Hes related to Mrs Zhou, and she works for the Jias. What earthly good will a servant be, complained Dimes family, when a respectable member of the family such as yourself can do nothing for us! Jia Yun found this highly mortifying. What you dont seem to realize, he protested indignantly, is that nowadays servants can have more pull than their masters! Dimes wife and daughter could see that they were wasting their time with him. Were much obliged to you for all the trouble youve gone to, Mr Yun, they muttered sarcastically. When Father gets out hes sure to want to thank you himself... They went their way. Eventually they found somebody else to assist in the extrication of Dime, who was duly acquitted and released, having suffered no more by way of punishment than a few strokes of the rod. Upon his return to the family hearth, his womenfolk related to Dime how the Jias had failed to intervene on his behalf.
Bao-yu smiled. Oriole continued She said that now you are studying so hard, you are sure to pass your exam and then if you go on and become a Palace Graduate and an official, your parents hopes for you will not have been in vain. Oriole suddenly remembered what Bao-yu had once said to her, the day she had knotted tassels for him. I hope you do pass! she went on animatedly. It will be such a blessing for our mistress. Remember what you said that day in the Garden, when you asked me to knot you a plum-blossom tassel? You wondered what lucky household the mistress would take me to when she married? Well, you were the lucky one after all! There was something about what she said and the way she said it that aroused in Bao-yu once more an old and all too human emotion. But the nostalgia soon passed he composed himself again and said with a gentle smile So, according to you, I am lucky, and so is your mistress. But how do you feel about it? Oriole flushed at once, and forced a smile Were just maids. Being lucky or not doesnt really enter into it for us. Bao-yu smiled again As a matter of fact, even if you did spend your whole life as a maid, you might turn out to have been luckier than either of us. This sounded to Oriole like more of his foolishness. She was afraid of being responsible for another of his scenes, and deemed it prudent to leave, but before she could do so, Bao-yu laughed Silly girl! Let me tell you something. If you want to know what it was, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 119 Bao-yu becomes a Provincial Graduate and severs worldly ties The House of Jia receives Imperial favour and renews ancestral glory As we told in the last chapter, Oriole, perplexed by Bao-yus words, had been about to leave when she heard him speak again Silly girl! Let me tell you something. If your mistress is lucky, then so are you, since you are her maid. Aroma cannot be depended upon. In future, mark my words, you must look after your mistress with care and devotion, and in the end you may receive a fitting reward for your years of service. To Oriole Bao-yus speech, although it began with some semblance of sense, tailed off into rambling nonsense. Well, she replied, Id better be going now. Madam is waiting for me. If you want any more sweets, Mr Bao, just send one of the junior maids to fetch me. Bao-yu nodded and Oriole went on her way. Shortly afterwards, Bao-chai and Aroma returned from the front room. The time drew near for the examination. All the family were full of eager anticipation, hoping that the two boys would write creditable compositions and bring the family honour. All except for Bao-chai while it was true that Bao-yu had prepared well, she had also on occasions noticed a strange indifference in his behaviour. Her first concern. was that the two boys, for both of whom this was the first venture of its kind, might get hurt or have some accident in the crush of men and vehicles around the examination halls. She was more particularly worried for Bao-yu, who had not been out at all since his encounter with the monk. His delight in studying seemed to her the result of a somewhat too hasty and not altogether convincing conversion, and she had a premonition that something untoward was going to happen. So, on the day before the big event, she despatched Aroma and a few of the junior maids to go with Candida and her helpers and make sure that the candidates were both properly prepared. She herself inspected their things and put them out in readiness, and then went over with Li Wan to Lady Wangs apartment, where she selected a few of the more trusty family retainers to accompany them the next day, for fear they might be jolted or trampled on in the crowds. The big day finally arrived, and Bao-yu and Jia Lan changed into smart but unostentatious clothes. They came over m high spirits to bid farewell to Lady Wang, who gave them a few parting words of advice This is the first examination for both of you, and although you are such big boys now, it will still be the first time either of you has been away from me for a whole day. You may have gone out m the past, but you were always surrounded by your maids and nurses. You have never spent the night away on your own like this. Today, when you both go into the examination, you are bound to feel rather lonely with none of the family by you.
What induced him to behave in such a despicable manner? Dont waste your breath on him, replied Jia Lian. I shall deal with him later. Suncloud came in to announce the arrival of Qiao-jie. When Lady Wang saw her, although the separation had not been a long one, the agonizing suspense of the days leading up to her escape flooded back into her mind, and she broke down and wept profusely. Qiao-jie cried a great deal herself. Jia Lian came over to thank Grannie Liu. Lady Wang bade her be seated, and together they discussed the whole adventure. When Jia Lian saw Patience again, he was overcome with gratitude for what she had done, and although he could hardly express his true feelings at such a family gathering, he could not help shedding a few tears. From this day on he held Patience in greater and greater esteem and resolved to promote her to the position of proper wife as soon as his father returned. But we anticipate. Lady Xing had been sure there would be trouble as soon as Jia Lian learned of Qiao-Jies disappearance. When she heard that he was at Lady Wangs she became most anxious and sent a maid to eavesdrop, who returned to inform her that Qiao-jie and Grannie Liu were both there talking, having just arrived back together. It suddenly dawned on Lady Xing what had happened. She knew that she had been hoodwinked and felt very peeved with Lady Wang Stirring up trouble between me and my son! I wonder who it was that told Patience our secret in the first place! At that moment she saw Qiao-jie and Grannie Liu come in, accompanied by Patience. Lady Wang followed them and spoke to her, laying the blame for everything on Jia Yun and Wang Ren You were taken in by what they said, Sister-in-law. You only meant the best. How could you have known the tricks and schemes they were up to! Lady Xing felt truly ashamed of herself. She saw that Lady Wang had acted rightly, and respected her for it. From now on relations between the two sisters-in-law became less strained. Patience spoke to Lady Wang, and then took Qiao-jie to say hello to Bao-chai. The two of them exchanged commiserations. With the Emperors favour now restored, said Qiao-jie, our family is sure to prosper once more. And surely Uncle Bao will come back. As they were talking, Ripple came running into the room in a great lather, crying Help! Aromas been taken poorly! But for the outcome, you must read the next chapter. CHAPTER 120 Zhen Shi-yin expounds the Nature of Passion and Illusion And Jia Yu-cun concludes the Dream of Golden Days As soon as she heard from Ripple that Aroma had been taken seriously ill, Bao-chai hurried in with Qiao-jie and Patience to see her. They found her lying unconscious on the kang, having had what seemed to be a heart seizure. They forced some cool boiled water through her lips and eventually she came round, whereupon they settled her down to sleep and sent for the doctor. How could Aroma have been taken like this so suddenly? asked Qiao-jie. The other evening replied Bao-chai, she wept herself into a terrible state and had a sudden giddy spell. Mother told one of the maids to help her up from the ground and in the end she went to sleep. There was so much else happening at the time that we never sent for a doctor. That must be what has brought this on. The doctor arrived presently, and the ladies withdrew. When he had taken Aromas pulses, he diagnosed her condition as the consequence of undue excitement and anger, wrote out a prescription accordingly and took his leave. Aroma had in fact overheard or thought she had overheard someone saying that if Bao-yu failed to return all of his maids would be dismissed. It was the shock of hearing this that had upset her and aggravated her illness. When the doctor had departed, and when Ripple went out to prepare her medicine, Aroma was left lying alone on her bed, and in her confusion she thought she could see Bao-yu standing before her. Then the dim figure of a monk appeared before her eyes, holding the pages of an album open in his hand and saying You are not destined to be mine. In days to come another will claim you for his own. Aroma was about to speak to him, when Ripple returned. Your medicines ready, she said. Youd better take it now. Aroma opened her eyes and knew that it had all been a dream. She did not confide in Ripple, but swallowed her medicine and lay there brooding to herself Bao-yu must have gone away with that monk.
in the Spring and Autumn period, King Wen of the state of Chu ruled 689-676 BC defeated and put to death the ruler of the state of Xi. He then took the Lord Xis widow as his concubine and had two sons by her. She refused to communicate verbally with her new master, however. and when King Wen asked her the reason for her silence she eventually replied I, a widow, now serve a second husband. Having thus failed to seek death, what is there that I can say? Aromas married life is the first chapter of another history. Our narrative returns to Jia Yu-cun, who, having been convicted of avarice and extortion, was also released under the general amnesty and allowed to return to his native city as a common citizen. He sent his family on ahead and himself travelled with a young page and a cartload of baggage. His journey brought him once more to Wake Ness Ferry at Rushford Hythe, and as he approached the river he saw a Taoist hermit emerging from a thatched hut by the waters edge, clasping his hands in greeting. This time Yu-cun recognized him at once as Zhen Shi-yin and promptly bowed in response. Esteemed Mr Jia, began the old hermit, I trust you have been well since we last parted? So you, sir, are indeed my erstwhile patron Mr Zhen, in Immortal form! exclaimed Yu-cun. Why did I not know you at our last encounter? Afterwards, when I heard that your hermitage had been destroyed by fire, I was most concerned for your safety. I am fortunate indeed to have been granted this second opportunity to marvel at the profundity of your spiritual attainments. Alas, I am as benighted as ever, as you can see from my present condition. On the previous occasion, replied Zhen Shi-yin, your position was so exalted that I dared not presume an acquaintance. Because of our old friendship, I said a few words, which you ignored altogether. Wealth and poverty, success and failure, none of these are coincidental. Nor is our meeting again like this today a coincidence, but rather a meaningful and marvellous event. We are not far from my lodge and I would be delighted if you could stop by and pass the time of day with me. Jia Yu-cun consented with pleasure and the two men walked hand in hand, the page following them with the baggage-cart to the little thatched hermitage. Shi-yin ushered Yu-cun in, and he sat down and was brought tea by the old mans acolyte. Yu-cun asked to hear the story of his mystical conversion, and Shi-yin smiled In an instant my world was transformed. You yourself, sir, hailing as you do from the realm of luxury and opulence, must surely have heard there of a person by the name of Bao-yu? Of course, replied Yu-cun. Recently I heard a rumour to the effect that he too has taken refuge in the dharma. I saw something of him in the past and it certainly never occurred to me that he would take a step like this. There is nothing unexpected about it, said Shi-yin. I have known of his strange destiny for many years. Ever since that day long ago, in fact, when I met you outside my abode in Carnal Lane and we had that little chat. I had already encountered him then. But the capital is a long way from your old home, said Yu-cun in great surprise. How could you possibly have set eyes on him at that time? We had long enjoyed a spiritual communion, replied Shi-yin darkly. In that case, sir, you must know of his present whereabouts? Bao-yu, replied the old man, is the Stone, the Precious Jade. Before the two mansions of Rong and Ning were searched and their worldly goods impounded, on the very day when Bao-chai and Dai-yu were separated, the Stone had already quit the world. This was in part to avoid the impending calamity, in part to permit the consummation of the union. From that moment the Stones worldly karma was complete, its substance had returned to the Great Unity. All that remained was for it to demonstrate some small fraction of its spiritual powers by achieving academic distinction and by leaving behind an heir to bring honour to the family name. Thus its precious nature, its magical power, its capacity for spiritual transformation, these were made manifest, and all could know that it was no ordinary stone of this world. To this end the Buddhist mah sattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso first brought it into the world, and now that its destiny is fulfilled it is they who will take it back once more to its place of origin.
The other gentlemen present concurred. So Jia Zheng kowtowed again, first towards the Emperor and then to the prince, and left the Palace, hurrying home to hear the news to Grandmother Jia, knowing the anxious suspense in which she would be awaiting his return. The entire Jia household, menfolk and womenfolk, were waiting anxiously at the entrance of Rong-guo House to learn the outcome of his interview, and breathed a huge sigh of relief when they saw him return safely home. None dared to question him as he hurried past them and on into Grandmother Jias apartment. He recounted to her the details of the latest Edict and Grandmother Jia, though pleased that some of the charges had been dropped, was understandably distressed to learn that the two titles were lost to the family and that both Jia She and Cousin Zhen were sentenced to penal servitude. Lady Xing and You-shi simply broke down when they heard the news. You must not distress yourself Mother, pleaded Jia Zheng. Al-though Brother She will have to work at the Mongolian frontier post, he will still be serving the nation, and will not be maltreated. If he acquits himself creditably, he may be fully reinstated. As for Zhen, he is still a young man and a bit of hard work certainly wont do him any harm. This is a lesson we would have had to learn sooner or later. We cannot rest for ever on the laurels of our forefathers. He added a few more words of this kind, which comforted Grandmother Jia. After all, she had never been particularly fond of Jia She, and Cousin Zhen was not her own grandson. But Lady Xing and You-shi were inconsolable. We are ruined! thought Lady Xing to hersel With my husband sent into exile in his old age, who can I turn to? Lian is supposed to be my son, but he has always attached himself more to his uncle Zheng than to his own father. Now that we are all dependent on Zheng, Lian and Xi-feng are bound to lean even more towards that side of the family. I shall be completely abandoned I have nothing to look forward to but loneliness and misery for the rest of my days. You-shi had always been in charge of Ning-guo House, and apart from Cousin Zhen she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff. She and Cousin Zhen had a happy marriage moreover. Now he was to be sent away in disgrace, every-thing they had was confiscated, and they would be obliged to look to the Rong-guo branch for support. Grandmother Jia loved her well enough, but still, she would be the recipient of charity, and she would have to bring Lovey and Dove along with her, not to mention young Rong and his wife, who were still too young to be independent. It was really Lians fault that my sisters came to such a wretched end, she reflected. And yet he and Xi-feng have survived unscathed, while we are reduced to this desperate state of affairs. Grandmother Jia was greatly affected by You-shis disconsolate sobbing, and she turned to Jia Zheng and asked him Now that their sentence has been pronounced, will your brother She and young Zhen be allowed to come home to say goodbye? Rong has been acquitted, so I assume that he will be set free. In the normal course of events such a visit would not be allowed, replied Jia Zheng. But I have already asked if as a personal favour Brother She and Cousin Zhen could be allowed home to make preparations for their departure, and the Board of Punishments has most graciously agreed to make this concession. I assume that Rong will be set free and will accompany them. Now, please dont you worry, Mother. I shall do all I can for them. Im growing old and senile, said Grandmother Jia. Its years since I last enquired about the familys finances. The Ning-guo side has had everything confiscated, I know, and that of course includes the house itself. On our side, your brother She and Lian have had their things taken too. Now, youd better tell me how much money do we have left? And what are our estates in the Eastern provinces worth? When those two have to go, we must give them a few thousand taels of silver to take with them. Jia Zheng saw himself caught. If I tell the truth, he thought to himself, I fear it will come as a great blow. But if I conceal it, heaven alone knows how we will be able to pay for our present needs, let alone manage in the future. Had you not asked, Mother, he began, I would never have bothered you with this.
The maid was obliged to return and on her way met Ripple. Did you see where Mr Bao went? Im looking for him too, said Ripple. Her Ladyship and the others are waiting for him so that they can start dinner. Where can he have got to? Youd better hurry back and report to Her Old Ladyship. Dont say we cant find him, just say the wine didnt agree with him and he wont be having any dinner. Say hell be over when hes had a little lie-down. Ask Her Old Ladyship and Their Ladyships to start without him. The junior maid carried Ripples message to Pearl, who passed it on to Grandmother Jia. He doesnt usually eat much anyway, commented the old lady. He may as well miss out on dinner then, and have a rest. Tell him he neednt come back at all today. His wife is here, and that will do. Is that clear? said Pearl to the junior maid. Yes, Miss Pearl, said the maid, not daring to explain what had really happened. She went out and walked around for a bit, then returned, claiming to have conveyed the message to Bao-yu. No one took a great deal of notice. They ate their dinner and then sat chatting. Our narrative leaves them and returns to Bao-yu. Overwhelmed by a sudden sense of grief, he had quit the party and was wandering aimlessly outside. Aroma hurried after him and asked what the matter was. Nothing really, he replied. I just feel very miserable all of a sudden. Why dont we go for a little stroll over to the apartment where Cousin Zhens wife is living, and leave them to their drinking? But Mrs Zhen is at the party, said Aroma. Who do you want to visit in her apartment? No one, replied Bao-yu. I just thought I might drop in on her for a second. Id forgotten she was at the party. Id still like to go and see what sort of an apartment it is that she is living in. Aroma went along with him, and the two of them talked as they went. They soon came to You-shis apartment, and noticed that the small side gate next to it leading into the Garden was half-ajar. Bao-yu did not go into You-shis apartment at all instead he went up to the two old serving-women in charge of the side gate, who were sitting there on the threshold having a conversation, and asked them Is this side gate kept open? Not usually, replied one of them. But today we were told that Her Old Ladyship might be wanting some fruit from the Garden, so its to be kept open in case. Bao-yu walked slowly up to the gate and, having confirmed for himself that it was open, made as if to go in but Aroma held him back anxiously. You mustnt go in there. The Garden is haunted. Its been empty for ages. You might bump into something nasty like the others did! Bao-yu was tipsy enough to feel a little daring, and replied Im not afraid of such things! Aroma tugged at him with all her might and wouldnt let go. The serving-woman came up Nowadays the Garden is ever so quiet and peaceful. Since the priests came and drove away the evil spirits, we often go in on our own to pick flowers and fruit. If Mr Bao wants to have a look, well go in with him. With so many of us, theres surely nothing to be afraid of. Bao-yu was delighted and Aroma was obliged to abandon her attempts to dissuade him, and followed them in hersel As Bao-yu entered the Garden, a scene of utter desolation greeted his eyes whichever way he turned. The flowers and trees seemed every one to be wilting, to be more dead than alive, and the paint had long since started to peel from the walls of many of the buildings. In the distance he espied a thicket of bamboo, an isolated patch of brilliant green foliage. Bao-yu contemplated the view for a moment. Ever since I fell ill and left the Garden, he said, Ive been living at Grannies. It must be months since Ive been here. What a wilderness it has become in that time! But look over there at that single clump of green bamboo thats doing so well - surely thats the Naiads House? Youve been away too long, said Aroma. Youve lost your sense of direction. While weve been talking weve already walked past Green Delights. And look - she turned back and pointed - theres the Naiads House, over there! Bao-yus eyes followed the direction of her pointing hand. If weve already passed it, then lets go back and have a look.
Id like to sit up and chat for a bit. Pearl and the other maids gently supported her with their hands. She seemed momentarily revived. Whether she was to live or die will be told in the next chapter. CHAPTER 110 Lady Jia ends her days, and returns to the land of shades Wang Xi-feng exhausts her strength, and forfeits the familys esteem Grandmother Jia sat up in bed and began to speak I have been part of the Jia family for over sixty years. I have had a long life and enjoyed my full share of happiness. I think I can say that all my children and grandchildren from Zheng downwards have turned out well. As for Bao-yu I have loved him so dearly and Her eyes searched the room for Bao-yu, and Lady Wang pushed him towards the bed. Grandmother Jia extended one hand from beneath the bedcovers and took hold of him My boy, you must promise to do your very best for the family! Yes, Grandma, choked Bao-yu, his eyes brimming with tears. He struggled to contain his weeping and stood listening to her, as she continued I want to see one of my great-grandchildren, and then I think I can set my heart at rest. Wheres my little Lan? Li Wan pushed Lan forwards. Grandmother Jia let go of Bao-yu and took Lan by the hand. You must be a good boy and always do your duty to your mother. And when youre grown up, you must win her honour and glory! Now, wheres Fengie? Xi-feng was standing by the side of the bed and hurried round to face Grandmother Jia. Here I am, Grandma. My child, said Grandmother Jia, your trouble is that youre too clever! Try to be more charitable in future and to make your peace with fate, I know Im not much of a one to talk the most Ive done in my life is try to be honest and to bear my misfortunes with patience. Ive never been the sort for fasting or prayer. The only good work I ever did was to have those copies of the Diamond Sutra made a year or so ago. I wonder if theyve all been distributed yet? Xi-feng informed her that the copies had not yet been distributed. The sooner that act of devotion is completed the better, said the old lady. I know my elder son She and Cousin Zhen are detained in exile, and cannot be here but how could that little devil Xiang-yun be so heartless? Why has she not come to see me? Faithful and her fellow maids knew the reason only too well, but said nothing. Grandmother Jia looked next at Bao-chai. As she did so, she sighed and a flush began to spread across her face. Jia Zheng knew this to be a sign of imminent death. He came forward with the ginseng broth, but Grandmother Jias teeth were already tightly clenched. She closed her eyes, then opened them once more and gazed round the entire room. Lady Wang and Bao-chai came forward and supported her gently, while Lady Xing and Xi-feng dressed her. The old serving-woman prepared the bed where she was to be laid out, and arranged the coverlet. There was a faint rattle in her throat, a smile stole across her face, and she was gone. She was eighty-two years old. The serving-women hurried forward to lay her on the bed. Jia Zheng and the other menfolk knelt in the outer room, Lady Xing and the womenfolk knelt by the bed from both rose the first chorus of lamentation. The servants outside had all made their preparations, and as soon as word came from the inner quarters, every gateway was thrown open, from the main entrance to the inner gate leading to the ladies apartments, and white paper was pasted on every door. The funeral awning was raised over the courtyard, and a memorial archway erected outside the main entrance. Every member of the household immediately put on their mourning clothes. Jia Zheng reported his bereavement and the commencement of his three-year period of mourning to the Board of Rites, who submitted a memorial requesting the Emperors instructions in the matter. His Majesty, being a person of the profoundest compassion and kindliness, in consideration of the services rendered and distinctions obtained by previous generations of the family, and especially in view of the relationship of the deceased to the Imperial Jia Concubine, authorized a bounty of one thousand taels of silver and instructed officers from the Board of Rites to make offerings and do reverence before her coffin. Jia household servants were despatched to notify all relatives and family friends of Lady Jias death, and they all came to condole for while they knew that the Jias had come down in the world, they also saw that the family continued to enjoy the Emperors favour.
But if everyone with those feelings adopted your attitude, for a start, I wouldnt be living with you now, Id still be. at home. Honestly! Reading hooks is supposed to improve the mind and foster a more sensible approach to life. But your wits seem more addled than ever! If thats what you really think, Aroma and I may as well go and live somewhere else. Then you can go ahead and invite all the others to move in and look after you. Bao-yu took both of them by the hand I know youre right. But why must it happen so soon? Couldnt they wait till I am dust and ashes! Aroma put her hand over his mouth There you go! More nonsense! Youve only just begun to recover, and Mrs Baos getting her appetite back again at last. If you make another scene I shall wash my hands of you altogether! Bao-yu knew that they were talking sense. But in his heart he couldnt find a way to their sensible point of view. What you are saying is obviously right, he moaned. But what can I do? I feel so utterly wretched. Bao-chai said nothing more but secretly despatched Aroma to fetch him a sedative. They did their best to calm him down, and Aroma suggested to Bao-chai that they should ask Tan-chun to refrain from calling on Bao-yu before her departure. Theres no need to worry, said Bao-chai. In a day or two, when hes in a more reasonable frame of mind, it would actually be a good thing for them to have a long talk. Tan is an extremely intelligent person, and not the type to pander to the sensibilities of others. Im sure shell give him some sound advice, and help to cure him from thinking in this way. Meanwhile Faithful arrived with a message from Grandmother Jia who had just learned of Bao-yus relapse. Aroma was to comfort him and on no account to allow him to fret. Aroma assured Faithful that she would follow Grandmother Jias instructions, and after sitting with them for a short while Faithful returned. -576 Grandmother Jia was also concerned about the preparations for Tan-chuns departure. Although Tan-chun would not be travelling with a complete trousseau, they should nevertheless provide her with all the personal effects she might need. Grandmother Jia sent for Xi-feng, told her of Jia Zhengs decision and placed these arrangements in her hands. Xi-feng undertook this responsibility, but to learn how she managed you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 101 In Prospect Garden a moonlit apparition repeats an andent warning And at Scattered Flowers Convent the fortune-sticks provide a strange omen Xi-feng returned to her apartment and, seeing that Jia Lian had not yet come home, began supervising the preparation of Tan-chuns baggage and trousseau. Later that evening, as dusk was giving way to night, she suddenly conceived the idea of going to visit Tan-chun. She told Felicity and a couple of other maids to accompany her, and sent one of them on ahead with a lantern. As they walked out, a brilliant moon had already risen, and Xi-feng told the maid carrying the lantern that she would not be needed and could go home. Then, as they passed the window of the tea-room frequented by the domestics, she heard the sound of chattering coming from within. An animated discussion of some sort seemed to be in progress, punctuated by an occasional sob or burst of laughter. It must be some of the older serving-women gathered for a gossip, thought Xi-feng curious, and not a little apprehensive, she told Crimson to go in and mingle with them. Listen carefully, she said. Lead them on, and find out what it is theyre talking about. Yes, maam, said Crimson, and went on her errand. Xi-feng continued towards the Garden, accompanied now only by Felicity. The gate had been left ajar and mistress and maid were able to push it lightly open and walk in. Within the Garden the moonlight seemed even brighter, and the trees cast deep pools of shadow. The intense silence created an atmosphere of extreme solitude and desolation. They were about to take the path to Autumn Studio when a gust of wind blew through the trees, releasing a shower of falling leaves and soughing through the branches with a doleful sound that startled the crows and other nesting birds into flight. Xi4eng had drunk a little wine earlier in the evening, and the wind, when it blew upon her, set her trembling. How cold it is! said Felicity from behind, huddling up to try to keep warm.
Dai-yu closed her eyes and slumped back, almost causing Nightingale to topple over with her. Nightingale, her heart thumping in great agitation, called Snowgoose over to help her settle Dai-yu down again. It was too late now to send for anyone. And yet, what if Dai-yu should die during the night, and the only people there were Snowgoose, herself and the one or two other junior maids in the Naiads House? They passed a restless night. Morning came at last, and Dai-yu seemed a little more comfortable. -But after breakfast she suddenly began coughing and vomiting, and became tense and feverish again. Nightingale could see that she had reached a crisis. She called Snowgoose and the other juniors in and told them to mount watch, while she went to report to Grandmother Jia. But when she reached Grandmother Jias apartment, she found it almost deserted. Only a few old nannies and charladies were there, keeping an eye. Where is Her Old Ladyship? asked Nightingale. We dont know, came the reply in chorus. That was very odd, thought Nightingale. She went into Bao-yus room and found that too quite empty, save for a single maid who answered with the same Dont know. By now Nightingale had more or less guessed the truth. How could they be so heartless and so cruel? And to think that not a soul had come to visit Dai-yu during the past few days! As the bitterness of it struck her with full force, she felt a great wave of resentment break out within her, and turned abruptly to go. I shall go and find Bao-yu, and see how he is faring! I wonder how he will manage to brazen it out in front of me! I remember last year, when I made up that story about Miss Lin going back to the South, he fell sick with despair. To think that now he should be openly doing a thing like this! Men must have hearts as cold as ice or snow. What hateful creatures they are! She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet within. Suddenly she realized Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where? She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yus page boy Inky rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale? I heard that Master Bao was getting married, replied Nightingale, and I wanted to watch some of the fun. But I can see Ive come to the wrong place. And I dont know when the wedding is taking place, either. If I tell you, said Inky in a confidential tone, you must promise not to tell Snowgoose. Weve been given orders not to let any of you know. The weddings to be tonight. Of course its not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside another apartment. Whats the matter? continued Inky, after a pause. Nothing, replied Nightingale. You can go now. Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and clenching her teeth, she said fiercely Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous way but when you are happily married, and have your hearts desire, you neednt think you can look me in the face again! As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the Garden. She was not far from the Naiads House, when she saw two junior maids standing at the gate, peeping out nervously. They saw her coming, and one of them cried out Theres Miss Nightingale! At last! Nightingale could see that all was not well. Gesturing to them anxiously to be silent, she hurried in, to find Dai-yu red in the face, the fire from her liver having risen upwards and inflamed her cheeks. This was a dangerous sign, and Nightingale called Dai-yus old wet-nurse, Nannie Wang, to come and take a look. One glance was enough to reduce this old woman tears. Nightingale had turned to Nannie Wang as an older person, who could be expected to lend them some courage in this extremity. But she turned out to be quite helpless, and only made Nightingale more distraught than before. Suddenly she thought of someone else she could turn to, and sent one of the younger maids to fetch her with all speed.
I see nothing against it, she said. But I think we should all take time to think it over properly. In accordance with Xi-fengs plan, Lady Wang went on As you have no head of family present, we should like you to dispense with the usual trousseau. Tomorrow you should send Ke to let Pan know that while we proceed with the wedding, we shall continue to do our utmost to settle his court-case. She made no mention of Bao-yus feelings for Dai-yu, but continued Since you have given your consent, the sooner they are married, the sooner things will look up for everyone. At this point, Faithful came in to take back a report to Grandmother Jia. Though Aunt Xue was still concerned about Bao-chais feelings, she saw that in the circumstances she had no choice, and agreed to everything they had suggested. Faithful reported this to Grandmother Jia, who was delighted and sent her back again to ask Mrs Xue to explain to Bao-chai why it was that things were being done in this way, so that she would not feel unfairly treated. Aunt Xue agreed to do this, and it was settled that Xi-feng and Jia Lian would act as official go-betweens. Xi-feng retired to her apartment, while Aunt Xue and Lady Wang stayed up talking together well into the night. Next day, Aunt Xue returned to her apartment and told Bao-chai the details of the proposal, adding I have already given my consent. At first Bao-chai hung her head in silence. Then she began to cry. Aunt Xue said all that she could jo comfort her, and went to great lengths to explain the reasoning behind the decision. Bao-chai retired to her room, and Baoqin went in to keep her company and cheer her up. Aunt Xue also spoke to Ke, instructing him as follows You must leave tomorrow. Find out the latest news of Pans judgement, and then convey this message to him. Return as soon as you possibly can. Xue Ke was away for four days, at the end of which time he returned to report to Aunt Xue. The Circuit Judge has ratified the verdict of manslaughter, and after the next hearing his final memorial will be presented to the Provincial Supreme Court for confirmation. We should have the commutation money ready. As for Cousin Chais affair, Cousin Pan approves entirely of your decision, Aunt. And he says that curtailing the formalities will save us a lot of money too. You are not to wait for him, but should do whatever you think best. Aunt Xues mind was greatly eased by the knowledge that Xue Pan would soon be free to come home, and that there were now no further obstacles to the marriage. She could see that Bao-chai was unwilling to be married in this way, but reasoned with herself Even if this is not what she ideally wants, she is my daughter and has always been obedient and well-bred. She knows I have agreed to it, and will not go against my wishes. She instructed Xue Ke We must prepare the betrothal-card. Take some fine gold-splash paper and write on it the Stems and Branches of Bao-chais birth. Then take it to Cousin Lian. Find out which day has been fixed for the exchange of presents, and make all the necessary preparations for sending ours. We shall not be inviting any friends or relatives to the wedding. Pans friends are a worthless lot, as you yourself said, while our relations consist mainly of the Jias and the Wangs. The Jias are grooms family, and there are no Wangs in the capital at present. When Xiang-yun was engaged, the Shis did not invite us, so we need not get in touch with them. The only person I think we should invite is our business manager, Zhang De-hui. He is an older man and experienced in such things, and will be a help to us. Xue Ke carried out these instructions, and sent a servant over with the betrothal-card. Next day, Jia Lian came to visit Aunt Xue. After paying his respects, he said I have consulted the almanac, and tomorrow is a most propitious day. I have come here today to propose that our two families exchange presents tomorrow. And please, Aunt Xue, do not be too critical about the arrangements. He presented the grooms notice, which bore the date of the wedding. Aunt Xue said a few polite words of acceptance and nodded her assent. Jia Lian returned at once and reported to Jia Zheng. Report to your Grandmother, said Jia Zheng, and say that as we are not inviting anybody, the wedding should be kept very simple.
Grandmother Jia was so ill that no one dared break the news to her. Alas! What a cruel end for such a gentle creature, her flowerlike beauty crushed within a year of marriage! None of the Jias could leave home with Grandmother Jia as she was, and the Suns gave Ying-chun a predictably makeshift funeral. Grandmother Jia continued to deteriorate steadily, but still her only thought was for her granddaughters and great-nieces. On one occasion Xiang-yun was in the forefront of her mind, and she sent a maid to see how she was. The maid returned and tiptoed in to find Faithful. Faithful was at the bedside, as were Lady Wang and the other ladies and the maid, not wishing to disturb them, went round to the back to find Amber. Her Old Ladyship sent me to fetch news of Miss Xiang-yun, she told Amber, and I found her crying her heart out! Her husband has suddenly been taken ill, and the doctors say theres no hope for him. At the best it will turn into a consumption and he may last another four or five years! You can imagine how badly Miss Xiang-yun has taken it! Shes already heard about Her Old Ladyships illness, but now she simply cant leave home. She told me not to mention her husbands illness to Her Old Ladyship. If she does ask after Miss Xiang-yun, you must think of some way to explain her absence. Amber heaved a deep sigh, and after a long silence dismissed the maid. She too thought it unwise to inform Grandmother Jia, and went to her bedside with the intention of telling Faithful to invent some story. She found Grandmother Jia deathly pale, and everyone in the room whispering among themselves You can see shes going! Amber did not dare utter a word. Jia Zheng discreetly called Jia Lian over to whisper something in his ear, and Jia Lian tiptoed off to do his bidding. Outside he assembled the remaining household staff. Her Old Ladyship will soon be gone. You must make sure that everything is in order. First fetch out the coffin-boards for inspection, and measure them up for a lining. Go round all the apartments, take everyones measurements, and give the tailor a complete list, with instructions to make everyone a set of mourning clothes. Arrange for the funeral awning to be constructed in the courtyard and for coffin-bearers to be hired. And have extra staff put on duty in the kitchen. Mr Lian, replied Lai Da, on behalf of the others. You dont need to worry about these things. We have already thought of everything. But where is the money coming from? We wont need to borrow, said Jia Lian. Her Old Ladyship has made provision herself. The Master told me just now that he wants no expense spared. It must be done in style we must put on a good show. Yes, sir. Lai Da and the others went about their business at once, and Jia Lian returned to his own apartment. How is Mrs Lian? he asked Patience. Patience shot her mouth out towards the inner room Go and see for yourself. Jia Lian went in. Xi-feng was struggling to dress herself, but was too weak to do so. She had collapsed on the kang, and was leaning on the little kang-table. Its no good hoping to snatch some rest now! exclaimed Jia Lian. Grandmother is sinking fast and you must be there. Hurry up and tell them to tidy things up in here. And pull yourself together! If the worst happens, we wont be able to get away for quite a while. Weve got nothing left to tidy up! said Xi-feng bitterly. Only a few odds and ends, nothing worth bothering about. You go on ahead, Sir Zheng may want you. Ill come as soon as Im properly dressed. J ia Lian returned to Grandmother Jias apartment and reported discreetly to Jia Zheng that all had been seen to and the various duties assigned. Jia Zheng nodded. The Imperial Physician was announced, and Jia Lian went out to receive him. Grandmother Jias pulses were taken and then the physician emerged to inform Jia Lian in hushed tones Lady Jias pulse-rate is very poor. You must be prepared for the worst. Jia Lian understood and passed the message on to Lady Wang and the others. Lady Wang beckoned Faithful with a meaningful glance and told her to prepare Grandmother Jias funeral clothes. Faithful went to fetch them. The old lady opened her eyes and asked for a drink of tea. Lady Xing brought her a cup of ginseng tea, and she put her lips to it.
Jia Yu-cun was not amused. Give this precious rogue a good thrashing, he ordered grimly, adding by way of a vicious pun That should soon cut him down to size! His attendants pinned Ni Er to the ground and administered a few hefty cracks of the whip. The pain soon cleared Dimes head, and he began begging abjectly for mercy. Yu-cun laughed loudly at him from his chair Diamond, indeed! All right, leave him alone for the present. Take him back to the yamen. We can question him at leisure there. There was a cry from the runners, who immediately bound Dime and dragged him along behind the chair, ignoring his continued pleas for mercy. Yu-cun went first to the Palace to report on his tour, and then returned to his yamen, where daily business soon engulfed him. He was too busy to give Dime another thought. But the bystanders who had witnessed the flogging in the street lost no time in telling the story to their friends, and the news soon spread that Ni Er the swank, Ni Er the drunken bully, had fallen foul of Mayor Jia and landed himself in deep water. Rumour of it eventually reached the ears of his wife and daughter, and that night when he failed to come home his daughter, fearing the worst, went to all the gambling-dens in search of him. His cronies only confirmed the story, and Dimes daughter was reduced to tears at the thought of what might have happened to her father. Dont take it to heart so, miss! they said. That Mayor Jias related to the Rong-guo Jias. And isnt young Jia Yun a buddy of your dads? Why dont you and your mum go and ask him to put in a word for Dime? That should fix it. Dimes daughter thought this over to herself Theyre right. Father has often said how friendly he is with young Mr Jia Yun next door. Perhaps I should go and see him. She hurried home and told her mother, and the following morning the two of them went to call on Jia Yun. He happened to be at home that day, and invited them both in, while his mother told the little maid to serve them tea. They related the story of Dimes arrest, and begged Jia Yun to help them secure his release. Of course! agreed Jia Yun without the slightest hesitation. No 3 trouble at all. Ill drop in at Rong-guo House, mention it to them, and the matter will soon be settled. This Mayor Jia owes everything to his connection with the Rong-guo Jias. One word from them and Dime will be a free man again! Dimes wife and daughter returned home in high spirits and with great expectations. They went to visit Dime in the yamen where he was being held prisoner, and told him the good news, that thanks to 3 the intervention of Jia Yun and the Jia family he would shortly be set free. Dime was greatly relieved. Unfortunately Jia Yun, having had his previous overtures rebuffed by Xi-feng, had been too cowed to visit her again, and since that day had hardly set foot inside Rong-guo House. The men on the Rongguo gate treated callers strictly according to their standing with the family. If the family were known to have received a person with cordiality and respect, that person was welcomed and announced immediately if on the other hand, a person had once been cold- shouldered, the servants were quick to take their cue. If such a person called again, even if he were a relative, they would refuse to report his arrival and would send him away without more ado. So, when Jia Yun turned up and asked to pay his respects to Jia Lian, he got a very cool reception at the gate Mr Lian is not in. When he comes home, we will inform him that you called. Jia Yun would have persisted and asked to see Mrs Lian, but he was afraid to provoke the gatemen any further, and with some reluctance turned about and went home. He had to face renewed importuning from Dimes wife and daughter the next day But Mr Yun! We thought you said the Jias could get anything they wanted out of anyone! Youre one of the family, and this isnt a big thing to ask. You cant have failed! You cant let us down like this! Jia Yun felt thoroughly humiliated, and tried to bluff his way out Yesterday my relatives were too busy to send anyone. But Im sure they will do something about it today, and then Dime will be set free. Theres really no need to worry. Dimes wife and daughter waited to see how things would turn out. Jia Yun, having failed to gain access by the front entrance of Rong-guo House, now tried the back, thinking he might be able to get in touch with Bao-yu in the Garden.
You and your dear Mr Bao will live happily ever after, I dare say! But Im all on my own. Im long past caring about appearances! She announced her intention of returning to her mothers, and made a dash for the street. Luckily there were enough people present to stop her, and eventually they managed to calm her down. Bao-qin, who was at this time still staying with Aunt Xue, in preparation for her own wedding, was so horrified by Jin-guis behaviour that she resolved to keep well out of her way from then on. Whenever Xue Ke was at home, Jin-gui would select one of her more provocative gowns and issue forth, her cheeks heavily powdered and rouged, her eyebrows pencilled, her hair dressed in its most alluring style. She would contrive to walk past his apartment, where she would give an artificial-sounding cough, or ask innocently who was inside. If she encountered him in person, she would at once waylay him and attempt to beguile him with seductive small-talk, simpering, pouting and purring by turns, displaying for his benefit the full range of her feminine charms. When the maids saw what she was up to, they beat a hasty retreat. Jin-gui carried on regardless, intent on executing Moonbeams plan for the conquest of Xue Ke. He for his part avoided her if he could, and if he could not, endeavoured to be civil, Out of a fear that she might otherwise cause worse trouble for him. But Jin-guis infatuation blinded her to the truth, so that Xue Kes courteous manner only fanned the flames of her desire. The one thing she could not help noticing, however, the one detail that marred the illusion, was the way in which the object of her passion entrusted every smailest thing of his to Caltrop. The sorting, mending and washing of his clothes, all were given to her. And if she, Jin-gui, entered the room while the two of them were talking, she noticed how they hurriedly went their separate ways, as if she had intruded on some intimate tete-a-tete. All of this inflamed her jealousy. She could not, however, bring herself to confront Xue Ke directly about it, for fear that any move against Caltrop might set Xue Ke against herself. Instead she decided to bide her time, and continued to accumulate a deep and bitter store of resentment towards her rival. One day Moonbeam came into her room and tittered Mrs Pan, have you seen Master Ke? Jin-gui I have not. Moonbeam I told you he was fooling us with all that strait-laced talk of his. When we sent him some wine, he said he didnt drink but just now I saw him at Mrs Xues, quite tipsy and red in the face. If you dont believe me, why, go and wait for him in the doorway. Hell be coming this way. Stop him and ask him. See what he says. Jin-gui annoyed Im sure he wont be coming out just yet. Anyway, hes such a cold fish. Words are wasted on him. Moonbeam Youre just being silly again, maam. Why not give it a try? If he plays, we can play too. If not, well just have to think of another way. Perhaps shes right after all, Jin-gui thought to herself. She posted Moonbeam outside to keep watch for Xue Ke, and went in once more to her dressing-table. She opened her mirror and looked herself up and down. A little more lipstick, a flowery handkerchief, and she was ready for the fray. Or almost ready she still felt there was something missing, but before she could think what it was that she needed to add that final touch, she heard Moonbeams voice outside You seem in high spirits today, Master Ke! Been drinking somewhere, have you? This was her cue. Jin-gui raised the portiere and stepped out just in time to hear Xue Kes reply Our manager Mr Zhang is celebrating his birthday today, and I was pressed into drinking half a cup. My face is still burning from it. Before he had finished, Jin-gui moved into the attack Other peoples wine has more flavour than ours, I dare say ... Xue Ke felt the sting of her remark and blushed a deeper shade of red. He took a step towards her and said with a polite smile Of course not, sister-in-law. Now that the conversation was launched, Moonbeam disappeared inside and left them to it. Jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling, but there was something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly befuddled innocence in his eyes, that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled to the distant land of Java.
But how can I bear to leave, remembering how things were between us? She agonized over her dilemma, and recalling the ominous words Bao-yu had spoken to her in her dream she vowed to herself that if her destiny could not be shared with Bao-yu she would rather not live at all. With the medicine, however, the pain in her heart gradually subsided. She felt guilty to be lying down all the time, but forced herself to rest and struggled through the next few days until she was able to get up and about again and wait on her mistress. Bao-chai herself although she was constantly thinking of Bao-yu and shed many a tear in private over her own unhappy fate, was kept bus helping her own mother to arrange for the payment of Xue Pans commutation fine, by no means an easy task. But of this no more. Jia Zheng had arrived in Nanking with Grandmother Jias coffin, accompanied by Jia Rong and the coffins of Qin-shi, Xi-feng, Dai-yu and Faithful. They made arrangements for the Jia family members to be interred, and then Jia Rong took Dai-yus coffin to her owr family graveyard to be buried there, while Jia Zheng saw to the construction of the tombs. Then one day a letter arrived from home in which he read of the success achieved by Bao-yu and Jia Lan in their examinations - which gave him great pleasure - and of Bao-yus disappearance, which disturbed him greatly and made him decide to cut short his stay and hurry home. On his return journey he learned of the amnesty decreed by the Emperor, and received another letter from home telling him that Jia She and Cousin Zhen had been pardoned, and their titles restored. Much cheered by this news, he pressed on towards home, travelling by day and night. On the day when his boat reached the post-station at Piling, there was a sudden cold tarn in the weather and it began to snow. He moored in a quiet, lonely stretch of the canal and sent his servants ashore to deliver a few visiting-cards and to apologize to his friends in the locality, saying that since his boat was due to set off again at any moment he would not be able to call on them in person or entertain them aboard. Only one page-boy remained to wait on him while he sat in the cabin writing a letter home to be sent on ahead by land. When he came to write about Bao-yu, he paused for a moment and looked up. There, up on deck, standing in the very entrance to his cabin and silhouetted dimly against the snow, was the figure of a man with shaven head and bare feet, wrapped in a large cape made of crimson felt. The figure knelt down and bowed to Jia Zheng, who did not recognize the features and hurried out on deck, intending to raise him up and ask him his name. The man bowed four times, and now stood upright, pressing his palms together in monkish greeting. Jia Zheng was about to reciprocate with a respectful bow of the head when he looked into the mans eyes and with a sudden shock recognized him as Bao-yu. Are you not my son? he asked. The man was silent and an expression that seemed to contain both joy and sorrow played on his face. Jia Zheng asked again If you are Bao-yu, why are you dressed like this? And what brings you to this place? Before Bao-yu could reply two other men appeared on the deck, a Buddhist monk and a Taoist, and holding him between them they said Come, your earthly karma is complete. Tarry no longer. The three of them mounted the bank and strode off into the snow. Jia Zheng went chasing after them along the slippery track, but although he could spy them ahead of him, somehow they always remained just out of reach. He could hear all three of them singing some sort of a song On Green sickness Peak -2507 I dwell In the Cosmic Void I roam. Who will pass over, -2507 Who will go with me, Who will explore The supremely ineffable Vastly mysterious -2507 Wilderness To which I return! Jia Zheng listened to the song and continued to follow them until they rounded the slope of a small hill and suddenly vanished from sight. He was weak and out of breath by now with the exertion of the chase, and greatly mystified by what he had seen. Looking back he saw his page-boy, hurrying up behind him. Did you see those three men just now? he questioned him. Yes, sir, I did, replied the page. I saw you following them, so I came too. Then they disappeared and I could see no one but you. J ia Zheng wanted to continue, but all he could see before him was a vast expanse of white, with not a soul anywhere.
I had a stomach-ache, and went for a bit of a stroll. That was when I looked back. When I saw the blaze and realized it was the temple that was on fire, I came here as fast as I could to let you know. I certainly didnt see anyone coming out of the flames. His twinge of conscience notwithstanding, Yu-cun was at heart a man who put his career first, and he felt insufficient concern to involve and inconvenience himself any further. Wait here until the fire has died down, he told the servant. Then go back and see if you can find any trace of the old man. Report to me directly. Yes, sir. Reluctantly the man stayed behind to carry out these instructions. J ia Yu-cun crossed the river and continued his tour of inspection, putting up for the night, a few stops later, at the official lodgings provided. Next morning, his duties were completed and he was greeted at one of the city gates by the usual throng of runners, who then escorted him through the streets with a great deal of noise and pomp. On the way, he heard from within his sedan one of the criers having some kind of altercation in the street, and asked what the trouble was. A man was dragged forward and deposited kneeling at the foot of the sedan. The crier himself then fell to his knees and gave the following account of the incident This drunkard, instead of keeping out of Your Honours way, came lurching right in front of your chair, sir. I told him to get off the road, but he answered back in a drunken and insolent manner, threw himself down on the ground in the middle of the street, and accused me of hitting him. J ia Yu-cun addressed the offender directly This entire district, as you know, is in my charge, and every one of its residents falls under my jurisdiction. You, sir, must have known this only too well, and must also have been aware of my presence in these parts. In your drunken state the very least you could have done was to keep out of my way. But instead you have polluted the highway with your obnoxious person, and have then had the effrontery to slander one of my men! Explain yourself! Paid fir the wine meself, din I? grumbled the man. An the grounds is Majestys, innit? is Majesty never said I couldnt sleep on it if Id adda few! Cant see what its gorra do with you, yerroner! Why, this fellow seems to consider himself completely above the law! snapped Jia Yu-cun angrily. Whats his name? Ni Er, replied the man. But they calls me the Drunken Diamond. Jia Yu-cun was not amused. Give this precious rogue a good thrashing, he ordered grimly, adding by way of a vicious pun That should soon cut him down to size! His attendants pinned Ni Er to the ground and administered a few hefty cracks of the whip. The pain soon cleared Dimes head, and he began begging abjectly for mercy. Yu-cun laughed loudly at him from his chair Diamond, indeed! All right, leave him alone for the present. Take him back to the yamen. We can question him at leisure there. There was a cry from the runners, who immediately bound Dime and dragged him along behind the chair, ignoring his continued pleas for mercy. Yu-cun went first to the Palace to report on his tour, and then returned to his yamen, where daily business soon engulfed him. He was too busy to give Dime another thought. But the bystanders who had witnessed the flogging in the street lost no time in telling the story to their friends, and the news soon spread that Ni Er the swank, Ni Er the drunken bully, had fallen foul of Mayor Jia and landed himself in deep water. Rumour of it eventually reached the ears of his wife and daughter, and that night when he failed to come home his daughter, fearing the worst, went to all the gambling-dens in search of him. His cronies only confirmed the story, and Dimes daughter was reduced to tears at the thought of what might have happened to her father. Dont take it to heart so, miss! they said. That Mayor Jias related to the Rong-guo Jias. And isnt young Jia Yun a buddy of your dads? Why dont you and your mum go and ask him to put in a word for Dime? That should fix it. Dimes daughter thought this over to herself Theyre right. Father has often said how friendly he is with young Mr Jia Yun next door. Perhaps I should go and see him. She hurried home and told her mother, and the following morning the two of them went to call on Jia Yun.
I remember it now. It was in a dream. What a blessing this is, to return to the scene of my childhood dream! Somehow in his confusion his original intention of finding Faithful had gone, giving way to a new and more generalized curiosity about what lay before him. He plucked up his courage again and opened the door of the first cupboard. Within it he saw a number of albums, and a thrill of excited delight ran through him. People always say that dreams are false, he thought to himself. But it seems that this one was real! How often Ive wished I could dream that dream of mine again! And now here I am, and my wish is coming true. I wonder if these are the very albums I saw? Stretching out his hand he took the top one, and held it in his hand. It bore the label Jinling, Twelve Beauties of, Main Register. I do remember seeing this, he thought to himself. I think I do... If only I could remember more clearly! He opened it at the first page, and found himself looking at a picture, but one that was so blurred he could hardly tell what it represented. There followed a few rows of characters, written in an almost indecipherable hand, among which he could faintly trace the forms of jade belt dai yu and green wood lin. Surely that must be a riddle for Cousin Lin? he thought to himself, and read on in earnest. The next line contained the words the gold pin beneath the snow xue. Why thats Bao-chais surname! he exclaimed aloud. He read to the end of the fourth and last line. It doesnt seem to say very much. Its just a series of riddles on the names Lin Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai. Theres nothing very exceptional about that. But some of the phrases sound rather ominous. I wonder what its all supposed to mean? Silly me! Im not really supposed to be here at all, he rebuked himself. If I spend my time daydreaming like this and someone comes, Ill have wasted my chance to look through the rest. He continued his inspection of the albums. He did not allow himself time to linger over the next picture, but went straight to the poem, which ended with the words -1227 When hare meets tiger, your great dream shall end. They brought a sudden burst of illumination What a brilliant prediction! It must refer to the death of my eldest sister. If they are all as clear as this, I should copy them down and study them carefully. That way I can find out everything about my sisters and cousins, how long theyre going to live, whether they will fail or succeed in life, be wealthy or poor. At home I shall have to keep my knowledge a secret of course. But my inside information will at least save me a lot of unnecessary worrying .. He looked everywhere for writing implements, but could see neither brush nor inkstone, and fearing that someone might surprise him, he hurriedly scanned through the rest of the album. The next leaf bore an impressionistic representation of a figure flying a kite. He did not feel in the mood to dwell on the pictures but quickly read the remaining poems in the set of twelve. In some cases he was able to grasp the hidden meaning at a first reading, others required a moments reflection, while some remained obstinately unintelligible. He committed all of them carefully to memory none the less. With a sigh he took out the next album, labelled Supplementary Register No. 1, and began to read. He stopped at the lines You chose the player fortune favoured, Unmindful of your masters doom. At first they meant nothing to him. Then he studied the accompanying picture, a bunch of flowers and a mat painted in the same impressionistic style as the kite-flying girl. Suddenly he burst into tears. See Volume I, Appendix, p. 527. He was about to read further, when he heard a voice saying Daydreaming again! Come now, Cousin Lin wants to see you. The voice was very like Faithfuls, but when he turned to look, to his great bewilderment there was no one there. Then suddenly he saw Faithful again, standing outside the doorway and beckoning to him. He ran out after her in delight, but her shadowy form drifted constantly ahead of him and he was unable to overtake her. Dear Faithful! Please wait for me! he cried. She took no notice but hurried on ahead, while he ran panting after her. Suddenly another vista loomed in front of him, of high buildings and intricately carved roofs, among which he could dimly perceive the figures of palace ladies. In his eagerness to explore this new realm Bao-yu forgot Faithful completely. Wandering in through one of the gateways, he found himself among all sorts of strange and exotic plants and flowers, none of which he could identify.
said Xi-feng. Who ever heard of a husband waiting for his wife to go out? These clothes arent right, said Bao-yu. That peacock cape Grannie gave me to wear last time I went to Uncle Zi-shengs was so much nicer. Well, go ahead and wear it this time then, said Xi-feng teasingly. How can I? Its too early in the year. Xi-feng realized that she had inadvertently drawn attention to the incorrect timing and therefore fraudulent nature of her uncles party. It didnt matter so much about Bao-chai, who was herself related to the Wangs. But she felt embarrassed to have thus risked discrediting her own family in front of the maids. Aroma, whose mind was running along very different lines, hastened to add her explanation of Bao-yus words I dont think you understand, maam. He wouldnt wear that cape even if it were the right season. Why ever not? asked Xi-feng. I should explain, maam, replied Aroma. Mr Baos ways are sometimes so very strange. Her Old Ladyship gave him the cape to wear to his uncle Wangs party two years ago. He had an accident and burnt a hole in it. My mother was seriously ill at the time and I was at home looking after her. Skybright was still with us then, though she was already ill, and I was told when I got back that she had stayed up all night darning the cape for him. The mend was so neat that Her Old Ladyship didnt even notice it the next day. One day last year, when it was particularly cold, I told Tealeaf to take the cape to school in case Bao-yu needed something warmer to put on. But the sight of it reminded Bao-yu of Skybright and he said he never wanted to wear it again. He told me to put it away for good. Poor Skybright! put in Xi-feng before Aroma had finished speaking. Such a pretty girl! And so clever with her hands! If only she hadnt been quite so quick-tongued. Someone must have gone gossiping to Lady Wang, or she would never have dealt with the poor girl so harshly and driven her to such an early death. Which reminds me. Not so very long ago I saw Cook Lius daughter - Fivey I think her name is - and couldnt help noticing that shes the spitting image of Skybright. I thought of bringing her in to work for me, and her mother seemed agreeable to the idea. Then I thought what a good replacement shed make for Crimson in Bao-yus apartment. But Patience told me it was Lady Wangs policy not to take on any more pretty maids like Skybright for Bao-yu. So I dropped the idea. Now that hes married Im sure there can be no objection. Ill tell Fivey to start work here straight away. How would that be, Bao? Then if you ever find yourself missing Skybright, all you need to do is look at Fivey instead. Bao-yu had been about to leave the room, but at Xi-fengs mention of Fivey had stood there bemused. Aroma spoke for him Of course hed be pleased. Hes wanted her as a maid for a long while, but knew that Her Ladyship was against the idea. Very well then, Ill tell her to come tomorrow, said Xi-feng. And Ill square your mother mysel Bao-yus delight knew no bounds and he set off in high spirits for Grandmother Jias apartment, leaving Bao-chai to finish her toilet. Xi-feng had found the contrast between the way in which Bao-yu and Bao-chai clung to each other, and her own recent conflict with Jia Lian, somewhat depressing, and she was now anxious to leave. She rose and said to Bao-chai with a smile Shall we go and see Aunt Wang now? Still smiling she walked out of the room, and Bao-chai accompanied her. They went first to Grandmother Jias apartment, where they found Bao-yu informing the old lady of the proposed expedition to Uncle Wang Zi-shengs. Grandmother Jia nodded Off you go then. But dont drink too much, and be sure to come home early. Dont forget youre only just beginning to get well again. Yes, Grannie, said Bao-yu. He had no sooner reached the courtyard than he turned round and re-entered the room, walking over to Bao-chai and whispering something in her ear. She smiled Yes of course. Now be off with you! She hurried him on his way once more. Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and Bao-chai settled down to a conversation, but had barely exchanged three sentences when Ripple appeared The Young Master has sent Tealeaf back with a message for Mrs Bao.

Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and Bao-chai settled down to a conversation, but had barely exchanged three sentences when Ripple appeared The Young Master has sent Tealeaf back with a message for Mrs Bao. -1344 Bao-chai Whats he forgotten now? Ripple I told one of the junior maids to ask Tealeaf. The message is this The Young Master forgot to tell Mrs Bao something. She should not be too long if she is coming and if she isnt, then she should take care not to stand in a draught. Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and the entire assembly of old serving-women and maidservants burst out laughing. Bao-chai blushed fiercely and said to Ripple with a scornful pfui Silly creature! Is that worth running back in such a fluster for? Ripple giggled and sent a junior maid to scold Tealeaf, who raced back to Bao-yu, calling to the maid over his shoulder The Young Master insisted on my dismounting to go on this fools errand. If I hadnt delivered his message Id have been in trouble with him, and now that I have I get it in the neck from them! The maid laughed and went running back to repeat this to the ladies. Grandmother Jia turned to Bao-chai Youd better go, my dear, or hell never stop fretting. What with this and Xi-fengs merciless teasing, Bao-chai felt too embarrassed to stay any longer. When Bao-chai had taken her leave, Perfecta, one of the nuns from the Convent of the Scattered Flowers, came to call on Grandmother Jia. She greeted Xi-feng also, and sat down to take tea. Why havent you been to see us for such a long while? asked Grandmother Jia. These past few days we have had so many services at the Convent, replied Perfecta, and so many grand ladies coming to make their devotions I just havent had a moment to call my own. Today I have a special reason for visiting Your Old Ladyship. We have a private service tomorrow which I thought you might possibly be interested in attending. What kind of service is it? asked Grandmother Jia. Last month, replied Perfecta, the household of the late Excellency Wang was afflicted with a possession of spirits. Her Ladyship even saw her husbands departed spirit during the night. She came to tell me about it yesterday at the Convent, and pledged herself to an act of devotion at the shrine of our Bodhisattva of the Scattered Flowers. Its to be a forty-nine-day Solemn Mass for Purification of All Souls on Land and Sea, for the Preservation and Peace of All Members of the Family, for the Ascension into the Celestial Regions of All Departed Souls, and for the Well-Being in This Life of All the Living. Ive been extremely busy with the preparations, and this is the first opportunity Ive had to come and pay my respects. Xi-feng had always scorned all forms of superstition.
They may think we still possess hidden wealth. Of course, Uncle Zheng went on to say to me, if we dont spend all of Grandmothers money on the funeral, no one will want to appropriate whats left for their own personal use. In one way or another it should still be spent on Grandmother. Now she was a Southerner, and though we have ancestral burial4and in the South, there are no buildings on it. When her coffin has been transported to the South, with any money thats left over we can put up some buildings on the ancestral burial-ground, and buy a few hectares of land to provide for the sacrifices. If we ever return to the South ourselves, it will come in handy, and even if we dont, we can always let some of the poorer clan members live on it. They can keep up the seasonal offerings and sweep the graves at regular intervals. That was Uncle Zhengs proposal. Dont you think it a sound one? Youre surely not suggesting that we spend the entire amount on the funeral, are you? Has any of the money been issued yet? asked Xi-feng. Not a penny of it, replied Jia Lian. I heard that when Mother learned of this proposal of Uncle Zhengs, she sang its praises and did her utmost to encourage both him and Aunt Wang in their efforts to economize. So what can I do? I already have several hundred taels owing for the awning and the pall-bearers fees, but the cash still hasnt been issued. If I go and ask for it, theyll all tell me the moneys there but that I must get the work finished first and reckon up afterwards. Theres no one we can borrow from the servants with any money of their own have all disappeared. When I called a roll, some were absent sick, others were in the country, while the ones still here have stayed on only out of sheer necessity and are no use to us. Theyre interested only in making a profit for themselves. Xi-feng was lost in thought for a moment. How are we going to manage, then? she said finally. As she was speaking a maid came into the room Theres a message for you from Lady Xing, maam. Today is the third day of the ladies reception, and the arrangements are still topsy-turvy. The guests should not have to be kept waiting for their food, after the funeral offering has been made! They had to ask for their meal several times before they were served. And even when the main dishes arrived, there was still no rice. Surely we can do better than that! Xi-feng hurried in to give the servants orders to serve lunch, and they managed to produce something passable. Unfortunately there was an unusually large crowd of guests that day and the staff were at their most sullen and apathetic. Xi-feng had to supervise them herself, then she hurried out and told Brighties wife to call a general meeting of all the serving-women. She gave each one clear instructions, to which they replied with a surly, Yes, Mrs Lian, and proceeded to do nothing during the afternoon. Look how late it is! Why havent you served the evening offering and meal yet? demanded Xi-feng. Serving the food would be no problem, maam, came the reply, if we had the necessary utensils .. Fools! exclaimed Xi-feng. This is your job! Of course youll get whatever you need! The servants reluctantly applied themselves to their impossible tasks, while Xi-feng went straight to the main apartment to seek Ladies Xing and Wangs permission for the necessary utensils. But there was still such a throng of guests around them that it was impossible for her to get a word in. Evening was drawing on, and in despair she went to see Faithful and asked her for the use of Grandmother Jias spare dinner service. Why come asking me for it? exclaimed Faithful. Mr Lian pawned it a couple of years ago! Youd better ask him if he ever redeemed it. I dont want the silver or gold, said Xi-feng. The regular service will do. What do you suppose Lady Xing and Mrs You have been using since they moved in? asked Faithful pointedly. Xi-feng knew she must be telling the truth, and left at once for Lady Wangs apartment, where she managed to talk Silver and Suncloud into lending her a service, had a quick inventory made by Sunshine, and told him to hand the things over to the servants. Faithful saw Xi-feng in this state of disarray, and although she did not call her back to complain, she thought to herself Why is Mrs Lan, who used to be so capable, bungling things so badly this time?
He didnt so much as shed a single tear. He could see me crying my eyes out, and didnt even try to comfort me, but just stared at me and smiled. What a deceiver! All those fine things he used to say to us in the past were just meant to fool us. Thank goodness Id seen through him the other evening and didnt fall for it again! But theres still one thing I dont understand. He even seems to have become cold towards Aroma. I know Mrs Bao has never been a very warm 9r close person by nature - so she probably doesnt mind his change of heart. But what about Musk and the others, dont they feel hard done by? Theyve let their feelings make fools of them and have wasted half their lives over him, only to be forsaken like this! As she was brooding, she saw Fivey coming towards her. Youre not still weeping for Miss Lin, are you? asked Fivey, seeing Nightingales tear-stained face. If you want my opinion of Mr Bao, I think its high time we forgot about his reputation, and looked at what he really is. I was always being told how kind he was, especially towards girls. Thats why my mother tried so hard to get me into service with him. Since then Ive waited on him from the beginning of this illness of his. But now that hes better, I havent had so much as a kind word from him! In fact he wont even acknowledge my existence! Nightingale burst out laughing at this comical tale of woe. Pshh! Why, hark at you, you little vixen! she exclaimed. How do you want Mr Bao to treat you? Really, you should be ashamed of yourself! When hes not even interested in the maids that are closest to him, do you expect him to find time for you? She laughed again and drew a reproving finger across Fiveys face. What kind of a niche are you carving out for yourself in Bao-yus affections? Fivey blushed at her own foolishness. She was on the point of explaining that it wasnt so much her own treatment at Bao-yus hands that was worrying her as his whole attitude towards the maids, when they heard someone calling from outside The monk is back! And hes demanding his ten thousand taels! Her Ladyship doesnt know what to do and wanted Mr Lian to go and talk with him, but Mr Lians not at home! The monk is outside, ranting and raving. Her Ladyship wants Mrs Bao to go over and consult with her. To learn how they placated the monk, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 117 Two fair damsels conspire to save the jade, and forestall a flight from earthly bondage An infamous rogue takes charge of the mansion, and assembles a gang of cronies Lady Wang sent for Bao-chai to consult with her, while Bao-yu, hearing that the monk was outside, rushed to the front courtyard on his own. Where is my Master? he shouted. Finally, as there was no sign of the monk there, he went outside, where he found his groom Li Gui barring the monks way. My mother bids me invite His Reverence in, said Bao-yu. Li Gui relaxed his grip, and the monk went swaggering in. Bao-yu observed at once the resemblance between this monk and the guide in his dream, and the truth began to grow clearer in his mind. He bowed Master, please forgive your disciple for being so slow in welcoming you. I have no desire to be entertained, said the monk. I just want my money, and then Ill be off. This was hardly the way one would have expected a man of great spiritual attainments to talk, reflected Bao-yu. But then he looked at the monks head, which was covered with scabs, and at his filthy, tattered robe, and thought to himself Theres an old saying The True Sage does not reveal himself, and he who reveals himself is no True Sage. I must be careful not to waste this opportunity. I had better reassure him about the money, and sound him out a little. Father, he said, please be patient. My mother is preparing your money at this very moment. Please be seated and wait a while. May I venture to enquire, Father, whether you have recently returned from the Land of Illusion? Illusion, my foot! exclaimed the monk. I come whence I come, and I go whither I go. I came here to return your jade. But let me ask you a question where did your jade come from? For a minute or so Bao-yu could think of no reply. The monk laughed. If you know nothing of your own provenance, why delve into mine?
Suddenly he slipped out , and without a word the monk raced after him and overtook him. Jia Lian had no choice but to escort the monk to the reception hall and then hurry over to inform Jia Zheng who was enormously relieved by the news, and sent for the monk straight away, bowing to him and expressing his profound thanks. The monk returned the salutation and sat down. Jia Lian thought himself apprehensively Now he wont budge till hes been paid... Jia Zheng scrutinized the monk. It was not, he concluded, one the two he had seen on the previous occasion. From which holy establishment do you hail? he enquired. And what pray is your reverends own name in religion? Where did obtain my sons stone talisman? How is it that the sight of it cured him so quickly? The monk greeted this stream of questions with an inscrutable smile Dont ask me. I have not the slightest idea. Just give me my thousand taels, and well call it a day. Jia Zheng could see he was dealing with rather a brusque sort of fellow, and was nervous of offending him The money? Why yes, of course you shall have it ... Id like it now. Im in a hurry. Please be seated for a moment, while I go in and see whether it is ready. Youd better get a move on. Jia Zheng went in to the others. He said nothing of his interview with the monk but went straight to the kang where Bao-yu was lying. When Bao-yu saw his father coming, he tried to raise himself up, but was too weak to do so. Lady Wang held him down and told him on no account to move, while Bao-yu smiled from where he lay and handed the jade to his father, with the words You see, Bao-yu has returned! J ia Zheng was aware of the Stones reputedly supernatural properties. He glanced at it and said to Lady Wang Now that Bao-yu has recovered consciousness, how are we to pay the monk? Pawn everything I own! replied Lady Wang at once. That should be enough. I hardly think he wants money, put in Bao-yu. Do you? Jia Zheng nodded thoughtfully I thought it rather strange, I must say. But he absolutely insists. You must go out and entertain him, said Lady Wang. Well see what we can do. As Jia Zheng went out, Bao-yu began clamouring for food. First he consumed a bowl of congee and then he demanded some rice, which the old women even brought him. But Lady Wang forbade him to eat it. Itll be perfectly all right, protested Bao-yu. Im better now. He leant forwards and promptly tucked into a bowl of rice. His spirits seemed greatly revived. He wanted to sit up properly, and Musk came forward and supported him gently. Carried away by her excitement at his recovery she blurted out What a treasure that Stone of yours is! Just seeing it has made you better! Thank goodness you never managed to smash it to pieces! Her words caused a sudden change to come over Bao-yus face. He threw the Stone aside and slumped back. But to learn if he survived, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 116 Human destinies are reveald in a fairy realm, and the Stone is restored to its rightful owner Mortal remains are transported to their terrestrial home, and duty is discharged by a filial son Musks untimely reference to a sensitive episode from the past sent Bao-yu into a sudden swoon and he slumped back onto his bed once more. Lady Wang and the assembled family broke into a fresh bout of wailing and weeping, while Musk herself, realizing that her thoughtlessness was to blame for this terrible turn though Lady Wang had not yet had time to scold her, began to weep and at the same time made a desperate resolution If Bao-yu dies, I shall take my own life and die with him! Lady Wang could see that this time none of their efforts to rouse Bao-yu was having any effect, and sent an urgent message to the monk, begging him to come to the rescue again. But the monk was nowhere to be seen. Jia Zheng had returned earlier to the hall, only to find that his eccentric guest had vanished into thin air. This fresh outcry from the inner apartment now reached Jia Zhengs ears and he hurried back, to find Bao-yu unconscious again, teeth clenched and with no trace of a pulse. He felt his chest, and finding it still quite warm, sent in desperation for a doctor, to attempt resuscitation by forcing down a draught of some kind. But Bao-yus spirit had already quit its mortal frame. Then that means he was dead, you say?
Jia Zheng went into see Lady Wang, while Jia Lian sent someone to invite Grannie Liu over. When she was informed that the match had been approved by the Master, she proceeded to favour Lady Wang and the other ladies with a long speech on the certain future success of the young man, how his family was sure to come up in the world, and what a prosperous multitude of sons and grandsons the couple were sure to breed. While she was talking one of the maids came in to announce that Hua Zi-fang, Aromas brother, had sent his wife to convey his respects. Lady Wang spoke to the woman and ascertained from her that a match had been proposed by the Hua family to a certain Mr Jiang living south of the city, a young man with property and land and a pawnshop business of his own. He was a few years older than Aroma but had never married and was exceptionally good4ooking. Lady Wang was satisfied with this description of the match. Tell them I agree, she said. In a few days time your husband can come and fetch his sister and take her away to be married. She also sent some of her own people to make discreet enquiries, and received confirmation of the mans character, whereupon she informed Bao-chai, and asked Aunt Xue to break the news gently to Aroma. Poor Aroma was inconsolable at the prospect of leaving Rong-guo House, but she could not offer any resistance. She remembered the visit Bao-yu had paid her at home many years previously, and the oath she had sworn afterwards, never to leave him even in death. Now Her Ladyship is making me do this against my will, and if I insist on remaining single and faithful to his memory, people will call me shameless. But if I do go, it is not of my own wishing. She wept until she was choking with tears. Aunt Xue and Bao-chai did their utmost to talk her round, and eventually she thought to herself If I were to die here, it would be a poor return for all Her Ladyships kindness to me in the past. I had best die at home. So she bade farewell to them all, her heart heavy with sorrow. It was equally painful for her to part from the other maids. Resolved to end her own life at the first opportunity, she mounted a carriage and set off for home. When she saw her brother and his wife, there were more tears, but she could not bring herself to say what was on her mind. Her brother showed her one by one all the presents sent by the Jiang family, and the trousseau that he himself had made ready for her, a part of which, he explained, had been given by Lady Wang, while a part he had provided himsel This kindness made it harder than ever for Aroma to express her sorrow, and after spending two days at her brothers home, she thought things over carefully again He has done everything so nicely for me. If I were to die here, wouldnt I be hurting him? She turned it over and over in her mind, and no course of action seemed easy and right. Her heart was wound into a tight knot. She could only bear her fate stoically and bide her time. The auspicious day in the almanac arrived for her to be taken to her husbands home, and not wishing to make a scene she concealed her grief and let herself be helped into the bridal sedan. At her new home, she thought to herself, she would make plans afresh. But once she arrived at the Jiang household, she found them so sincere and respectful towards her, deferring to her in every way as a young married lady, with the maids and serving-women all calling her Mrs Jiang the minute she set foot in the house, that death seemed impossible again to die there would be to do them a great injury, she thought to herself it would be a poor return for all their kindness. On her wedding night she wept without ceasing and would not at first yield to her husbands embrace, but gradually he won her over with gentle affection. The next day, when they were unpacking her cases together, Jiang noticed among her things a crimson cummerbund. From this clue he deduced that his bride must have been one of the maids in attendance on Bao-yu, to whom he had once presented this cummerbund. Earlier he had thought that his bride was just one of Grandmother Jias maids he had certainly never dreamed that he was marrying Aroma. Jiang Yu-han for it was he, Bao-yus actor friend Bijou was greatly moved when he remembered all the warmth shown him by Bao-yu in the past, and as a consequence he treated Aroma with stlil greater courtesy and consideration.
The same goes for the ladies apartments. We must find husbands for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking. Its in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be Sent to take it back to them straight away. If anything else should happen to us, wed only involve them in a lot more trouble, push them out of the frying-pan and into the fire. Jia Zheng, who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters, mumbled a contrite Yes, Mother to all of these eminently practical instructions, thinking to himself What a flair she has for organization! And what worthless bunglers we all are by comparison! He could see that Grandmother Jia was tired, and begged her to lie down and rest. The little you see here is all I have left, she said. When I die, you can use some of it to pay for my funeral, and give the remainder to my maids. They found this mention of her death greatly upsetting, and all fell to their knees once more. Please set your mind at ease, Mother. In time to come, if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain His Majestys favour, then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors, to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year. If you can only somehow make amends, said Grandmother Jia, then perhaps I shall be able to face our ancestors with pride when I die. Dont think that I know only how to enjoy a comfortable life, and that I have no stomach for poverty! Thats not it at all. Its just that I am rather shocked by all this. During the past few years you have seemed so prosperous, and I was only too glad not to interfere to jolly along and mind my own business. I never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state. Ive always known that we were living beyond our means, of course, but I thought somehow wed manage to muddle through. I suppose we were dulled by habit we couldnt adjust, we were too used to things as they were. Well now we must use this opportunity to economize and set things to rights, or else our family will be the laughing-stock of the world. You may think its the poverty that appals me. But its not. What I have always cared about more than anything is our family tradition, our family honour. Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know. How is Mrs Lian? Grandmother Jia asked her before shed finished speaking. Not at all well today, replied Lady Wang on Felicitys behalf. Ail exclaimed the old lady, rising wearily to her feet. These young people are the bane of my life! I can see they want to drive me into my grave! She asked her maids to assist her and announced her intention of paying Xi-feng a visit herself Jia Zheng hastened to detain her, and endeavoured to calm her down This has all been so distressing for you, Mother. You have already exerted yourself so much in finding a solution to our problems. You really must give yourself a bit of a rest. I am sure my wife can go over and see to Xi-feng. There is no need for you to expose yourself to any further upsets. If anything serious were to happen to you, how should I ever forgive myself. You may all leave now, ordered Lady Jia. Come back a little later. There are still a few things I want to say. Jia Zheng, his attempt at filial consolation having been thus peremptorily crushed, did not venture to say any more. He went out to superintend the practical arrangements for the convicts departure and instructed Jia Lian to choose some servants to accompany them.
They heard Xi-feng calling and Patience hurried to her bedside. Xifeng said nothing further, however, and Patience was just asking Felicity what the trouble was when they were interrupted by the arrival of Jia Lian. He glanced at the kang where Xi-feng lay, then without a word stomped into the inner room, uttered a series of exasperated grunts and sat down. Autumn was the only one to follow him in. She poured his tea and waited on him attentively, whispering something in his ear. Jia Lian summoned Patience and asked her Isnt Mrs Lian taking medicine? What if she isnt? Oh, how should I know? Bring me the key to the chest. The blackness of his mood was more evident than ever to Patience. She restrained herself from saying anything in reply, but went out and whispered in Xi-fengs ear. Xi-feng was silent. Patience fetched a casket, placed it by Jia Lans side and walked away. Where are you off to in such a damned hurry? snapped Jia Lian. Arent you going to take the key out for me, now that youve dumped the thing there? Patience tried not to react. She opened the casket, took out the key and opened the chest with it. Then she asked What do you want from it? What have we got in there? Patience finally broke down. Half angrily, half tearfully she begged Jia Lan Please, wont you tell us what the matter is? Its not fair to keep us in this dreadful suspense... What is there to say? Youre the ones who caused this trouble in the first place. Now we owe four or five thousand taels for Grandmothers funeral, and Uncle Zheng has told me to mortgage some family property to raise the money. Do you imagine weve anything left to mortgage? Its going to look pretty bad if we cant meet our debts. I never asked to do this. I shall just have to pawn the things Grandmother gave me. Well, whats the matter with you? Dont you agree? Patience did not say a word, but started taking everything out of the chest. Crimson came up to her Come quickly! Mrs Lian has been taken bad! Patience hurried in, forgetting Jia Lian entirely, and found Xi-feng waving her arms wildly in the air. She tried to hold her down, calling Out to her tearfully. Even Jia Lian now came in to have a look. He stamped his foot and cried This will be the death of me! Tears started to his eyes. Felicity came m Youre wanted outside, sir. Jia Lian checked himself and went out. Xi-feng was weakening with every minute, and Felicity and the other maids began wailing and sobbing. Qiao-jie heard and came running in, followed by Grandmother Liu, who hurried over to the kang and began muttering prayers to the Buddha and a lot of other mumbo-jumbo, which appeared to rally Xi-fengs spirits a little. Presently Lady Wang arrived, having heard the news from a maid by this time Xi-feng was more peaceful and Lady Wang saw no undue cause for concern. She greeted Grannie Liu and asked her how long she had been at Rong-guo House. Grannie Liu returned the greeting and immediately began talking at some length about Xfengs illness. After a while Suncloud appeared with a message that her mistress was wanted by Sir Zheng, whereupon Lady Wang gave Patience a few instructions and left. After her bad spell, Xi-fengs mind seemed to grow clearer. She saw Grannie Liu in the room once more, and began to feel a growing faith in the efficacy of the old dames prayers. She told Felicity and the others to leave them alone and, calling Grannie Liu over to the side of her bed, confided to her that she felt very troubled at heart and was constantly seeing spirits. Grannie Liu replied that in her home village there was a certain miraculous Bodhisattva, and a certain temple where prayers were always answered. I beseech you to pray for me, said Xi-feng. If you need money for offerings, I can provide it for you. She slipped a golden bracelet off her wrist and gave it to Grannie Liu. Theres no need of that, said Grannie Liu. If we country-folk make a vow, we give a few hundred cash when we get better - no need for anything as grand as this. If I go and pray for you, that will be your vow, maam, and when youre better you can go yourself and give what you want. Xi-feng knew that Grannie Liu was sincere, and did not try to press the bracelet on her.
I hardly think Sir Zheng would want her to remain single and make a show of faithfulness to Bao-yu, said Aunt Xue. He doesnt even know that she was Bao-yus chamber-wife. He has always thought of her as just an ordinary maid, so it would seem rather absurd to him to want to keep her on. The only solution is for you to send for a member of her own family and impress upon them the importance of arranging a decent marriage for her. We can give her a generous send-off. She is a good-natured girl and still quite young. You should do what you can for her after all the years she has worked for you. Let me explain things carefully to her. Theres no need to let her know straight away. First we should get in touch with her family and let them arrange a match next we should make some enquiries ourselves and then if it seems that the prospective husbands family are in a position to support her properly, and if the young man himself seems suitable, we can let her leave and get married. Thats a very good idea. Youve thought it all out very well, replied Lady Wang. If we do not take the initiative, Sir Zheng may go ahead himself and deal with her in a very tactless way, and then I will be responsible for yet another misfortune. Exactly the same thought had occurred to me, said Aunt Xue nodding her head. After they had chatted a while longer, Aunt Xue took her leave and went to Bao-chais apartment. She found Aroma in floods of tears and did her best to console her, speaking so far as possible in vague generalities. Aroma was at heart a simple girl and not much of a talker, and she merely gave the appropriate responses to whatever Aunt Xue said. I am only a servant, she said in the end, and it is very kind of you to think to speak to me like this, maam. I have never dared to go against any wish of Her Ladyships. Theres a good girl! said Aunt Xue, more pleased than ever with her. Bao-chai added a few high-sounding words of her own and when she and Aunt Xue parted from Aroma their minds were considerably more at ease. A few days later Jia Zheng came home and was greeted on his arrival by all the family. Jia She and Cousin Zhen had also returned from their exile by now, and they spent some time with Jia Zheng, catching up on each others news. Then Jia Zheng went in to see the womenfolk. Bao-yus absence cast a shadow of gloom over the gathering, which Jia Zheng tried to dispel as best he could. There was a reason behind all this! he said. It is up to us men now to maintain a high standard of public life, and I hope that all of you meanwhile will lend us your support here at home. There must be no hint of any slipping back into the lax old ways. Each apartment can look after its own affairs, and weve no need of a general manager. Everything in our own apartment I leave to you this was addressed to Lady Wang, to deal with in a fitting manner. Lady Wang informed him that Bao-chai was with child, and that all Bao-yus maids would be dismissed. Jia Zheng nodded in silence. The following day he attended court to receive his instructions from the chief ministers. I am extremely grateful for His Majestys gracious favour, he said. But since this is still within my period of mourning, I beg you to instruct me how I should express my gratitude. The ministers offered to present a memorial on his behalf. The Emperor most magnanimously granted Jia Zheng a special audience, and after listening to his formal expression of thanks favoured him with several Imperial instructions and enquired after his son, the successful Provincial Graduate. Jia Zheng told him the full story of Bao-yus disppearance. The Emperor marvelled at it and declared that Bao-yus compositions had indeed manifested a remarkable originality, the very quality one would expect of a soul from another plane. Such a person could have excelled at court if such had been his destiny but since he had not deigned to earn honours of a worldly nature, it was His Majestys pleasure to confer upon him the religious title Master Verbi Profundi - Master of the Profound Word. Jia Zheng kowtowed again to express his thanks for this great honour, and took his leave. On his return home he was received by Jia Lian and Cousin Zhen, who were delighted to hear the latest news from court. Ning-guo House has been set in order, said Cousin Zhen, and with your consent we intend to take up residence there again. Green Bower Hermitage in the Garden has been set aside for my sister Xi-chuns devotions.
This puzzled him for a moment. Why Snowgoose, and not Nightingale? he asked himself. Then Of course. Snowgoose is Dai-yus original maid from the South, whereas Nightingale was one of our maids, which would never do. And so, when he saw Snowgoose, it was as if he had seen the face of Dai-yu herself beneath the veil. The Master of Ceremonies chanted the liturgy, and the bride and groom knelt before Heaven and Earth. Grandmother Jia was called forth to receive their obeisances, as were Sir Zheng, Lady Wang and other elders of the family, after which they escorted the couple into the hall and thence to the bridal chamber. Here they were made to sit on the bridal bed, were showered with dried fruit and subjected to the various other practices customary in old Nanking families such as the Jias, which we need not describe in detail here. Jia Zheng, it will be remembered, had gone along with the plan grudgingly, in deference to Grandmother Jias wishes, retaining grave though unspoken doubts himself as to her theory of Bao-yus luck. But today, seeing Bao-yu bear himself with a semblance of dignity, he could not help but be pleased. The bride was now sitting alone on the bridal bed, and the moment had come for the groom to remove her veil. Xi-feng had made her preparations for this event, and now asked Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and others of the ladies present to step forward into the bridal chamber to assist her. The sense of climax seemed to cause Bao-yu to revert somewhat to his imbecile ways, for as he approached his bride he said Are you better now, coz? Its such a long time since we last saw each other. What do you want to go wrapping yourself up in that silly thing for? He was about to raise the veil. Grandmother Jia broke into a cold sweat. But he hesitated, thinking to himself I know how sensitive Cousin Lin is. I must be very careful not to offend her. He waited a little longer. But soon the suspense became unbearable, and he walked up to her and lifted the veil. The Matron of Honour took it from him, while Snow-goose melted into the background and Oriole came forward to take her place. Bao-yu stared at his bride. Surely this was Bao-chai? Incredulous, with one hand holding the lantern, he rubbed his eyes with the other and looked again. It was Bao-chai. How pretty she looked, in her wedding-gown! He gazed at her soft skin, the full curve of her shoulders, and her hair done up in tresses that hung from her temples! Her eyes were moist, her lips quivered slightly. Her whole appearance had the simple elegance of a white lily, wet with pendant dew the maidenly blush on her cheeks resembled apricot-blossom wreathed in mist. For a moment he stared at her in utter astonishment. Then he noticed that Oriole was standing at her side, while Snowgoose had quite vanished. A feeling of helpless bewilderment seized him, and thinking he must be dreaming, he stood there in a motionless daze. The maids took the lamp from him and helped him to a chair, where he sat with his eyes fixed in front of him, still without uttering a single word. Grandmother Jia was anxious lest this might signal the approach of another of his fits, and herself came over to rally him, while Xi-feng and You-shi escorted Bao-chai to a chair in the inner part of the room. Bao-chai held her head bowed and said nothing. After a while, Bao-yu had composed himself sufficiently to think. He saw Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang sitting opposite him, and asked Aroma in a whisper Where am I? This must all be a dream. A dream? Why, its the happiest day of your life! said Aroma. How can you be so silly? Take care Sir Zeng is outside. Pointing now to where Bao-chai sat, and still whispering, Bao-yu asked again Who is that beautiful lady sitting over there? Aroma found this so comical that for a while she could say nothing, but held her hand to her face to conceal her mirth. Finally she replied That is your bride, the new Mrs Bao-yu. The other maids also turned away, unable to contain their laughter. Bao-yu Dont be so silly! What do you mean, "Mrs Bao-yu"? Who is Mrs Bao-yu? Aroma Miss Chai. Bao-yu But what about Miss Lin?
Some of my seafaring mates happen to be in the area at this very moment, waiting for a job like this to crop up. Once weve got our hands on the money, you and I would be wasting our time in these parts. Wed be far better off going to sea with my mates and spending our fortune there! Good idea, eh? Of course, if you cant bear the thought of parting from your old foster-mum, well just have to lug her along too. One big happy family, eh! Youre drunk! exclaimed He San. You dont know what youre talking about. The whole ideas a crazy one. None the less, he took the man aside into an out-of-the-way alley, and the two of them stood there talking a while longer before going their separate ways. Our story must leave them for the time being. -1536 We must return to Rong-guo House and to Bao Yong, the former Zhen family retainer now living with the Jias, who after a dressing-down from Jia Zheng had been demoted to caretaking duties in the Garden. In the general bustle of Grandmother Jias funeral, no one thought of assigning him a task. He was unconcerned by this and continued to mind his own business, cooking for himself and leading a somewhat carefree and independent life. If he felt bored, he would take a nap, and on waking would practise with sword and stave in the Garden. On the day of Grandmother Jias funeral procession, of which he was quite aware, although he had been given no part to -1344 play in it, he was taking a stroll in the Garden when he saw the figure of a nun accompanied by an old matron, making their way to the side gate, where they began knocking. He went up to them Where would you be going, Reverend Mother? The old matron replied We heard that Lady Jias wake is over, and as we couldnt see Miss Xi-chun in the procession we thought she must have stayed at home. Sister thought she might be lonely and has come to call on her. None of the family are at home, said Bao Yong. Im in charge of the Garden and I must ask you to return to your quarters. If you want to visit, please wait until they have come back from the procession. And who do you think you are, you ruffian? the matron protested indignantly. What business is it of yours where we go? I dont like your type, replied Bao Yong. I say you cant go, and thats final. Why, this is downright mutiny! the old matron retorted angrily and noisily. When Lady Jia was alive they never stopped us going anywhere. What kind of an upstart are you, to start throwing your weight around in this insolent manner? I dont care what you say, I will go out this way! She seized the door-knocker and struck it several times with all her might. Adamantina was speechless with rage as she listened to this exchange. She was on the point of going home when the old women on the other side of the gate heard the sound of an argument and opened up to investigate. Deducing that Adamantina must have been offended by Bao Yong, and knowing that she was on intimate terms with the ladies of the house, especially Miss Xi-chun, the women feared that at some later date she might report them for not letting her through, and thereby get them into serious trouble. They hurried after her We had no idea you were here, Your Reverence. Our apologies for being so slow in Opening the gate. Miss Xi-chun is at home, and would be so pleased to see you. Please come on in. That stupid caretaker is new here. He doesnt know anything. Well report him later to Her Ladyship and shell have him beaten and get rid of him. At first Adamantina refused to change her mind. But the old women kept on pestering her, begged her not to get them into trouble, were on the point of falling to their knees, until in the end she really had no choice but to turn back and follow them into the mansion. Bao Yong, Seeing how things stood, understandably made no further attempts at obstruction but went back to his room, scowling and fuming to himself. Adamantina went straight to Xi-chuns apartment. She offered her condolences and they chatted for a while. I still have a few more nights to last out before the others come home, said Xi-chun. Xi-feng is sick, and Im all on my own. Its so boring and lonely - and scaring! If only I had someone to keep me company! Now that youve come all this way, wont you stay the night?
If you allow yourself to sink into the dreadful state you were in after you lost your jade, youll cause us no end of trouble again! If youre still worried, Mother, said Bao-yu, then by all means send for a doctor and Ill take some medicine. Lady Wang accordingly sent a maid to fetch a doctor, and was thus far too preoccupied with Bao-yu to think of Xi-chuns predicament. The doctor arrived presently, examined Bao-yu and made out a prescription, after the administration of which Lady Wang returned to her own apartment. Over the next few days, however, Bao-yu seemed to become more of an imbecile than ever. He stopped eating completly, and his condition began to cause general concern. When the time came for the ceremony to mark the end of the formal mourning period for Grandmother Jia, and since the family were especially busy at the temple, Jia Yun was called in to receive Bao-yus doctor and because of the shortage of men in Jia Lians compound, Wang Ren also had to be asked to attend and help supervise there. Qiao-jie had made herself ill crying day and night for her mother, and in every respect Rong-guo House presented a picture of sad disarray. When the family returned from the service at the temple, Lady Wang went at once to visit Bao-yu. She found that his condition had greatly deteriorated. He was unconscious, and the servants were in a helpless panic some were standing there in tears, some had already gone to Jia Zhengs, where they announced The doctor says its a waste of time to prescribe any more medicine, and we must be prepared for the worst ... Jia Zheng heaved a bitter sigh and went to inspect for himself. Bao-yu indeed showed every sign of being at deaths door, and Jia Zheng ordered Jia Lian to make the necessary preparations. Jia Lian did not dare gainsay him, and reluctantly gave instructions for Bao-yus last things to be prepared. He was just wondering how they could possibly raise the money for yet another funeral, when one of the servants rushed into the room in a state of great agitation, crying Mr Lian! Something terrible! Another disaster! Jia Lian had no notion what the man could be referring to and stared at him transfixed with fear What is it? Theres a monk at the gate and he says hes brought back Mt Baos lost lade. He wants ten thousand taels for it Jia Lian spat in the servants face Hng! I thought from the fluster you were in that it was something serious. Didnt you hear about that last hoax? And even if this jade were genuine, what good could it do now, when the boys already past hope? Thats what I said myself, sir. But the monk swore that Mr Bao would be cured as soon as we paid him the money. As he was speaking, another servant rushed in crying The monks gone berserk! Hes crashing his way in and none us can stop him! This is unbelievable! exclaimed Jia Lian. Send him packing this instant! When he learned what had happened, Jia Zheng was as flummoxed as Jia Lian. Meanwhile more cries came from within Bao-yu is sinking! Jia Zheng was growing desperate, when he heard the monks voice calling If you want the boy to live, just bring me the money! Jia Zheng suddenly thought It was a monk who cured Bao-yus earlier illness perhaps this monk can save him after all. But if the jade is genuine, how will we ever raise the money for it? After a moments reflection, he concluded to himself Oh well, we can think of that in due course. Lets cure him first, and bargain later. By the time he had reached this decision and despatched a servant with an invitation, the monk was already on his way, and without so much as a bow or a word of acknowledgement went striding into Bao-yus room. Jia Lian tried to restrain him, saying There are ladies in there! A tramp like you cant go barging in! Any delay, cried the monk, and it may be too late to save him! Jia Lian was too flustered to be able to do anything but follow him, calling out in confusion Quiet now! Stop your weeping! The monk has arrived! He continued calling out like this, but Lady Wang and the others were far too overwrought by Bao-yus condition to pay him any attention. When eventually they did look round, they were shocked to see the great burly figure of the monk descending on them, and at the last moment tried unsuccessfully to conceal themselves, while the monk made straight for the kang on which Bao-yu lay.
Look at Li Wan her son has passed his Provincial examination, and no doubt next year young Lan will go on to become a Palace Graduate and an official. After all that his mother has suffered, now at last she can reap her reward. As for my daughter, you know that she is not a fickle or flighty girl. You have no cause to worry on her account. Lady Wang found her sisters words convincing and reassuring. Bao-chai was always so demure and restrained as a child, she reflected to herself. Always fond of plain, simple things. Perhaps that is why she has ended up in this predicament. Perhaps everything in this world really is fated! Though Chai has wept a great deal, she has never lost her sense of dignity. In fact she has even on occasion tried to comfort me. What a rare girl she is! So unlike her poor husband, wh6 clearly was not meant for any joy in this world. Comforted somewhat by these thoughts, Lady Wang turned her mind to Aroma None of the other maids presents much of a problem. The older ones can be married off, the younger ones can continue to wait on Bao-chai. But what am I to do with Aroma? She did not feel she could raise such a sensitive matter at a large family gathering, and decided to wait until the evening when she could discuss it privately with her sister. Aunt Xue did not go home that night but stayed to comfort Bao-chai, afraid she might weep to excess. But in the end, as it turned out, Bao-chai was extremely reasonable. She reflected stoically on the whole course of events and concluded that since Bao-yu had always been a very strange creature, and since no doubt all that had happened had been preordained, there was little point in fighting against it. She expressed this in a very level-headed way to her mother, who was most relieved to hear her adopt this attitude and communicated it to Lady Wang when she next saw her. Lady Wang nodded and sighed If I really were a wicked woman, fate would never have given me such a wonderful daughter-in-law! She started to become tearful again, and Aunt Xue tried to calm her down. She brought up the subject of Aroma She has grown so terribly thin of late. All she ever does is brood about Bao-yu. Its right and proper for a wife to exhibit loyalty to her husband, even when he is a true husband to her no longer. And a chamber-wife may do the same if she wishes. But Aroma was never formally declared to be Bayus chamber-wife, even though in fact we know that she was. Yes, I was thinking about this only a short while ago, said Lady Wang. I was waiting for a chance to talk it over with you in private. If we simply dismiss her from service, Im afraid she wont want to go, and may even try to take her own life. We could keep her on, but I am afraid Sir Zheng would not approve. It is a tricky problem. I hardly think Sir Zheng would want her to remain single and make a show of faithfulness to Bao-yu, said Aunt Xue. He doesnt even know that she was Bao-yus chamber-wife. He has always thought of her as just an ordinary maid, so it would seem rather absurd to him to want to keep her on. The only solution is for you to send for a member of her own family and impress upon them the importance of arranging a decent marriage for her. We can give her a generous send-off. She is a good-natured girl and still quite young. You should do what you can for her after all the years she has worked for you. Let me explain things carefully to her. Theres no need to let her know straight away. First we should get in touch with her family and let them arrange a match next we should make some enquiries ourselves and then if it seems that the prospective husbands family are in a position to support her properly, and if the young man himself seems suitable, we can let her leave and get married. Thats a very good idea. Youve thought it all out very well, replied Lady Wang. If we do not take the initiative, Sir Zheng may go ahead himself and deal with her in a very tactless way, and then I will be responsible for yet another misfortune. Exactly the same thought had occurred to me, said Aunt Xue nodding her head. After they had chatted a while longer, Aunt Xue took her leave and went to Bao-chais apartment. She found Aroma in floods of tears and did her best to console her, speaking so far as possible in vague generalities. Aroma was at heart a simple girl and not much of a talker, and she merely gave the appropriate responses to whatever Aunt Xue said.
Their misdeeds have driven me to these drastic measures, but dont think I have forgotten that you too are my son. In due time you will receive your fair share. Bao-yu is married and can have what is left here - gold and silver worth several thousand taels. And Li Wan she has always been such a dutiful granddaughter4n4aw to me, and little Lan is such a sweet child. Heres some for them too. There, Ive finished. Jia Zheng was moved to tears to see how clearly she had worked everything out. We have failed you, Mother! he sobbed, falling to his knees. We have not done our filial duty towards you in your old age and yet you shower us with such bounty! How can we ever outlive our shame! Oh poppycock! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Dont you worry, if it werent for this crisis I should certainly have kept it all for myself! But lets be serious our staff is much too large. You are the only one left with an official post, Zheng, so we dont need more than a few servants. Tell the stewards to call the staff together and make the necessary arrangements. Each establishment must make do with as few servants as possible. We would have had to manage with none at all if our household had been confiscated. The same goes for the ladies apartments. We must find husbands for some of the maids, and give others back their freedom. And although our property has not been taken, I still think it would be best if you handed over the Garden. Lian should be given the job of sorting out the country estates. Some can be sold, some kept on, as seems most appropriate. Above all there must be no more pomp in future, no more empty show. We must be realistic. And another thing I should mention. We still have some money belonging to the Zhen family of Nanking. Its in safe keeping with your wife, Zheng. Someone should be Sent to take it back to them straight away. If anything else should happen to us, wed only involve them in a lot more trouble, push them out of the frying-pan and into the fire. Jia Zheng, who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters, mumbled a contrite Yes, Mother to all of these eminently practical instructions, thinking to himself What a flair she has for organization! And what worthless bunglers we all are by comparison! He could see that Grandmother Jia was tired, and begged her to lie down and rest. The little you see here is all I have left, she said. When I die, you can use some of it to pay for my funeral, and give the remainder to my maids. They found this mention of her death greatly upsetting, and all fell to their knees once more. Please set your mind at ease, Mother. In time to come, if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain His Majestys favour, then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors, to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year. If you can only somehow make amends, said Grandmother Jia, then perhaps I shall be able to face our ancestors with pride when I die. Dont think that I know only how to enjoy a comfortable life, and that I have no stomach for poverty! Thats not it at all. Its just that I am rather shocked by all this. During the past few years you have seemed so prosperous, and I was only too glad not to interfere to jolly along and mind my own business. I never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state. Ive always known that we were living beyond our means, of course, but I thought somehow wed manage to muddle through. I suppose we were dulled by habit we couldnt adjust, we were too used to things as they were. Well now we must use this opportunity to economize and set things to rights, or else our family will be the laughing-stock of the world. You may think its the poverty that appals me. But its not. What I have always cared about more than anything is our family tradition, our family honour. Every day of my life has been lived in the hope that this generation would outshine our ancestors. But I would have been content just to maintain our position as it was. I had no idea of the disgraceful jiggery-pokery those two were up to behind my back! Grandmother Jia was ruminating aloud in this fashion when Felicity came hurrying into the room and ran over to Lady Wang in a great fluster Oh Your Ladyship! Mrs Lian heard the news from court this morning, and shes cried such a lot that now she seems quite faint. Patience sent me over to let you know.
she asked. We had better question Moonbeam. Jin-guis mother seemed to become very apprehensive all of a sudden. Why should Moonbeam know about my daughters things? she protested. Come, maam, put in Zhou Ruis wife, thats hardly a very sensible question. Miss Moonbeam was with Mrs Pan all the time. Of course shed know. Moonbeam could see she was cornered, and would have to tell the truth Madam used to take things with her whenever she went home. There was nothing I could do about it. A roar of indignation burst from the Xue camp So thats it! Really, Mrs Xia! A fine mother you are! You talk your daughter into stealing our things and then when the supply runs out, you force her to commit suicide so that you can blackmail us! Theyll be very interested to hear that at the inquest! Go outside, said Bao-chai, and tell Mr Lian that the Xias must on no account be allowed to leave. Jin-guis mother was now in a state of extreme trepidation, and cursed Moonbeam roundly You little hussy! You scandal-monger! When did my daughter ever steal any of their things? Stealings nothing, retorted Moonbeam coolly, compared to murder and I dont mean to let myself be called a murderer in order to cover up for a thief. If we can find the missing things, well know who the murderer is, said Bao-qin. Someone quickly go and find Lian. He can ask that Xia fellow about the buying of the arsenic. Theyll want to know about that at the inquest. Jin-guis mother began to panic Moonbeam must be possessed to speak such nonsense! When did my daughter ever buy arsenic? If you ask me, it was Moonbeam herself! Thats going too far! cried Moonbeam wildly. Im not taking that - not from you! Why, it was the two of you who were always telling Mrs Pan to stand up for her rights! It was you who advised her to make life unbearable for Mr Pans family, and then, when they were ruined, to walk off with every last button in the house and find herself a decent husband! Do you deny that? Before Jin-guis mother could reply, Zhou Ruis wife cried with glee Denounced by one of your own servants! Well, what have you got to say for yourself now? J in-guis mother cursed Moonbeam again, and gnashing her teeth said bitterly Havent I treated you well? Are you trying to drive me to the grave? At the inquest, I shall testify that it was you who did it! Moonbeam glared at her angrily and then turned to Mrs Xue Please release Caltrop, maam. Theres no sense in harming an innocent person like this. I shall tell the whole truth at the inquest. Bao-chai immediately instructed the servants to release Moonbeam instead, and said Come on, Moonbeam, youve always been a straightforward girl. Dont let yourself get involved in underhand dealings. Youll only suffer for it. If youve something to say, then go ahead and say it. Tell us the truth, and the whole affair can be cleared up once and for all. Moonbeam was terrified of being tortured at the inquest, and finally gave in Every day Mrs Pan used to complain about the way life had treated her. Why was I born to such a stupid mother? shed say. Instead of showing me some sense and marrying me to Master Ke, she went and chose his half-baked booby of a cousin! Id gladly die if I could only spend one day with Master Ke! And then shed always say how she hated Caltrop. I didnt pay much attention at first, and later when I began to notice how friendly she was being to Caltrop I supposed that Caltrop must have somehow earned her way back into her good books. I thought Mrs Pan made the soup for her as a kind gesture. Then I discovered that she had something quite different in mind! Something horrible! That makes no sense at all! interrupted Jin-guis mother. If you are implying that she intended to do away with Caltrop, then how do you account for the fact that she ended up swallowing the poison herself? Bao-chai turned to Caltrop You tell us what happened yesterday, Caltrop. Did you drink any of the soup? A few days ago, began Caltrop, when I was so ill that I could hardly lift my head, Mrs Pan offered to bring me some soup. I didnt dare refuse, and I was struggling to sit up when she had an accident on the way and spilt the soup all over the floor. It was a lot of trouble for her, cleaning it all up, and I felt very bad to have been the cause of it.
Nothing whatsoever had occurred. He sighed. As the poet once said, he mused out loud Since deaths parting, slow and sad the year has been Even in my dreams, her soul has not been seen. Bao-chai, who in contrast to Bao-yu had not slept a wink all night, heard him recite these well-known lines from Bo Ju-yis Song of Enduring Grief, and remarked What a singularly inept quotation! If Gousin Lin were alive, shed be cross with you again, for comparing her to Yang Gui-fei! Bao-yu was embarrassed that she had overheard him. He climbed out of bed and walked sheepishly into the inner room. I meant to come in last night, he said. But somehow I lay down and fell fast asleep. What difference does it make to me whether you came in or not? said Bao-chai. Aroma had not slept either, and hearing the two of them talking she hurried over at once to pour tea. At that moment a junior maid from Grandmother Jias arrived. Did Mr Bao have a good nights sleep? she asked. If so, then will he and Mrs Bao please call on Her Old Ladyship as soon as they have completed their toilet? Please inform Her Old Ladyship, replied Bao-chai, that Mr Bao slept extremely well and that we will both call presently. The maid departed with this message. Bao-chai completed her toilet at once, and accompanied by Oriole and Aroma she went first to pay her respects to Grandmother Jia. Then she called politely on Lady Wang and Xi-feng, before returning once more to Grandmother Jias. Her mother had by now arrived. How was Bao-yu last night? was what everyone wanted to know He went to sleep as soon as we got home, Bao-chai informed them. He was fine. They were relieved to hear this and the conversation passed to various other topics. Presently a junior maid came in to say that Ying-chun was going home Mr Sun sent someone to Lady Xings to complain, and Her Ladyship sent word to Miss Xi-chun to say that Miss Ying-chun must not be detained, but should return at once. Miss Ying-chun is at Her Ladyships now. Shes very upset, and is crying. She will be coming over presently to say goodbye, maam. Grandmother Jia was greatly distressed. Why did fate have to bring together a sweet child like Ying and this monster Sun! Shell have to bear with it for the rest of her life. Theres no way out for her, poor girl! As they were speaking, Ying-chun came in, her cheeks wet with tears. The family were still supposed to be celebrating Bao-chais birthday, so she did her best not to cry as she made her farewells. Grandmother Jia knew that Ying-chun must not delay her departure and she did not try to detain her. Youd best be on your way, she said. But please, however bad things are, try to look on the bright side! Hes what he is and there is little you can do to change him. In a few days Ill send someone to invite you home again for another visit. Oh Grannie! sobbed Ying-chun. Youve always loved me! But its no good! I know Ill never come home again! She could contain herself no longer, and tears streamed down her cheeks. Come along now! They all did what they could to cheer her upOf course youll come again! You should be thankful youre not at the other end of the world, like poor Tan. She has almost no chance whatsoever of coming home. This mention of Tan-chun only brought more tears to the eyes of Grandmother Jia and the ladies. Once again, the fact that it was Bao-chais birthday induced one of them to try and strike a more optimistic note Who knows if peace is restored on the coast, Tans father-in4aw may be transferred back to the capital, and then we shall be able to see her! Of course! everyone concurred. Ying-chun had now to contain her grief as best she could and take her leave. They saw her out, and then returned to Grandmother Jias, where the party continued for the rest of that day and into the evening. When they saw that the old lady was tired, they all went their separate ways home. Aunt Xue, after bidding farewell to Grandmother Jia, went to have a talk with Bao-chai Your brother has survived this year, and if he can only receive an Imperial pardon and have his sentence reduced, he may still be able to pay his fine and be set free.
Dai-yu gave a wraithlike smile, but said nothing. She started coughing again and brought up a lot more blood. Nightingale and Snowgoose came closer and watched her feebly struggling for breath. They knew that any further attempt to rally her would be to no avail, and could do nothing but stand there watching and weeping. Each day Nightingale went over three or four times to tell Grandmother Jia, but Faithful, judging the old ladys attitude towards Dai-yu to have hardened of late, intercepted her reports and hardly mentioned Dai-yu to her mistress. Grandmother Jia was preoccupied with the wedding arrangements, and in the absence of any particular news of Dai-yu, did not show a great deal of interest in the girls fate, considering it sufficient that she should be receiving medical attention. Previously, when she had been ill, Dai-yu had always received frequent visits from everyone in the household, from Grandmother Jia down to the humblest maidservant. But now not a single person came to see her. The only face she saw looking down at her was that of Nightingale. She began to feel her end drawing near, and struggled to say a few words to her Dear Nightingale! Dear sister! Closest friend! Though you were Grandmothers maid before you came to serve me, over the years you have become as a sister to me... She had to stop for breath. Nightingale felt a pang of pity, was reduced to tears and could say nothing. After a long silence, Dai-yu began to speak again, searching for breath between words Dear sister! I am so uncomfortable lying down like this. Please help me up and sit next to me. I dont think you should sit up, Miss, in your condition. You might get cold in the draught. Dai-yu closed her eyes in silence. A little later she asked to sit up again. Nightingale and Snowgoose felt they could no longer deny her request. They propped her up on both sides with soft pillows, while Nightingale sat by her on the bed to give further support. Dai-yu was not equal to the effort. The bed where she sat on it seemed to dig into her, and she struggled with all her remaining strength to lift herself up and ease the pain. She told Snowgoose to come closer. My poems... Her voice failed, and she fought for breath again. Snow-goose guessed that she meant the manuscripts she had been revising a few days previously, went to fetch them and laid them on Dai-yus lap. Dai-yu nodded, then raised her eyes and gazed in the direction of a chest that stood on a stand close by. Snowgoose did not know how to interpret this and stood there at a loss. Dai-yu stared at her now with feverish impatience. She began to cough again and brought up another mouthful of blood. Snowgoose went to fetch some water, and Dai-yu rinsed her mouth and spat into the spittoon. Nightingale wiped her lips with a handkerchief. Dai-yu took the handkerchief from her and pointed to the chest. She tried to speak, but was again seized with an attack of breathlessness and closed her eyes. Lie down, Miss, said Nightingale. Dai-yu shook her head. Nightingale thought she must want one of her handkerchiefs, and told Snowgoose to open the chest and bring her a plain white silk one. Dai-yu looked at it, and dropped it on the bed. Making a supreme effort, she gasped out The ones with the writing on... Nightingale finally realized that she meant the handkerchiefs Bao-yu had sent her, the ones she had inscribed with her own poems. She told Snowgoose to fetch them, and herself handed them to Dai-yu, with these words of ad vice You must lie down and rest, Miss. Dont start wearing yourself out. You can look at these another time, when you are feeling better. Dai-yu took the handkerchiefs in one hand and without even looking at them, brought round her other hand which cost her a great effort and tried with all her might to tear them in two. But she was so weak that all she could achieve was a pathetic trembling motion. Nightingale knew that Bao-yu was the object of all- this bitterness but dared not mention his name, saying instead Miss, there is no sense in working yourself up again. Dai-yu nodded faintly, and slipped the handkerchiefs into her sleeve. Light the lamp, she ordered. Snowgoose promptly obeyed. Dai-yu looked into the lamp, then closed her eyes and sat in silence.
Aunt Xue was particularly happy at the news, and set about making preparations for the payment of Xue Pans fine, since his death sentence would now be commuted as part of the amnesty. A few days later it was announced that Zhen Bao-yu and his father had called to offer their congratulations, and Lady Wang sent Jia Lan out to receive them. Shortly afterwards Jia Lan returned with a broad smile on his face Good news, Grandmother! Uncle Zhen Bao-yus father has heard at court of an edict pardoning both Great-uncle She and Uncle Zhen from Ning-guo House, and restoring the hereditary Ning-guo rank to Uncle Zhen. Grandfather is to keep the hereditary Rong-guo rank and after his period of mourning will be reinstated as a Permanent Secretary in the Board of Works. All the familys confiscated property is to be restored. His Majesty has read Uncle Baos composition and was extremely struck by it. When he discovered that the candidate concerned was Her Late Graces younger brother, and when the Prince of Bei-jing added a few words of commendation, His Majesty expressed a desire to summon him to court for an audience. The ministers then told him that Uncle Bao had disappeared after the examination it was I who informed them of this in the first place, and that he was at present being looked for everywhere, without success, whereupon His Majesty issued another edict, ordering all the garrisons in the capital to make a thorough search for him. You can set your mind at rest now, Grandmother. With His Majesty taking a personal interest in the matter, Uncle Bao is sure to be found! Lady Wang and the rest of the family were delighted and congratulated each other on this new turn of events. Meanwhile Jia Huan and his accomplices were still on tenterhooks, searching everywhere for Qiao-jie, who having left the city with Patience and Grannie Liu had meanwhile arrived in the village and been installed in Grannie Lius best room, specially cleaned out for the occasion. Although their daily diet was simple village fare, it was wholesome and clean, and with little Qing-er to keep them company they had relatively few cares. There were a few quite well-off families in the village, who when they heard that there was a Miss Jia staying at Grannie Lius insisted on coming to have a look for themselves. They all waxed eloquent on the subject of her fairylike appearance and sent presents of fruit, fresh produce and game. In fact, Qiao-jies presence caused a considerable stir. The richest family were the Zhous, whose wealth was composed partly of money and partly of extensive holdings of land. They had one son in the family, a cultivated, fine-looking lad of fourteen, who had studied with a family tutor and had recently passed the preliminary Licentiate exam. When his mother set eyes on Qiao-jie she was lost in admiration. What a pity! she thought to herself, with a deep inner sigh of regret. A boy from a country family like ours would never be thought fit for such a well-bred young lady. She stood there for some time deep in thought, and Grannie Liu soon guessed what was on her mind. I know what youre thinking, she said. Why dont I propose the match for you? Mrs Zhou laughed Dont go making fun of me! A great family like theirs, stoop to the likes of us! Well, itd do no harm to suggest it, replied Grannie Liu. And we shall see. The two of them left it at that and went their separate ways. Grannie Liu was concerned to know the latest developments at Rong-guo House and sent Ban-er into town to find out. He reached Two Dukes Street to find a throng of carriages outside the two mansions, and stationed himself close by to glean what news he could. This is what he overheard Both families have had their ranks restored and all their confiscated property returned. Things are looking up for them again. But young Bao-yu has disappeared without trace after passing his exams. Ban-er was delighted to hear of the familys restoration to favour and was just setting off home to carry the good news back to his grandmother when he saw several horses pull up outside the gates. The riders dismounted and the gatemen saluted with one knee on the ground Welcome home, sir! And congratulations! How is Sir Shes health? Better, replied the young man who had first dismounted. And he has received His Majestys gracious permission to return home. After a short pause he asked What are those men doing over there? His Majesty sent an official here with a decree. They require a member of the family to receive back all the confiscated property. The young master strode in cheerfully, and Ban-er, concluding that it must be Jia Lian, did not wait for any further news but hastened home to inform Grannie Liu.
He attempted to forestall a reply in like vein from Zhen Bao-yu I had always understood from what I had heard of you that you condemned vulgar and commonplace notions, and had formed your own personal view of the world. I was so happy to have had this opportunity of meeting you today, and of learning from you something that would help me transcend this mortal realm we live in and enter a more spiritual plane. I felt sure that such an encounter would help to cleanse my heart of worldly desires, and open my eyes to a more profound view of life. Alas, it is clear from your words that you consider me a coarse creature, and have therefore treated me out of politeness to this rigmarole 6f worldly wisdom. Young Zhen reflected Clearly he has heard tales of me as a child, and therefore thinks that I was speaking out of mere politeness, masking my true nature. I must be frank with him. Who knows, he may even turn out to be a true friend. I fully appreciate the sincerity of your remarks, he began. When I was young, I too abhorred anything that smacked of the platitude and the cliche. But I grew older, and when my father resigned from his post and had little further inclination for social entertaining, the role of host devolved upon me. In the course of my duties I observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom I met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name. All their written works or spoken words were of l6yalty and filial piety, their entire lives were devoted to virtue and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed upon them by their fathers and teachers alike. So gradually I cast off the intractable theories and foolish passions of my youth. I am still searching for teachers and friends of a like mind to instruct me and guide me out of my benighted ignorance, and I consider it a great blessing to have met you. I feel sure that I have much to learn from you. Believe me, what I said earlier was in earnest. The more Jia Bao-yu heard the more exasperated he felt. For politeness sake he mumbled something ambiguous in reply, and was saved from further embarrassment by a summons from the inner apartments If the gentlemen have eaten, would Mr Zhen please join the ladies? Bao-yu seized this opportunity, promptly inviting Zhen Bao-yu to lead the way, and they proceeded to Lady Wangs apartment, followed by the other boys. Seeing Lady Zhen seated in the place of honour, Jia Bao-yu paid her his respects, Jia Huan and Jia Lan followed suit, and Zhen Bao-yu likewise paid his respects to Lady Wang. At last the two ladies and their two jades were face to face. Although Jia Bao-yu was now married, Lady Zhen was old enough not to have to stand on ceremony on that account, especially as the connection between their two families was such a long-standing one. She saw how alike the two of them were, and could not help warming towards Jia Bao-yu with Lady Wang it was the same, she took Zhen Bao-yu by the hand and plied him with questions, finding him rather more mature than her own son. She glanced at Jia Lan, and reflected to herself that he too cut a fine figure though not quite on a level with the two jades, he could certainly hold his own in their company. Jia Huans uncouth appearance, on the other hand, aroused all her old antipathy. When it became known that both jades were present together, all the maids came to have a look. How extraordinary! they murmured to one another. Its one thing for them to have the same name but they even look alike - face, build, everything! Luckily our Bao-yu is dressed in mourning white or wed never be able to tell them apart! Nightingale in particular seemed momentarily quite stunned. She was thinking of Dai-yu If only she were still alive! They might have married her to this Bao-yu. I think shed have been willing enough..., Even as these thoughts were running through her head, she heard Lady Zhen say A few days ago, I believe my husband, who now considers our Bao-yu of an age to be married, asked Sir Zheng to look out for a suitable bride for him. Lady Wang was already much taken with Zhen Bao-yu and without any hesitation she replied I should be glad to act as a matchmaker for your son. Of our own girls, two have passed away, and one is already married. Cousin Zhen of Ning-guo House has an unmarried younger sister, but she is a few years too young for the match.
Ten, who was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and his chest puffed out, asked him what his business was with Mr Zhou. The clerk stood to attention with his hands at his sides and smiled uneasily. The new Intendant has been in office more than a month now, he replied, but not a single granarys been opened to take in the tax-grain. The local magistrates have been made to feel uncomfortable by all his stern pronouncements. Theyve been quite put off from entering into the usual - how shall I put it? - negotiations. Now, if the grain is not going to be taken in and delivered on time, whats the point of your being here at all? What a ridiculous question! said Ten. Our Master the Intendant is a man of his word. Of course hell meet his commitments. As a matter of fact he was about to issue the Reminders a couple of days ago, but on my advice they were postponed. Now, tell me what you really wanted to see Zhou about? Clerk Oh, that was it ... the Reminders. Nothing else .. Ten Nonsense! Dont try to fool me with that, my lad! And dont come sneaking in here with any nifty little plans, or Ill tell the Intendant to beat you and take your job away. Clerk My family has served in this yamen for three generations Ive got a decent position here, I manage to make an honest living. I dont mind going by the book until this Intendant gets promoted and moved somewhere else. Im not like that beggarly lot whove just left. He took formal leave of Li Ten Id best be going now, sir. Ten stood up, all smiles Come on now, cant you take a joke? No need to get rattled by a few words .. Im not rattled. I just dont want to say anything that might compromise you, sir. Ten walked over to the clerk and took him confidentially by the hand Tell me, whats your name? Zhan Hui, Homophone for bribery sir, replied the clerk nervously. I spent quite a few years up in the capital myself when I was a boy. Mr Zhan! Why, of course! Ive heard of you. Come now, were all in this together. If theres something you want to talk to me about, why not drop by this evening and we can have a nice little chat. We all know how capable you are, Mr Li, replied the clerk aloud, with a sigh of relief. Why, you really had me worried there for a minute! He left amidst general laughter. That evening Zhan returned and he and Li were closeted together deep into the night. The next day, when Li found some pretext to call on Jia Zheng, and hinted at some of the measures he had in mind, predictably he received a stern reprimand. The following day, Jia Zheng was due to pay a formal visit in the town, and he issued orders for his retinue to make themselves ready. A considerable interval of time elapsed, and the gong in the inner yamen was struck three times, but still there was no sign of anyone to beat the drum in the main hall. Someone was finally found to perform this duty, and Jia Zheng came walking out of his private chambers with measured stride, to find that there was only one attendant waiting for him, instead of the usual team of runners and criers. Resolving not to pursue this dereliction for the time being, Jia Zheng stepped into the sedan at the foot of the terrace and waited for his chair-bearers. Another long interval elapsed before these had all assembled and were ready to carry him out of the yamen, and the Intendants solemn departure was then announced by a single feeble report from the cannon, while a grand total of two members of the ceremonial band, a drummer and a bugler, put in a forlorn appearance on the bandstand. Jia Zheng was now extremely annoyed. Things have been in perfect order until today. Whats the meaning of this shambles? His insignia-bearers, such as they were, straggled across the road in an unseemly fashion. Jia Zheng concluded his visit as best he could, and immediately upon his return summoned the defaulters and threatened them with a flogging. Some pleaded that they had been unable to attend because they lacked the requisite headgear, others that they had been forced to pawn their uniforms, while some claimed that they had not eaten for three days and were therefore too weak for heavy carrying duties. Jia Zheng vented his anger on them verbally, ordered a couple of them to be flogged and left it at that. The next day the chief cook came asking for more money, and Jia Zheng had to provide him with some of the personal reserve he had brought with him from home.
To think that now he should be openly doing a thing like this! Men must have hearts as cold as ice or snow. What hateful creatures they are! She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet within. Suddenly she realized Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where? She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yus page boy Inky rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale? I heard that Master Bao was getting married, replied Nightingale, and I wanted to watch some of the fun. But I can see Ive come to the wrong place. And I dont know when the wedding is taking place, either. If I tell you, said Inky in a confidential tone, you must promise not to tell Snowgoose. Weve been given orders not to let any of you know. The weddings to be tonight. Of course its not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside another apartment. Whats the matter? continued Inky, after a pause. Nothing, replied Nightingale. You can go now. Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and clenching her teeth, she said fiercely Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous way but when you are happily married, and have your hearts desire, you neednt think you can look me in the face again! As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the Garden. She was not far from the Naiads House, when she saw two junior maids standing at the gate, peeping out nervously. They saw her coming, and one of them cried out Theres Miss Nightingale! At last! Nightingale could see that all was not well. Gesturing to them anxiously to be silent, she hurried in, to find Dai-yu red in the face, the fire from her liver having risen upwards and inflamed her cheeks. This was a dangerous sign, and Nightingale called Dai-yus old wet-nurse, Nannie Wang, to come and take a look. One glance was enough to reduce this old woman tears. Nightingale had turned to Nannie Wang as an older person, who could be expected to lend them some courage in this extremity. But she turned out to be quite helpless, and only made Nightingale more distraught than before. Suddenly she thought of someone else she could turn to, and sent one of the younger maids to fetch her with all speed. Her choice might seem a strange one but Nightingale reasoned that as a widow, Li Wan would certainly be excluded from Bao-yus wedding festivities. Besides she was in general charge of affairs in the Garden, and it would be in order to ask her to come. Li Wan was at home correcting some of Jia Lans poems, when the maid came rushing frantically in and cried Mrs Zhu! Miss Lins dying! Everyone over there is in tears! Li Wan rose startled to her feet and without a word set off at once for the Naiads House, followed by her maids Candida and Casta. As she walked, she wept and lamented to herself When I think of all the times we have spent together - oh my poor cousin! So lovely, so gifted! There is hardly another like her. Only Frost Maiden and the Goddess of the Moon could rival her. How can she be leaving us at such a tender age, for that distant land from whence no travellers return And to think that because of Xi-fengs deceitful scheme, I have not been able to show myself at the Naiads House and have done nothing to show my sisterly affection! Oh the poor, dear girl! She was already at the gate of the Naiads House. There was no sound from within. She began to fret. I must be too late! She must have died already and they are resting between their lamentations. I wonder if her grave-clothes and coverlet are ready? She quickened her step and hurried on into the room. A young maid standing at the inner doorway had already seen her, and called out Mrs Zhu is here! Nightingale hurried out to meet her. How is she? asked Li Wan. Nightingale tried to answer but all she could muster was a choked sob. Tears poured down her cheeks like pearls from a broken, necklace, as she pointed silently to where Dai-yu lay.
Not so very long ago I saw Cook Lius daughter - Fivey I think her name is - and couldnt help noticing that shes the spitting image of Skybright. I thought of bringing her in to work for me, and her mother seemed agreeable to the idea. Then I thought what a good replacement shed make for Crimson in Bao-yus apartment. But Patience told me it was Lady Wangs policy not to take on any more pretty maids like Skybright for Bao-yu. So I dropped the idea. Now that hes married Im sure there can be no objection. Ill tell Fivey to start work here straight away. How would that be, Bao? Then if you ever find yourself missing Skybright, all you need to do is look at Fivey instead. Bao-yu had been about to leave the room, but at Xi-fengs mention of Fivey had stood there bemused. Aroma spoke for him Of course hed be pleased. Hes wanted her as a maid for a long while, but knew that Her Ladyship was against the idea. Very well then, Ill tell her to come tomorrow, said Xi-feng. And Ill square your mother mysel Bao-yus delight knew no bounds and he set off in high spirits for Grandmother Jias apartment, leaving Bao-chai to finish her toilet. Xi-feng had found the contrast between the way in which Bao-yu and Bao-chai clung to each other, and her own recent conflict with Jia Lian, somewhat depressing, and she was now anxious to leave. She rose and said to Bao-chai with a smile Shall we go and see Aunt Wang now? Still smiling she walked out of the room, and Bao-chai accompanied her. They went first to Grandmother Jias apartment, where they found Bao-yu informing the old lady of the proposed expedition to Uncle Wang Zi-shengs. Grandmother Jia nodded Off you go then. But dont drink too much, and be sure to come home early. Dont forget youre only just beginning to get well again. Yes, Grannie, said Bao-yu. He had no sooner reached the courtyard than he turned round and re-entered the room, walking over to Bao-chai and whispering something in her ear. She smiled Yes of course. Now be off with you! She hurried him on his way once more. Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and Bao-chai settled down to a conversation, but had barely exchanged three sentences when Ripple appeared The Young Master has sent Tealeaf back with a message for Mrs Bao. -1344 Bao-chai Whats he forgotten now? Ripple I told one of the junior maids to ask Tealeaf. The message is this The Young Master forgot to tell Mrs Bao something. She should not be too long if she is coming and if she isnt, then she should take care not to stand in a draught. Grandmother Jia, Xi-feng and the entire assembly of old serving-women and maidservants burst out laughing. Bao-chai blushed fiercely and said to Ripple with a scornful pfui Silly creature! Is that worth running back in such a fluster for? Ripple giggled and sent a junior maid to scold Tealeaf, who raced back to Bao-yu, calling to the maid over his shoulder The Young Master insisted on my dismounting to go on this fools errand. If I hadnt delivered his message Id have been in trouble with him, and now that I have I get it in the neck from them! The maid laughed and went running back to repeat this to the ladies. Grandmother Jia turned to Bao-chai Youd better go, my dear, or hell never stop fretting. What with this and Xi-fengs merciless teasing, Bao-chai felt too embarrassed to stay any longer. When Bao-chai had taken her leave, Perfecta, one of the nuns from the Convent of the Scattered Flowers, came to call on Grandmother Jia. She greeted Xi-feng also, and sat down to take tea. Why havent you been to see us for such a long while? asked Grandmother Jia. These past few days we have had so many services at the Convent, replied Perfecta, and so many grand ladies coming to make their devotions I just havent had a moment to call my own. Today I have a special reason for visiting Your Old Ladyship. We have a private service tomorrow which I thought you might possibly be interested in attending. What kind of service is it? asked Grandmother Jia. Last month, replied Perfecta, the household of the late Excellency Wang was afflicted with a possession of spirits.
Tomorrow you must tell your menfolk to make sure our carriages and horses are prepared well in advance. We dont want any last-minute panics. Yes, maam. Li Wans servants went about their business. Our story now turns to Shi Xiang-yun. Earlier, because of her husbands illness, she had only been able to come once to mourn for Grandmother Jia. She calculated now that there were two days left before the funeral procession was due to set off and since her husbands condition had been positively diagnosed as a consumption, and he was therefore in no immediate danger, she decided she must call once more. She came on the day before the final wake. She recalled all Grandmother Jias love for her, and then her thoughts turned to her own fate, to have married such a fine husband, a man of such grace and talent, of such a gentle disposition, only to watch him being taken from her slowly and inexorably by an illness whose roots must surely lie in some previous lifetime. She wept with renewed grief for most of that night, despite the persistent efforts of Faithful and the other maids to console her. Bao-yu was unbearably distressed by the sight of Xiang-yuns weeping, but could hardly go to comfort her in the midst of the ceremonial lamentations. The plain mourning-clothes she was wearing and the absence of any make-up seemed to make her even prettier than before her marriage. He looked round at Bao-qin and the other girls they too were plainly dressed, with a minimum of ornamentation. The very simplicity lent a charm and grace to their appearance. His eyes rested on Bao-chai how well mourning-clothes became her! She looked even more attractive than in her everyday attire. The men of old, mused Bao-yu to himself, used to say that of all flowers none could rival the splendour of plum-blossom, not for its early blooming but for the incomparable purity of its whiteness, the unsurpassable freshness and delicacy of its scent. If only Cousin Lin were here now, and dressed in a simple mourning gown, how exquisitely beautiful she would look! He felt a pang of grief, tears rolled down his cheeks, and he began sobbing loudly and unrestrainedly. It was a funeral after all, and no one would think such behaviour out of place. The ladies were already busy rallying Xiang-yun when suddenly they heard another familiar voice break out wailing on the outside of the screen. They surmised that both cousins were overwhelmed by memories of Grandmother Jias past love and kindness, and little guessed that Xiang-yun and Bao-yu each had private cause for grief. Their heart-felt lamentations soon brought tears to everyones eyes, and it fell to Aunt Xue and old Mrs Li to offer comfort and counsel moderation. The following day was the wake proper, and therefore busier than ever. Xi-feng was utterly exhausted, but there was nothing for it, she had to struggle on and muddle her way through the morning, even though she had by now lost her voice. By the afternoon, when the number of guests reached its peak and demands were being made on her from all quarters, she had reached breaking point and was searching in desperation for some second wind when a young maid came running in Here you are, maam! No wonder Lady Xing is so cross! So many guests, she said. I cant possibly take care of them. Where is Mrs Lian? Hiding somewhere with her feet up, Ill be bound! This unmerited rebuke provoked a sudden surge of indignation within Xi-feng. She struggled to control herself, but tears started to her eyes, and all went black before her. A sickly taste rose into her mouth and she began to vomit up quantities of bright red blood. The strength ebbed from her legs and she sank to the ground. Luckily Patience was at hand and hurried over to support her mistress as she crouched there, blood gushing from her mouth in an unstaunchable stream. To learn if she survived this crisis or not, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 111 A devoted maid renders a final service, and accompanies her mistress to the Great Void A villainous slave takes his revenge, and betrays his masters into the hands of thieves Patience hurried forward, and with the help of another maid she raised Xi-feng from the ground and gently escorted her to her room. There she laid her down with great care on the kang and told Crimson to bring a cup of hot water and hold it to her lips. Xi-feng drank a sip of the water and then sank into a heavy sleep. Autumn came briefly into the room, glanced at her lying there, and walked out again. Patience did not ask her to stay, but turned instead to Felicity who was standing at her side and said Go and tell Their Ladyships at once.
Back in the capital I heard that he invited a lot of women along to that very inn and that they were all there together getting drunk and causing quite a rumpus on the very evening when he beat this waiter to death. And I heard that the local mandarin was not the only one to do the family a favour. Apparently Mr Lian spent a small fortune on the case, and sent bribes to every yamen concerned, to try to get Mr Pan off. Its funny the Board hasnt mentioned that in its report. I suppose in one way its only to be expected. Now this affair has come to light, the people involved must all be busy covering up for each other. Theyre trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet. They want to make it seem like a minor case of negligence. Then the worst that can happen to them is that theyll lose their jobs. Theyd never want to admit to bribes being taken. Much too serious. Dont you worry about this one, sir, Ill get hold of the inside story. Wed best not keep the Viceroy waiting any longer ... You dont understand, said Jia Zheng. Its the local magistrate I feel sorry for. For doing us this favour, he has forfeited his job. And that may not even he the end of it for him. It wont do any good worrying about him, sir, said Li. Your attendants have been waiting for a long time. Youd best be going in to see the Viceroy now, sir. To learn what it was the Viceroy wanted of Jia Zheng, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 100 Caltrop disturbs an elaborate seduction and inspires bitter resentment Bao-yu learns of a distressing betrothal and laments an imminent departure Jia Zheng was with the Viceroy for a long time, and outside the yamen speculation mounted as to the reason for the summons. Li Ten, in the absence of any information, assumed that his master was wanted in connection with this latest trouble in the Gazette, and feared the worst. At last the interview was over, and Li hurried forward to meet Jia Zheng and accompany him home. He was too impatient to wait until their return, and as soon as they were alone he asked Jia Zheng What kept you so long, sir? Something of great importance, I suppose? Jia Zheng smiled. Not really. It turns out that the Commandant of the Haimen region, who has offered his sons hand in marriage to my daughter, is himself related to the Viceroy, and has written asking him to take a special interest in my well-being. The Viceroy was most affable, and even went so far as to say to me Now we are related too! Li rejoiced inwardly, seeing in this new turn of events cause to be bolder still in his own schemes. He encouraged Jia Zheng enthusiastically to proceed with the marriage. Communications between Kiangsi and the capital were slow, and it was hard for Jia Zheng to know whether or not he was personally implicated in Xue Pans troubles. At such a great distance it would be difficult for him to influence the course of events in Xue Pans favour. When he returned to his own yamen, he despatched a family servant to the capital to ascertain exactly what had happened, and at the same time to carry a message to Grandmother Jia, informing her of the marriage proposal. If she agreed, he suggested that Tan-chun should be sent straight away to join him, in preparation for the wedding. The servant set off with all speed for the capital. He reported first to Lady Wang, and then went to the Board of Civil Office, where his enquiries revealed that the only person to have suffered in the Xue Pan affair was the acting magistrate of Tai-ping, who had lost his job, and that Jia Zheng was not in any way implicated. The servant sent back a reassuring report to Jia Zheng, himself remaining behind to await further developments. It will be remembered to what lengths Aunt Xue had gone, and with what large sums of money she had bribed the various courts involved, to bring in a verdict of accidental homicide in the earlier stages of Xue Pans case. She had been proposing to raise the money for his fine by selling the family pawnshop business. Now when she heard of the new verdict brought by the Board of Punishments, she sent still more bribes, but to no avail. The sentence was confirmed--death by strangulation after the Autumn Assizes. Day and night she wept tears of grief and rage. Bao-chai visited her several times and tried to offer consolation Brother Pan must have been born under an unlucky star, Mama! With the fortune that Grandpa left, he should have been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. But instead its been one disaster after another.
CHAPTER 104 -1536 Drunken Dime at large again a small fish whips up a mighty storm Our Besotted Hero in agony once more a chance thrust quickens a numbed heart The temple you visited has just caught fire, sir! Jia Yu-cun turned round, to see flames leaping from the ground and a cloud of whirling ashes darkening the sky. How extraordinary! he thought to himself. I left the place only minutes ago, and have walked but this little distance. How could such a fire have started? What if old Mr Zhen has perished in it? To return and investigate would almost certainly make him late for the ferry. On the other hand he felt a little uneasy about not going back at all. After a moments thought, he asked the man Did you notice whether the old Taoist managed to escape or not? I was not far behind you, sir. I had a stomach-ache, and went for a bit of a stroll. That was when I looked back. When I saw the blaze and realized it was the temple that was on fire, I came here as fast as I could to let you know. I certainly didnt see anyone coming out of the flames. His twinge of conscience notwithstanding, Yu-cun was at heart a man who put his career first, and he felt insufficient concern to involve and inconvenience himself any further. Wait here until the fire has died down, he told the servant. Then go back and see if you can find any trace of the old man. Report to me directly. Yes, sir. Reluctantly the man stayed behind to carry out these instructions. J ia Yu-cun crossed the river and continued his tour of inspection, putting up for the night, a few stops later, at the official lodgings provided. Next morning, his duties were completed and he was greeted at one of the city gates by the usual throng of runners, who then escorted him through the streets with a great deal of noise and pomp. On the way, he heard from within his sedan one of the criers having some kind of altercation in the street, and asked what the trouble was. A man was dragged forward and deposited kneeling at the foot of the sedan. The crier himself then fell to his knees and gave the following account of the incident This drunkard, instead of keeping out of Your Honours way, came lurching right in front of your chair, sir. I told him to get off the road, but he answered back in a drunken and insolent manner, threw himself down on the ground in the middle of the street, and accused me of hitting him. J ia Yu-cun addressed the offender directly This entire district, as you know, is in my charge, and every one of its residents falls under my jurisdiction. You, sir, must have known this only too well, and must also have been aware of my presence in these parts. In your drunken state the very least you could have done was to keep out of my way. But instead you have polluted the highway with your obnoxious person, and have then had the effrontery to slander one of my men! Explain yourself! Paid fir the wine meself, din I? grumbled the man. An the grounds is Majestys, innit? is Majesty never said I couldnt sleep on it if Id adda few! Cant see what its gorra do with you, yerroner! Why, this fellow seems to consider himself completely above the law! snapped Jia Yu-cun angrily. Whats his name? Ni Er, replied the man. But they calls me the Drunken Diamond. Jia Yu-cun was not amused. Give this precious rogue a good thrashing, he ordered grimly, adding by way of a vicious pun That should soon cut him down to size! His attendants pinned Ni Er to the ground and administered a few hefty cracks of the whip. The pain soon cleared Dimes head, and he began begging abjectly for mercy. Yu-cun laughed loudly at him from his chair Diamond, indeed! All right, leave him alone for the present. Take him back to the yamen. We can question him at leisure there. There was a cry from the runners, who immediately bound Dime and dragged him along behind the chair, ignoring his continued pleas for mercy. Yu-cun went first to the Palace to report on his tour, and then returned to his yamen, where daily business soon engulfed him. He was too busy to give Dime another thought. But the bystanders who had witnessed the flogging in the street lost no time in telling the story to their friends, and the news soon spread that Ni Er the swank, Ni Er the drunken bully, had fallen foul of Mayor Jia and landed himself in deep water. Rumour of it eventually reached the ears of his wife and daughter, and that night when he failed to come home his daughter, fearing the worst, went to all the gambling-dens in search of him.
I have since then had this constantly in the forefront of my mind, but was reluctant to press the matter after my transfer to maritime defence in this remote region. That circumstances should have put such an obstacle in the way of our plans has been a source of great regret to me. Now that the light of your noble presence illumines these southern skies, however, that obstacle has been removed. I had been thinking to write and send you my felicitations, when I received your letter. From his bivouac an old soldier raises his hand in humble salute! Even on these distant shores, I feel myself basking in the genial warmth of your benevolence. Dare I hope for your consent if I now propose this alliance once more? My son was favoured, I recall, with your gracious approval, and we have long anticipated the great joy that your daughters charming presence would bring to our household. If you are kind enough to confirm your acceptance, I shall despatch a go-between without delay. Though the journey is a long one for your daughter, it can he accomplished by boat. And though I cannot offer much in the way of pomp and ceremony, I can at least send a suitably furnished barge to receive her. This brief missive carries my most sincere congratulations on your new appointment. In eager anticipation of your favourable response, believe me to be, honoured sir, your most humble and respectful servant, Zhou Qiong. Fate seems indeed to play a decisive role in affairs of matrimony, reflected Jia Zheng to himself after perusing the letter. I do remember suggesting this betrothal last year. There seemed to be several factors in its favour Zhou was taking up an appointment in the capital, he and I were old friends and both from Nanking families, and his son was a good-looking enough young man. It was only a casual suggestion, and I never mentioned it at home. Afterwards he was transferred to Maritime Defence and the matter was dropped. And yet now an unforeseeable stroke of fate has sent me here to the provinces, and Zhou has broached the subject once more. Theirs seems a suitable family, and I think it would be a good match for Tan-chun. But I am here on my own, and I shall have to write home to consult them first. He was still deliberating, when one of the gate-attendants came in with an official despatch summoning him to a conference with the Viceroy, and he had to set out at once for the Viceroys seat. After his arrival there, he was awaiting further instructions and sitting in his temporary lodgings, idly leafing through a pile of Peking Gazettes that lay on the table, when his eye was caught by a report from the Board of Punishments In the case of Xue Pan, travelling on business, registered domicile Nanking... Good heavens! exclaimed Jia Zheng in some alarm. Have they memorialized already? He read on more carefully. The gist of the report was that Xue Pan, having killed Zhang San in an affray, had connived with the relatives of the deceased and other eyewitnesses to get himself off on a charge of accidental homicide. Jia Zheng brought his hand down with a thump on the table. Hes done for! He read the report through to the end The Metropolitan Govemor has forwarded the following abstract of the case Xue Pan of Nanking, while travelling through the town of Tal-ping, stayed at Lis Inn. One of the waiters employed by Gaffer Li the proprietor was a certain Zhang San, with whom Xue was not previously acquainted. On the day of the month of the year , Xue Pan placed an order with the proprietor for some wine, as he had invited Wu Liang a native of Tai-ping to drink with him. When his guest came, he sent the waiter Zhang San to bring them the wine. The wine was sour, and Xue Pan told him to replace it with something better. Zhang San argued that since that particular wine had been ordered, it was impossible to change it. Xue Pan considered Zhangs behaviour insolent and raised his cup to throw the wine in his face. Unfortunately he exerted too much force and the cup slipped from his hand just as Zhang lowered his head to retrieve a chopstick from the ground. The cup struck Zhang on the top of the head, there was a substantial loss of blood, and he died shortly afterwards. Gaffer Li hurried to the scene but was too late to be of any help. He informed Mrs Zhang, nee Wang, the deceaseds mother, who came to the inn only to find her son already dead. She called Out the beadle and brought a plaint at the local yamen. The then acting magistrate held an inquest and the coroner completed the usual certificate. Two crucial facts were, however, omitted first, that the bregmatic fracture was one and one-third inches long and second, that Zhang had also sustained injuries in the small of the back.
It is not that I cant take the responsibility. It is just that Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian have arranged everything and the likes of us dont really know whats going on. In the circumstances, it seems only right to mention you and Miss Patience. Patience had already told Snowgoose to come out. Over the past few days Snowgoose had fallen rather into disfavour with Dai-yu, who had called her a silly, ignorant child, and her feelings of loyalty towards her mistress had as a consequence been rather blunted. Besides there was no question of her disobeying an order from Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. She therefore tidied her hair quickly and made ready to go. Patience told her to change into her smartest clothes and to go with Mrs Lin. Patience herself stayed on and spoke for a short while with Li Wan. Before she left, Li Wan instructed her to call in on Lins wife on her way and tell her that her husband should make the necessary preparations for Dai-yu with all possible speed. This Patience agreed to do and went on her way. As she turned a corner in the Garden, she caught sight of Lins wife walking ahead of her with Snowgoose and called to her to wait. I will take Snowgoose with me. You go and tell your husband to prepare Miss Lins things. I will report to Mrs Lian for you. Yes, Miss Patience, said Lins wife, and went on her errand. Patience then took Snowgoose to the bridal apartment, and reported there herself before going to see to her own affairs. When Snowgoose saw the wedding preparations in full swing and thought of Dai-yu lying at deaths door, she felt a pang of grief. But she dared not show her feelings in the presence of Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng. What can they want me for? she wondered. I must see what is going on. I know Bao-yu used to be head over heels in love with Miss Lin. And yet now he seems to have deserted her. I begin to wonder if this illness of his is genuine or just a pretence. He may have made the whole thing up so as to avoid upsetting Miss Lin. By pretending to lose his jade and acting like an idiot, perhaps he thinks he can put her off, and marry Miss Chai with a clear conscience? I must watch him closely, and see if he acts the fool when he sees me. Surely he wont keep up the pretence on his wedding-day? She slipped in and stood spying at the inner doorway. Now, though Bao-yus mind was still clouded from the loss of his jade, his sense of joy at the prospect of marrying Dai-yu - in his eyes the most blessed, the most wonderful thing that had happened in heaven or earth since time began - had caused a temporary resurgence of physical well-being, if not a full restoration of his mental faculties. Xi-fengs ingenious plan had had exactly the intended effect, and he was now counting the minutes till he should see Dai-yu. Today was the day when all his dreams were to come true, and he was filled with a feeling of ecstasy. He still occasionally let slip some tell-tale imbecile remark, but in other respects gave the appearance of having completely recovered. All this Snowgoose observed, and was filled with hatred for him and grief for her mistress. She knew nothing of the true cause of his joy While Snowgoose slipped away unobserved, Bao-yu told Aroma to hurry and dress him in his bridegrooms finery. He sat in Lady Wangs chamber, watching Xi-feng and You-shi bustling about their preparations, himself bursting with impatience for the great moment. If Cousin Lin is coming from the Garden, he asked Aroma, why all this fuss? Why isnt she here yet? Suppressing a smile, Aroma replied She has to wait for the propitious moment. Xi-feng turned to Lady Wang and said Because we are in mourning, we cannot have music in the street. But the traditional ceremony would seem so drab without any music at all, so I have told some of the women-servants with a bit of musical knowledge, the ones who used to look after the actresses, to come and play a little, to add a bit of a festive touch. Lady Wang nodded, and said she thought this a good idea. Presently the great bridal palanquin was born in through the main gate. The little ensemble of women-servants played, as it entered down an avenue of twelve pairs of palace-lanterns, creating a passably stylish impression. The Master of Ceremonies requested the bride to step out of her palanquin, and Bao-yu saw the Matron of Honour, all in red, lead out his bride, her face concealed by the bridal veil.
And now hes Scrimping on your own mothers funeral. Dont you think you ought to have a word with him about it, and make him see sense? Father would like nothing more than to have a nice funeral, said Qiao-jie. But things have changed. We havent enough money, so of course we have to be a bit careful. What about your own things? pursued Wang Ren relendessly. Surely youve something left yourself? It all went in the raid last year, said Qiao-jie. Ive got nothing left at all. Are you trying me on too? expostulated Wang Ren. I know that Lady Jia gave away all sorts of things. You ought to produce your share now. Qiao-jie could not bring herself to admit that her father had already taken her share and sold it, and so pretended not to understand what he was referring to. I know! exclaimed Wang. Youre keeping it for your trousseau! Qiao-jie refused to say another word. Wang Ren had already offended her with his remarks and she began to sob until she was almost choking with emotion. If you have anything else to say, sir, protested Patience heatedly, please wait until Mr Lian comes back. Miss Qiao-jie is much too young to understand. As for you, youve just been itching for my sister to die, havent you! sneered Wang Ren. The lot of you! So you could step into her shoes ... Im not asking for much just a decent funeral. Surely you dont want to disgrace your own family? He sat himself down in a surly fashion. Qiao-jie was feeling very miserable. I know Father does care, she was thinking to herself. And besides, when Mother was alive, Uncle Ren sneaked off with all sorts of stuff of hers himself, so hes got no right to complain. In her eyes Wang Ren was rather a despicable sort of person. He for his part secretly reckoned to himself that Xi-feng must have kept her own private hoard, and that despite the raid there was bound to be silver somewhere in her apartment - and a fair amount of it too. They probably think Ive come to Sponge, and the girl is trying to protect them. She wont be any use to me, the little wretch! He began to conceive an intense dislike for his niece. Jia Lian was far too busy trying to rustle up money for the funeral to take in all these complications. He had delegated the outer formalities to Lai Da, but he still needed a lot of money for the inner reception and could not see how he was going to find it. Patience was aware of his predicament. You mustnt overdo things, sir, she urged him. Youll only make yourself ill. Ill! exclaimed Jia Lian, somewhat histrionically. Thats the least of my worries! We cant even find the money to get by from day to day, let alone pay for the funeral. And to make matters worse, now Ive got this idiot round my neck! Theres really no need to work yourself into such a state, sir, said Patience. If youve no money, Ive a few things that were not taken in the raid. Use them if you like. What a wonderful stroke of luck! thought Jia Lian to himself. He smiled at Patience That would be a real help. It would save me from having to race around trying to raise the money. Ill pay you back as soon as I can. Whatever I have was given me by Mrs Lian in the first place, said Patience. So theres really no need to pay me back. I just want the funeral to be done properly, thats all. Jia Lian accepted Patiences offer with sincere gratitude, and pawned her belongings for the funeral expenses. From then on he made a point of discussing everything with her. Autumn was most put out, and took every opportunity to mutter complaints Now that Mrs Lian is gone, Patience thinks she can take over. The Master gave me to Mr Lian how can Patience think to climb above me? Patience noticed Autumns disgruntled attitude, but paid no attention. Jia Lian, for his part, found Autumns resentment which he observed soon enough most objectionable, and whenever anything happened to annoy him he vented his bad humour on her. Lady Xing criticized him for this, and he felt obliged to restrain himself. But of this no more. In due course, after Xi-fengs encoffined corpse had been laid out for ten days, it was escorted to the temple. Jia Zheng was still in mourning for Grandmother Jia and was confined to his study during the period of Xi-fengs funeral.
Our kind of love, yours and mine, is the former, natural state. It is like a bud. Once open, it ceases to be true love. Faithfuls soul signalled understanding with a nod, and followed Qin Ke-qing. When the wake was over, Ladies Xing and Wang began giving instructions to those of the servants who were staying behind to look after the house, and Amber went in search of Faithful to ask her whether their carriages had been hired for the next day. She looked in vain in the outer room of Grandmother Jias apartment, and then she noticed that the door to the inner room was on the latch, and putting her eye to the crack peered through into the half-lit interior. A flickering lamp filled the room with eerie shadows. No sound could be heard from inside and she retraced her steps, saying to herself Where can the wretched girl have disappeared to? On her way out she bumped into Pearl. Have you seen Faithful? she asked. No, replied Pearl. Ive been looking myself. Their Ladyships want to speak to her. Most probably shes fallen asleep in the inner room. Ive just had a look - she didnt seem to be there, said Amber. The lamp needs trimming, and its awfully dark and spooky inside. I didnt actually go inside. Shall we go in together and look properly? The two maids entered the room. First they trimmed the lamp. Who put this footstool here? exclaimed Pearl. I nearly tripped over it. As she spoke she looked upwards and let out a horrified cry. Aio! She fell back and collided with Amber, who looked up in turn, screamed and stood rooted to the spot. Their cries were soon heard, and other maids came running into the room. There were more shrieks of horror, and word was sent at once to Ladies Xing and Wang. When Lady Wang and Bao-chai heard the news, they both burst into tears and set off to Grandmother Jias apartment to see for themselves. I never thought Faithful had it in her to do this! exclaimed Lady Xing. Send someone at once to inform Sir Zheng. Bao-yu stood dumbfounded, an expression of glazed horror in his eyes. Aroma and his other maids rallied him Cry if you must, but dont bottle it up like this! Finally he managed to emit a piercing wail. What a rare girl Faithful was to ch6ose such a death! he had been thinking to himself. The purest essence of the universe is truly concentrated in her sex! She has found a fitting and noble death. We, Grandmothers own grandchildren, are despicable by comparison. We have shown ourselves less devoted than her maid. He found something strangely comforting in this thought, and by the time Bao-chai had come to his side to soothe his tears, he was smiling again. Oh dear! cried Aroma. Mr Baos going mad again! Its nothing to worry about, Bao-chai reassured her. No doubt he has his reasons. Bao-yu was pleased to hear Bao-chai say this. Perhaps she really does understand me, he thought to himsel If so, she is the only one. He was drifting off into some other fantastic reverie when Jia Zheng arrived. Faithful is a commendable child! exclaimed Jia Zheng with a sincere sigh of admiration. Lady Jias love for her was not in vain! He turned to Jia Lian Send someone to buy her a coffin, and lay her in it this very night. Tomorrow her remains can be conveyed together with Mothers, and her coffin can lie in state behind that of her mistress. In this way her noble act can be carried to a fitting conclusion. Jia Lian went out to execute these instructions, and gave orders for Faithfuls body to be let down and laid out in Grandmother Jias inner room. When Patience heard the news of Faithfuls suicide, she came with Oriole and a whole crowd of other maids and they all wept bitterly before Faithfuls body. The occasion caused Nightingale to think of her own future and the precariousness of her present situation, and she regretted that she herself had not chosen Faithfuls path and followed Dai-yu to the grave. By so doing she would at least have fulfilled her duty as a maid and died a noble death. In Bao-yus apartment she was doing little more than marking time. Although he was very considerate and affectionate towards her, she knew that nothing would ever come of it. All these thoughts added a note of personal grief to her lamentations. Lady Wang sent at once for Faithfuls sister-in-law. She told her to supervise the encoffinment, and after consulting with Lady Xing, issued her an allowance of one hundred taels from Grandmother Jias fund.
The monk returned the salutation and sat down. Jia Lian thought himself apprehensively Now he wont budge till hes been paid... Jia Zheng scrutinized the monk. It was not, he concluded, one the two he had seen on the previous occasion. From which holy establishment do you hail? he enquired. And what pray is your reverends own name in religion? Where did obtain my sons stone talisman? How is it that the sight of it cured him so quickly? The monk greeted this stream of questions with an inscrutable smile Dont ask me. I have not the slightest idea. Just give me my thousand taels, and well call it a day. Jia Zheng could see he was dealing with rather a brusque sort of fellow, and was nervous of offending him The money? Why yes, of course you shall have it ... Id like it now. Im in a hurry. Please be seated for a moment, while I go in and see whether it is ready. Youd better get a move on. Jia Zheng went in to the others. He said nothing of his interview with the monk but went straight to the kang where Bao-yu was lying. When Bao-yu saw his father coming, he tried to raise himself up, but was too weak to do so. Lady Wang held him down and told him on no account to move, while Bao-yu smiled from where he lay and handed the jade to his father, with the words You see, Bao-yu has returned! J ia Zheng was aware of the Stones reputedly supernatural properties. He glanced at it and said to Lady Wang Now that Bao-yu has recovered consciousness, how are we to pay the monk? Pawn everything I own! replied Lady Wang at once. That should be enough. I hardly think he wants money, put in Bao-yu. Do you? Jia Zheng nodded thoughtfully I thought it rather strange, I must say. But he absolutely insists. You must go out and entertain him, said Lady Wang. Well see what we can do. As Jia Zheng went out, Bao-yu began clamouring for food. First he consumed a bowl of congee and then he demanded some rice, which the old women even brought him. But Lady Wang forbade him to eat it. Itll be perfectly all right, protested Bao-yu. Im better now. He leant forwards and promptly tucked into a bowl of rice. His spirits seemed greatly revived. He wanted to sit up properly, and Musk came forward and supported him gently. Carried away by her excitement at his recovery she blurted out What a treasure that Stone of yours is! Just seeing it has made you better! Thank goodness you never managed to smash it to pieces! Her words caused a sudden change to come over Bao-yus face. He threw the Stone aside and slumped back. But to learn if he survived, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 116 Human destinies are reveald in a fairy realm, and the Stone is restored to its rightful owner Mortal remains are transported to their terrestrial home, and duty is discharged by a filial son Musks untimely reference to a sensitive episode from the past sent Bao-yu into a sudden swoon and he slumped back onto his bed once more. Lady Wang and the assembled family broke into a fresh bout of wailing and weeping, while Musk herself, realizing that her thoughtlessness was to blame for this terrible turn though Lady Wang had not yet had time to scold her, began to weep and at the same time made a desperate resolution If Bao-yu dies, I shall take my own life and die with him! Lady Wang could see that this time none of their efforts to rouse Bao-yu was having any effect, and sent an urgent message to the monk, begging him to come to the rescue again. But the monk was nowhere to be seen. Jia Zheng had returned earlier to the hall, only to find that his eccentric guest had vanished into thin air. This fresh outcry from the inner apartment now reached Jia Zhengs ears and he hurried back, to find Bao-yu unconscious again, teeth clenched and with no trace of a pulse. He felt his chest, and finding it still quite warm, sent in desperation for a doctor, to attempt resuscitation by forcing down a draught of some kind. But Bao-yus spirit had already quit its mortal frame. Then that means he was dead, you say? The exact situation, dear Reader, was as follows the spirit had flitted in its incorporeal fashion out to reception hall, where it saw the jade-bearing monk and saluted him with a bow. The monk hurriedly rose to his feet, grasped the spirit the hand and set off. Bao-yu spirit followed, light as a leaf drifting the breeze.
Come on, Dumbo! he protested. Be fair! I never called you names! Drink a forfeit, theres a boy! Dumbo, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, willingly complied. They all had a few more cups, and in the general state of intoxication Dumbo let fly a few barbed remarks about his sister Lady Xing, while Wang Ren had a go at desecrating the memory of his Xi-feng, both of them evincing great bitterness. Their example and the wine lent Jia Huan a little courage, and he too had his fling, complaining how heartless Xi-feng had been, and how she had tried to ruin so many of their lives. Yes, people ought to show a bit of common decency, they all agreed. The way she used Lady Jias influence to bully everyone was dreadful. Well, she died without giving birth to an heir she only ever had a daughter. Retribution in her own lifetime! Jia Yun, who remembered only too well how harsh Xi-feng had once been towards him, and how Qiao-jie had started bawling the instant she set eyes on him, allowed himself to wade into the general melee with some abuse of his own about the two of them. Jia Qiang tried to steer the party in a less vindictive direction Come on! Drink up! This gossip will get us nowhere! How old is the young lady you mentioned? enquired the two Singsong girls. Is she pretty? Oh yes, replied Jia Qiang. Extremely so. Shes about thirteen. What a pity, in that case, that she was born into a family like yours! the girls exclaimed. If 9nly she came from a more humble home, she could soon find herself in a position to bring all her family lots of jobs, and pots of money into the bargain! What do you mean? We know of a certain Mongol prince, replied the girls. Quite a ladies man he is. He is looking for a concubine, and the lady who fits the bill would be able to take her whole family along with her to live in the palace. What a marvellous stroke of luck that would be for somebody! None of them seemed to take much notice of this, except for Wang Ren, who looked very thoughtful. For the present he said nothing and continued drinking. A little later two young lads came in, younger sons of Stewards Lai and Lin. You seem to be having a fine time of it, sirs, by the looks of things! they exclaimed. Everyone rose to greet them. Why have the two of you been such a long time? Weve been expecting you for ages. They explained Early this morning we heard rather a disturbing rumour that out family was in some sort of official trouble again, so we hurried out to see what news we could glean at the Palace. It turned out to have nothing to do with our family after all. In that case, why didnt you come straight here afterwards? It wasnt exactly our family, but it was connected with us. It was that Mr Jia Yu-cun. When we were at the Palace we saw him bound in chains. They told us he was being taken to the High Court for questioning. We knew he was a frequent visitor here, and were afraid that the case might somehow involve us, so we followed them to see what happened. Good thinking, my man! exclaimed Jia Yun. We are most obliged to you. Sit down and have a drink, and then tell us all about it. The two sat down after a polite show of reluctance, and as they drank continued This Mr Yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow, and knows how to pull strings. Hed done extremely well until recently, in fact but greed was his downfall. There were several charges brought against him, avarice and extortion being two of them. As we all know, our present August Sovereign is exceptionally wise, compassionate and benevolent. There is one thing that stirs his wrath, however, and that is corruption, any form of tyrannical or bullying behaviour. So His Majesty decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial. If he is found guilty, things will look pretty grim for him if he is acquitted, then the men who brought the charges will be in for trouble. It is certainly comforting to think what just times we live in! For those lucky enough to be officials in the first place! Like your elder brother, said one of the company, referring to Steward Lais eldest son, Lai Shang-rong. Hes a county magistrate. Done very nicely for himself. True enough, replied young Lal. But his conduct still leaves a lot to be desired, Im afraid. He may not last long at this rate.
But she turned out to be quite helpless, and only made Nightingale more distraught than before. Suddenly she thought of someone else she could turn to, and sent one of the younger maids to fetch her with all speed. Her choice might seem a strange one but Nightingale reasoned that as a widow, Li Wan would certainly be excluded from Bao-yus wedding festivities. Besides she was in general charge of affairs in the Garden, and it would be in order to ask her to come. Li Wan was at home correcting some of Jia Lans poems, when the maid came rushing frantically in and cried Mrs Zhu! Miss Lins dying! Everyone over there is in tears! Li Wan rose startled to her feet and without a word set off at once for the Naiads House, followed by her maids Candida and Casta. As she walked, she wept and lamented to herself When I think of all the times we have spent together - oh my poor cousin! So lovely, so gifted! There is hardly another like her. Only Frost Maiden and the Goddess of the Moon could rival her. How can she be leaving us at such a tender age, for that distant land from whence no travellers return And to think that because of Xi-fengs deceitful scheme, I have not been able to show myself at the Naiads House and have done nothing to show my sisterly affection! Oh the poor, dear girl! She was already at the gate of the Naiads House. There was no sound from within. She began to fret. I must be too late! She must have died already and they are resting between their lamentations. I wonder if her grave-clothes and coverlet are ready? She quickened her step and hurried on into the room. A young maid standing at the inner doorway had already seen her, and called out Mrs Zhu is here! Nightingale hurried out to meet her. How is she? asked Li Wan. Nightingale tried to answer but all she could muster was a choked sob. Tears poured down her cheeks like pearls from a broken, necklace, as she pointed silently to where Dai-yu lay. Realizing With a pang what Nightingales pitiable condition must portend, Li Wan asked no more, but went over at once to see for herself. Dai-yu no longer had the strength to speak. When Li Wan said her name a few times, her eyes opened a slit as if in recognition of the voice. But her eyelids and lips could only make a trembling suggestion of a movement. Although she still breathed, it was now more than she could manage to utter a single word, or shed a single tear. Li Wan turned around and saw that Nightingale was no longer in the room. She asked Snowgoose where she was, and Snowgoose replied In the outer room. Li Wan hurried out, to find Nightingale lying on the empty bed, her face a ghastly green, her eyes closed, tears streaming down her cheeks. Where her head lay on the embroidered pillow, with its border of fine brocade, was a patch the size of a small plate, wet with her tears and the copious effusions of her nose. When Li Wan called to her, she opened her eyes slowly, and raised herself slightly on the bed. Silly girl! Li Wan upbraided her. Is this a time for tears? Fetch Miss Lins grave-clothes and dress her in them. Are you going to leave it till it is too late? Would you have her go naked from the world? Would you ruin her honour? This released a fresh flood of tears on Nightingales part. Li Wan wept herself, fretfully wiping her eyes and patting Nightingale on the shoulder. Dear girl! Look how you are upsetting me now, and making me cry. Hurry and get her things ready. If we delay much longer, it will all be over. They were in this state of trepidation, when they heard footsteps outside, and someone came running into the room in a great flurry, causing Li Wan to start back in alarm. It was Patience. When she saw their tear-stained faces, she stopped abruptly and stared at them aghast for a while. Why arent you over there? asked Li Wan. What do you want here? As she spoke, Steward Lins wife also came into the room. Patience answered Mrs Lian was worried, and sent me to see how things were. As you are here, Mrs Zhu, I can tell her to set her mind at rest. Li Wan nodded. Patience went on I should like to see Miss Lin myself. So saying, she walked into Dai-yus bed-chamber, with tears on her cheeks. Li Wan turned to Steward Lins wife and said You have come just in time.
They related the story of Dimes arrest, and begged Jia Yun to help them secure his release. Of course! agreed Jia Yun without the slightest hesitation. No 3 trouble at all. Ill drop in at Rong-guo House, mention it to them, and the matter will soon be settled. This Mayor Jia owes everything to his connection with the Rong-guo Jias. One word from them and Dime will be a free man again! Dimes wife and daughter returned home in high spirits and with great expectations. They went to visit Dime in the yamen where he was being held prisoner, and told him the good news, that thanks to 3 the intervention of Jia Yun and the Jia family he would shortly be set free. Dime was greatly relieved. Unfortunately Jia Yun, having had his previous overtures rebuffed by Xi-feng, had been too cowed to visit her again, and since that day had hardly set foot inside Rong-guo House. The men on the Rongguo gate treated callers strictly according to their standing with the family. If the family were known to have received a person with cordiality and respect, that person was welcomed and announced immediately if on the other hand, a person had once been cold- shouldered, the servants were quick to take their cue. If such a person called again, even if he were a relative, they would refuse to report his arrival and would send him away without more ado. So, when Jia Yun turned up and asked to pay his respects to Jia Lian, he got a very cool reception at the gate Mr Lian is not in. When he comes home, we will inform him that you called. Jia Yun would have persisted and asked to see Mrs Lian, but he was afraid to provoke the gatemen any further, and with some reluctance turned about and went home. He had to face renewed importuning from Dimes wife and daughter the next day But Mr Yun! We thought you said the Jias could get anything they wanted out of anyone! Youre one of the family, and this isnt a big thing to ask. You cant have failed! You cant let us down like this! Jia Yun felt thoroughly humiliated, and tried to bluff his way out Yesterday my relatives were too busy to send anyone. But Im sure they will do something about it today, and then Dime will be set free. Theres really no need to worry. Dimes wife and daughter waited to see how things would turn out. Jia Yun, having failed to gain access by the front entrance of Rong-guo House, now tried the back, thinking he might be able to get in touch with Bao-yu in the Garden. To his surprise he found the garden gate locked, and was obliged to return home once more, dejected and crestfallen. It was only a few years ago that Dime lent me that money, he thought to himself. I used it to buy Mrs Lian a present of camphor and musk, and as a result she gave me the tree-planting job. But this time, just because I cant afford presents, I get the brush-off. Shes got nothing to be proud of lending out money - money thats been handed down in the family - while poor householders like us cant even borrow a tael when we need it. I suppose she thinks shes being clever, that this is a nice little nest-egg, a clever way to protect her own future. She doesnt know what a stinking reputation shes earned for herself. If I keep my mouth shut, well and good but if I tell people what I know, shell have more than one life to answer for in court! He found Dimes wife and daughter waiting for him when he got back, and this time he had to admit, albeit in a modified form, that his mission had not borne fruit The Jias did send someone to put in a word for Dime, but Im afraid Mayor Jia wont set him free. You might have more luck if you try Mr Leng Zi-xing. Hes related to Mrs Zhou, and she works for the Jias. What earthly good will a servant be, complained Dimes family, when a respectable member of the family such as yourself can do nothing for us! Jia Yun found this highly mortifying. What you dont seem to realize, he protested indignantly, is that nowadays servants can have more pull than their masters! Dimes wife and daughter could see that they were wasting their time with him. Were much obliged to you for all the trouble youve gone to, Mr Yun, they muttered sarcastically. When Father gets out hes sure to want to thank you himself... They went their way. Eventually they found somebody else to assist in the extrication of Dime, who was duly acquitted and released, having suffered no more by way of punishment than a few strokes of the rod.
That was your servants doing. You will have to be more cautious in future. Although you have escaped with your own property intact this time, if His Majesty should ever have occasion to question your integrity again, it might be considerably less pleasant for you. Jia Zheng seemed greatly perturbed by this. What do you mean? In what way was my reputation tarnished? There is of course no shred of material evidence, came the reply, but we have heard others say that during your time as Grain Intendant you instructed your servants to practise extortion. As Heaven is my witness, exclaimed Jia Zheng, no such thought even entered my head! My men were cheating and bullying behind my back. Any more of this sort of gossip and I shall be finished! Its no use fretting about the past, commented one of the company. But you should examine your present staff carefully. Weed out any refractory elements among them and deal with them severely. At that moment one of the janitors entered the room Sir Shes son-in-law, Mr Sun, has sent a servant with a message, sir. His master is too busy to come in person. This man is instructed to inform you that the Suns are expecting you to discharge Sir Shes debts. Jia Zheng looked gloomy and harassed, and gave a perfunctory acknowledgement. His friends laughed contemptuously This Mr Sun has a bad reputation and it certainly seems well founded. When his father-in-law has his home raided and his property confiscated, so far from offering assistance, he comes hounding him for money. Its preposterous! Lets not talk of him, replied Jia Zheng. That whole match was a blunder on my elder brothers part. I should have thought my poor niece had suffered enough at this young mans hands, without his having to torment me as well. As he was speaking, Xue Ke appeared. I have learned, he reported to Jia Zheng, that Commissioner Zhao is insisting on pursuing every detail of the indictment. I am afraid that Uncle She and Cousin Zhen will have a hard time of it. You must seek the princes help in this matter, Jia Zhengs friends advised him. Without his intervention, you may all be ruined. Jia Zheng thanked his visitors for their advice, which he said he would be sure to follow, and they all took their leave. It was already lighting-up time, and Jia Zheng went to pay his evening respects to Grandmother Jia, who seemed slightly recovered. He returned to his apartment, and sat once more silently brooding over Jia Lian and Xi-fengs reckless behaviour. Their usury, now that it had come to light, would damage the whole family and he blamed them bitterly for it. But he reflected also that Xi-feng was gravely ill, and had lost everything in the raid, which was sure to have been a great additional blow to her, and decided not to criticize her for the time being, but to contain his anger and say nothing. The rest of that night passed without further event. Early next morning Jia Zheng went to the Palace to give thanks for the Emperors clemency, and afterwards to the palaces of the Prince of Bei-jing and the Prince of Xi-ping, where he kowtowed to them and begged them to intervene on behalf of Jia She and Cousin Zhen. The princes spoke reassuringly in reply. Jia Zheng went on to visit other friends and colleagues to enlist their support. Our narrative turns to Jia Lian. He ascertained, from his enquiries in official quarters, that his father and Cousin Zhen were indeed facing a serious charge and seeing that there was nothing he could do to help, returned despondently home. In his apartment, Patience sat weeping and watching by Xi-fengs bedside, while Autumn could be heard in the side-room grumbling to herself. When Jia Lian came close to Xi-feng and saw how feeble she was, he could not bring himself to vent his resentment on her. Patience said to him with tears in her eyes Everythings gone! Well never get any of it back. And look at Mrs Lian, sir. You must send for a doctor. Psh! spat Lian bitterly. Im only alive by the skin of my teeth do you expect me to bother on her behalf? These words did not escape Xi-feng, and she opened her eyes and looked at Jia Lian in silence. Tears began to trickle down her cheeks. Jia Lian walked out of the room, and Xi-feng said to Patience You must be more realistic! Now things have come to this, you must put me out of your mind. I only wish I could die today and have done with it! If I still mean anything to you, then the one thing I beg of you is to look after little Qiao-jie when Im gone.
And has she definitely received your permission? If so, if it is real, then there is something further I should like to tell you, Mother. But if it is still not settled, I shall keep what I know to myself. What a peculiar way to talk! exclaimed Xi-chun. If I were not in earnest, do you honestly think I would have been able to convince my aunts? I feel the same way as Nightingale if they will let me do as I wish, I shall count myself blessed if they will not, I should rather die than continue living my present life! So, theres nothing to fear. Whatever you have to say, just go ahead and say it. If I do tell you this, its hardly divulging a secret, said Bao-yu, since it refers to something already predestined. I want you all to listen while I recite a poem. Honestly! they chided him. At a moment like this, with real people really suffering, all you can think about is poetry! Its sickening! Its not something of my own. Its a poem I once saw somewhere. Id like you to listen to it. Oh very well. Hurry up then. Enough of your prattling! Bao-yu did not try to explain himself any further, hut began to recite When you see through the spring scenes transient state, A nuns black habit shall replace your own. Alas, that daughter of so great a house By Buddhas altar lamp should sleep alone! Li Wan and Bao-chai both cried out in alarm Lord save us! Hes bewitched! Lady Wang shook her head and sighed Bao-yu, where on earth did you see this poem? Bao-yu was reluctant to say any more, and replied Please dont ask, Mother. Just take my word for it. As the meaning of the poem gradually sank in, Lady Wang began sobbing again You said you were joking the other day, when you talked of becoming a monk yourself. And now this poem all of a sudden! Enough! I understand. What am I to do? There is nothing I can do, but let you go your own ways. If only you could have waited till I was dead and gone! Then you could all have done as you pleased! Bao-chai tried to console her, but was in no fit state to do so. The pain she herself felt was like a knife-wound piercing her heart, and eventually she broke down and burst into tears. Aroma was faint with weeping and had to be supported by Ripple. Bao-yu did not shed a single tear, nor did he try to offer them any solace. He maintained a total silence. Jia Lan and Jia Huan had already left, and it fell to Li Wan to do what she could to save the situation Im sure it 5 simply that Bao-yu is too upset by this decision of Xi-chuns to know what he is saying. We should not take it seriously. Nightingale must receive an answer, though we must let her stand up. Is she to be granted her request or not? What difference does it make? replied Lady Wang. Her mind is clearly made up in any case, and when a persons mind is made up theres no stopping them. No doubt Bao-yu will tell us that this decision of Nightingales is predestined too. Nightingale kowtowed, and Xi-chun thanked Lady Wang. Nightingale also kowtowed to Bao-yu and Bao-chai. Amida Buddha! exclaimed Bao-yu piously. How noble! How rare! I never thought that you would be the first of us to be saved! Bao-chais self-control failed her again, and Aroma, heedless of Lady Wangs presence, burst out sobbing and cried I want to go with Miss Xi-chun too, and spend the rest of my life in prayer! Bao-yu smiled Yours is also a fine aspiration. But alas, a life of seclusion has not been decreed you by fate. Then I would rather die! sobbed Aroma. Despite his new-found detachment, Bao-yu could not help being moved by this declaration. But he said nothing. It was already three oclock in the morning, and he suggested to his mother that she should retire for the night. Li Wan went back to her apartment, and Landscape escorted Xi-chun to her room, where she continued to wait on her for the time being. Husbands were eventually found for each of Xi-chuns maids, and Nightingale spent the rest of her days faithfully serving her. But we anticipate. J ia Zheng, meanwhile, was on his way south with Grandmother Jias coffin, and had run into an army convoy returning to the capital after the victorious completion of a campaign.
Nightingale, anxious lest she burn these too, leaned up against Dai-yu and freeing one hand, reached out with it to take hold of them. But before she could do so, Dai-yu had picked them up again and dropped them in the flames. The brazier was out of Nightingales reach, and there was nothing she could do but look on helplessly. Just at that moment Snowgoose came in with the stand. She saw Dai-yu drop something into the fire, and without knowing what it was, rushed forward to try and save it. The manuscripts had caught at once and were already ablaze. Heedless of - the danger to her hands, Snowgoose reached into the flames and pulled out what she could, throwing the paper on the floor and stamping frantically on it. But the fire had done its work, and only a few charred fragments remained. Dai-yu closed her eyes and slumped back, almost causing Nightingale to topple over with her. Nightingale, her heart thumping in great agitation, called Snowgoose over to help her settle Dai-yu down again. It was too late now to send for anyone. And yet, what if Dai-yu should die during the night, and the only people there were Snowgoose, herself and the one or two other junior maids in the Naiads House? They passed a restless night. Morning came at last, and Dai-yu seemed a little more comfortable. -But after breakfast she suddenly began coughing and vomiting, and became tense and feverish again. Nightingale could see that she had reached a crisis. She called Snowgoose and the other juniors in and told them to mount watch, while she went to report to Grandmother Jia. But when she reached Grandmother Jias apartment, she found it almost deserted. Only a few old nannies and charladies were there, keeping an eye. Where is Her Old Ladyship? asked Nightingale. We dont know, came the reply in chorus. That was very odd, thought Nightingale. She went into Bao-yus room and found that too quite empty, save for a single maid who answered with the same Dont know. By now Nightingale had more or less guessed the truth. How could they be so heartless and so cruel? And to think that not a soul had come to visit Dai-yu during the past few days! As the bitterness of it struck her with full force, she felt a great wave of resentment break out within her, and turned abruptly to go. I shall go and find Bao-yu, and see how he is faring! I wonder how he will manage to brazen it out in front of me! I remember last year, when I made up that story about Miss Lin going back to the South, he fell sick with despair. To think that now he should be openly doing a thing like this! Men must have hearts as cold as ice or snow. What hateful creatures they are! She was already at Green Delights, and found the court-yard gate ajar. All was quiet within. Suddenly she realized Of course! If he is getting married, he will have a new apartment. But where? She was looking around her in uncertainty, when she saw Bao-yus page boy Inky rush past, and called to him to stop. He came over, and with a broad smile asked What are you doing here, Miss Nightingale? I heard that Master Bao was getting married, replied Nightingale, and I wanted to watch some of the fun. But I can see Ive come to the wrong place. And I dont know when the wedding is taking place, either. If I tell you, said Inky in a confidential tone, you must promise not to tell Snowgoose. Weve been given orders not to let any of you know. The weddings to be tonight. Of course its not being held here. The Master told Mr Lian to set aside another apartment. Whats the matter? continued Inky, after a pause. Nothing, replied Nightingale. You can go now. Inky rushed off again. Nightingale stood there for a while, lost in thought. Suddenly she remembered Dai-yu. She might already be dead! Her eyes filled with tears, and clenching her teeth, she said fiercely Bao-yu! If she dies, you may think you can wash your hands of her in this callous way but when you are happily married, and have your hearts desire, you neednt think you can look me in the face again! As she walked, she began to weep. She made her way, sobbing pitifully, across the Garden. She was not far from the Naiads House, when she saw two junior maids standing at the gate, peeping out nervously.
Once she is installed, everything will be all right, have no fear. Her grandmother has given her consent, and her uncle Wang Ren is acting as go-between. The ladies agreed to co-operate. Jia Yun went to give Lady Xing the latest news, and informed Lady Wang of the match. Li Wan and Bao-chai had no inkling of the truth and received the news of the princely wedding with pleasure. On the day appointed, several splendidly attired palace ladies arrived, and were received and entertained for a while by Lady Xing. They were soon aware that the lady with whom they were dealing was of considerable rank, and were most respectful towards her. As the terms of the transaction had not been finally agreed upon, Lady Xing had said nothing to Qiao-jie but had merely informed her that some relatives had come to call and asked her to go out and see them. Qiao-jie, who was little more than a child, and too young to suspect anything, went with her old nanny and Patience, who felt a little uneasy and insisted on accompanying her charge. The minute Qiao-jie entered the room the two palace ladies began subjecting her to a penetrating scrutiny, ogling her entire person, top to toe. They then rose to their feet, took her by the hand and looked her over once more, after which they sat down again for a few minutes and then left. Qiao-jie was most embarrassed by all this staring, and when she returned to her room she sat puzzling it over to herself. She could not recall ever having seen these relatives before, and said as much to Patience, who for her part, as soon as she had seen the way the two women were carrying on, had guessed the truth. Theyre obviously examining her with a view to marriage, she thought to herself. But with Mr Lian away from home, the responsibility for this rests with Lady Xing, and Ive no idea which family is involved. A family of the same rank as ours would never go in for all this staring. Anyway, those women didnt look as if they came from one of the royal princely establishments. There was something rather outlandish about them. Id better not say anything to Qiao-jie for the present, but wait until I know more myself. Patience set about discovering the truth of the matter, and since the maids and serving-women concerned had all worked under her at one time or another in the past, they were well disposed and immediately gave her the information she wanted. She was horrified, and racked her brains for some means of averting this catastrophe. She still thought it wiser to say nothing to Qiao-jie, but hurried over to inform Li Wan and Bao-chai, begging them to lay the matter before Lady Wang. Lady Wang herself had already sensed that there was something amiss, and had said as much to Lady Xing. But Lady Xing was quite taken in by her brother and Wang Ren, and instead of paying any heed to Lady Wangs words, rather suspected some ulterior motive in her opposition to the scheme. The girl is of age, she replied. With Lian away from home, the decision in this matter is mine. And besides, my brother and the girls own uncle have both looked into it thoroughly. Surely they know the truth. I am very much in favour of the idea. And you neednt worry if anything should go wrong, Lian and I are not going to start laying the blame at your door. Lady Wang made some perfunctory reply, but was secretly furious with Lady Xing. She took her leave and went back to tell Bao-chai what had been decided. She wept as she spoke, and Bao-yu tried to console her. Mother, dont distress yoursel Nothing will come of this scheme. Whatever happens is already written in Qiao-jies destiny anyway, so please dont try to interfere. Dont be such an idiot! exclaimed Lady Wang. Once theyve agreed to this match, theyll be here any day to fetch her away! Patience is right, your cousin Lian will blame me for this when he comes back! I would want the best for any member of the family, and especially for Qiao-jie, for her parents sake. Think of the other girls. We arranged Xiu-yans marriage to your cousin Ke, and now look how happy they are together! And the Mei family into which Bao-qin has married are by all accounts very comfortably off, so theres no need to worry about her. Xiang-yun, I know, has not been quite so fortunate. That match was her own uncles idea in the first place, and it would have turned out well if her husband had not fallen ill of a consumption and died.
Whod ever say such a thing? Jia Lian Its no less than he deserves! I may as well tell you the truth, so that you can see for yourself what sort of a brother you really have. What about this birthday party hes giving for Uncle Zisheng? Xi-feng thought for a moment, then exclaimed Aiyo! Why yes, now that you mention it, thats something I meant to ask you about surely Uncle Zi-shengs birthday falls during the winter? Bao-yu used to go every year. How strange! I remember quite clearly. When Uncle Zheng was promoted and Uncle Zi-sheng sent those players over, I made a mental note to myself. It seemed so out of character for him to do a thing like that. Uncle Zi-sheng has always been the mean one, not at all like Uncle Zi-teng. In fact the two brothers were always at daggers drawn. You only have to look at the casual way Uncle Zi-sheng behaved when Uncle Zi-teng died. Youd never have thought they were even related. I remember saying that when his next birthday came round we should be sure to send him some players as a return gesture, so as not to be beholden to him. But surely its much too early in the year for him to be celebrating his birthday now? Whats going on? Jia Lian You still havent got the faintest idea, have you? The very first thing your precious brother Ren did when he got back to the capital was to profit from Uncle Zi-tengs death by holding a memorial service. He was afraid wed try to put a stop to it so he never told us. The funeral donations brought him in several thousand taels, I can tell you. Uncle Zi-sheng was furious with him afterwards for cornering the market. This put your brother in a bit of a spot. So for his next little project he picked Uncle Zi-shengs birthday, the perfect opportunity to make some more money for himself, and placate old Zi-sheng into the bargain. He wasnt going to be held back by what the family or friends might say, or by the paltry fact that Uncle Zi-sheng.doesnt really have a birthday until next winter. Let people think what they like, he doesnt care! He doesnt know the meaning of the word pride! Now, on top of all this, let me tell you why I got up so early this morning. Recently theres been a memorial from the Censorate. Its in some way connected with the recent disturbances on the coast. The wording refers to the deficit left by Wang Zi-teng after his term of office and asks that this deficit be made good by his younger brother Wang Zi-sheng and by his nephew Wang Ren. The two of them got the wind up and asked me to try to pull a few strings for them. I agreed to do it for them. They seemed so pathetic and scared, and anyway I was afraid it might eventually affect you and Aunt Wang. I hoped old Qiu in the Inner Palace might see to it for me, perhaps get Uncle Zi-tengs successor to cook the books somehow. But I was late, damn it, hed already left for court. So there I was, up at dawn, tearing around for nothing, while they put on plays and hold a party! If that isnt enough to make a mans blood boil, tell me what is! Xi-feng still felt she must put some sort of a case for her brother, partly out of her constitutional need never to admit defeat, and partly out of loyalty to her own family However badly he may have behaved, hes still your brother4n-law. If you help him, youll be doing a good turn for both of my uncles, for the living and the dead. Our family honour is at stake so I implore you to help. Otherwise you know what will happen I shall be held responsible for your wrath, and theyll blacken my name for ever. Xi-feng burst into tears. Sitting up in bed, she began to comb her hair, and to throw on some clothes. Theres no need for you to react like that, said Jia Lian. Its your brother whos behaved so abominably Ive said nothing against you. And the servants-- when I had to go out this morning, I knew you were not well, so I didnt disturb you. But they just went on sleeping. Our parents never tolerated such behaviour. Youve grown too slack. You want to please everybody, thats your trouble. And the moment I say anything critical, you start hauling yourself out of bed in protest. If I give the servants a piece of my mind, I suppose youll stick up for them next. Its too absurd! Xi-feng dried her eyes.
Then later someone else told me it wasntour side of the family after all - I was so relieved! Afterwards I heard about Sir Zheng being promoted and was so pleased I wanted to come straight here to offer my congratulations. But we had so much to do on the land that I couldnt get away. And then yesterday I heard that Her Old Ladyship had passed away! I was bringing in the beans, and I was that shocked I couldnt go on, I just had to sit down on the ground and cry my heart out. I said to my son-in-law I dont care what you say, it may be true or it may just be a rumour, but either way Im going into town to find out for myself! Theyre not a bad sort, my daughter and her man, and they wet their eyes too when they heard the news. So this morning they saw me off and I left before first light and came here as quick as I could. There was no one to ask on the way and I couldnt get any news, so I came straight here to the back gate and when I saw the door-gods all pasted over with white I got the shock of my life. I tried finding Mrs Zhou, but there was no sign of her. Then I ran into a young lady who told me Mrs Zhou was in trouble and had been given the sack. I waited for ages before I saw someone I knew and was able to come in. Id no idea you were so sick too, maam! Grannie Liu was in tears. The distressing effect she was having on Xi-feng made Patience anxious, and she drew her aside before she could say any more Now, Grannie, after all this talking your mouth must be awfully dry. How about a nice cup of tea? She took her off into one of the maids rooms, while Qing-er continued playing in Qiao-jies room. I really dont want any tea, protested Grannie Liu. Please, miss, can someone take me over to Her Ladyships now? Id like to pay my respects and mourn for Her Old Ladyship. Theres no hurry, said Patience. It will be too late for you to leave this evening anyway. I was afraid you would upset Mrs Lian with all your talking. Thats why I hurried you out. I hope you wont take offence. Holy Name! How very thoughtful of you, miss! But how is Mrs Lian ever going to get better? Does it look serious to you? asked Patience. Maybe I shouldnt say this, replied Grannie Liu, but to me it looks very nasty. They heard Xi-feng calling and Patience hurried to her bedside. Xifeng said nothing further, however, and Patience was just asking Felicity what the trouble was when they were interrupted by the arrival of Jia Lian. He glanced at the kang where Xi-feng lay, then without a word stomped into the inner room, uttered a series of exasperated grunts and sat down. Autumn was the only one to follow him in. She poured his tea and waited on him attentively, whispering something in his ear. Jia Lian summoned Patience and asked her Isnt Mrs Lian taking medicine? What if she isnt? Oh, how should I know? Bring me the key to the chest. The blackness of his mood was more evident than ever to Patience. She restrained herself from saying anything in reply, but went out and whispered in Xi-fengs ear. Xi-feng was silent. Patience fetched a casket, placed it by Jia Lans side and walked away. Where are you off to in such a damned hurry? snapped Jia Lian. Arent you going to take the key out for me, now that youve dumped the thing there? Patience tried not to react. She opened the casket, took out the key and opened the chest with it. Then she asked What do you want from it? What have we got in there? Patience finally broke down. Half angrily, half tearfully she begged Jia Lan Please, wont you tell us what the matter is? Its not fair to keep us in this dreadful suspense... What is there to say? Youre the ones who caused this trouble in the first place. Now we owe four or five thousand taels for Grandmothers funeral, and Uncle Zheng has told me to mortgage some family property to raise the money. Do you imagine weve anything left to mortgage? Its going to look pretty bad if we cant meet our debts. I never asked to do this. I shall just have to pawn the things Grandmother gave me. Well, whats the matter with you? Dont you agree? Patience did not say a word, but started taking everything out of the chest.
He probably went there to find the Hibiscus Fairy. Or maybe it was some other sprite Bao-yu made no reply. Lady Wang seemed too agitated to speak. So there wasnt anything frightening in the Garden then? asked Grandmother Jia. Well, dont lets talk about it any more. But in future, if you want to go walking there, you must at least take more people with you. If it hadnt been for this little escapade of yours, our guests would have left long ago. Off you go now, all of you, and have a good nights sleep. Come back early in the morning. Tomorrow I shall make up for today and see that you enjoy yourselves properly. And this time we wont let him spoil things! They all said goodbye to Grandmother Jia and the party broke up. Aunt Xue stayed the night with Lady Wang, Xiang-yun with Grandmother Jia, while Ying-chun went to stay with Xi-chun. The others all returned to their respective apartments. When Bao-yu reached home, he was still a picture of misery. Bao-chai knew the cause of his endless sighing, and deliberately turned a deaf ear to it. She was concerned however that if he continued like this he might fall into a serious depression and revert to his old idiocy. Going into the inner room she called Aroma aside and questioned her in detail about Bao-yus excursion in the Garden. To learn of Aromas response, you must read the next chapter. CHAPTER 109 Fivey shares a vigil, and receives affection meant for another Ying-chun pays her debt to fate, and returns to the Realm of Primordial Truth Bao-chai, having extracted from Aroma a detailed account of what had happened in the Garden, feared that a fresh bout of grief might indeed cause Bao-yu to fall ill again. In an attempt to avert this she deliberately alluded to Dai-yus dying moments, in the course of an apparently casual conversation with Aroma. Human beings have certain feelings towards each other while they are alive, she went on to say. But after death a person enters a separate realm and becomes a different entity. Someone still alive may continue to be infatuated, but the dead person, the object of that feeling, will be quite oblivious of it. Besides, if Miss Lin has become a fairy, she must take a very dim view of lesser mortals and would hardly deign to mingle with them on this earthly plane. To start imagining such things is to invite trouble and to lay oneself open to possession by evil spirits. She was talking to Aroma, but her words were clearly intended for Bao-yus ears. Aroma realized this and replied in an appropriate vein Of course shes not a fairy. Its out of the question. If Miss Lins spirit were haunting the Garden, why has she never once appeared to me in a dream? She and I were good friends, after all. . Bao-yu was listening from outside, and considered this idea of Aromas carefully It is strange! Since I first learned of Cousin Lins death, Ive thought of her constantly, every day. But why have I never once seen her in my dreams? It must be because shes in Heaven, and thinks me a dull earthling incapable of communicating on her exalted level. I know what Ill do tonight Ill sleep here in the outer room. Perhaps since Ive just returned from the Garden she will be more aware of my feelings, and will condescend to visit me this once in a dream. If she does, I must be sure to ask her where she has gone, so that I can make offerings to her regularly. If on the other hand it turns out that she is too pure for even a single dream-visit, then I must try to put her out of my mind once and for all. Having made this resolution, he said aloud I shall sleep out here tonight. You neednt be bothered on my account. Bao-chai did not try to oppose him directly, but cautioned him Dont go having any foolish ideas. Didnt you see how worried Mother was when she heard that youd been in the Garden? She could hardly speak for anxiety! You must be sensible and look after yourself. If you go and do something silly again and Grandmother finds out, its us shell blame for not taking proper care of you. I wasnt being serious, said Bao-yu. Id just like to sit here for a while and then come in. You must be tired too. Go to sleep, dont wait up for me. Bao-chai thought he would probably come in later, and said with an air of affected nonchalance cry well then. Im going to sleep. Aroma can look after you. This was exactly what Bao-yu had been hoping for.
I can get the better of you lot any day! Come on, Ten old mate! Were depending on you! groaned the others. You know youre the one the Master trusts. If you wont help us, were done for! All right. But you ve got to trust me too. Dont leave me to do all the dirty work and bring in the money, and then turn on me and say Ive taken more than my fair share. No chance of that. You know were broke. Anythings better than nothing. As they were speaking, the granary clerk came in, and asked for Mr Zhou. Ten, who was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and his chest puffed out, asked him what his business was with Mr Zhou. The clerk stood to attention with his hands at his sides and smiled uneasily. The new Intendant has been in office more than a month now, he replied, but not a single granarys been opened to take in the tax-grain. The local magistrates have been made to feel uncomfortable by all his stern pronouncements. Theyve been quite put off from entering into the usual - how shall I put it? - negotiations. Now, if the grain is not going to be taken in and delivered on time, whats the point of your being here at all? What a ridiculous question! said Ten. Our Master the Intendant is a man of his word. Of course hell meet his commitments. As a matter of fact he was about to issue the Reminders a couple of days ago, but on my advice they were postponed. Now, tell me what you really wanted to see Zhou about? Clerk Oh, that was it ... the Reminders. Nothing else .. Ten Nonsense! Dont try to fool me with that, my lad! And dont come sneaking in here with any nifty little plans, or Ill tell the Intendant to beat you and take your job away. Clerk My family has served in this yamen for three generations Ive got a decent position here, I manage to make an honest living. I dont mind going by the book until this Intendant gets promoted and moved somewhere else. Im not like that beggarly lot whove just left. He took formal leave of Li Ten Id best be going now, sir. Ten stood up, all smiles Come on now, cant you take a joke? No need to get rattled by a few words .. Im not rattled. I just dont want to say anything that might compromise you, sir. Ten walked over to the clerk and took him confidentially by the hand Tell me, whats your name? Zhan Hui, Homophone for bribery sir, replied the clerk nervously. I spent quite a few years up in the capital myself when I was a boy. Mr Zhan! Why, of course! Ive heard of you. Come now, were all in this together. If theres something you want to talk to me about, why not drop by this evening and we can have a nice little chat. We all know how capable you are, Mr Li, replied the clerk aloud, with a sigh of relief. Why, you really had me worried there for a minute! He left amidst general laughter. That evening Zhan returned and he and Li were closeted together deep into the night. The next day, when Li found some pretext to call on Jia Zheng, and hinted at some of the measures he had in mind, predictably he received a stern reprimand. The following day, Jia Zheng was due to pay a formal visit in the town, and he issued orders for his retinue to make themselves ready. A considerable interval of time elapsed, and the gong in the inner yamen was struck three times, but still there was no sign of anyone to beat the drum in the main hall. Someone was finally found to perform this duty, and Jia Zheng came walking out of his private chambers with measured stride, to find that there was only one attendant waiting for him, instead of the usual team of runners and criers. Resolving not to pursue this dereliction for the time being, Jia Zheng stepped into the sedan at the foot of the terrace and waited for his chair-bearers. Another long interval elapsed before these had all assembled and were ready to carry him out of the yamen, and the Intendants solemn departure was then announced by a single feeble report from the cannon, while a grand total of two members of the ceremonial band, a drummer and a bugler, put in a forlorn appearance on the bandstand. Jia Zheng was now extremely annoyed. Things have been in perfect order until today. Whats the meaning of this shambles? His insignia-bearers, such as they were, straggled across the road in an unseemly fashion.
Like your elder brother, said one of the company, referring to Steward Lais eldest son, Lai Shang-rong. Hes a county magistrate. Done very nicely for himself. True enough, replied young Lal. But his conduct still leaves a lot to be desired, Im afraid. He may not last long at this rate. Has he been taking squeeze himself? Lai nodded and drained his cup. What other news did you pick up at the Palace? they asked them. Oh, nothing much. A number of criminals from the coast have apparently been arrested, and sent to the High Court. During their trial they revealed the whereabouts of several others of their kind, lying low here in the capital, watching and waiting for fresh opportunities for crime. Fortunately the present civil and military authorities have such a sound grip on the situation, and are so dedicated to the service of the throne, that these criminal elements will be effectively controlled. If youve heard of such cases, perhaps you have news of our burglary? asked one of the party. Im afraid not, came the reply. I heard something about a man from one of the inland provinces who got into trouble here in town for abducting a girl and running off with her to the coast. She put up a fight and he ended by killing her. They arrested him crossing the border, and executed him on the spot. Wasnt Sister Adamantina from Green Bower Hermitage abducted in similar circumstances? put in one of the others. Couldnt it have been her? Bound to have been! muttered Jia Huan. How could you know? they asked him. She was a sickening creature! said Jia Huan. Always giving herself airs and graces. She had only to set eyes on Bao-yu to get a big smile all over her face. But she wouldnt so much as acknowledge my existence! I hope it is her! Plenty of people are kidnapped all the time, someone commented. It could easily have been someone else. I can well believe it was her, said Jia Yun. The day before yesterday I heard that one of the sisters at the Hermitage had a dream in which she saw Adamantina being killed. This was greeted with derision You cant take dreams seriously! Dream or no dream, its all one to me, protested Dumbo. Lets get on with the real business of the evening, shall we? Eat up, everyone, and we can start tonights Big Game. This met with general approval, and as soon as they had finished their meal they began gambling in earnest. They were still at it well after midnight, when suddenly they heard a great commotion coming from the inner apartments. They were eventually informed that Xi-chun had been arguing with You-shi, and the upshot of it was that she had cut all her hair off and gone running to Ladies Xing and Wang. There she kowtowed and begged them to relent and let her have her wish. If they would not, she threatened to put an end to her life there and then. The two ladies were at their wits end, and sent for Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to intervene. Jia Yun however knew that this was something Xi-chun had resolved to do long ago, at least since the fateful night of the burglary when she had been left in charge of the house, and to him there seemed little hope in trying to dissuade her now. He talked it over with Jia Qiang Lady Wang says she wants us to intervene, but I dont see how we can achieve anything. Its a heavy responsibility, and they want to off-load it onto us. Well have to put on a show of talking Xi-chun out of her decision, and then, when she refuses to listen, well have to pass the matter back to the ladies, and meanwhile write a letter to Uncle Lian, absolving ourselves from any blame. They both agreed on this strategy, called on Ladies Xing and Wang, and then went through the motions of trying to dissuade Xi-chun, who was every bit as adamant as they had predicted. If she could not take refuge in a convent outside the family mansion, then she said she would make do with a couple of quiet rooms within it, in which to recite her sutras and say her prayers. Eventually You-shi could see that the aunts were not prepared to take the responsibility her own feat that Xi-chun might commit suicide got the better of her and she forced herself to compromise. I can see I shall have to take the blame. Very well then. Let them say that it was I who could not tolerate my own husbands sister and drove her to a nunnery! What do I care! But I cannot allow her to leave home. That is out of the question. She will have to stay here. Aunts Xing and Wang, I call you to witness my decision.
Youll only make yourself ill. Ill! exclaimed Jia Lian, somewhat histrionically. Thats the least of my worries! We cant even find the money to get by from day to day, let alone pay for the funeral. And to make matters worse, now Ive got this idiot round my neck! Theres really no need to work yourself into such a state, sir, said Patience. If youve no money, Ive a few things that were not taken in the raid. Use them if you like. What a wonderful stroke of luck! thought Jia Lian to himself. He smiled at Patience That would be a real help. It would save me from having to race around trying to raise the money. Ill pay you back as soon as I can. Whatever I have was given me by Mrs Lian in the first place, said Patience. So theres really no need to pay me back. I just want the funeral to be done properly, thats all. Jia Lian accepted Patiences offer with sincere gratitude, and pawned her belongings for the funeral expenses. From then on he made a point of discussing everything with her. Autumn was most put out, and took every opportunity to mutter complaints Now that Mrs Lian is gone, Patience thinks she can take over. The Master gave me to Mr Lian how can Patience think to climb above me? Patience noticed Autumns disgruntled attitude, but paid no attention. Jia Lian, for his part, found Autumns resentment which he observed soon enough most objectionable, and whenever anything happened to annoy him he vented his bad humour on her. Lady Xing criticized him for this, and he felt obliged to restrain himself. But of this no more. In due course, after Xi-fengs encoffined corpse had been laid out for ten days, it was escorted to the temple. Jia Zheng was still in mourning for Grandmother Jia and was confined to his study during the period of Xi-fengs funeral. His entourage of literary gentlemer had gradually deserted him. Only Cheng Ri-xing still called regularly On one occasion Jia Zheng was speaking to him on the genera subject of the familys decline See how one by one we are dying off! My elder brother and young Zhen are both in exile. Our finances deteriorate daily. And who knows what has become of our country estates in the Eastern provinces. Altogether, a disastrous state of affairs! I have been here many years, sir, said Cheng, and I have seen for myself how busy your staff are, enriching themselves at your expense. Every year sees money draining from your pockets into theirs. It is ruining you. Then there is the money needed for the families of 5ji She and Mr Zhen, and the sizeable debts incurred besides, and the loss sustained as a result of the recent burglary, which I hardly think will be recovered. If you wish to put your house in order, sir, the only remedy I envisage is for you to assemble your staff, and to charge your most trustworthy steward with a comprehensive investigation of their accounts. In that way you can judge in which department retrenchment is possible. Deficits should be made good by the individual steward responsible. That way you will at leas know where you stand. Then theres the Garden. It is too large for anyone to buy. But I is a shame that a place with such potential for profit should have been so neglected. During the years that you have been away, sir, the staff there have been manufacturing all manner of frightening tales which have had the effect of deterring everyone from entering the place. All your troubles are, in short, the doing of the servants. You should make a thorough investigation, and dismiss any unsatisfactory elements among them. It is the only remedy that makes sense. My dear Cheng, replied Jia Zheng, nodding his head gravel you do not seem to realize I cannot even trust my own nephew, let alone the servants! And if I myself were to try to carry out a investigation such as you suggest, I could never hope to get to the root of the problem. Not that I could engage in such a thing anyway while still in mourning. Even if I did, I have never paid much attention to household details in the past, so I really have no what we are supposed to have and what we dont have. I would no know where to look. You are altogether too charitable and virtuous a man, sir, rejoined Cheng. In any other family of comparable position, even if things had reached this critical state, the masters would count on being able to stave off disaster for another five or ten years by asking their stewards for money. I understand that one of your men has even been appointed to a district magistracy ... No! cut in Jia Zheng firmly.
Dont you agree? Patience did not say a word, but started taking everything out of the chest. Crimson came up to her Come quickly! Mrs Lian has been taken bad! Patience hurried in, forgetting Jia Lian entirely, and found Xi-feng waving her arms wildly in the air. She tried to hold her down, calling Out to her tearfully. Even Jia Lian now came in to have a look. He stamped his foot and cried This will be the death of me! Tears started to his eyes. Felicity came m Youre wanted outside, sir. Jia Lian checked himself and went out. Xi-feng was weakening with every minute, and Felicity and the other maids began wailing and sobbing. Qiao-jie heard and came running in, followed by Grandmother Liu, who hurried over to the kang and began muttering prayers to the Buddha and a lot of other mumbo-jumbo, which appeared to rally Xi-fengs spirits a little. Presently Lady Wang arrived, having heard the news from a maid by this time Xi-feng was more peaceful and Lady Wang saw no undue cause for concern. She greeted Grannie Liu and asked her how long she had been at Rong-guo House. Grannie Liu returned the greeting and immediately began talking at some length about Xfengs illness. After a while Suncloud appeared with a message that her mistress was wanted by Sir Zheng, whereupon Lady Wang gave Patience a few instructions and left. After her bad spell, Xi-fengs mind seemed to grow clearer. She saw Grannie Liu in the room once more, and began to feel a growing faith in the efficacy of the old dames prayers. She told Felicity and the others to leave them alone and, calling Grannie Liu over to the side of her bed, confided to her that she felt very troubled at heart and was constantly seeing spirits. Grannie Liu replied that in her home village there was a certain miraculous Bodhisattva, and a certain temple where prayers were always answered. I beseech you to pray for me, said Xi-feng. If you need money for offerings, I can provide it for you. She slipped a golden bracelet off her wrist and gave it to Grannie Liu. Theres no need of that, said Grannie Liu. If we country-folk make a vow, we give a few hundred cash when we get better - no need for anything as grand as this. If I go and pray for you, that will be your vow, maam, and when youre better you can go yourself and give what you want. Xi-feng knew that Grannie Liu was sincere, and did not try to press the bracelet on her. My life is in your hands, Grannie! she said. My little girl also is pursued by countless ailments and afflictions. I entrust her to you as well. Grannie Liu readily agreed. I really ought to be going if Im to catch the gates, she said. Theres still just time. In a day or two, when youre better, you can come and offer thanks. Xi-fengs soul was beleaguered by the spirits of those she had harmed during her lifetime, and she was eager for the old lady to go and pray for her Do your best for me. If I can only get some peaceful sleep, I shall be so grateful to you. You can leave your granddaughter here. But shes only a country lass, and has no manners, protested Grannie Lu. Im afraid shell only make trouble here. Id better take her with me. Dont you worry. She is one of the family, it will be quite all right. We may be hard up, but I think we can feed one extra mouth. Grannie Liu could tell that Xi-feng meant what she said, and for her part she was only too pleased to let Qing-er stay with the Jias a few days and save a little at home. The only problem was that Qing-er herself might not be willing. She decided to call her over and offer her the choice, and soon discovered that the two girls had become firm friends, that Qiao-jie was most reluctant to let Qing-er go, and that Qing-er herself was eager to stay. The old lady gave her grandchild a few parting words of advice, said goodbye to Patience and hurried out, anxious to reach the city gates before they closed. And there our narrative must leave her. Green Bower Hermitage was built on Jia family land, and when Prospect Garden was created for the Visitation, the site of the Hermitage was included within the Gardens precincts. But as a religious establishment it had always been self-supporting, and had never been dependent on Jia family charity.
How pretty she looked, in her wedding-gown! He gazed at her soft skin, the full curve of her shoulders, and her hair done up in tresses that hung from her temples! Her eyes were moist, her lips quivered slightly. Her whole appearance had the simple elegance of a white lily, wet with pendant dew the maidenly blush on her cheeks resembled apricot-blossom wreathed in mist. For a moment he stared at her in utter astonishment. Then he noticed that Oriole was standing at her side, while Snowgoose had quite vanished. A feeling of helpless bewilderment seized him, and thinking he must be dreaming, he stood there in a motionless daze. The maids took the lamp from him and helped him to a chair, where he sat with his eyes fixed in front of him, still without uttering a single word. Grandmother Jia was anxious lest this might signal the approach of another of his fits, and herself came over to rally him, while Xi-feng and You-shi escorted Bao-chai to a chair in the inner part of the room. Bao-chai held her head bowed and said nothing. After a while, Bao-yu had composed himself sufficiently to think. He saw Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang sitting opposite him, and asked Aroma in a whisper Where am I? This must all be a dream. A dream? Why, its the happiest day of your life! said Aroma. How can you be so silly? Take care Sir Zeng is outside. Pointing now to where Bao-chai sat, and still whispering, Bao-yu asked again Who is that beautiful lady sitting over there? Aroma found this so comical that for a while she could say nothing, but held her hand to her face to conceal her mirth. Finally she replied That is your bride, the new Mrs Bao-yu. The other maids also turned away, unable to contain their laughter. Bao-yu Dont be so silly! What do you mean, "Mrs Bao-yu"? Who is Mrs Bao-yu? Aroma Miss Chai. Bao-yu But what about Miss Lin? Aroma The Master decided you should marry Miss Chai. Whats Miss Lin got td do with it? Bao-yu But I saw her just a moment ago, and Snow-goose. too. They couldnt have just vanished! What sort of trick is this that youre all playing on me? Xi-feng came up and whispered in his ear Miss Chai is sitting over there, so please stop talking like this. If you offend her,. Grannie will be very cross with you. Bao-yu was now more hopelessly confused than ever. The mysterious goings-on of that night, c6ming on top of his already precarious mental state, had wrought him up to such a pitch of despair that all he could do was cry - I must find Cousin Lin! - again and again. Grandmother Jia and the other ladies tried to comfort him but he was impervious to their efforts. Furthermore, with Bao-chai in the room, they had to be careful what they said. Baoyu was clearly suffering from a severe relapse, and they now abandoned their attempts to rally him and instead helped him to bed, while ordering several sticks of gum benzoin incense to be lit, the heavy, sedative fumes of which soon filled the room. They all stood in awesome hush. After a short while, the incense began to take effect and Bao-yu sank into a heavy slumber, much to the relief of the ladies, who sat down again to await the dawn. Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng to ask Bao-chai to lie down and rest, which she did, fully dressed as she was, behaving as though she had heard nothing. Jia Zheng had remained in an outer room during all of this, and so had seen nothing to disillusion him of the reassuring impression he had received earlier on. The following day, as it happened, was the day selected according to the almanac for his departure to his new post. After a short rest, he took formal leave of the festivities and returned to his apartment. Grandmother Jia, too, left Baoyu sound asleep and returned to her apartment for a brief rest. The next morning, Jia Zheng took leave of the ancestors in the family shrine and came to bid his mother farewell. He bowed before her and said I, your unworthy son, am about to depart for afar. My only wish is that you should keep warm in the cold weather and take good care of yourself. As soon as I arrive at my post, I shall write to ask how you are. You are not to worry on my account.
Hell be coming this way. Stop him and ask him. See what he says. Jin-gui annoyed Im sure he wont be coming out just yet. Anyway, hes such a cold fish. Words are wasted on him. Moonbeam Youre just being silly again, maam. Why not give it a try? If he plays, we can play too. If not, well just have to think of another way. Perhaps shes right after all, Jin-gui thought to herself. She posted Moonbeam outside to keep watch for Xue Ke, and went in once more to her dressing-table. She opened her mirror and looked herself up and down. A little more lipstick, a flowery handkerchief, and she was ready for the fray. Or almost ready she still felt there was something missing, but before she could think what it was that she needed to add that final touch, she heard Moonbeams voice outside You seem in high spirits today, Master Ke! Been drinking somewhere, have you? This was her cue. Jin-gui raised the portiere and stepped out just in time to hear Xue Kes reply Our manager Mr Zhang is celebrating his birthday today, and I was pressed into drinking half a cup. My face is still burning from it. Before he had finished, Jin-gui moved into the attack Other peoples wine has more flavour than ours, I dare say ... Xue Ke felt the sting of her remark and blushed a deeper shade of red. He took a step towards her and said with a polite smile Of course not, sister-in-law. Now that the conversation was launched, Moonbeam disappeared inside and left them to it. Jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling, but there was something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly befuddled innocence in his eyes, that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled to the distant land of Java. She smiled. You mean, you have to be led to water .. Precisely. Im really no drinker. Im glad to hear it. Better than your cousin, anyway, forever boozing his way into trouble. At least your wife wont be left to sleep in an empty bed ... She narrowed her eyes at him suggestively, and her cheeks began to glow. Xue Ke saw serious danger ahead, and decided to make a dash for it while he still could. But he was too slow. Jin-gui was not going to let him slip through her fingers now! In a second she was on him and had him in her clutches. Sister-in-law! cried Xue Ke in consternation. This is most undignified! He was trembling all over. Jin-gui threw caution to the winds. Come in here with me. Theres something important I have to tell you. Things had reached this critical juncture when a voice behind her called Mrs Pan! Its Caltrop. Shes coming this way! Jin-gui glanced wildly behind her. Moonbeam had lifted the portiere to observe the course the interview was taking and then when she caught sight of Caltrop coming from the other direction, had hastened to warn Jin-gui. Jin-gui in her panic relaxed her grip, and Xue Ke seized his chance of escape. Caltrop herself had noticed nothing and had been walking innocently on her way until Moonbeam called out, when she looked round and to her horror saw Jin-gui dragging Xue Ke into her boudoir. Caltrop immediately turned about and, heart thumping, began walking back in the direction she had come from. Jin-gui stood there a while, and stared in angry dismay after the vanishing form of Xue Ke. Then she gave a snort of exasperation and withdrew to her apartment, smarting with thwarted desire. Caltrop, who had come through the side gate and was making her way to Bao-qins when she stumbled upon them, hurried back to her room. Resentment towards Caltrop now festered within Jin-guis bosom, and the poison worked its way into the very marrow of her being. Later that same day, Bao-chai was in Grandmother Jias apartment, and heard Lady Wang speaking of the betrothal Jia Zheng had proposed for Tan-chun. Im glad the boys from a Nanking family, said Grandmother Jia. But if he came here once before, I cant understand why Zheng has never mentioned it. We knew nothing about it either, said Lady Wang. I can see advantages in the match, said Grandmother Jia. The only objection is the dreadful distance involved. I know that Zheng is posted there at present. But supposing he is transferred later on, poor Tan will be so isolated. With official families, theres no telling where they may be posted, replied Lady Wang.
After standing for a moment lost in thought, Bao-yu asked again But if as you say, death is a dispersion, how can there be such a place as the Nether World? There is, replied the man with a superior smile, and yet there is not, such a place. It is a teaching, devised to warn mankind in its blind attachment to the idea of life and death. The Supreme Wrath is aroused by human folly in all forms - whether it be excessive ambition, premature death self-sought, or futile self-destruction through debauchery and a life of overweening violence. Hell is the place where souls such as these are imprisoned and made to suffer countless torments in expiation of their- sins. This search of yours for Lin Dai-yu is a case of futile self-delusion. Dai-yu has already returned to the Land of Illusion and if you really want to find her you must cultivate your mind and strengthen your spiritual nature. Then one day you will see her again. But if you throw your life away, you will be guilty of premature death self-sought and will be confined to Hell. And then, although you may be allowed to see your parents, you will certainly never see Dai-yu again. When he had finished speaking, the man took a stone from within his sleeve and threw it at Bao-yus chest. The words he had spoken and the impact of the stone as it-landed on his chest combined to give Bao-yu such a fright that he would have returned home at once, if he had only know which way to turn. In his confusion he suddenly heard a voice, and turning, saw the figures of Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Bao-chai, Aroma and his other maids standing in a circle around him, weeping and calling his name. He was lying on his own bed. The red lamp was on the table. The moon was shining brilliantly through the window. He was back among the elegant comforts of his own home. A moments reflection told him that what he had just experienced had been a dream. He was in a cold sweat. Though his mind felt strangely lucid, thinking only intensified his feeling of helpless desolation, and he uttered several profound sighs. Bao-chai had known of Dai-yus death for several days. While Grandmother Jia had forbidden the maids to tell him for fear of further complicating his illness, she felt she knew better. Aware that it was Dai-yu who lay at the root of his illness and that the loss of his jade was only a secondary factor, she took the opportunity of breaking the news of her death to him in this abrupt manner, hoping that by severing his attachment once and for all she would enable- his sanity and health to be restored. Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang and company were not aware of her intentions and at first reproached her for her lack of caution. But when they saw Bao-yu regain consciousness they were all greatly relieved and went at once to the library to ask doctor Bi to come in and examine his patient again. The doctor carefully took his pulses. How odd! he exclaimed. His pulses are deep and still, his spirit calm, the oppression quite dispersed. Tomorrow he must take a regulative draught, which I shall prescribe, and he should make a prompt and complete recovery. The doctor left and the ladies all returned to their apartments in much improved spirits. Although at first Aroma greatly resented the way in which Bao-chai had broken the news, she did not dare say so. Oriole, on the other hand, reproved her mistress in private for having been, as she put it, too hasty. What do you know about such things? retorted Bao-chai. Leave this to me. I take full responsibility. Bao-chai ignored the opinions and criticisms of those around her and continued to keep a close watch on Baoyus progress, probing him judiciously, like an acupunturist with a needle. A day or two later, he began to feel a slight improvement in himself, though his mental equilibrium was still easily disturbed by the least thought of Dai-yu. Aroma was constantly at his side, with such words of consolation as The Master chose Miss Chai as your bride for her more dependable nature. He thought Miss Lin too difficult and temperamental for you, and besides there was always the fear that she would not live long. Then later Her Old Ladyship thought you were not in a fit state to know what was best for you and would only be upset and make yourself iller if you knew the truth, so she made Snowgoose come over, to try and make things easier for you. This did nothing to lessen his grief, and he often wept inconsolably.
Faithful gave the money to an old serving-woman to take out to the accounts office. The remainder of that evening and night passed without any further event. The next day a servant was sent to fetch Ying-chun for the party. Aunt Xue and Bao-qin were invited, and were asked to bring Caltrop with them. Mrs Li was also invited, and later that day she arrived together with Li Wen and Li Qi. These preparations were kept secret from Bao-chai. One of Grandmother Jias maids simply came to tell her that her mother had called, and to invite her over to the old ladys apartment. Bao-chai was pleased to hear of her mothers arrival, and went dressed as she was to greet her. She found her cousin Bao-qin and Caltrop there, and Mrs Li with the Li sisters, and presumed that they had all come to call upon hearing that the family troubles were over. She greeted Mrs Li, then Grandmother Jia, then exchanged a few words with her mother and said hello to the Li sisters. Now, will the ladies please be seated, said Xiang-yun from the side, and we can congratulate our cousin and wish her a long and happy life on this very special occasion. Bao-chi looked rather bewildered for a moment. Then she thought to herself, Of course! Tomorrows my birthday! Its quite right for you to come and visit Grandmother, she protested. But you certainly shouldnt have gone to all this trouble on my account. Bao-yu heard this as he came in to greet Aunt Xue and Mrs Li. He had originally been thinking of organizing something for Bao-chais birthday himself, but had said nothing to Grandmother Jia because of the general confusion of the past few weeks. He was delighted that Xiang-yun had taken the initiative. Yes, tomorrows her birthday, he said. I was meaning to remind you, Grannie. Shame on you. cried Xiang-yun with a playful laugh. As if Grannie needed you to remind her! Who do you think invited everyone here but Grannie? Bao-chai secretly doubted this. But then she heard Grandmother Jia say to her mother Poor Chai - its been more than a year since she married Bao-yu, and somehow with one thing after another, weve never celebrated her birthday. Today I wanted to do it properly, so I invited you and Mrs Li over. I thought it would be a nice opportunity for us all to have a chat. Youre only just starting to feel better, Lady Jia, protested Aunt Xue. It is my daughter who should be thinking how best to do her duty and show you her love and respect. You really shouldnt go to such lengths on young Chais account. Bao-yu is Grannies favourite grandson, said Xiang-yun, so of course Grannie has a soft spot for Chai as well! Anyway Chai deserves it! Bao-chai hung her head in modest silence. Bao-yu meanwhile was marvelling to himself at Xiang-yuns forthrightness I always imagined that Xiang-yun would change once she was married thats why yesterday I was rather reserved with her. As a result I suppose she herself decided to keep her distance. But to hear her talk now, she seems quite the same as ever. Why has marriage made my wife more modest and bashful than before, more tongue-tied than ever? While these thoughts were passing through his mind, a junior maid came in to announce the arrival of Ying-chun. Shortly afterwards Li Wan and Xi-feng arrived, and they all exchanged greetings. Ying-chun referred to her fathers departure I wanted to come and see him before he left, but my husband wouldnt allow me to. He said he didnt want his family to be infected by our bad luck. He wouldnt listen to anything I said, and there was nothing I could do. I cried for two or three days. Why did he let you come today then? asked Xi-feng. This time he said that since Uncle Zheng had been given the title, there was no harm in renewing contact. She burst into tears. Ive been feeling quite wretched myself, Grandmother Jia upbraided her, and I asked you all here to celebrate my granddaughterin4aws birthday and to have a bit of fun. I thought thered be lots of laughter to cheer us up - and there you go mentioning this unhappy business of yours and upsetting me all over again. Ying-chun and the rest were silenced. Xi-feng tried her hardest to put on a brave front for the occasion and to jolly the old lady along but somehow she seemed to have lost the knack of making people laugh, and her efforts all fell flat.
I braved the flames and went into the temple to see if I could find the Taoist. His hut was completely razed to the ground, even the wall behind it had collapsed, and there was no trace of the old man. He must have been roasted alive...... All that was left was his prayer-mat, and drinking-gourd somehow they both seemed to have survived intact. I looked all over the place for any human remains, but there was not so much as a bone to be seen. I was going to bring you the prayer-mat and gourd, to show you, in case you didnt believe me, sir but when I picked them up they lust turned to ashes in my hands. Yu-cun deduced from this account that Zhen Shi-yins departure from the scene of the fire had been no ordinary death, but rather some miraculous process of etherealization. He dismissed the runner, and went in again to his private apartment, where he made no mention to his wife of Shi-yins metamorphosis by fire, thinking she would fail to understand and would only be distressed instead he simply told her that no trace of the old man had been found, and that he had most probably escaped alive. Leaving his private apartment, Yu-cun went to his study, and was sitting there pondering the few words Zhen Shi-yin had spoken during their brief encounter, when one of his attendants came in to convey an Imperial summons to the Palace, to peruse certain state papers. Yu-cun hurriedly took a sedan-chair to the Palace. As he arrived he overheard someone say The Kiangsi Grain Intendant, Jia Zheng, has been impeached, and is at court to plead for clemency! Yu-cun pressed on into the Cabinet Office and greeted the various Ministers of State gathered there. He first performed his duty and glanced through the state papers which spelled out His Majestys displeasure with the state of the coastal defences, and then left the Cabinet Office at once to find Jia Zheng and to commiserate with him on his impeachment, expressing his relief that it was not too serious a charge, and asking if his journey to the capital had been a comfortable one. Jia Zheng replied with a detailed account of his misfortunes. Has your plea for clemency been presented to the throne yet? asked Yu-cun. It has, replied Jia Zheng. I am expecting to receive the Rescript when His Majesty returns from lunch. Even as they were speaking, Jia Zheng was summoned to the Imperial presence, and hurried in. Those senior ministers who were connected with him waited anxiously in one of the antechambers and when, after a lengthy audience, he finally emerged again, his face beaded with sweat, they all pressed forward to greet him. Well? they asked. How did it go? Frightened the life out of me! gasped Jia Zheng, his tongue popping out of his mouth. I must thank you all, gentlemen, for your concern. I am relieved to inform you that I have come out of this business relatively unscathed. On what subjects did His Majesty question you? His first question concerned the smuggling of firearms in Yunnan Province. The original memorial on the case identified the ringleader as a member of the household of Jia Hua, the former Grand Preceptor. His Majesty thought he remembered the name as that of my fathers cousin, and asked me if it was indeed the same man. I kowtowed at once and reminded him that my fathers cousin was Jia Dai- hua . His Majesty laughed. Then he went on to ask me if there was not another relative of mine named Jia Hua, who had once been President of the Board of War, but had subsequently been demoted and then appointed Mayor. Jia Yu-cun was among those present. His more formal personal name was indeed Hua, Yu-cun being merely a commonly used sobriquet, and he nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard this. And how did you reply to this, sir? he asked Jia Zheng. I replied most deliberately that the former Grand Preceptor Jia Hua hailed from Yunnan, whereas the Jia who was at present Mayor of the Metropolitan Prefecture was a Chekiang man. His Majestys second question concerned the Jia Fan recently impeached by the Soochow censor. He asked me if this man also belonged to my family. I kowtowed and replied that he did. A cloud seemed to pass over His Majestys countenance, and he said A disgraceful affair, for a man to let his own household servants run riot and lay their hands on the wives of innocent citizens! I did not dare utter a word What relation of yours is this Jia Fan? A distant one, Your Majesty, I hastily replied.
Then you could all have done as you pleased! Bao-chai tried to console her, but was in no fit state to do so. The pain she herself felt was like a knife-wound piercing her heart, and eventually she broke down and burst into tears. Aroma was faint with weeping and had to be supported by Ripple. Bao-yu did not shed a single tear, nor did he try to offer them any solace. He maintained a total silence. Jia Lan and Jia Huan had already left, and it fell to Li Wan to do what she could to save the situation Im sure it 5 simply that Bao-yu is too upset by this decision of Xi-chuns to know what he is saying. We should not take it seriously. Nightingale must receive an answer, though we must let her stand up. Is she to be granted her request or not? What difference does it make? replied Lady Wang. Her mind is clearly made up in any case, and when a persons mind is made up theres no stopping them. No doubt Bao-yu will tell us that this decision of Nightingales is predestined too. Nightingale kowtowed, and Xi-chun thanked Lady Wang. Nightingale also kowtowed to Bao-yu and Bao-chai. Amida Buddha! exclaimed Bao-yu piously. How noble! How rare! I never thought that you would be the first of us to be saved! Bao-chais self-control failed her again, and Aroma, heedless of Lady Wangs presence, burst out sobbing and cried I want to go with Miss Xi-chun too, and spend the rest of my life in prayer! Bao-yu smiled Yours is also a fine aspiration. But alas, a life of seclusion has not been decreed you by fate. Then I would rather die! sobbed Aroma. Despite his new-found detachment, Bao-yu could not help being moved by this declaration. But he said nothing. It was already three oclock in the morning, and he suggested to his mother that she should retire for the night. Li Wan went back to her apartment, and Landscape escorted Xi-chun to her room, where she continued to wait on her for the time being. Husbands were eventually found for each of Xi-chuns maids, and Nightingale spent the rest of her days faithfully serving her. But we anticipate. J ia Zheng, meanwhile, was on his way south with Grandmother Jias coffin, and had run into an army convoy returning to the capital after the victorious completion of a campaign. The canal was hopelessly congested with military transport boats, and the delay made Jia Zheng extremely fretful. His one consolation was an encounter with an official from the Coastal Defence Yamen, who informed him that the Commandant, Tan-chuns father-in-law, had been recalled to the capital. Tan-chun would now be able to visit home, although there was no indication when she would be travelling. Another consequence of the delay was that Jia Zheng found himself running short of cash. He was obliged to write a letter and have it delivered to the yamen of Steward Lais son, Lai Shang-rong, who happened to be a mandarin in the vicinity, asking him for a loan of five hundred silver taels. The servant entrusted with this mission was told to bring the money and overtake Jia Zheng further along the canal. A few days and a dozen or so Ii later, the servant reappeared and came on board the boat with Lai Shang-rongs reply. The letter was full of tales of woe of one sort or another, and enclosed fifty taels of silver. Jia Zhen was furious, and without a moments hesitation ordered the servant to return Take him back his money this instant! And he can have his letter too! Tell him not to bother! The poor servant did as he was ordered and returned to Lais yamen. Lai, perturbed at having both his letter and his paltry offering returned, and knowing that he had behaved meanly, made up another package, this time enclosing an additional hundred taels, and begged the servant to take it back with him to Jia Zheng. But despite Lais pleas and blandishments, the man absolutely refused, and returned to the boat empty-handed. Lai Shang-rong was most apprehensive about the consequences of this episode, and immediately wrote to his father at Rong-guo House, advising him to take some leave and if possible to buy his way out of service. When Steward Lai received his sons letter, he asked Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to plead with Lady Wang for his release.
And Fragrance for the Tail, concluded Jia Qiang. Jia Huan obliged with a line by another Tang poet, Song Zhi-wen Beyond the clouds there wafts a heavenly Fragrance ... Boring! Boring! complained Xing De-quan. Stop posing, Huan, me old fellow! Fat lot you know about poetry! This is no fun at all, its enough to make you sick! Lets drop it and play Guess-fingers instead. Loser to drink and sing a song, a double sconce. Anyone who cant sing can tell a joke instead. But it better be a good one. They all agreed to this new proposal and there was a noisy scene as they began to throw out fingers and make their calls. Wang Ren was the first loser. He drank and sang a song. Bravo! they cried and set to again. Next to lose was one of the girls. She sang a song called Little Miss Glamorous. Then it was Xing De-quan. Everyone wanted a song from him, but he protested that he was tone-deaf Ill tell a joke instead. If nobody laughs, Jia Qiang warned him, youll have to pay another forfeit. Xing downed his cup and began his story Ladies and gentlemen once upon a time, in a certain village, there were two temples - a big one, dedicated to the Great Lord of the North, and by its side a smaller one, dedicated to the Village God. The Great Lord was always inviting the Village God over for a chat. One day something was stolen from his temple, and he asked the Village God to look into the matter. But there are no thieves in this district, protested the lesser deity. It must be carelessness on the part of one of your door-gods. Someone must have sneaked in past them and stolen these things. Nonsense! replied the Great Lord. Youre in charge round these parts. If theres been a theft, then youre responsible. Whats the meaning of this? You should be trying to catch the thief, not accusing my door-gods of being careless! What I meant by careless, prevaricated the Village God, was that your temple must have been badly sited - you know, the Dragon Lines must be at fault I had no idea you could read fengshui, commented the Great Lord in a tone of disbelief. Allow me to take a look for you, offered the Village God, and see what I can see. He walked around the temple, peering into every nook and cranny, and after a while reported My Lord, behind your throne there is a double-leaved red door. An unfortunate oversight. Personally I have a good solid brick wall behind my throne, so naturally I never have things stolen. You can easily remedy the present situation by having a wall built in place of the door. This seemed plausible to the Great Lord, and he instructed his door-gods to call in builders and put up a wall. But we cant even afford a single candle or stick of incense in this temple! moaned the door-gods. How can we possibly buy bricks and mortar and hire the labour to build a wall? The Great Lord could think of no solution. He ordered them to find one, but they were stumped too. Just then the Tortoise General, whose recumbent stone form lay at the Great Lords feet, stood up and said Youre a useless lot! Ive got an idea pull down the red door, and use my belly to block up the doorway. Im sure that will do the job perfectly well. An excellent plan! cried the door-gods in chorus. Convenient, dependable and free! So the Tortoise General became Rear Wall, and peace prevailed - for a while. Then things began to disappear from the temple again. The door-gods summoned the Village God and complained You guaranteed our security if we built a wall, but look whats happened! Weve got a wall and still we re losing things! Your wall cant be solid enough. Have a look at it for yourself, they insisted. The Village God went and did so. It certainly seemed a solid enough wall. All most puzzling. Then he felt it with his hand. Aaah! he exclaimed. No wonder! I meant a properly built wall. Any old thief could push down this false wall jia qiang. They all laughed, even Jia Qiang, whose name had provided the raw material for the joke. Come on, Dumbo! he protested. Be fair! I never called you names! Drink a forfeit, theres a boy! Dumbo, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, willingly complied. They all had a few more cups, and in the general state of intoxication Dumbo let fly a few barbed remarks about his sister Lady Xing, while Wang Ren had a go at desecrating the memory of his Xi-feng, both of them evincing great bitterness.

Their example and the wine lent Jia Huan a little courage, and he too had his fling, complaining how heartless Xi-feng had been, and how she had tried to ruin so many of their lives. Yes, people ought to show a bit of common decency, they all agreed. The way she used Lady Jias influence to bully everyone was dreadful. Well, she died without giving birth to an heir she only ever had a daughter. Retribution in her own lifetime! Jia Yun, who remembered only too well how harsh Xi-feng had once been towards him, and how Qiao-jie had started bawling the instant she set eyes on him, allowed himself to wade into the general melee with some abuse of his own about the two of them. Jia Qiang tried to steer the party in a less vindictive direction Come on! Drink up! This gossip will get us nowhere! How old is the young lady you mentioned? enquired the two Singsong girls. Is she pretty? Oh yes, replied Jia Qiang. Extremely so. Shes about thirteen. What a pity, in that case, that she was born into a family like yours! the girls exclaimed. If 9nly she came from a more humble home, she could soon find herself in a position to bring all her family lots of jobs, and pots of money into the bargain! What do you mean? We know of a certain Mongol prince, replied the girls. Quite a ladies man he is. He is looking for a concubine, and the lady who fits the bill would be able to take her whole family along with her to live in the palace. What a marvellous stroke of luck that would be for somebody! None of them seemed to take much notice of this, except for Wang Ren, who looked very thoughtful. For the present he said nothing and continued drinking. A little later two young lads came in, younger sons of Stewards Lai and Lin. You seem to be having a fine time of it, sirs, by the looks of things! they exclaimed. Everyone rose to greet them. Why have the two of you been such a long time? Weve been expecting you for ages. They explained Early this morning we heard rather a disturbing rumour that out family was in some sort of official trouble again, so we hurried out to see what news we could glean at the Palace. It turned out to have nothing to do with our family after all. In that case, why didnt you come straight here afterwards? It wasnt exactly our family, but it was connected with us. It was that Mr Jia Yu-cun. When we were at the Palace we saw him bound in chains. They told us he was being taken to the High Court for questioning. We knew he was a frequent visitor here, and were afraid that the case might somehow involve us, so we followed them to see what happened. Good thinking, my man! exclaimed Jia Yun. We are most obliged to you. Sit down and have a drink, and then tell us all about it. The two sat down after a polite show of reluctance, and as they drank continued This Mr Yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow, and knows how to pull strings. Hed done extremely well until recently, in fact but greed was his downfall. There were several charges brought against him, avarice and extortion being two of them. As we all know, our present August Sovereign is exceptionally wise, compassionate and benevolent. There is one thing that stirs his wrath, however, and that is corruption, any form of tyrannical or bullying behaviour. So His Majesty decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial. If he is found guilty, things will look pretty grim for him if he is acquitted, then the men who brought the charges will be in for trouble. It is certainly comforting to think what just times we live in! For those lucky enough to be officials in the first place! Like your elder brother, said one of the company, referring to Steward Lais eldest son, Lai Shang-rong.
Jia Lian returned at once and reported to Jia Zheng. Report to your Grandmother, said Jia Zheng, and say that as we are not inviting anybody, the wedding should be kept very simple. She can exercise her discretion over the presents. There is no need to consult me any further. Jia Lian bowed, and went in to convey this message to Grandmother Jia. Meanwhile Lady Wang had told Xi-feng to bring in the presents that were being given on Bao-yus behalf, for Grandmother Jias inspection. She also told Aroma to bring Bao-yu in to see them. He seemed highly amused by the whole business, and said It seems such a waste of everyones time, to send all these things from here to the Garden, and then have them brought all the way back, when its all in the family anyway! This seemed to Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia sufficient proof that, whatever anyone might have said to the contrary, Bao-yu still had his wits about him, and they said as much to each other in tones of some satisfaction. Faithful and the other maids could not help but smile too. They brought the presents in and displayed them one by one, describing them as they went along A gold necklace and other jewellery in gold and precious stones - altogether eighty pieces forty bolts of dragon-brocade for formal wear and one hundred and twenty bolts of silks and satins in various colours one hundred and twenty costumes for the four seasons of the year. They have not had time in the kitchen to prepare the sheep and wine, so this is money in lieu. Grandmother Jia expressed her approval, and said softly to Xi-feng You must tell Mrs Xue not to think of this as an empty formality. In due course, when Pan is back and she has that weight off her mind, she can have these made up into dresses for Chai. In the meantime, we shall take care of all the bedcovers for the wedding-day. Yes Grandmother, replied Xi-feng, and returned to her apartment. She sent Jia Lian over first to Aunt Xues, then summoned Zhou Rui and Brightie to receive their instructions. When delivering the presents, she said, you are not to use the main gate. Use the little side-gate in the garden, that used to be kept open. I shall be going over myself shortly. The side-gate has the advantage of being a long way from the Naiads House. If anyone from any other apartment notices you, you are to tell them on no account to mention it at the Naiads House. Yes maam. The two men departed for Aunt Xues apartment at the head of a contingent of servants bearing the presents. Bao-yu was quite taken in by all this. His new feeling of happy anticipation had caused a general improvement in his health, though his manner of speech remained rather eccentric at times. When the present-bearers returned, the whole thing was accomplished without a single name being mentioned. The family and all the staff knew, but were under orders from Xi-feng to maintain abs6lute secrecy, and no one dared disobey. Dai-yu meanwhile, for all the medicine she took, continued to grow iller with every day that passed. Nightingale did her utmost to raise her spirits. Our story finds her standing once more by Dai-yus bedside, earnestly beseeching her Miss, now that things have come to this pass, I simply must speak my mind. We know what it is thats eating your heart out. But cant you see that your fears are groundless? Why, look at the state Bao-yu is in! How can he possibly get married, when hes so ill? You must ignore these silly rumours, stop fretting and let yourself get better. Dai-yu gave a wraithlike smile, but said nothing. She started coughing again and brought up a lot more blood. Nightingale and Snowgoose came closer and watched her feebly struggling for breath. They knew that any further attempt to rally her would be to no avail, and could do nothing but stand there watching and weeping. Each day Nightingale went over three or four times to tell Grandmother Jia, but Faithful, judging the old ladys attitude towards Dai-yu to have hardened of late, intercepted her reports and hardly mentioned Dai-yu to her mistress. Grandmother Jia was preoccupied with the wedding arrangements, and in the absence of any particular news of Dai-yu, did not show a great deal of interest in the girls fate, considering it sufficient that she should be receiving medical attention. Previously, when she had been ill, Dai-yu had always received frequent visits from everyone in the household, from Grandmother Jia down to the humblest maidservant.
Patience did not ask her to stay, but turned instead to Felicity who was standing at her side and said Go and tell Their Ladyships at once. Felicity informed Ladies Xing and Wang that Xi-feng had vomited blood and would be unable to continue with her duties. Lady Xing suspected Xi-feng of malingering, but refrained from expressing her suspicions in front of her female relatives. Tell Mrs Lian to go and lie down then, she said. No one made any further comment. That evening an endless stream of family and friends came to call, and only thanks to the help of a few close relations could a semblance of normality be maintained. Xi-fengs absence was the cue for many of the staff to give up working altogether, and little now stood between Rong-guo House and total chaos. At ten oclock in the evening, when those guests who lived a long way off had departed, the family began to prepare for the wake, and a chorus of lamentation rose from the womenfolk gathered within the funeral screen. Faithful wept herself into a faint, and had to be propped up and given a vigorous pummelling. When she came round, all she could say was Her Old Ladyship was always so good to me! I want to go with her! Her words were not taken seriously, but were considered a natural, if rather hyperbolic, expression of her grief. Later, when the time came for the wake proper, and over a hundred family and servants were gathered together for the ritual, Faithful was nowhere to be seen, and in the general flurry of activity no one bothered to check where she was. The turn came for Amber and Grandmother Jias other maids to lament and make their offering, and they would have looked for Faithful then to join them, but thought she had probably worn herself out with weeping and gone to lie down somewhere, and decided to let her be. When the ritual was over, Jia Zheng told Jia Lian to ensure that all was ready for the funeral cortege, and discussed with him who was to look after the house in the familys absence. Ive told Yun to stay at home and take charge, said Jia Lian. And Steward Lin and his family will stay behind as well and supervise the dismantling of the awning. I still dont know which of the ladies should be left in charge of the inner apartments. I heard your mother say that Xi-feng was ill and wouldnt be going, replied Jia Zheng. So she will be staying at home anyway. And Cousin Zhens wife suggested that, as she is so seriously ill, Xi-feng should have Xi-chun and a few maids and serving-women to keep her company. Between them they can keep an eye on Grand-mothers apartments. Jia Lian had his reservations about this proposal. You-shi doesnt like Xi-chun, he thought to himself, and is deliberately preventing her from going on the procession. But Xi-chun cant take charge on her own. And Xi-feng is too sick to be of any help. You should go and rest now, Uncle, he said to Jia Zheng. Ill report back to you when Ive had a word with Mother. Jia Zheng nodded, and Jia Lian went in to Lady Xings apartment. Earlier in the evening, Faithful had wandered off on her own, brooding tearfully to herself All my life Ive lived with Her Old Ladyship, and now that shes dead Ive nowhere to turn. Sir She is not at home, thats something to be thankful for, but I dont like the way Lady Xing is behaving. Sir Zheng will never intervene on my behalf, and one way or another the future looks very bleak. The young masters will all be trying to get their way. We shall each of us be dealt with as they think fit, some kept for their beds, some married to their page-boys... Well, I for one wont stand for it! Id rather die! But how? Thats the question She had made her way towards Grandmother Jias inner room. From the threshold she detected a faint form in the dim lamplight within, a lady with a sash in her hand, poised as if in the very act of hanging herself from a beam. Faithful was not in the least frightened. Who can this be? she asked herself. Someone bent on the same course as myself, but with greater resolve ... Who are you? she said aloud. We seem to have the same thought! Let us die together! There was no reply. Faithful walked a little closer and could see now that it was not one of the maids from Grandmother Jias apartment. She looked more carefully. A chill breeze blew past her, and the ladys form vanished into thin air.
You yourself gave judgement in the case when you first held office. Now she is married to a certain Mr Xue and is about to give birth to his child. In so doing she will die. She will leave behind her a son to continue the Xue familys ancestral rites. Now is the moment for her earthly life to cease, and I must be at hand to receive her spirit. With a shake of his sleeve Shi-yin was gone. Yu-cun began to feel very dozy and had soon fallen asleep in the little hermitage at Wake Ness Ferry by Rushford Hythe. Shi-yin went to receive Caltrops soul across the threshold of death and to escort her to the Land of Illusion, there to be handed over to the Fairy Disenchantment and to have her name entered on the register. As he passed through the great archway he saw the monk and the Taoist drifting towards him, and approaching them he said Mahisattva! Illuminate! My felicitations! Is the love karma fulfilled? Have all those souls involved been duly returned and entered in the registers? The karma is not yet complete, they replied. But that senseless Block has already returned. Now all that remains is to restore it to its place of origin and to record the last instalment of its story. Then its little trip into the world will not have been in vain. Shi-yin clasped both hands together in salutation and took his leave. The monk and the Taoist continued on their way bearing the jade, until finally they came to the foot of Green sickness Peak and there, in the very place where Nu-wa had once smelted her fiery amalgam to repair the vault of Heaven, they carefully deposited their burden and each drifted off on his way. An otherworldy tome recounts an otherworldly tale, As Man and Stone become once more a single whole. -16240 5 One day Vanitas the Taoist passed again by Green sickness Peak and saw the Stone that had been found unfit to repair the heavens, lying there still, with characters inscribed on it as before. He read the inscription through carefully again and noticed that a whole new section had been appended to the g tha with which the earlier version concluded. This new material provided several dnouements and tied up various loose ends in the plot, completing the overall design of fate that underlay the original story. When I first saw this strange tale of Brother Stones I thought it worth publishing as a novel and copied it down for that purpose. But at the time it was unfinished the cycle within it was incomplete. There was in the earlier version none of this material relating the Stones return to the source. I wonder when this rather admirable last instalment can have been added? From it the reader can indeed see that Brother Stones experience of life sharpened the edge of his spiritual perception, and brought him to a more complete awareness of the Tao. At the end he had no cause for remorse or regret. But with the passing of the years the characters of this new version of the inscription may wear away and be misread. I had better copy it down again in this complete form and find someone in the world with leisure on his hands to publish it and transmit its message that things are not as they seem, that the extraordinary and the ordinary, truth and fiction, are all relative to each other. Perhaps my fellow humans whom the dream of life has ensnared may find in this tale an echo, may be summoned back by it to their true home while free spirits of the high hills may find in the record of Brother Stones transformations, as in that older tale of the Migration of the Magic Mountain, a reflected light to quicken their own aspirations. So Vanitas copied it all down and slipping this new version into his sleeve took it off with him to the luxurious, opulent world of men, to seek out a suitable mortal for the task of publication. But all the men he encountered were either too busy establishing themselves in their careers, or else too preoccupied with their day-to-day survival, to have the leisure or inclination to prattle with a Stone. Then at last Vanitas came to the little hermitage at Wake Ness Ferry by Rushford Hythe there he found a man asleep from which he deduced him to be a man of leisure and thought he would give him this Story of the Stone to read. But however many times he called out, he could not rouse him from his slumber. Eventually he heaved him up and gave him a good shake, and the man slowly opened his eyes. He skimmed through the book and let it fall from his hand saying I have seen all this myself at first-hand. As far as I can see your record contains no errors. Allow me to tell you of a man who can transmit this story to the world on your behalf, and by so doing bring this strange affair to a proper conclusion.
Jia Zheng went next to see his brother, and then the younger men, and it was agreed that they would worship at the family ancestral shrine first thing the following day. These duties performed, Jia Zheng retreated to his private apartment, where he spoke with Lady Wang and his other womenfolk, and then with Bao-yu, Jia Lan and Jia Huan. To his relief he observed a considerable improvement in Bao-yu, who seemed plumper and healthier than at the time of his departure for Kiangsi. He still knew nothing of the boys mental derangement, and this discernible outward improvement was a source of some satisfaction to him and a welcome antidote to his own anxieties. He dismissed any reservations he still had about the way in which Grandmother Jia had handled the wedding. Bao-chai too, he noticed, seemed more mature and poised than ever, while young Lan was growing into a fine, cultured young man. Jia Zheng was visibly pleased by what he saw. The only blot on the landscape was Jia Huan. He did not seem to have changed in the slightest, and still failed to arouse in his father any flicker of paternal affection or pride. After a silence lasting several minutes Jia Zheng suddenly seemed to think of something. There seems to be one person missing. Lady Wang knew he must be thinking of Dai-yu, whose death she had refrained from mentionmg in any of her letters and as she did not wish to spoil the pleasure of his homecoming by breaking the news to him now, she replied that illness had prevented Dai-yu from being present. This act of deception cut Bao-yu to the quick, but he did his utmost to appear composed, out of respect for his father. Lady Wang invited all the children and grandchildren to the welcoming feast, and they drank to the Masters return. Xi-feng, although she was strictly the daughter-in-law of Jia She and Lady Xing, was also present by virtue of her role as manageress of the household, helping Bao-chai to pour the wine. Jia Zheng cut the party short, saying that after one more round they should all retire. The servants were also dismissed, with instructions to call on him the next day, after the ancestral sacrifice. Jia Zheng and Lady Wang were at last alone and able to talk together. Lady Wang was still reluctant to broach any serious topic when Jia Zheng referred to her brother Wang Zi4engs death, she did her best not to appear too distressed and when he mentioned Xue Pans fresh calamities, her only comment was that he had brought them upon himself. At an opportune moment however she broke the news of Dai-yus death, which seemed to come as a great shock to Jia Zheng, and to affect him deeply. Tears stole down his cheeks, and he sighed several times. Lady Wang herself could no longer contain her tears. Suncloud and her other maids who were standing close by gave her dress a discreet tug, and she quickly composed herself and steered the conversation towards a more cheerful subject. Soon afterwards they went to bed. Early next morning, a ceremony was performed in the ancestral shrine, in the presence of all the young male members of the family, and afterwards Jia Zheng received Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian in the gallery at the side of the shrine, where he asked them for a report of the household accounts, which Cousin Zhen supplied, albeit in a highly selective form. As I have only just returned home, commented Jia Zheng, I do not intend to subject you to an inquisition now, Zhen. But let me say this while I have been away, I have heard it said that you have been allowing standards to slip. You must exercise the utmost diligence and caution. You are older than the other members of your generation, and should set an example to the younger ones. There must be no offence caused to people outside. And that applies to you too, Lian. This is no routine homecoming homily. I have my reasons for warning you. There are things I have heard. I repeat you must both be more careful in future. Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian were by now bright red in the face, and all they could muster was a feeble, Yes, sir. Jia Zheng did not pursue the matter any further, but went in to his own reception hall, where all the menservants were waiting for him thence he proceeded to the inner apartments, to be welcomed by all the maids and serving-women. But we will not describe these events in any great detail. Our story returns to Bao-yu, and to the occasion on the previous day when he had been secretly so upset to hear Lady Wang speak of Dai-yus illness. Jia Zheng had finally granted him permission to leave the family gathering, and he returned to his apartment.
But its no good! I know Ill never come home again! She could contain herself no longer, and tears streamed down her cheeks. Come along now! They all did what they could to cheer her upOf course youll come again! You should be thankful youre not at the other end of the world, like poor Tan. She has almost no chance whatsoever of coming home. This mention of Tan-chun only brought more tears to the eyes of Grandmother Jia and the ladies. Once again, the fact that it was Bao-chais birthday induced one of them to try and strike a more optimistic note Who knows if peace is restored on the coast, Tans father-in4aw may be transferred back to the capital, and then we shall be able to see her! Of course! everyone concurred. Ying-chun had now to contain her grief as best she could and take her leave. They saw her out, and then returned to Grandmother Jias, where the party continued for the rest of that day and into the evening. When they saw that the old lady was tired, they all went their separate ways home. Aunt Xue, after bidding farewell to Grandmother Jia, went to have a talk with Bao-chai Your brother has survived this year, and if he can only receive an Imperial pardon and have his sentence reduced, he may still be able to pay his fine and be set free. These past few years have been so unbearably lonely and wretched for me! Ive been thinking, perhaps I should go ahead with your cousin Kes wedding after all what do you think? Youre anxious about it, arent you, Mama? replied Bao-chai. Pans marriage turned out so badly, and youre worried that Kes will be the same. Well, my advice is to go ahead. You know Xiu-yans character, and have nothing to fear on that account. Life is very hard for her at present. Once shes married into our family, however poor we are, its bound to be better for her than being totally dependent on others as she is now. In that case, said Aunt Xue, will you tell Lady Jia when you have a chance? Ive no one at home, and I should like her to choose a lucky day for the wedding. Just talk it over with Ke and choose a good day between you, said Bao-chai. Then you can let Grandmother and Aunt Xing know, and go ahead with the wedding. Im sure Aunt Xing will be only too glad to be rid of Xiu-yan. I heard today that Xiang-yun is going home, said Aunt Xue. Lady Jia wants Bao-qin to stay on here with you for a few days. She will be marrying too, quite soon, so you should take the chance of having a good chat with her. I will, Mama. Aunt Xue remained with her daughter a little longer, and then after saying goodbye to the others, went home. Let us return to Bao-yu. When he found himself in his apartment again that evening, he pondered his experience of the night before. There was no denying the fact that Dai-yu had failed to appear to him in a dream. That meant one of two things either she had indeed already become a fairy, and was holding herself aloof from intercourse with as coarse a being as himself or else he was just being too impatient. He decided to give this second alternative the benefit of the doubt, and resolved to prolong his experiment a little. Somehow last night, he said to Bao-chai, when I fell asleep outside, I had a sounder nights sleep than I usually do in the inner room. I woke up feeling very calm and refreshed. Ive been thinking, I should like to try it again for another couple of nights. But I suppose you and Aroma will object again... Early that morning when she had heard him reciting the poem, Bao-chai knew it was the memory of Dai-yu that had inspired it. She knew that this obsession of his was something mere words would never cure, and concluded that she might as well let him go ahead and spend the two nights outside, and thus be the agent of his own disenchantment. Anyway, the fact of the matter was that he had slept soundly the previous night. She had been awake herself, and knew. What nonsense! she replied. Why should we object? If you want to sleep there, go ahead. Just dont have any foolish ideas. Youll only be laying yourself open to possession by evil spirits. Bao-yu laughed Why ever should I do that? Aroma was opposed to the plan I think you should sleep in the inner room. Its harder to look after you properly in the outer room. You might catch a chill or something.
She stopped short, thinking it inadvisable to be so rude, and changing her tone somewhat, said Besides, after waiting on a sick person, I fear we would not be fit for such an occasion. And while Miss Lin is still alive, she may ask for me at any time. Li Wan tried to make the peace between them. The truth is, she said, that this maid and Miss Lin have an affinity from a past life. Snowgoose, I know, was Miss Lins original maid from home, but even she is not so indispensable as Nightingale. We really cannot separate them just now. Lins wife, who had been considerably put out by Nightingales outspoken response, was obliged to contain herself when Li Wan came to the maids defence. Seeing Nightingale reduced to floods of tears, she eyed her with a hostile smile and said I shall ignore Miss Nightingales rudeness. But am I to report what you have just said to Her Old Ladyship? And am I to tell Mrs Lian? As she was speaking, Patience came out of Dai-yus bedchamber, wiping her eyes Tell Mrs Lian what.? she asked. Lins wife told her the substance of their conversation. Patience lowered her head in thought. After a moment, she said Why cant you take Snowgoose? Would she do? asked Li Wan. Patience went up to her and whispered a few words in her ear. Li Wan nodded, and said Well in that case, it will be just as good if we send Snowgoose. Will Miss Snowgoose do? Lins wife asked Patience. Yes, replied Patience. She will do just as well. Then will you please tell her to come with me straight away, said Lins wife. I shall report to Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. I shall say that you are both responsible for the arrangement, mind. And later you can tell Mrs Lian yourself, Miss Patience. Of course, replied Li Wan curtly. Do you mean to say that someone as old and experienced as you cannot even take the responsibility for a small thing like this? Lins wife smiled. It is not that I cant take the responsibility. It is just that Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian have arranged everything and the likes of us dont really know whats going on. In the circumstances, it seems only right to mention you and Miss Patience. Patience had already told Snowgoose to come out. Over the past few days Snowgoose had fallen rather into disfavour with Dai-yu, who had called her a silly, ignorant child, and her feelings of loyalty towards her mistress had as a consequence been rather blunted. Besides there was no question of her disobeying an order from Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. She therefore tidied her hair quickly and made ready to go. Patience told her to change into her smartest clothes and to go with Mrs Lin. Patience herself stayed on and spoke for a short while with Li Wan. Before she left, Li Wan instructed her to call in on Lins wife on her way and tell her that her husband should make the necessary preparations for Dai-yu with all possible speed. This Patience agreed to do and went on her way. As she turned a corner in the Garden, she caught sight of Lins wife walking ahead of her with Snowgoose and called to her to wait. I will take Snowgoose with me. You go and tell your husband to prepare Miss Lins things. I will report to Mrs Lian for you. Yes, Miss Patience, said Lins wife, and went on her errand. Patience then took Snowgoose to the bridal apartment, and reported there herself before going to see to her own affairs. When Snowgoose saw the wedding preparations in full swing and thought of Dai-yu lying at deaths door, she felt a pang of grief. But she dared not show her feelings in the presence of Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng. What can they want me for? she wondered. I must see what is going on. I know Bao-yu used to be head over heels in love with Miss Lin. And yet now he seems to have deserted her. I begin to wonder if this illness of his is genuine or just a pretence. He may have made the whole thing up so as to avoid upsetting Miss Lin. By pretending to lose his jade and acting like an idiot, perhaps he thinks he can put her off, and marry Miss Chai with a clear conscience? I must watch him closely, and see if he acts the fool when he sees me. Surely he wont keep up the pretence on his wedding-day? She slipped in and stood spying at the inner doorway. Now, though Bao-yus mind was still clouded from the loss of his jade, his sense of joy at the prospect of marrying Dai-yu - in his eyes the most blessed, the most wonderful thing that had happened in heaven or earth since time began - had caused a temporary resurgence of physical well-being, if not a full restoration of his mental faculties.
It worries me so, seeing you in this state. I only wish I could be here with you all the time, and help keep the peace. But I cant. Bao-yu would never let me come back, however halfwitted he may be. The other day Sir Zheng sent a message home to say how shocked he was to read the report in the Gazette. He has already sent one of his men to try to intervene on Pans behalf. So you see - there are so many people trying to help Pan Out of this mess hes made. And thank goodness Im at least close by. I think if I were living a long way off and heard that this had happened, Id simply die worrying about you. Please, Mama, give yourself a moments respite. Be thankful that Pan is still alive. Use this opportunity to take stock. Ask one of the older men in the firm to find Out what we owe and what we are owed, and see exactly how much we have left. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue tearfully, the past few days I have been so preoccupied with your brother I simply havent had time to tell you of our own troubles. Whenever youve come to see me its either been you trying to cheer me up or me giving you the latest news from the yamen. I havent told you the worst. We have been struck off the register of court purveyors. Two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale, while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and were involved in another court case over that. Your cousin Ke has been out every day trying to collect some of the money owing to us. Our liabilities here will probably amount to several tens of thousands of taels, and we shall have to sell our share of the Nanking joint-stock business and some property as well, in order to meet our obligations. Two days ago I even heard a rumour that the pawnbroking side of the Nanking business has g6ne bankrupt and been closed down! If that turns out to be true, I really have come to the end of the road! Aunt Xue began weeping hysterically. Ba-chai was also in tears by now, but tried to comfort her Theres no sense in your distressing yourself about the finances, Mama. Let Cousin Ke take care of that. Though I must say it is distressing to see our employees abandon us and turn against us the moment were down on our luck. I can understand them wanting to save their own skins but I know that some of them are actually encouraging outsiders to cheat us out of our money. As for Pans friends, its a waste of time expecting any help from them. The only thing theyre any good for is parties. The first sign of trouble and theyre of. If you love me, Mama, please listen to my words of advice. At your age its time you took more care of yourself and worried about others less. Remember, even if the worst comes to the worst, youll manage somehow or other. Forget about the clothes and furniture. Let Jin-gui have them. Not many of the servants or serving-women will want to stay on, so you may as well let most of them go too. I feel sorry for Caltrop. After everything shes been through, I think you should keep her on with you. If you ever run short of anything, I can always help out, provided weve got it at home. Im sure he wouldnt mind. And Aroma is a decent sort of girl. She knows about our troubles in fact the slightest mention of your name brings tears to her eyes. He doesnt know that anythings the matter, so he hasnt been particularly worried. If he were to learn the truth, I think the shock might be too much for him. Dear girl, said Aunt Xue, not waiting for her to finish, whatever you do, dont tell him. He nearly died on account of Miss Lin. Hes a little better now. If he were to have a sudden relapse, it would be such a trial for you! And then if you had to spend all your time nursing him, I should be robbed of my last source of comfort. Ive thought of that, replied Bao-chai. Thats why I havent told him. At that very moment Xue Pans wife Jin-gui came running into the outer room, screaming Whats the good of being alive? My mans done for now anyway. Its no use pretending! The least we can do is march along to the execution ground and put up a fight! Weve got nothing to lose! With this she began banging her head against the wooden partition, till her hair came undone and fell in disorder about her shoulders. Aunt Xue could only stare at her in speechless rage, while Bao-chai tried to reason with her dear sister-in-law, her good sister-in-law, all to no avail.
None of these was really a plausible candidate. The Only person for the job was Xi-feng. With Jia Lian in charge of the outside, it would make good sense for her to run the inside and look after the lady guests. She had always had great confidence in herself in the past and had assumed that Grandmother Jias funeral would be the culmination of her career, an opportunity for her to prove how indispensable she was. Ladies Xing and Wang remembered how well she had coped with Qin Ke-qings funeral, and thought they could rely on her to repeat her success. When therefore they absolved her from her duties as a mourner and asked her to take over full responsibility as manageress once more, she could hardly refuse. After all, she thought to herself, Ive always been in charge here. The servants are used to taking orders from me. It was Lady Xings servants and You-shis who were hard to handle before, and theyve all gone. It will be less convenient settling bills without tallies, but I shall have cash available from Grandmothers fund, so there should be no problem. It will help having Lian in charge of his side of the reception, too. Even though Im not well, I think I should be able to get by without discrediting mysel Its bound to be easier than Qin Ke-qings funeral. She waited until the morning after the Third Day, during which ceremonies were held welcoming back the spirit of the deceased. Then she told Zhou Ruis wife to summon a general assembly of the staff and to bring the registers. When she scrutinized them, she found that altogether there were only twenty-one men, nineteen serving-women, and a dozen or so maids. It would not be enough. Why, we have fewer servants for Lady Jias funeral than we had for Qin Ke-qings! she thought to herself with dismay. Even after calling in extra hands from the country estates, there would still be a serious shortage. She was turning this problem over in her mind when one of the junior maids came in Miss Faithful would like you to go over and see her, Mrs Lian. Somewhat reluctantly Xi-feng went over to Grandmother Jias apartment, where she found Faithful in floods of tears. The moment she saw Xi-feng, she clutched hold of her and cried Please be seated, Mrs Lian, and let me kowtow to you! I know one shouldnt do such things during a period of mourning, but I really must! Faithful fell to her knees, and Xi-feng held out her hands to prevent her. Come on! Whats the meaning of all this? If youve something on your mind, then just go ahead and say it! Faithful insisted on kneeling, and Xi-feng continued her attempts to pull her to her feet. Her Old Ladyships funeral has been placed entirely in your hands and Mr Lians, sobbed Faithful. Her Old Ladyship left a special sum of money to pay for it. While she was alive, Her Old Ladyship never wasted a penny on herself now that the time has come for her funeral, I beg you, maam, to do the right thing by her and give her a proper send-off! Just now I heard the Master talking about it The Book of Songs this, and Confucius that - I didnt understand a word of what he said. I caught one sentence, though In funerals, sincere grief is of more importance than outward show. I asked Mrs Bao to explain what he meant, and she said that the Master wants to keep the funeral a simple affair. He believes that heart-felt grief is the truest form of devotion, and that there is no need for extravagant display. But as I see it, for someone like Her Old Ladyship, things ought to be a bit grand. I know Im only a servant, and have no right to speak in these matters, but I feel that Her Old Ladyship loved us both during her lifetime, maam, both you and me, and now that shes dead we owe it to her to send her off with a bit of style! I know how good you are at that sort of thing, maam, and I wanted to ask for your support, so that we could decide together whats best. Ive been with Her Old Ladyship all my life, and death cannot part us! If I dont see this done properly, how am I ever to look her in the face again? Xi-feng found Faithfuls way of talking rather odd. Dont you worry, she replied. Of course everything will be done in proper style. Sir Zheng may talk of economy, but we have certain standards to maintain. Well spend every penny of the money on Lady Jia, if need be.
While weve been talking weve already walked past Green Delights. And look - she turned back and pointed - theres the Naiads House, over there! Bao-yus eyes followed the direction of her pointing hand. If weve already passed it, then lets go back and have a look. Its getting rather late now, said Aroma. Her Old Ladyship will be waiting for you to start dinner. Wed better go back to the party. Bao-yu said nothing. He walked on, along the route he imagined he had trodden so many times in the past, and began making his way towards his Naiads House. Percipient Reader, it will no doubt have surprised you to hear that Bao-yu had lost his way in the Garden after an absence of less than a year. The truth of the matter is that Bao-yu was quite correct in his orientation it was Aroma who, anticipating his reaction to the sight of the Naiads House, had at first deliberately kept him occupied with conversation, and then when she saw him walking instinctively in that direction despite her efforts - heading, as she feared, straight into the arms of evil spirits -had tried to convince him that they had already walked past the place. Bao-yus heart was fixed, however his compass was firmly set, and he was not to be so easily diverted. He pressed ahead, and reluctantly Aroma followed. Suddenly he stood still. He seemed to be listening and watching. What is it? asked Aroma. Is there someone living there now? he asked. I should hardly think so, she replied. I could have sworn I heard someone weeping inside! There must be someone! Youre imagining things, said Aroma. Its because you always used to come here and find Miss Lin crying. Bao-yu was unconvinced and still wanted to approach and listen from a closer distance. The old women hurried forward Its getting rather late now, sir. Time to be getting back. Were not afraid of going anywhere else in the Garden, but just here the way is so dark and you never know... Weve heard tell that since Miss Lin died theyre always hearing sounds of weeping here. No one will come near the place. Bao-yu and Aroma both started when they heard this. You see! I told you! cried Bao-yu, the tears springing to his eyes. Oh, Cousin Lin! Cousin Lin! he sobbed. How could I have wounded you so! Please dont reproach me! Dont feel bitter towards me! It was my father and mother who made the choice. In my heart I was always true to you! With each word he became more and mote distraught, and finally broke into a great wail of grief. Aroma was wondering what on earth to do, when she saw Ripple hurrying towards her with a cohort of serving-women. Are you quite out of your mind! cried Ripple. Bringing Mr Bao here of all places! Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship are dreadfully worried and have sent everywhere to look for him. Just now the women on the side gate said theyd seen the two of you come in here. Their Ladyships had the fright of their lives when they heard! They scolded me and told me to form a search party and come straight here. Hurry up now, wed better be quick! Bao-yu was still sobbing pitifully, but Aroma and Ripple dragged him away, wiping the tears from his eyes and chiding him with a description of the anxiety his grandmother was suffering on his account. In the end he gave in and followed them back. Aroma could imagine only too vividly how worried Grandmother Jia would be and she took Bao-yu straight back to the old ladys apartment. None of the party had gone home they were all there waiting for Bao-yus return. Aroma! cried Grandmother Jia severely. I thought you were a sensible girl. Thats why Ive always trusted you with Bao-yu. How could you take him into the Garden? Hes only just beginning to get better, and a nasty experience might set him right back. And then where would we be? Aroma did not dare say a word in her own defence, but hung her head in shame. Bao-chai for her part was deeply shocked to see how pale Bao-yu seemed on his return. Bao-yu refused to watch Aroma take the blame, and spoke up on her behalf When we went in it was broad daylight, and there was nothing to be afraid of. I havent been for a walk in the Garden for such a long time, and today Id had a little wine at the party and was feeling in the mood for a stroll.
She blushed fiercely and her heart missed a beat. Mr Bao! she whispered. Whatevers on your mind, just go ahead and say it. But please stop behaving like this. Bao-yu let go of her hand. If Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently Thats what Skybright said. Surely you must have heard? It seemed quite plain to Fivey what manner of different behaviour he had in mind. She felt she must protest If thats what she said, she should have been ashamed of herself! No decent girl would suggest a thing like that! Dont you start preaching at me too! snapped Bao-yu irritably. I was thinking how like Skybright you looked - thats the only reason I told you what she said. How dare you slander her! Fivey could no longer discern Bao-yus true intentions. Its late, she said. You really should go to sleep and not sit up like this. You might catch cold. Didnt you hear what Mrs Bao and Aroma said just now? Im not cold, said Bao-yu. As he said this, it suddenly struck him that Fivey was most inadequately clad, and that she might catch a chill just as Skybright had done. Why arent you wearing a proper robe? he asked her. You called, and it sounded important, she replied. I was hardly going to take time off to dress! I would have, mind you, if Id kndwn you were going to keep me talking this long. Bao-yu handed Fivey the pale blue silken padded jacket that was lying on the bed, and told her to put it on. But she refused. You keep it - Im not cold. And anyway, Ive a perfectly good robe of my own. She went across to her bed and put on a long robe. She listened out for a moment. Musk was sound asleep. She crossed slowly back to Bao-yu I thought you were supposed to be having a quiet night? Bao-yu smiled. To tell you the truth, that was never my intention. Actually, I was hoping to meet a fairy... His words strengthened her suspicions. Who do you mean? Ill tell you if you like, he replied. But its a long story. Youd better come up here and sit next to me... But youre all tucked up in bed! she protested, blushing again and smiling coyly. How can I possibly sit next to you? Why not? One night a year or two ago, when the weather was cold and Skybright stayed up to play a trick on Musk, I was afraid she was going to catch a chill, so I tucked her under my quilt to keep her warm. Whats wrong with it? People shouldnt be so prudish. Fivey thought he was merely putting ideas into her head. She did not know that he sincerely meant every word he said. She contemplated her dilemma. She could hardly escape and yet if she remained, it would be equally awkward for her to remain standing or to sit down beside him. She gave him a little glance and her face puckered into a smile Dont say such silly things! People might hear. No wonder you have such a reputation. How can you still need to go flirting, with two such beautiful ladies as Mrs Bao and Aroma by your side! Dont you ever suggest such a thing again, or Ill report you to Mrs Bao. And then youll have cause to be ashamed! As she was speaking there was a sudden noise outside, which startled them both, and shortly afterwards Bao-chai could be heard coughing in the inner room. Bao-yu made a quick motion with his lips, and Fivey hurriedly extinguished the lamp and stole back to bed. In fact, earlier that evening, both Bao-chai and Aroma had gone straight to sleep, exhausted after their previous sleepless night and the days exertions, and both of them had slept soundly through this conversation between Bao-yu and Fivey. It was the sudden noise in the courtyard that had woken them too. They listened for any further sound, but all was quiet. Bao-yu meanwhile lay down in bed again, and was thinking to himself That noise must surely have been Cousin Lin! She came, and then, when she heard me talking with Fivey, she decided to give us both a fright. He lay there tossing and turning, a thousand wild fancies running through his head, and only nodded off some time after three in the morning. Bao-yus advances had left Fivey with a guilty conscience, and when Bao-chai coughed she feared that they had both been overheard, and lay awake worrying about it all night. Early the next morning she rose, and seeing Bao-yu still fast asleep, began quietly tidying the room.
Now theyll be laughing at us. Tomorrow you must tell your menfolk to make sure our carriages and horses are prepared well in advance. We dont want any last-minute panics. Yes, maam. Li Wans servants went about their business. Our story now turns to Shi Xiang-yun. Earlier, because of her husbands illness, she had only been able to come once to mourn for Grandmother Jia. She calculated now that there were two days left before the funeral procession was due to set off and since her husbands condition had been positively diagnosed as a consumption, and he was therefore in no immediate danger, she decided she must call once more. She came on the day before the final wake. She recalled all Grandmother Jias love for her, and then her thoughts turned to her own fate, to have married such a fine husband, a man of such grace and talent, of such a gentle disposition, only to watch him being taken from her slowly and inexorably by an illness whose roots must surely lie in some previous lifetime. She wept with renewed grief for most of that night, despite the persistent efforts of Faithful and the other maids to console her. Bao-yu was unbearably distressed by the sight of Xiang-yuns weeping, but could hardly go to comfort her in the midst of the ceremonial lamentations. The plain mourning-clothes she was wearing and the absence of any make-up seemed to make her even prettier than before her marriage. He looked round at Bao-qin and the other girls they too were plainly dressed, with a minimum of ornamentation. The very simplicity lent a charm and grace to their appearance. His eyes rested on Bao-chai how well mourning-clothes became her! She looked even more attractive than in her everyday attire. The men of old, mused Bao-yu to himself, used to say that of all flowers none could rival the splendour of plum-blossom, not for its early blooming but for the incomparable purity of its whiteness, the unsurpassable freshness and delicacy of its scent. If only Cousin Lin were here now, and dressed in a simple mourning gown, how exquisitely beautiful she would look! He felt a pang of grief, tears rolled down his cheeks, and he began sobbing loudly and unrestrainedly. It was a funeral after all, and no one would think such behaviour out of place. The ladies were already busy rallying Xiang-yun when suddenly they heard another familiar voice break out wailing on the outside of the screen. They surmised that both cousins were overwhelmed by memories of Grandmother Jias past love and kindness, and little guessed that Xiang-yun and Bao-yu each had private cause for grief. Their heart-felt lamentations soon brought tears to everyones eyes, and it fell to Aunt Xue and old Mrs Li to offer comfort and counsel moderation. The following day was the wake proper, and therefore busier than ever. Xi-feng was utterly exhausted, but there was nothing for it, she had to struggle on and muddle her way through the morning, even though she had by now lost her voice. By the afternoon, when the number of guests reached its peak and demands were being made on her from all quarters, she had reached breaking point and was searching in desperation for some second wind when a young maid came running in Here you are, maam! No wonder Lady Xing is so cross! So many guests, she said. I cant possibly take care of them. Where is Mrs Lian? Hiding somewhere with her feet up, Ill be bound! This unmerited rebuke provoked a sudden surge of indignation within Xi-feng. She struggled to control herself, but tears started to her eyes, and all went black before her. A sickly taste rose into her mouth and she began to vomit up quantities of bright red blood. The strength ebbed from her legs and she sank to the ground. Luckily Patience was at hand and hurried over to support her mistress as she crouched there, blood gushing from her mouth in an unstaunchable stream. To learn if she survived this crisis or not, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 111 A devoted maid renders a final service, and accompanies her mistress to the Great Void A villainous slave takes his revenge, and betrays his masters into the hands of thieves Patience hurried forward, and with the help of another maid she raised Xi-feng from the ground and gently escorted her to her room. There she laid her down with great care on the kang and told Crimson to bring a cup of hot water and hold it to her lips. Xi-feng drank a sip of the water and then sank into a heavy sleep. Autumn came briefly into the room, glanced at her lying there, and walked out again.
Mrs Lian and Her Old Ladyship, replied the stewards wife, have decided that they need Miss Nightingale in attendance over there. Before Li Wan could say anything, Nightingale spoke up for herself Mrs Lin, will you be so kind as to leave now? Cant you even wait until she is dead? We will leave her then, you need not fear. How can you be so... She stopped short, thinking it inadvisable to be so rude, and changing her tone somewhat, said Besides, after waiting on a sick person, I fear we would not be fit for such an occasion. And while Miss Lin is still alive, she may ask for me at any time. Li Wan tried to make the peace between them. The truth is, she said, that this maid and Miss Lin have an affinity from a past life. Snowgoose, I know, was Miss Lins original maid from home, but even she is not so indispensable as Nightingale. We really cannot separate them just now. Lins wife, who had been considerably put out by Nightingales outspoken response, was obliged to contain herself when Li Wan came to the maids defence. Seeing Nightingale reduced to floods of tears, she eyed her with a hostile smile and said I shall ignore Miss Nightingales rudeness. But am I to report what you have just said to Her Old Ladyship? And am I to tell Mrs Lian? As she was speaking, Patience came out of Dai-yus bedchamber, wiping her eyes Tell Mrs Lian what.? she asked. Lins wife told her the substance of their conversation. Patience lowered her head in thought. After a moment, she said Why cant you take Snowgoose? Would she do? asked Li Wan. Patience went up to her and whispered a few words in her ear. Li Wan nodded, and said Well in that case, it will be just as good if we send Snowgoose. Will Miss Snowgoose do? Lins wife asked Patience. Yes, replied Patience. She will do just as well. Then will you please tell her to come with me straight away, said Lins wife. I shall report to Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. I shall say that you are both responsible for the arrangement, mind. And later you can tell Mrs Lian yourself, Miss Patience. Of course, replied Li Wan curtly. Do you mean to say that someone as old and experienced as you cannot even take the responsibility for a small thing like this? Lins wife smiled. It is not that I cant take the responsibility. It is just that Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian have arranged everything and the likes of us dont really know whats going on. In the circumstances, it seems only right to mention you and Miss Patience. Patience had already told Snowgoose to come out. Over the past few days Snowgoose had fallen rather into disfavour with Dai-yu, who had called her a silly, ignorant child, and her feelings of loyalty towards her mistress had as a consequence been rather blunted. Besides there was no question of her disobeying an order from Her Old Ladyship and Mrs Lian. She therefore tidied her hair quickly and made ready to go. Patience told her to change into her smartest clothes and to go with Mrs Lin. Patience herself stayed on and spoke for a short while with Li Wan. Before she left, Li Wan instructed her to call in on Lins wife on her way and tell her that her husband should make the necessary preparations for Dai-yu with all possible speed. This Patience agreed to do and went on her way. As she turned a corner in the Garden, she caught sight of Lins wife walking ahead of her with Snowgoose and called to her to wait. I will take Snowgoose with me. You go and tell your husband to prepare Miss Lins things. I will report to Mrs Lian for you. Yes, Miss Patience, said Lins wife, and went on her errand. Patience then took Snowgoose to the bridal apartment, and reported there herself before going to see to her own affairs. When Snowgoose saw the wedding preparations in full swing and thought of Dai-yu lying at deaths door, she felt a pang of grief. But she dared not show her feelings in the presence of Grandmother Jia and Xi-feng. What can they want me for? she wondered. I must see what is going on. I know Bao-yu used to be head over heels in love with Miss Lin. And yet now he seems to have deserted her. I begin to wonder if this illness of his is genuine or just a pretence. He may have made the whole thing up so as to avoid upsetting Miss Lin.
He replied to Jia Bao-yus remarks in what he deemed to be a fitting vein Long have I known of your great gifts. I fear that, before a person of such egregious purity, refinement and grace, I am but an ordinary and foolish mortal, and that by sharing your name I do but tarnish its lustre. He seems a sympathetic enough character, pondered Jia Bao-yu upon hearing this. But why does he flatter me almost as if I were a girl? We are both of us men, and therefore creatures of impurity. Your praise is alas undeserved, he said. I am but a dull and foolish creature, a mere lump of senseless stone! How can I compare with a person of such quality and nobility as yourself? It is I who am unworthy of the name that we both bear. When I was young, mused Zhen Bao-yu aloud for his new friends benefit, I was blind to my own limitations and entertained ideas far above my station. But then my family fell on hard times, and we have all spent the past few years in greatly reduced circumstances. As a result, although I can hardly lay claim to a comprehensive experience of lifes vicissitudes, I feel I may have acquired some slight knowledge of the ways of the world, some meagre understanding of human nature. You, on the other hand, have lived in the lap of luxury all your life, you have lacked for nothing, and you have, I am sure, been able to achieve great distinction in your literary compositions and in the study of public affairs, a distinction that has caused your honourable father to hold you in high esteem, and to view you with great pride and affection. I say again, you are worthy of the fine name that we both bear. Jia Bao-yu recognized by now the telltale rhetoric of the career worm and fell silent, wondering how best to respond, while Jia Huan for his part began to feel uncomfortable at having been so entirely excluded from the conversation. Jia Lan, however, found Zhen Bao-yus little sermon most congenial You are altogether too modest, sir. Surely, in the fields of literary composition and public affairs of which you speak, it is precisely from long experience that true ability and knowledge are derived. I am of course too young to claim any knowledge of literary composition, but a careful perusal of the little that I have read has led me to the conclusion that external grace and meretricious refinement are of little worth when compared with the cultivation of a good character. Jia Bao-yu found his nephews remarks nauseatingly priggish, and wondered where on earth he had picked up this way of speaking. He attempted to forestall a reply in like vein from Zhen Bao-yu I had always understood from what I had heard of you that you condemned vulgar and commonplace notions, and had formed your own personal view of the world. I was so happy to have had this opportunity of meeting you today, and of learning from you something that would help me transcend this mortal realm we live in and enter a more spiritual plane. I felt sure that such an encounter would help to cleanse my heart of worldly desires, and open my eyes to a more profound view of life. Alas, it is clear from your words that you consider me a coarse creature, and have therefore treated me out of politeness to this rigmarole 6f worldly wisdom. Young Zhen reflected Clearly he has heard tales of me as a child, and therefore thinks that I was speaking out of mere politeness, masking my true nature. I must be frank with him. Who knows, he may even turn out to be a true friend. I fully appreciate the sincerity of your remarks, he began. When I was young, I too abhorred anything that smacked of the platitude and the cliche. But I grew older, and when my father resigned from his post and had little further inclination for social entertaining, the role of host devolved upon me. In the course of my duties I observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom I met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name. All their written works or spoken words were of l6yalty and filial piety, their entire lives were devoted to virtue and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed upon them by their fathers and teachers alike. So gradually I cast off the intractable theories and foolish passions of my youth. I am still searching for teachers and friends of a like mind to instruct me and guide me out of my benighted ignorance, and I consider it a great blessing to have met you. I feel sure that I have much to learn from you. Believe me, what I said earlier was in earnest.
I have been worrying about the same thing myself replied Bao-chai. Your proposal is a very sensible one. So from then on Oriole was put in charge. Bao-yu never left his room now. Every day he sent someone else to pay respects to his mother on his behalf. Lady Wangs delight at this new regime of his needs no description. -1536 When the third of the eighth came round Grandmother Jias birthday, Bao-yu went early in the morning to kowtow at her shrine and then returned to his quiet room. After breakfast, Bao-chai, Aroma and some of the maids had gone to sit in the front room and were chatting with Ladies Xing and Wang, and he was sitting alone in his room, deep in concentration, when Oriole carne in with a tray of sweetmeats. Her Ladyship asked me to bring these for you, she said. They are offerings left over from Her Old Ladyships sacrifice. Bao-yu rose to his feet to thank her and then sat down again. Put them over there, he said. As she placed the tray to one side, Oriole said to him in an undertone Her Ladyship has been speaking very highly of you in the front room. Bao-yu smiled. Oriole continued She said that now you are studying so hard, you are sure to pass your exam and then if you go on and become a Palace Graduate and an official, your parents hopes for you will not have been in vain. Oriole suddenly remembered what Bao-yu had once said to her, the day she had knotted tassels for him. I hope you do pass! she went on animatedly. It will be such a blessing for our mistress. Remember what you said that day in the Garden, when you asked me to knot you a plum-blossom tassel? You wondered what lucky household the mistress would take me to when she married? Well, you were the lucky one after all! There was something about what she said and the way she said it that aroused in Bao-yu once more an old and all too human emotion. But the nostalgia soon passed he composed himself again and said with a gentle smile So, according to you, I am lucky, and so is your mistress. But how do you feel about it? Oriole flushed at once, and forced a smile Were just maids. Being lucky or not doesnt really enter into it for us. Bao-yu smiled again As a matter of fact, even if you did spend your whole life as a maid, you might turn out to have been luckier than either of us. This sounded to Oriole like more of his foolishness. She was afraid of being responsible for another of his scenes, and deemed it prudent to leave, but before she could do so, Bao-yu laughed Silly girl! Let me tell you something. If you want to know what it was, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 119 Bao-yu becomes a Provincial Graduate and severs worldly ties The House of Jia receives Imperial favour and renews ancestral glory As we told in the last chapter, Oriole, perplexed by Bao-yus words, had been about to leave when she heard him speak again Silly girl! Let me tell you something. If your mistress is lucky, then so are you, since you are her maid. Aroma cannot be depended upon. In future, mark my words, you must look after your mistress with care and devotion, and in the end you may receive a fitting reward for your years of service. To Oriole Bao-yus speech, although it began with some semblance of sense, tailed off into rambling nonsense. Well, she replied, Id better be going now. Madam is waiting for me. If you want any more sweets, Mr Bao, just send one of the junior maids to fetch me. Bao-yu nodded and Oriole went on her way. Shortly afterwards, Bao-chai and Aroma returned from the front room. The time drew near for the examination. All the family were full of eager anticipation, hoping that the two boys would write creditable compositions and bring the family honour. All except for Bao-chai while it was true that Bao-yu had prepared well, she had also on occasions noticed a strange indifference in his behaviour. Her first concern. was that the two boys, for both of whom this was the first venture of its kind, might get hurt or have some accident in the crush of men and vehicles around the examination halls. She was more particularly worried for Bao-yu, who had not been out at all since his encounter with the monk. His delight in studying seemed to her the result of a somewhat too hasty and not altogether convincing conversion, and she had a premonition that something untoward was going to happen.
This is truly the end! He sighed, and his cheeks were wet with tears. Xue Ke tried to console him, and then went Out again to gather more news. Things look bad, he reported later that day. At the Board of Punishments, I could discover nothing about the two princes and their report to the throne. But I did learn something else. Early this morning a censor named Li presented an impeachment against the magistrate of Ping-an, accusing him of toadying to a metropolitan official, of pandering to his superiors and of Oppressing the common people - together with a whole string of serious related offences. What has that to do with us? replied Jia Zheng somewhat impatiently. What about our own people? The two cases are connected, said Xue Ke. The metropolitan official referred to in Censor Lis impeachment is in fact Uncle She which means that he is implicated in a miscarriage of justice - which is a serious offence. His friends at court want to keep their hands clean if they possibly can, and there is no one even willing to keep us informed. Its the same with the guests who fled from the party just now - they have either gone home, or found some other hiding place in which to lie low until the storm blows over. A few members of the clan are even publicly asking who will be the lucky one to get the title now that the family has been disgraced. They all have an eye on it ... Jia Zheng stamped his foot and interrupted him again This is all the consequence of my elder brothers folly! And of the disgraceful ways into which Ning-guo House had fallen! But enough of this. Who knows if Lady Jia and Lians wife are even still alive! You had best return and continue your enquiries, while I go and see how Lady Jia is. If you have any news, bring it as quickly as you can. As they were speaking, a confused cry was heard from within Her Old Ladyship is sinking! Jia Zheng hurried away in great alarm. To learn if she lived, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 106 Wang Xi-feng feels remorse for the consequences of her past misdeeds And Grandmother Jia prays for the familys deliverance from further calamity Jia Zheng hurried straight in to Grandmother Jias apartment. The shock of the days events had finally taken its toll, and she was unconscious again and breathing fitfully. Lady Wang, with the help of Faithful and the other maids, eventually brought her round. They persuaded her to swallow one of her combined dispersant and sedative boluses, which brought some slight relief. But she remained tearful and distraught. Jia Zheng stood by her side and tried to comfort her and rally her spirits It is Brother She and I who have brought this misfortune on the family and caused you all this distress, Mother. Please try to take heart a little. We will do our utmost to set things to rights. If you should suffer in any way, our burden of guilt will be unbearable! I am over eighty now, replied the old lady, and ever since the day I came here as a girl and was married to your father, I have led a sheltered life. I have been blessed and protected by the family ancestors. Ive never even heard of such terrible goings-on as these. I am too old for it all. I couldnt bear to see you punished. Id rather die, and be spared the ordeal. She burst into tears once again, and Jia Zheng grew more and more agitated about her condition. Suddenly a voice was heard outside calling News from court for the Master! Jia Zheng hurried out. The Prince of Bei-jings aide-de-camp was waiting for him in the main reception hall, and greeted him with the words Excellent news, sir! Jia Zheng thanked the aide for coming and begged him to be seated. What are my instructions from His Highness? he asked. My master and His Highness the Prince of Xi-ping presented a joint report to His Majesty, and spoke at some length on your behalf, sir, stressing your penitence and your great appreciation of the clemency shown to you by the throne. His Majesty was most sympathetic, and mindful of the recent demise of Her Grace, he has resolved not to punish you, but instead to restore you to your former post as Under-Secretary at the Board of Works. Of the family property held under restraint, only that portion belonging to Sir She is to be confiscated. The rest will all be returned to you. His Majesty urges you to resume your official duties with diligence. The matter of the promissory notes will be investigated personally by my master. Any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be confiscated outright according to the relevant statute notes negotiated at permissible rates, together with title-deeds of houses and land, will all be returned.
I caught one sentence, though In funerals, sincere grief is of more importance than outward show. I asked Mrs Bao to explain what he meant, and she said that the Master wants to keep the funeral a simple affair. He believes that heart-felt grief is the truest form of devotion, and that there is no need for extravagant display. But as I see it, for someone like Her Old Ladyship, things ought to be a bit grand. I know Im only a servant, and have no right to speak in these matters, but I feel that Her Old Ladyship loved us both during her lifetime, maam, both you and me, and now that shes dead we owe it to her to send her off with a bit of style! I know how good you are at that sort of thing, maam, and I wanted to ask for your support, so that we could decide together whats best. Ive been with Her Old Ladyship all my life, and death cannot part us! If I dont see this done properly, how am I ever to look her in the face again? Xi-feng found Faithfuls way of talking rather odd. Dont you worry, she replied. Of course everything will be done in proper style. Sir Zheng may talk of economy, but we have certain standards to maintain. Well spend every penny of the money on Lady Jia, if need be. Before she died, said Faithful, Her Old Ladyship said that everything left over after the family distribution had been made was to be given to us. If theres not enough money for the funeral expenses, maam, then take our share of Her Old Ladyships belongings and pawn them. Whatever the Master may say, he can hardly go against Her Old Ladyships last wishes. He was here himself when she divided everything up. Youve always been such a sensible girl, said Xi-feng. Whats got into you today? Nothings got into me, protested Faithful. I just know that Lady Xing doesnt care, and that the Master is being too cautious. It may be that you are of the same mind as the Master, maam. If youre afraid too, and think that a proper funeral will get us into trouble, then no one will dare to give Her Old Ladyship her due. That would be the most terrible thing! Im only a maid, so of course its no personal concern of mine. But think what a disgrace it would be for the family! I hardly need reminding of that, replied Xi-feng. Set your mind at rest. I shall take care of everything. Faithful once more entreated Xi-feng to do her utmost, and pledged her undying gratitude. What a strange creature! thought Xi-feng to herself, as she left Grandmother Jias apartment. I wonder what can be in her mind? Of course shes right Grannies funeral should be stylish. Oh dear! I cant pay too much attention to Faithfuls complaints. Id better just stick to the book and follow family precedent. She summoned Brighties wife, and sent her with a message to Jia Lian, asking him to come and see her. What do you want me for? he asked, when he arrived shortly afterwards. Just keep your end up on the inside. There should be no problems. If youre in any doubt, stick to Uncle Zhengs instructions. There you are, said Xi-feng. What you say only bears out Faithfuls fears. What fears are they? Xi-feng repeated the substance of her interview with Faithful. Who cares what the maids say? retorted Jia Lian. Ive just been in to see Uncle Zheng, and this is what he said Wed like to lay on something grand for Mothers funeral, but although some people will understand that its her money were using, less well-informed observers may suspect us of secretly holding on to some of our own resources. They may think we still possess hidden wealth. Of course, Uncle Zheng went on to say to me, if we dont spend all of Grandmothers money on the funeral, no one will want to appropriate whats left for their own personal use. In one way or another it should still be spent on Grandmother. Now she was a Southerner, and though we have ancestral burial4and in the South, there are no buildings on it. When her coffin has been transported to the South, with any money thats left over we can put up some buildings on the ancestral burial-ground, and buy a few hectares of land to provide for the sacrifices. If we ever return to the South ourselves, it will come in handy, and even if we dont, we can always let some of the poorer clan members live on it. They can keep up the seasonal offerings and sweep the graves at regular intervals.
These misfortunes of ours, he said to them, by way of apology, are the direct consequence of my own failure to inculcate proper standards in the younger generation. We beg to differ, replied one of them. We have long considered Sir Shes conduct questionable. And Mr Zhen has been even more arrogant and dissolute in his ways. Now their misdemeanours have come to light and have brought them public censure. The fault lies entirely with them. It is most regrettable that their misdeeds should have rebounded on you, sir. I have known many cases of similar conduct, commented another, but none of them involved an indictment like this. Mr Zhen must have somehow caused offence . . The intervention of the censor in this case can be easily explained, countered another. It appears that one of your own household servants and some of his less respectable friends have been spreading unpleasant rumours, and that these reached the censors ears. He wished to substantiate them before proceeding any further, and persuaded this same servant of yours to go along and give information. Knowing how generously you treat your staff, I find it hard to believe that such a thing could have happened. Thats the way with servants, remarked another. They take advantage of their masters generosity. Since we are among friends here, I think I may be permitted to speak my mind. I know what an incorruptible man you are, sir but while you were in Kiangsi, your reputation was somehow tarnished. That was your servants doing. You will have to be more cautious in future. Although you have escaped with your own property intact this time, if His Majesty should ever have occasion to question your integrity again, it might be considerably less pleasant for you. Jia Zheng seemed greatly perturbed by this. What do you mean? In what way was my reputation tarnished? There is of course no shred of material evidence, came the reply, but we have heard others say that during your time as Grain Intendant you instructed your servants to practise extortion. As Heaven is my witness, exclaimed Jia Zheng, no such thought even entered my head! My men were cheating and bullying behind my back. Any more of this sort of gossip and I shall be finished! Its no use fretting about the past, commented one of the company. But you should examine your present staff carefully. Weed out any refractory elements among them and deal with them severely. At that moment one of the janitors entered the room Sir Shes son-in-law, Mr Sun, has sent a servant with a message, sir. His master is too busy to come in person. This man is instructed to inform you that the Suns are expecting you to discharge Sir Shes debts. Jia Zheng looked gloomy and harassed, and gave a perfunctory acknowledgement. His friends laughed contemptuously This Mr Sun has a bad reputation and it certainly seems well founded. When his father-in-law has his home raided and his property confiscated, so far from offering assistance, he comes hounding him for money. Its preposterous! Lets not talk of him, replied Jia Zheng. That whole match was a blunder on my elder brothers part. I should have thought my poor niece had suffered enough at this young mans hands, without his having to torment me as well. As he was speaking, Xue Ke appeared. I have learned, he reported to Jia Zheng, that Commissioner Zhao is insisting on pursuing every detail of the indictment. I am afraid that Uncle She and Cousin Zhen will have a hard time of it. You must seek the princes help in this matter, Jia Zhengs friends advised him. Without his intervention, you may all be ruined. Jia Zheng thanked his visitors for their advice, which he said he would be sure to follow, and they all took their leave. It was already lighting-up time, and Jia Zheng went to pay his evening respects to Grandmother Jia, who seemed slightly recovered. He returned to his apartment, and sat once more silently brooding over Jia Lian and Xi-fengs reckless behaviour. Their usury, now that it had come to light, would damage the whole family and he blamed them bitterly for it. But he reflected also that Xi-feng was gravely ill, and had lost everything in the raid, which was sure to have been a great additional blow to her, and decided not to criticize her for the time being, but to contain his anger and say nothing. The rest of that night passed without further event. Early next morning Jia Zheng went to the Palace to give thanks for the Emperors clemency, and afterwards to the palaces of the Prince of Bei-jing and the Prince of Xi-ping, where he kowtowed to them and begged them to intervene on behalf of Jia She and Cousin Zhen.
