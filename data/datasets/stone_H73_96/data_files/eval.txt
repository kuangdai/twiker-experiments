muttered Bao Er to himself. Sir, put in Zhou Rui promptly, I have been in charge of farm rents and income here for years, and on average I should say around four hundred thousand taels worth passes through my hands each year, and I have never had a word of complaint from the Master or their Ladyships or the young mistresses about anything, let alone such a small matter as this. According to him, we are supposed to have made off with the familys entire property and estates! It looks as if Bao Er has started some sort of quarrel, thought Cousin Zhen to himself. Better get rid of him. Out of my sight! he barked. Then turning from Bao Er to Zhou Rui That is all. Carry on with your work. The two servants left. Not long afterwards Cousin Zhen was resting in the study when he heard the most terrific din break out in the direction of the main gate. He sent a servant to inquire, who came back to report that a fight had started between Bao Er and an adopted son of Zhou Ruis. Who is this adopted son? asked Cousin Zhen. He San is his name, sir, replied the servant. A worthless fellow who spends most of his time drinking and causing trouble. He sometimes comes round here and hangs about in the porters lodge. Apparently he got involved in the argument between Bao Er and Zhou Rui. This is the limit! exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Have Bao Er and this He San character bound immediately! What about Zhou Rui? He disappeared when the fighting started, sir. Find him at once! This is preposterous! Yes, sir! In the midst of this commotion, Jia Lian returned and Cousin Zhen told him what had happened in his absence. What next! cried Lian. He sent an extra servant to help apprehend Zhou Rui, who soon realized that escape was impossible, gave himself up and was led before the masters. Tie him up as well! ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself principally to Zhou Rui Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start fighting all over again? And as if that wasnt bad enough, you have to drag in this brat of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you disappear and leave them to it! He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks. Its no good punishing only him, said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia Lian sat down to discuss family business. In the servants quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhens part to cover up for incompetence others said he was just inept at handling people while others saw it as yet another instance of his unpleasant character. Wasnt it he who recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? Whats probably happened is that Bao Ers wife wont oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so now hes taken it out on the husband... There were many differing interpretations. Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zhengs promotion at the Ministry of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out, but went around promising work to contractors and negotiating percentages for himself, and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to the apartment of his erstwhile patroness. Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in a temper and beating the servants, was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story from him. It may all have been over a trifle, she commented, but we must put a stop to such behaviour at all costs. If they think they can get away with it now, when the family fortunes are supposed to be flourishing, what is going to happen when the younger generation takes over? Theyll have a mutiny on their hands. I remember a year or so ago witnessing the most appalling scene at Ning-guo House - Big Jiao sprawled all over the steps, blind drunk and swearing sixteen to the dozen. None of us was spared. I dont care if he has rendered distinguished services in the past. Servants should know their place, and show a proper sense of respect. The trouble with Cousin Zhens wife - please dont misunderstand me - is that she is much too unsuspecting and lets her staff get away with anything. This Bao Er of theirs - or whatever his name is - is typical.
Get him on his own and talk him into producing the jade, then threaten to expose him unless he keeps his mouth shut, and theres our mystery solved. Amid much nodding of heads, Li Wan turned to Patience and said Youd better go. This will require all your tact. Yes maam, replied Patience, and hurried off. -320 A few minutes later, when she returned with Jia Huan, the others pretended hardly to notice his arrival. One of them made him a pot of tea and placed it on a table in the inner room. Then they all shuffled out and left the scene clear for Patience. She gave him an ingenuous smile. Master Baos jade has gone missing.. .1 dont suppose youve seen it anywhere have you? Jia Huans face instantly flushed to an ugly shade of purple . He glowered at her. Just because somebodys lost something, does that mean that I automatically become the suspect and get called in for interrogation? Have I got a criminal record or something? Patience decided to change tack, and said with a smile Of course no one would dream of suggesting you stole it! They just thought that perhaps you might have hidden it somewhere as a practical joke, and that by asking you if youd seen it I might be able to get a few clues as to where they should look for it. Its his jade, isnt it? replied Jia Huan indignantly. Hes the one that wears the thing - ask him, not me! Youre all so keen to please him, thats your trouble! If somethings found I never get to hear of it! But the moment anythings lost, its me that gets the blame! He got up and stomped out of the room. The maids stepped back to let him through. All this only served to exasperate Bao-yu. The amount of trouble that wretched thing has caused! he said. Ive no desire for it and I wish you would all forget about it. Now look what weve done. Huan will go and tell everybody and well never hear the end of it. Little ancestor, please. .. came tearfully from where Aroma stood in the throng of distraught maids. Its all very well for you to say "forget about it"! But what you seem to have forgotten is that if their Ladyships get to hear, the likes of us will be torn to shreds and ground to powder! This was followed by prolonged wailing. It soon became clear to them all that things could not be hushed up for much longer. They would have to agree on a story to tell Grandmother Jia and the other ladies. Thats easy, said Bao-yu. Just tell them I smashed it myself. No no! Thats no good! said Patience. Cant you see? Theyll want to know why you smashed it, and then things will look just as black for Aroma and the others. And besides, what if they want to see the pieces? Well then, say I lost it on a trip to town. There was a moments silence as they all pondered this suggestion. We might possibly have got away with that, said someone at last. But during the past few days you havent been to school, and you havent been out anywhere either. Yes I have, Bao-yu corrected them. A few days ago I went to the Earl of Lin-ans to watch the plays. You can say I lost it then. No, that wont do, said Tan-chun. If you lost it as long ago as that, theyll want to know why it hasnt been reported till now. They were still busy discussing the relative merits of these various fictions when suddenly they heard the voice of Aunt Zhao, cursing and wailing her way towards them. If you lose something, why cant you look for it yourselves, instead of sneaking up and blaming my boy? Well, here he is! Take him! Sacrifice him if you think it will do you any good! Kill him! Hack him to pieces! Do what you like with him! She propelled Jia Huan into the room, crying Thief! Hurry up and confess your crime! This brought loud and angry protestations from Huan. Li Wan was just bracing herself to intervene and make the peace when a maid came rushing in and announced Her Ladyship is here! Aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was now inevitable. Bao-yu and the girls went out at once to receive Lady Wang. Aunt Zhaos wrath subsided for a moment and she followed them out. From the startled look on their faces Lady Wang could see that what she had heard must be true. Is it really lost? she cried. No one dared reply. Lady Wang walked in, sat down and called Aroma forward.
A frown, then a smile, which soon gave way to a shake of the head, and finally an expression of impatience. When he seemed to have finished, she asked Whats it all about then? By way of response Bao-yu tore the letter into shreds. Aroma thought it wiser to change the subject. Are you planning to do some work after dinner or not? What a cad! She smiled at this capricious reply Well, what was it about? Oh who cares! Lets have dinner. Then Im going straight to bed. I feel quite sick! He told one of the junior maids to light a fire and threw the remains of Yuns letter into it. Supper was soon served, but Bao-yu was in no mood for it and only sat there staring glumly in front of him. After trying every form of pressure and persuasion Aroma finally succeeded in making him swallow a mouthful, only to see him put his bowl down once more and flop listlessly onto his bed. Suddenly he began to cry. Neither she nor Musk had the slightest idea what was the matter. "Come on, youve got to tell us, protested Musk. Its all this Yuns fault, or whatever his wretched name is. I cant imagine what his stupid letter was all about, to have such a queer effect on you, laughing one minute, crying your heart out the next. If you carry on in this strange way much longer, youll worry us to death, indeed you will! She was on the verge of tears herself. Aroma could not help smiling Musky dear, dont you go making things worse, please. Hes got quite enough on his mind as it is. Unless of course you want people to think the letter had something to do with you... Well, thats a stupid remark I must say! replied Musk. You dont know what it said, anyway. It might have been anything. Why drag me into it? Unless of course its got something to do with you... Before Aroma could reply there was a splutter of laughter from the bed and Bao-yu sat up, gave his clothes a shake and said to them both Come on, thats enough. Lets go to sleep. Ive got to work early in the morning. With these words he settled himself down and went to sleep. The night passed uneventfully, and next morning, after completing his toilet, he set off for school. He had just walked 6ut of the doorway when he remembered something and, calling to Tealeaf to wait, turned back. Musk! She came hurrying out. Whats the matter? If Yun comes today, tell him not to make a nuisance of himself here again or Ill report him to Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng. I will. Bao-yu set off once more, and was on his way out when who should come bustling in but J ia Yun himself. When he saw Bao-yu he promptly saluted and said My heartiest congratulations, Uncle! Bao-yu took this as a reference to th,e business contained in the previous days letter and replied curtly You tactless meddling fool! It makes no difference to you if there are things people care about. But Uncle! protested Yun with a smug smile. If you dont believe me, take a look for yourself. The crowds are outside the gate. What are you talking about? snapped Bao-yu, the anger rising in his voice. At that moment a wave of shouting and cheering came wafting in from the street outside. Hear that! exclaimed Jia Yun. Now will you believe me? Bao-yu was more perplexed than ever. He could distinguish a few words above the general din Have you people no manners? What do you mean by coming here and making this racket? Another voice replied The hand that raised Sir Jia has given us the privilege of bearing tidings other houses would be only too glad of receiving! Bao-yu understood at last that his fathers promotion had been officially announced, and that the din outside the gates was coming from a crowd of professional well-wishers their joy made the more vocal by the expectation of a tip. He was delighted and hurried on out of the Garden, only to be cornered again by Jia Yun. Happy Uncle? Needless to say the joy would be doubled if we could only announce your betrothal as well... Bao-yu blushed fiercely and spat in Jia Yuns face Ugh! Why dont you clear off? You make m,e sick! Jia Yun blushed too. Whats this? I can see youre a little. . A little what? asked Bao-yu angrily. But Jia Yu,ns nerve failed him and he left his remark unfinished. Bao-yu hurried off to school, where Dai-ru greeted him with a smile I have just heard the good news, my boy.
We have only been biding our time because Pans court-case has still not been settled. Yes, that is certainly the first obstacle, commented Jia Zheng. How can a girl be given in marriage while her elder brother is in jail? And besides there is Her Graces death. Although that does not strictly entail any such prohibition, Bao-yu should at least abide by the set term of mourning for a deceased elder sister, which would mean a period 6f nine months during which marriage would be highly irregular. And then, my own date of departure has already been reported to the throne, and I cannot postpone it now. That only leaves us a few days. There is not enough time. Grandmother Jia pondered her sons words. What he says is true, she thought to herself. If we wait for all of these conditions to be fulfilled, his father will have left, and who knows to what state the boys health may deteriorate. And then it may be too late. We shall have to put aside the rules for once. There is no other way. Having reached this conclusion in her own mind, she spoke to Jia Zheng again. If you will agree to this for him, I shall take care of any problems that may arise. There is nothing that cannot be ironed out, of that I am confident. His mother and I shall go over and put the matter personally to Mrs Xue. As for Pan, I shall ask young Ke to go to him and explain that we are doing this to save Bao-yus life. When he knows the reason, I am sure he will agree. As for marrying during a period of mourning, strictly speaking one shouldnt, I know. And besides, it is not right for him to marry while lie is so ill. But its a question of turning his luck. Both families are willing, and as the children have the bond of gold and jade to justify their union, we can dispense with the usual reading of horoscopes. We just need to choose an auspicious day to exchange presents in proper style, and then set a date for the wedding itself, possible afterwards. No music during the wedding itself, but otherwise we can follow court practice twelve pairs of long-handled lanterns and an eight-man palanquin for the bride. We shall have the ceremony in our southern form, and keep our old customs of throwing dried fruit onto the bridal bed and so forth. That will be enough to make it quite a proper wedding. Bao-chai is a sensible girl. We need not worry on her account. And Aroma is a very reliable person. We can count on her to have a calming influence on Bao-yu. She gets on well with Bao-chai too. One other thing. Mrs Xue once told us that a monk said Bao-chai should only marry someone with a jade to match her golden locket. Perhaps when she comes to live as Bao-yus wife, her locket will draw the jade back. Once they are married, things will look up and the whole family will benefit. So, we must prepare a courtyard and decorate it nicely - I should like you to choose it. We shant be inviting any friends or relations to the wedding, and we can have the party later, when Bao-yu is better and the mourning period is over. This way, everything will be done in time, and you will be able to see the young people married and set off with an easy mind. Jia Zheng had grave doubts about the proposal. But as it was Grandmother Jias, he knew he could not go against it. He smiled dutifully, and hastened to reply You have thought it all out very well, Mother, and have taken everything into account. We must tell the servants not to go talking about this to everyone they meet. It would hardly redound to our credit if people knew. And personally I doubt if Mrs Xue will agree to the idea. But if she does, then I suppose we should do as you suggest. You need not worry about Mrs Xue, said the old lady. I can explain things to her. Off you go then. Jia Zheng took his leave. He felt extremely uneasy about the whole idea. Official business soon engulfed him, however - acceptance of his new papers of appointment.. recommendations of staff from friends and relatives, an endless round of social gatherings of one sort or another and he delegated all responsibility for the marriage plans to Grandmother J ia, who in turn left the arrangements to Lady Wang and Xi-feng. Jia Zhengs only contributioh was to designate a twenty-frame building in a courtyard behind the Hall of Exalted Felicity, to he side of Lady Wangs private apartment, as Bao-yus new home. Grandmother Jias mind was now quite made up, and when she sent someone to communicate this to Jia Zheng he just replied Very well.
she asked. Im here on an errand for Miss Bao-chai, replied the woman. Something for Miss Lin. Wait here a minute. Snowgoose went in to consult with Dai-yu, who told her to show the old woman in. Once inside the room, she curtseyed to Dai-yu, then screwed up her eyes and peered at her curiously. Not a word of her errand. Dai-yu began to feel rather embarrassed, and asked what it was that Bao-chai had sent over. A pot of honeyed lychees is what Ive been instructed by Miss Bao-chai to bring to you, Miss Lin, replied the old woman, her features relaxing into a smile. Then she spotted Aroma in the room. Why, if it isnt Master Baos maid, Miss Hua! Thats right, nanny dear, replied Aroma. And how did you come to know who I was? Well, looking after Madams room as we do, we hardly ever go out visiting with Madam and Miss Bao-chai, so you wouldnt recognize us. But we remember just about all the young ladies that come round our way. She handed the pot to Snowgoose, took another look at Dai-yu, then turned back to Aroma and said with a confidential smile No wonder our Madam says that Miss Lin and your Master Bao were made for one another! She really does look just like a fairy! Aroma made a valiant attempt to avert any further blunders. Come along, nanny, you must be tired. Why dont you sit down and have a cup of tea? Oh no - were much too busy at home today, the old girl cackled on regardless. Weve everything to prepare for Miss Bao-qins Giving-away. And Ive still two pots of lychees to deliver to Master Bao-yu from Miss Bao-chai. She took her leave and went waddling busily out of the room. Dai-yu, who for Bao-chais sake had tried to disguise her annoyance at the way the old woman had come barging in, called out after her Please thank Miss Bao-chai for her kind present. La-di-da-di-da! the old. girl could still be heard burbling away to herself. Only Bao-yu would have the style to match such a fine lady... Dai-yu pretended not to hear. Really, said Aroma, trying to laugh the whole thing off, when people reach her age they just talk utter nonsense. You dont know whether to scold or laugh. -294 Snowgoose passed the lychees to Dai-yu. I couldnt put them away, would you? They chatted a little longer and. then Aroma left. That evening, when Dai-yu went into her side-room to undress for the night, she caught sight of the lychees again. They reminded her of the old womans visit, and revived the pain she had felt at her tactless gossiping. Dusk was falling, and in the stillness a thousand gloomy thoughts seemed to close in and oppress her mind. My health is so poor... And times running out. I know Bao-yu loves me more than anyone else. But Grannie and Aunt Wang still havent mentioned it! If only my parents had settled it for us while they were still alive.. But suppose they had? What if they had married me to someone else? Who could ever compare with Bao-yu? Perhaps Im better off like this after all! At least Ive still some hope. Like the rope on a pulley her secret hopes and fears spun up and down, tangling themselves tighter and tighter round her heart. Finally, with a sigh and a few tears, she lay down in her clothes, weary and depressed. She became vaguely aware of one of the junior maids coming in and saying Miss Lin, Mr Jia Yu-cun is outside and wants to see you. What could he want? thought Dai-vu to herself. Im not a regular student of his. Im not even a boy. He just happened to coach me when I was a little girl. Anyway, all the times hes come to see Uncle Zheng hes never once asked after me, so why should I have to see him now? She told the maid to convey her respects and thank Mr Yu-cun for calling, but to say that poor health obliged her to stay in bed. But Miss, said the maid, I think hes come to congratulate you, and some people have come to take you to Nanking. As she was speaking, a group including Xi-feng, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Bao-chai advanced into the room and announced cheerfully Congratulations my dear!
Bao-chai now came to the judges rescript, which read as follows -1344 RESCRIPT -5947 An inquest was held at the scene of the crime, and the evidence heard was conclusive. No torture of any kind was applied to the defendant, who freely admitted the charge, viz. Homicide by Blows. His admission of guilt has now been officially entered in the records. You, the appellant, an outsider with no first-hand knowledge of the case, in presuming to fabricate this unfounded appeal are guilty of contempt of court. In view of the mitigating circumstances of family loyalty, your offence will be overlooked in this instance. -1344 APPEAL REJECTED Theres no hope left then! cried Aunt Xue. What can we do now? That isnt all, said Bao-chai. Theres a P.S. She read on For confidential instructions, ask the boy - urgent. Aunt Xue immediately questioned the boy, who supplied the following information The people at the yamen know how rich we are, maam, and Master Ke says well have to use family connections here in the capital, and send another large bribe, if were to get a rehearing and a lighter sentence. He says you must act quickly, maam, as delay now could mean hardship for Mr Pan. Aunt Xue dismissed the boy and went at once to see her sister again. Lady Wang pleaded strenuously with Jia Zheng, but the most he was prepared to do was send someone to have a word with the judge. He refused to contemplate the use of pecuniary considerations. Aunt Xue, fearing that this gesture would prove ineffective, begged Xi-feng to speak to Jia Lian. The judges price was high - the figure ran into several thousands of taels but in the end an agreement was reached, and the way was clear for Xue Ke to proceed with his plan. The case was officially re-opened, and all the parties concerned were summoned once more to the district yamen - the beadle, eye-witnesses, relatives of the deceased, etc. Xue Pan was brought out from the cells. The clerk of the court called the roll, and the judge ordered the chief beadle to verify the original depositions. Then Mrs Zhang nee Wang and Zhang Er, the deceaseds mother and uncle, were called to give evidence. Mayt please Yeronner, began Mrs Zhang, punctuating her delivery with sobs, we Zhangs are country folk and live to the south of town. Papa Zhangs been gone these eighteen years. We had the three boys, but our eldest and second have both passed away. The only one as I had left was our third, and now hes gone too! More sobs. Twenty-three this year hedve been, anitplease Yeronner, and still a single lad. Hed took this job at Lis Bar by way 0 helpin me out, seem as wed so little comin in. Itdve been bout midday when this man come to the door-I can see im now -"Theres been a fight at Lis Bar!" says he, "And your boys been killed!" My poor heart, Yeronner! I was took that bad! I runned to Lis and there was my boy lyin on the ground, the blood runnin out is poor ead! I tried askin im what ad appened, but e couldnt say nothing, e was ardly breathin, and then ... well, then e was gone! If I could only get my hands on that wickedevilmurderin A growl of disapproval rippled through the ranks of the court underlings. Mrs Zhang rapidly kotowed to the bench All Im askin for is reglar justice Yeronner! He was all I ad left in the world! Next witness - Gaffer Li! called the judge peremptorily. Gaffer Li, proprietor of Lis Bar, came forward and knelt before the bench. Was this fellow Zhang employed for casual work on your premises? asked the judge. He was a regular waiter, replied Li. I see here that in your original deposition, as recorded at the Inquest, you state that Xue Pan dealt Zhang San a fatal blow on the head. Tell me, did you personally observe this blow? No, Your Honour. I was behind the counter at the time, in the tap-room. I heard that one of the customers in a private room had ordered some wine. Then a little later I heard that someone had been hurt. I ran in and saw Zhang San lying on the floor. He couldnt speak. I informed the beadle, and sent someone to tell Mrs Zhang. I have no idea how the fight started. There was a gentleman sitting at Mr Xues table, Your Honour.
Have another look for it. The maids were too scared to tell anyone else, and joined together in a furtive search. This went on for most of the day but there was still no sign of the jade. They emptied every box, and rummaged in every trunk, until there simply was nowhere left to look and they began to wonder if perhaps one of the visitors might have picked it up earlier in the day. How would anyone dare do such a thing? said Aroma. Everyone knows how important it is, and that Master Baos very life hinges on it. Ask about it, but be very discreet. If you find out that one of the maids has taken it and is playing a trick on us, kotow to her and beg for it back. If its a junior maid whos stolen it, dont tell a soul, just do whatever is necessary to get it back. Give her whatever you like in exchange. This is very serious. It would be terrible if we lost the jade, worse even than losing Master Bao himself! Musk and Ripple set off on this mission. Aroma hurried out after them with a few final words of instruction On second thoughts, leave the people who were here at lunch-time till last. If it turns out to be someone else, we dont want to offend them and cause a lot of ill-feeling to no purpose. The two maids split up to make their inquiries, but everywhere they went it was the same story. Nobody knew anything about it. Everybody was equally taken aback by the news. They hurried back to report their lack of success, and stared at one another in despondent silence. Bao-yu himself was now beginning to look rather stunned, and Aroma was so desperate that she could only weep helplessly. What could they do? There was nowhere left to look. They were too scared to tell any of the elder members of the family. The entire establishment at Green Delights was immobilized with fear and resembled a group of wooden statues or clay dolls. One by one the others who had heard the news began to arrive, among them Tan-chun, who immediately gave orders for the Garden gate to be shut and sent an old serving-woman and two maids on another comprehensive search, announcing to everyone present. that there would be a substantial reward for the recovery of the jade. They were all keen to establish their own innocence, and this, with the added incentive of winning the reward, now led to a flurry of indiscriminate searching. Every nook and cranny of the Garden was explored, not excluding the lavatories, but to no avail. It was as hopeless as hunting for an embroidery needle, and as evening drew on there was still no trace of the missing jade. Li Wan now sensed the urgency of the situation and said I have a suggestion to make. Its not the sort of thing I would usually like to suggest but in the present circumstances I feel I must... They all gave her their attention. Things are so desperate that I think we have to try anything. Now apart from Bao-yu, all the residents of the Garden are girls. I should like you all to ask your maids to remove their dresses, so that we can search everyone properly. If that produces no results, then we should send them to search the older serving-women and cleaners. Do you all agree? The consensus of opinion was that she was right. With so many people involved, and such confusion, this seemed the only way of establishing anyone 5 innocence. Tan-chun was the only one to abstain from making any comment. The maids were eager. to clear themselves, and Patience was the first to volunteer. One by one they all undid their dresses and filed past, while Li Wan supervised the examination. Tan-chun could contain herself no longer. My dear Wan, cant you see what a futile waste of time this all is? Supposing someone has stolen it do you really think he or she would be foolish enough to carry it around? Anyway, why should anyone want to steal it? It means a lot to us, but outside this household its quite valueless. If you ask me, someones doing this out of spite. They all knew immediately whom she was referring to. Jia Huan had been in and out of Green Delights many times that day. No one was prepared to mention his name, however, and she was obliged to be more specific herself It must be Huan. Who else would play such a nasty trick? Send someone secretly oVer to his room and bring him here. Get him on his own and talk him into producing the jade, then threaten to expose him unless he keeps his mouth shut, and theres our mystery solved. Amid much nodding of heads, Li Wan turned to Patience and said Youd better go.
Who our ancestors were, how they won their titles, every ramification of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo family trees, exactly how many of us there are, who we all are, where we all live, what we all do - why, he was a mine of information! I liked him for it, I must say. Jia Zheng smiled, and went on Hes done extremely well for himself in the last few years too. Promoted from Prefect to Censor, then in a few years to Vice-president of the Board of Civil Office, then President of the Board of War. He was demoted three grades for some incident, but now it seems he is to be promoted again. How hard it is to predict the vicissitudes of human life, commented Feng Zi-ying. And yet there is a pattern in all things, said Jia Zheng. Take your p earl for instance. The big one is like a man blessed with fortune the little ones are his dependants, sheltering in the shade of his influence. If the big one goes, then the little ones are helpless. If the head of a family is in trouble, his wife and children are taken from him, his relations are left destitute, even his friends he may see no more. Prosperity may crumble in the twinkling of an eye, like the passing of a spring cloud or the falling of an autumn leaf. What joy is there in public life? My kinsman Yu-cun has had a comparatively easy time of it. But take a case nearer home, the Zhen family, like our own in so many respects . They too were ennobled for their services to the Throne. Their style of life has always been very like ours. We used to see a great deal of them. I remember not many years ago when they were here in the capital, they sent one of their men round to convey their respects, and all seemed well. Yet not long afterwards their family estate was confiscated, and goodness alone knows what has become of them now. We have had no news of them for so long. My heart goes out to them. Whats this about a pearl? asked Jia She. Jia Zheng and Feng Zi-ying gave him a description of the Mother Pearl. We need have no fears, said Jia She, resuming the previous topic of conversation. Nothing can happen to us. Of course not, sir, said Feng, with Her Grace to protect your interests at Court, with such enviable connections and such a host of relations, and with a family that from Lady Jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record... Granted, said Jia Zheng somewhat grimly. But our respectability is more than balanced by our lack of ability and positive achievement. We are living on borrowed time, and one day it will run out. Do lets put an end to this depressing conversation, said Jia She, and have another drink. They did so, and after a few more rounds dinner was served. After dinner, tea was brought in and Fengs page came in and murmured something in his masters ear. Feng took his leave. What was that you said? asked Jia She of the page. Its snowing, sir, and theyve sounded the first evening watch. Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed already more than an inch thick on the ground. I hope your two curios are well wrapped? said Jia Zheng. They are, replied Feng. Dont forget, if you change your minds, Im sure we can come to some agreement about the price. Ill bear it in mind, said Jia Zheng. I shall wait to hear from you then. Its cold - please dont bother to see me out. Goodbye. Jia She and Jia Zheng instructed Jia Lian to accompany Feng Zi-ying to the gate. For the sequel, please read the following chapter. CHAPTER 93 A Zhen retainer seeks shelter in the Jia household And shady activities are revealed behind the Iron Threshold When Feng Zi-ying had gone, Jia Zheng sent for one of the men on the gate. I see theres an invitation here from the Earl of Lin-an, he said. Do you know what sort of an occasion it is? I did inquire, sir, replied the servant. Its only the arrival of a new company of actors at the Prince of Nan-ans. They are said to be first-class, and his lordship wants to celebrate by putting on a dramatic entertainment for a couple of days. Just an informal party for friends, nothing requiring a presentation I should say, sir. As the servant was speaking Jia She came over. Will you be going tomorrow? he asked his brother. I really ought to, replied Jia Zheng. The Earl has always been most affable.
She told Snowgoose to bring in her brush and inkstone, which were on the table outside, and moistening the ink, began to write. When she had completed four stanzas, she took a Qin Handbook from her shelf and looked through it. She decided to make a suite out of the two old melodies, Lonely Orchid Pavan and faintly Virtue. Having done the pointing, she wrote out a copy of the words there and then to send to Bao-chai, and asked Snowgoose to fetch the three-quarter size Qin she had brought from home, which was stored in a trunk. She tuned the strings and did a few preliminary finger-exercises. Her natural aptitude compensated for her lack of practice, and it was not long before all that she had learnt as a child came back to her. After playing for a while, seeing that it was already late in the night, she told Snowgoose to put away the Qin, and went to bed. And so we must leave her. One day Bao-yu, after completing his toilet, set off as usual with Tealeaf to go to school. On their way they encountered Inky, another of his page-boys, who came bounding up to them with a broad grin on his face and announced Good news, Master Bao! The Preceptors not at school today, and youve all been given the day off! Are you being serious? asked Bao-yu. If you dont believe me, take a look isnt that Master Huan and Young Master Lan on their way back now? Bao-yu looked and sure enough there were his half-brother and young nephew coming towards him with their contingent of pages, chatting away and giggling, though he could not catch what it was they were saying. When they saw him, they halted and stood with their arms respectfully at their sides. Why have you come back from school so soon? Bao-yu asked them. The Preceptor is busy today, replied Huan, and says we can all have the day off. Were to attend as usual tomorrow. Hearing this, Bao-yu turned about and, having reported the news to Grandmother Jia and his father, returned to Green Delights. Why are you back? asked Aroma. He told her what had happened, and after sitting with her for a minute or two made a move to go out again. Where are you off to in such a hurry? she asked. If youve been given the day off school, that doesnt mean you have to go charging about. You ought to make it a day of rest. Bao-yu stopped in his tracks and hung his head. I know youre right. But when will I next have a chance to get out and have some fun? Be a sport... He said this in such an appealing tone of voice that Aroma relented. All right, she said with a smile. Meanwhile lunch had been brought in, and he had to stay and eat it. He bolted it down, rinsed his mouth and was off. Fast as a puff of smoke he sped to the Naiads House. He found Nightingale in the courtyard hanging handkerchiefs out to dry. Has Miss Lin had her lunch yet? he asked. She had half a bowl of congee earlier on, replied Nightingale, but wasnt feeling very hungry. Shes sleeping at the moment. Youd better go somewhere else just now, Master Bao, and come back a bit later. He left reluctantly, not knowing quite where to go. Suddenly it occurred to him that he had not seen Xi-chun for several days, and he began strolling in the direction of Smartweed Loggia. When he reached the courtyard and stood by one of the windows, it all seemed very quiet and deserted. She too, he concluded, was having her nap and not to be disturbed. He was about to leave when he heard a faint sound coming from inside, too faint to identify. He stood still and listened again, in the hope of hearing it more clearly. There it was! A distinct little tap! He was still trying to think what it could be, when a voice said Why have you made that move, and not countered there? It was a game of Go! But Bao-yu did not have time to recognize the voice of the speaker. He heard Xi-chun reply Why should I bother? If you take me there, I shall simply counter here, and if you take me again I shall take you again. I shall still be one move ahead, and in the end I shall be able to connect. And what if I take you here? Aiyo! exclaimed Xi-chun. You had an inside counterattack up your sleeve. Im defenceless. That other girls voice was so familiar!
The maid returned in a short while to report Its the crab-trees at Green Delights. Earlier this year some of them were struck with the blight, and no one bothered to water them. Yesterday Bao-yu went to have a look at them and thought he could see buds on some of the branches. No one believed him or paid any attention to his story at the time. But today theres ho doubt about it, theyve come out in the most beautiful blossom! It has caused quite a stir and everyone is hurrying over there to have a look. Even Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship have been caught up in the excitement and are going along to see the blossom. So Mrs Zhu has given orders for all the paths to be cleared of leaves - thats what all the shouting was about. Dai-yu heard that Grandmother Jia was coming, she got up to change and sent Snowgoose on ahead, telling her to report back the moment Her Old Ladyship arrived. She soon came running back. Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship and a lot of the other ladies have all arrived! Hurry, Miss! Dai-yu took a brief look in the mirror, passed a comb quickly through her hair and set off with Nightingale in the direction of Green Delights. She arrived to find Grandmother Jia installed on Bao-yus day-couch, and after greeting her and Lady Xing and Lady Wang went on to say hello to Li Wan, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Xing Xiuyan. She noticed that several people were absent Xi-feng was ill in bed, Shi Xiang-yun had gone home to see her uncle who was in the capital on transfer, while Bao-qin had stayed at home with Bao-chai, and the two Li sisters, Wen and Qi, had been taken to live elsewhere by their mother, whom recent events had convinced that Prospect Garden was a rather unsuitable environment for her daughters. They were all chatting away, each propounding a different interpretation of the strange phenomenon of the winter-flowering crab-trees. They usually flower in the third month, I know, Grandmother Jia was saying. And we are in the eleventh month now. But then the movable terms in the calendar are rather late this year, so we could say this is more like the tenth month, which is after all sometimes called "Little Spring". With the exceptionally warm weather we have been having, a little blossom is only to be expected. You are quite right, Mother, agreed Lady Wang. We need someone of your experience to show us that this is really nothing out of the ordinary. Lady Xing however was not so easily convinced. I heard that these trees had already been struck by the blight for almost a year... How do you explain the fact that half-dead trees should start flowering now, at such an odd time of the year? Li Wan spoke next. I think you are both right, she said with a smile. My own humble suggestion is that they have flowered specially to tell us of some happy event that is about to take place in Bao-yus life. Tan-chun, although she remained silent, was secretly thinking to herself This must be an ill-omen. Everything that is in harmony with nature prospers, and things out of season, out of time, fade and die. Plants and trees obey a natural cycle. If a tree flowers out of season, it must be an ill omen. She kept all this to herself, however. It was Dai-yu who spoke next. She had been struck by Li Wans mention of a happy event, and said with some excitement There was once a family of farmers who had a thorn-bush. There were three sons in the family, and one day these three sons decided to leave home and go their separate ways. No sooner had they gone than the thornbush began to fade away and die. But some time later the brothers began to yearn for each others company, returned home and were reunited. And at once the thornbush began to flourish again. So you see plants follow closely the fortunes of the people to whom they are attached. Now Cousin Bao is devoting himself seriously to his studies, which pleases Uncle Zheng, which pleases the crab-trees, which is why they are flowering! This went down very well with Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang. What a well-chosen story! Such an interesting idea! Jia She and Jia Zheng now arrived to view the flowers, accompanied by Jia Huan and Jia Lan. Jia She spoke first. Cut them down. Thats what I say. Theres evil work afoot here. On the contrary, said Jia Zheng.
After drinking 489 about half of it, Grandmother Jia ordered the other half to be taken to Xi-feng. She pointed to one of the dishes. And this is for Patience. She turned to You-shi. Ive finished. Now you can eat. Thank you, said You-shi, but waited all the same until the old lady had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands and was walking up and down on Lady Wangs arm for her digestion before she begged to be seated. By this time Baoqin and Tan-chun had finished eating. They got up as You-shi sat down, excusing themselves from keeping her company while she ate. Oh, said You-shi, Im not used to eating at a big table like this all on my own. Faithful and Amber can eat with you for company, said Grandmother Jia. Good! said You-shi. I was about to suggest that. I like to see people eating together, said Grandmother Jia. She pointed to Butterfly. Now heres a good girl. Why shouldnt she eat with you as well? Go on, child! Go and eat with your mistress. As long as you are here with me, it doesnt matter if you break the rules for once. Come on! said You-shi to the maid encouragingly. Dont pretend to be bashful! Grandmother Jia stopped walking up and down and stood with her hands clasped behind her back to watch them eat. It suddenly struck her that the rice being served was the plain white rice normally eaten by the servants and that You-shi, too, was eating it. Why are you giving Mrs Zhen this stuff? she asked them. There isnt any of Your Old Ladyships rice left, said the maids. You had an extra young lady eating with you today, dont forget. Meals are made to measure nowadays, said Faithful. We cant afford to be extravagant the way we used to be. There have been so many floods and droughts during the past few years, said Lady Wang. Our farms havent been able to make up their quotas. These special kinds of rice are particularly hard to come by. We have had to start rationing them rather carefully. 490 Even the cleverest housewife cant make rice-gruel without rice. Grandmother Jia quoted the proverb amidst general laughter. Faithful turned to address the women waiting outside the door. If Her Old Ladyships rice is all finished, you can get the rice that Miss Tan would have eaten if she hadnt been eating with us and bring it here for Mrs Zhen. No need, said You-shi. What Ive got here is quite enough for me. I dare say it is, said Faithful, but what about me? The women hurried off to fetch the rice. Presently Lady Wang went off to have dinner in her own apartment, leaving You-shi to entertain Grandmother Jia. The time passed quickly, with much good-humoured teasing and laughter, and the first watch had already begun before Grandmother Jia noticed how late it was getting. Youd better be getting back now, she told You-shi. You-shi took her leave. Outside the inner gate she got into her waiting carriage. Her women pulled the blind down, then, taking all the maids with them except Butterfly, who was riding in the carriage with her mistress, hurried on ahead so that they could be waiting for You-shi when she arrived in the other mansion. The men from both gates walked some way along the street to keep it clear of pedestrians while six or seven pages pushed and pulled the carriage it seemed too short a distance and too late an hour for mules as far as the interior of the Ning-guo gateway. There the pages retired, old w6men came forward and raised the blind, and Butterfly dismounted and helped out her mistress. You-shi noticed that there were four or five large carriages waiting below the stone lions which flanked the gate and commented to Butterfly on their presence. I wonder how many horses there are in the stables? If this number came by carriage, you may be sure that a much greater number will have come on horseback. As she and Butterfly entered the outer courtyard, Jia Rongs wife at the head of a party of maids and older women carrying lanterns advanced to meet them. 491 Ive been dying for I dont know how long to have a look at the men while they are gambling, said You-shi, but so far I havent had an opportunity. Tonight is the best chance I shall ever get. Lets go along the wall in front of the windows so that we can peep in at them. The women with lanterns made a detour towards the building in which the men were congregated. One of them went ahead and warned the pages waiting outside not to announce their arrival to the men or make any other noise that would warn those inside of their coming.
Mrs Xue was just in low spirits when you saw her. There was no need for you to bring Cousin Chai into it. Mrs Xue came over because of Cousin Pans court-case. She was worried, and its hardly surprising she wasnt in the mood to entertain you. You just allowed your imagination to run away with you and lead you astray. Her words brought Bao-yu a sudden sense of enlightenment. Of course! he exclaimed with a laugh. Thats exactly it! Youre so much more perceptive than I am! No wonder you defeated me with that koan last year, when I was so wrought up. For all my pretensions, I need you to guide me to the truth. This bumptious Buddha bows to your Single Flower! In that case, said Dai-yu, seeing her opportunity, prepare yourself for another inquisition. Bao-yu crossed his legs, brought the palms of his hands together, closed his eyes, pursed his lips and said Pray begin. Dai-yu Now, let the First of my Propositions be that Cousin Chai likes you. Proposition the Second she likes you not. The Third she liked you a few days ago, but does no more. The Fourth she does today, but will not do tomorrow. The Fifth you like her, but she likes you not. The Sixth and last she likes you, btit you like her not. Consider these Six Propositions well. For several minutes Bao-yu was completely silent. Then suddenly he burst out laughing and cried If all the Seas of Paradise were mine, with my simple gourd Id be content. Dai-yu What if your gourd is carried away by the stream? Bao-yu Never! Wherever the stream flows, the gourd will always hold its own course. Dai-yu What if the flow comes to an end and your Pearl sinks? Bao-yu "Like a catkin held fast in a puddle, -1387 This Zen Mind Not a partridge, gaily cavorting In the spring wind." Dai-yu The first rule of Zen is not to tell lies. Bao-yu But its the truth, so help me Buddha, the Dharma and the Holy Brotherhood. Dai-yu lowered her head in silence. She heard a cawcaw outside the window, and a crow flew up into the sky, wheeling towards the south-east. Bao-yu What sort of an omen is that? Dai-yu Our fates cannot be learned from the cries of birds. Before Bao-yu could think of a reply, Ripple came into the room and said Master Bao, please hurry! The Master sent someone to the Garden to ask if you were home from school yet, Aroma said you were, so youd better be quick! Bao-yu jumped to his feet and hurried out in alarm. Dai-yu did not try to detain him. For the outcome, please read the next chapter. CHAPTER 92 Qiao-jie studies the Lives of Noble Women and shows a precocious enthusiasm for Virtue Jia Zheng admires a Mother Pearl and reflects on the vicissitudes of Life What does Father want me for? asked Bao-yu in some alarm, as they left the Naiads House. Ripple smiled. He doesnt. Aroma told me to fetch you, and I was afraid you wouldnt come, so I made it up... Bao-yu was greatly relieved. I would have come. Theres really no need to scare me like that. He arrived hack at Green Delights, to be interrogated by Aroma Where have you been all this time? At Miss Lins. I got delayed. We were chatting about Aunt Xue and Cousin Chais illness. What were you saying? asked Aroma inquisitively. Bao-yu described his Zen dialogue with Dai-yu. You two are so silly, was Aromas comment. Why cant you have a normal conversation about ordinary things, or discuss something nice like poetry? What do you have to go talking about Zen for? Youre not a monk! You dont understand, replied Bao-yu. We have our Zen secrets. No one else could join in our conversations. I dare say, returned Aroma, with a scornful sniff. Im sure that if you two went on Zennifying at each other till you were both blue in the face, we should still be standing here quite as much in the dark as ever. -347 When I was younger, said Bao-yu, ignoring her jibes, and Dai-yu was rather more childish in her ways, somehow I always managed to upset her by saying the wrong thing. Nowadays I think more about what I say, and she takes offence less easily.
Inform Tealeaf that he is to take Bao-yu first thing tomorrow morning to collect the required textbooks, and then bring them here for my inspection. I shall be accompanying him to school myself. Turning to Bao-yu Off with you! he trumpeted. I shall expect you early tomorrow morning. Bao-yu returned to Green Delights, where Aroma was anxiously awaiting him. The pleasure with which she received the news of his renewed course of study contrasted strangely with the incredulous horror that had rendered him speechless while in Jia Zhengs presence, and that now prompted him to send an urgent message through to Grandmother Jia, begging her to intervene. She sent for him at once and said You should give it a try, my darling. You dont want to anger your father. Dont worry. Remember I shall always be here if you need me. There was nothing for it but to go back and give the maids their instructions. Wake me at the crack of 4awn, as Father will be waiting to take me to school. Aroma and Musk took it in turns to stay awake that night. In the morning Aroma woke Bao-yu punctually, helped him wash, comb his hair and dress, and sent a junior maid out with instructions for Tealeaf to wait with the books at the inner gate. She had to spur him on a couple of times before finally he left and made his way towards the study. On his way he stopped to inquire if Sir Zheng had arrived yet, and was informed by a page from the study that one of the literary gentlemen had just called, but had been kept waiting outside, as the Master was still in his dressing-room. This calmed Bao-yus nerves a little, and he proceeded on to the inner sanctum. As luck would have it, a servant was at that very moment coming out on his way to fetch him, so he went straight in. After another brief homily, Jia Zheng led the way and father and son took a carriage to the school, Tealeaf following with the books. A look-out had been posted, and Dai-ru had been alerted and was standing in readiness for the partys arrival. Before the old man could come forward to greet him, however, Jia Zheng walked into the schoolroom and paid his respects. Dai-ru took him by the hand and inquired politely after Lady Jia. Bao-yu then went up and paid his respects. Jia Zheng remained standing throughout, and insisted on waiting until Dai-ru was seated before sitting down himself. I have come here today, he began, because I felt the need to entrust my son to you personally, and with a few words of instruction. He is no longer a child, and if he is to shoulder his responsibilities and earn a place in the world, it is high time he applied himself conscientiously to preparing for his exams. At home, unfortunately, he spends all his time idling about in the company of children. His verses, the only field in which he has acquired any competence, are for the most part turgid juvenilia, at their best romantic trifles devoid of substance. And he looks such a fine lad, interposed Dai-ru. He seems so intelligent. Why this refusal to study, this per-verse streak of hedonism? Not that one should entirely neglect poetic composition. But there is surely time enough for that later on in ones career. Precisely, said Jia Zheng. For the present I would humbly suggest a course of reading and exegesis of primary scriptural texts, and plenty of compositions. If he should show the least sign of being a recalcitrant pupil, I earnestly beseech you to take him in hand, and in so doing to save him from a shallow and wasted life. On this note he rose, and with a bow and a few parting remarks took his leave. Dai-ru accompanied him to the door. -294 Please convey my respects to Lady Jia. I will, said Jia Zheng, and climbed into his carriage. When Dai-ru returned to the classroom, Bao-yu was already sitting at a small rosewood desk in the south-west corner of the room, by the window. He had two sets of texts and a meagre-looking volume of model compositions stacked in a pile on his right. Tealeaf was instructed to put his paper, ink, brush and inkstone away in the drawer of the desk. I understand you have been ill, Bao-yu, said Dai-ru. I hope you are quite recovered? -258 Bao-yu rose to his feet. Quite recovered, thank you sir. We must see to it that you apply yourself with zeal from now on. Your father is most insistent that you should do well.
Even if I did hate her so much, I wouldn't let him have my own maid to replace her with.' 'What sort of manners are these?' Aunt Xue was trembling all over and her voice was choking. 'Since when did it become acceptable for a young woman to shout at her mother-in-law through the window? I was under the impression that you had been brought up in an educated household. All this shouting and screaming - I can't make out what you are trying to say.' Xue Pan stamped his foot and shouted at Jin-gui despairingly. 'Oh stop, stop! You'll have everyone laughing at us.' Jin-gui, thinking, no doubt, that having gone so far she might as well go all the way, only shouted the louder. 'Why should I care if people laugh at us? Your darling chamber-wife has been trying to do me in. Is this a time to start worrying about whether people are laughing at us or not? Why don't you keep her and sell me instead? Everyone knows how rich the Xues are and how they make use of their money in order to trample on other people. And every- 604 one knows about their fine relations who will always step in and slap anyone down for them who is giving them trouble. what are you waiting for? I dont know why you married me in the first place if you find me so unsatisfactory. Im sure I didnt ask you to come running round to our house, begging and entreating my mother to let you have me as your wife. She rolled about on the bed, weeping and screaming and beating her bosom. Xue Pan was beside himself. Whether he rebuked her, reasoned with her, beat her, or begged her to be silent, it seemed unlikely that anything he did would have much effect. He could only stump in and out of the room, sighing and groaning inarticulately, and concluded by exclaiming, with great bitterness, that he was a very unlucky man. Meanwhile Bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors. Aunt Xue continued to insist that Caltrop must be sold. Bao-chai smilingly expostulated. People like us dont sell servants, Mamma, we only buy them. I think anger is interfering with your judgement. What would people think if they heard that we were planning to sell a servant? They would laugh us to scorn. If Pan and his wife are dissatisfied with Caltrop, let her stay here and work for me. I could do with another maid. If we keep her, it will seem to them like a provocation, said Aunt Xue. Much better send her away and be done with it. I cant see that it makes any difference, said Bao-chai. Provided she never goes into the front part of the house, then as far as they are concerned, it will be just as if she had been sold. Caltrop was already at Aunt Xues feet begging to be allowed to stay and protesting her willingness to serve Bao-chai as a maid. Aunt Xue was obliged to relent. From now on Caltrop spent all her time with Bao-chai and stopped going into the front part of the house altogether. She had at least security now but for all that she was not entirely happy. Sometimes on fine, clear nights she would gaze wet-checked at the moon at other times she might be heard unaccountably sighing to herself while she trimmed a lamp. 605 The fact was that although she had lived with Xue Pan for several years, she had never borne him a child. Some defect in the blood had made her unable to conceive. And now she was ill too. The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid. She became very thin, yet had lost all interest in food. The doctor was called in and medicines were prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good. Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went for her with a cudgel or a knife but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst and of course he could not he could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The only result of it was that Jin-guis power over her husband grew all the stronger. At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind.
She bent down to pick up a pebble and hurled it into the centre of the lake. They heard a plop and saw the distorted image of the moon expand and contract as concentric ripples travelled outwards from the shattered surface. There was a loud squawk, and from the middle of the dark shadow a white stork flew up and flapped his way across the water in the direction of Lotus Pavilion. So thats who it was! said Dai-yu. I wasnt expecting him to be there. He gave me quite a shock. Im very grateful to that stork, said Xiang-yun. Hes given me a first line for the next couplet. -1014 XIANG-YUN Black shades the lamps last gleams annihilate -384 A storks dark shape crosses the cold, bright water Dai-yu murmured admiringly, but stamped with vexation when she began to think about finishing the couplet. Wretched stork, coming to her aid like that! This is not like the rain-swelled swirl couplet Im not going to be able to complete it by paralleling the whole line. A contrast for the dark moving shape is the most I can hope for. But your line is so natural, so simple and expressive. I feel almost like giving up. 522 Perhaps if we both thought about it we could finish it together, said Xiang-yun. Or, if you prefer, lets break off now and you can try again tomorrow. Dai-yu stared up at the sky, ignoring her. Suddenly, after remaining immobile for some seconds, she gave a little laugh. Stop your chatter, girl! I can finish this couplet. Listen -827 DAI- yu -534 Where, moon-embalmed, a dead muse lies in state. Xiang-yun clapped her hands. Excellent! Couldnt be better! I love your dead muse! She sighed. I mean excellent from a purely poetic point of view, because its so original. Its a bit morbid, though. I dont think it can be good for a person in your state of health to indulge in such chilling fantasies. With you to compete against, how else could I keep my end up? said Dai-yu. Because I put so much into that last line- Just at that moment a figure stepped out from behind the spur of rock beyond the tailings. Bravo! An excellent line! said this person. But it is, indeed, a little too melancholy. Dont do any more. If you go on from there, the danger is that you may produce something forced and mechanical, which instead of offsetting the beauty of your line will merely spoil it. Startled by this unexpected interruption, the two girls looked hard in the direction from which it came and with some surprise recognized the speaker as Adamantina. What are you doing here? they asked her. Hearing the sounds of your moon-watching party, followed later by the sound of a flute playing, I was tempted to come out and enjoy the moon myself. I wanted to see it over this open expanse of water, where it appears to most advantage, and as I approached, I could hear you both reciting. Such pure refinement constrained me to stay and listen. But there were lines which, in spite of their excellence contained a note of almost decadent melancholy, lines which made me fearful for the person uttering them. That is why I came out of my concealment and prevented you from going on. Lady Jia has 523 long since broken up the party. Everyone else in the Garden must be in bed by now. I wonder where your maids are. Doubtless they are somewhere looking for you. Are you not afraid of catching cold? Come with me, and I shall give you some hot tea to drink. It must be nearly dawn. Dai-yu laughed. Id no idea the night was so far advanced. The three of them walked together to Green Bower Hermitage. A faint light still flickered in the Buddha shrine and the incense in the burner gave off a tiny smoke. All the old lay-sisters were asleep. A little maid, nodding sleepily on Adamantinas meditation mat, appeared to be the only person still up. She roused herself when Adamantina called to her and made some tea with water from the already boiling kettle. Just at that moment there was a knocking at the gate and the little maid hurried to open it. It turned out to be Nightingale and Kingfisher with two or three old womenservants, looking for their mistresses. They found their mistresses drinking tea inside. Well! they said. Youve led us a fine old dance! Weve been all over the Garden looking for you. We even tried Mrs Xues outside. In the end we happened to go to that little pavilion under the mountain, just as the caretakers were waking up.
But Dai-yu now saw herself as Bao-yus future bride, and felt a need to behave towards. him with scrupulous modesty. If he should come to see me, she argued with herself, I should have to receive him politely, for the sake of our childhood friendship. But as for going over to see him myself, that is quite out of the question. So she turned a deaf ear to Aromas entreaties. Aroma next went secretly to tell Tan-chun. But Tan-chun was herself plunged in gloom. To her mind, the strange flowering of the crab-trees had been the first of a series of ill omens, followed by the still stranger loss of the Precious Jade, and now by her sisters death. With the family fortunes so evidently on the decline, how could she find it in herself to rally Bao-yus spirits? Besides, as brother and sister, they were obliged to maintain a certain distance. She did visit him once or twice, but he seemed indifferent to her presence and she made no further efforts. Bao-chai also knew of the missing jade. Her mother had already told her of her proposed betrothal to Bao-yu, the day she discussed it with Lady Wang and all but consented. Although it is your Aunt Wangs proposal, she had said to Bao-chai, I have still not given my final consent. I said we should have to wait until Pan comes home. What do you say to the idea? Are you willing? Mother, replied Bao-chai, in a most serious tone, you dont need to ask me. A daughters future lies in her parents hands. Since Father is dead, the decision is entirely yours. Consult Pan, if you wish, but why me? Aunt Xue was most touched by this display of modesty in her daughter, proof that her basically sound character had not been in any way spoiled by her luxurious upbringing. She would not mention Bao-yus name to her again. Bao-chai for her part maintained a strict taboo from that day forth on those two syllables. So when she came to hear of the missing jade, despite the concern she felt, she refrained from inquiring any further and contented herself with what she gleaned from those around her, while maintaining a show of complete indifference. Aunt Xue, on the other hand, sent a maid over several times to inquire after Bao-yu. She was also greatly concerned about her own son, and awaited her elder brothers arrival with impatience. His influence would surely secure Pans release. With the death of the Imperial Concubine, she could see how busy the Jias were. But as Xi-feng was well enough to take charge of the household management, she did not feel it necessary to visit them often. The one to suffer most during all this was Aroma, although she tried to remain quiet and calm, and to comfort Bao-yu and minister to his needs. He seemed to understand nothing, and she could only watch over him in secret anguish. After a few days, Yuan-chuns coffin was laid out in the Imperial Chapel of Rest, and Grandmother Jia and the other senior members of the family attended funeral services there for several days. Bao-yu was becoming daily more and more of an imbecile. He had no fever and was not in any physical pain, but he was eating little and sleeping less and becoming quite incoherent in his speech. Aroma, Musk and the other maids were at their wits end, and several times went to report to Xi-feng, who came over constantly to see how he was. At first she had thought that he was simply upset that his jade had not been found. But now, seeing the deranged state into which he was sinking, she sent for the doctor. The doctor paid daily visits, and more than one kind of medicine was prescribed, but all seemed to do more harm than good. To all inquiries as to where he felt pain, he was quite unable to reply. When Yuan-chuns funeral ceremonies were over, Grandmother Jias thoughts turned again to Bao-yu, and she came to the Garden to visit him, accompanied by Lady Wang. Aroma told Bao-yu to go out and greet her properly. Bao-yu was still able to get about, and managed to greet his grandmother presentably, with Aroma at his side prompting him at every turn. My dear boy! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. I am so relieved! I was led to believe that you were seriously ill. But now I see that you are quite your normal self. Lady Wang too seemed pleasantly surprised. Bao-yu said nothing and gave an inane grin. They went in and sat down. When Grandmother Jia asked him a question, he could only repeat whatever Aroma said.
The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew. Wont you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth watching. What time is it? Grandmother Jia asked. Past two oclock, said Lady Wang. The children couldnt hold out any longer. They have all gone off to bed. Grandmother Jia looked round the table. Only Tan-chun was still sitting there in the semicircle of empty chairs. Well, said Grandmother Jia, they are not used to staying up late. Considering the amount of weakness and sickliness there is among them, I suppose it is just as well. But theres my little Tan, sitting there all on her own, poor child! You go to bed too, my dear. Well end the party now. 512 She got up herself as she said this, and after taking a sip or two of green tea, climbed into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the Garden by two women, the rest walking beside her or following close behind. But of her and them no more. One of the women who remained behind to clear the table and stack the crockery noticed that a single porcelain cup was missing. After looking everywhere for it unsuccessfully, she appealed to the other servants. I suppose one of you must have dropped it accidentally and thrown it away somewhere. Do please tell us, and let us have the broken pieces, so that when we report the loss we shant be accused of having stolen it. None of us has broken it, said the others. It might have been a maid of one of the young ladles that broke it. If you can think who it might have been, I should go and ask them. You are right, said the woman, suddenly recollecting. I remember Kingfisher coming to fetch a cup for her mistress. I must go and ask her for it. She had not far to look. A short way along the paved path at the bottom of the steps she came upon her and Nightingale walking along together. It was Kingfisher who spoke first. Oh, has Her Old Ladyship ended the party then? I suppose you dont know where my mistress has gone? Ive come to ask you what youve done with one of our teacups, said the woman, and you ask me about your mistress! Kingfisher laughed. I poured out a cup of tea some time ago and handed it to her, and the next thing I knew was shed disappeared - with the teacup. Her Ladyship said just now that the young ladies had all gone to bed, said the woman. I dont know where you two can have been larking about all this time not to know anything about it. Im sure our mistresses wouldnt have slipped off to bed without telling us, said Kingfisher. More likely they lust went off for a walk. Perhaps when Her Old Ladyship left they joined the others to see her back to her apartment. Well go 513 over there now and have a look. If they are there, we shall know where your cup is. Why dont you come round and ask me for it tomorrow? Theres no pressing hurry for it now, is there? Theres no hurry as long as I know where it is, said the woman. Ill call round and ask you for it tomorrow. She went back to the pavilion then, to finish stacking the crockery. Lady Wang was wrong. Dai-yu and Xiang-yun had not gone to bed. The sight of all those Jias enjoying the moonlight in spite of Grandmother Jias complaint that the numbers were so few and the thought of Bao-chai and Bao-qin enjoying a moon-party of their own with Aunt Xue and the two Xue males made the occasion a painful one for Dai-yu. She had slipped away not in order to go to bed but to lean on the terrace railings and cry. Bao-yu on this occasion had little thought for anything but Skybrights illness, which had lately taken a serious turn for the worse, and after several appeals from his mother to go to bed, he had availed himself of the excuse for going back in order to find out how she was. Tanchun was still feeling too much out of temper after the recent d9mestic upheavals to have any appetite for amusement. Ying-chun and Xi-chun might have kept Dai-yu company, but since they did not as a rule get on with her very well, it would not have occurred to them to do so. That left only Xiang-yun to offer her some comfort. Now coz, this wont do! Youre an intelligent girl you must take more care of yourself.
You'll have everyone laughing at us.' Jin-gui, thinking, no doubt, that having gone so far she might as well go all the way, only shouted the louder. 'Why should I care if people laugh at us? Your darling chamber-wife has been trying to do me in. Is this a time to start worrying about whether people are laughing at us or not? Why don't you keep her and sell me instead? Everyone knows how rich the Xues are and how they make use of their money in order to trample on other people. And every- 604 one knows about their fine relations who will always step in and slap anyone down for them who is giving them trouble. what are you waiting for? I dont know why you married me in the first place if you find me so unsatisfactory. Im sure I didnt ask you to come running round to our house, begging and entreating my mother to let you have me as your wife. She rolled about on the bed, weeping and screaming and beating her bosom. Xue Pan was beside himself. Whether he rebuked her, reasoned with her, beat her, or begged her to be silent, it seemed unlikely that anything he did would have much effect. He could only stump in and out of the room, sighing and groaning inarticulately, and concluded by exclaiming, with great bitterness, that he was a very unlucky man. Meanwhile Bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors. Aunt Xue continued to insist that Caltrop must be sold. Bao-chai smilingly expostulated. People like us dont sell servants, Mamma, we only buy them. I think anger is interfering with your judgement. What would people think if they heard that we were planning to sell a servant? They would laugh us to scorn. If Pan and his wife are dissatisfied with Caltrop, let her stay here and work for me. I could do with another maid. If we keep her, it will seem to them like a provocation, said Aunt Xue. Much better send her away and be done with it. I cant see that it makes any difference, said Bao-chai. Provided she never goes into the front part of the house, then as far as they are concerned, it will be just as if she had been sold. Caltrop was already at Aunt Xues feet begging to be allowed to stay and protesting her willingness to serve Bao-chai as a maid. Aunt Xue was obliged to relent. From now on Caltrop spent all her time with Bao-chai and stopped going into the front part of the house altogether. She had at least security now but for all that she was not entirely happy. Sometimes on fine, clear nights she would gaze wet-checked at the moon at other times she might be heard unaccountably sighing to herself while she trimmed a lamp. 605 The fact was that although she had lived with Xue Pan for several years, she had never borne him a child. Some defect in the blood had made her unable to conceive. And now she was ill too. The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid. She became very thin, yet had lost all interest in food. The doctor was called in and medicines were prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good. Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went for her with a cudgel or a knife but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst and of course he could not he could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The only result of it was that Jin-guis power over her husband grew all the stronger. At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind. Finding herself now under attack from that quarter, she was unwilling to yield an inch and gave back as good as she got. When, after a few slanging-matches, Jin-gui grew really angry and began not only to curse her but to lay hands on her as well, she did not quite dare to return blow for blow, but she put on a fine display of hysteria, shrieking, rolling about on the floor and threshing about with her limbs. Thereafter she was constantly threatening suicide, and at any hour of the day or night they might have to snatch knives or scissors from her grasp or take down the noose which she had fastened for herself over a beam.
Instead of the young man in his crimson-curtained bed, why not say the young man at his rosy-misted casement? Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly. Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I havent got that sort of gauze in my windows so though rosy-misted casement is a great improvement, I dont think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would be a bit presumptuous. But why? said Dai-yu, smiling. My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to lend furs and horses and feel no resentment when they came back the worse for wear. And that was to mere acquaintances we two are members of the same family. I agree with you that one ought to share with ones friends, said Bao-yu, and not only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them. But for a mere male to arrogate to himself what properly belongs to you girls would be quite a different matter. It would be better to alter young man and maiden and let it be your elegy. After all, you were always very well-disposed towards Skybright. Id rather give the elegy to someone else than throw away your rosy-misted casement. Lets make it The mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted And the maid beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated. I should be very happy to alter it in that way, even though it would mean that the elegy would cease to have anything to do with me. 584 She wasnt my maid, said Dai-yu. It doesnt make sense. Besides, mistress and maid are such an unpoetical combination. I might want to use this version when Nightingale is dead, but that wont be for a long while yet, I imagine. Come now, its not very nice to talk about Nightingale dying, said Bao-yu, laughing. You started it, said Dai-yu. I know what, said Bao-yu. Ive got a still better solution. Why dont we just say I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated? Dai-yu momentarily changed colour yet though the words filled her with an almost unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded approvingly at his suggestion. Yes, thats a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. Im sure you must have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xings place first thing tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Yings betrothal has been decided on. I expect they want you there for the ceremony. Whats the hurry? said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. Ive not been feeling particularly well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow. How typical! said Dai-yu. I should try to grow out of these childish ways if I were you. You are getting too old- She broke off in a fit of coughing. Bao-yu at once became concerned about her. Theres a nasty wind here. I dont know why we are standing around in the cold like this. Wed better be getting back now. Theres no sense in making ourselves ill. I ought to be going back now in any case, said Dai-yu. Its time I went to bed. Well see each other again tomorrow. She began to walk away. Bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction. Suddenly it occurred to him that 585 Dai-yu was unaccompanied and he told the little maid to run after her and see her back to her apartment. Back at Green Delights he found some old women with a message from his mother. It was as Dai-yu had said. He was to go over first thing next morning to his Uncle Shes house. The family that Jia She was proposing to marry his daughter into was called Sun. They were a Da-tong family whose menfolk had all, for several generations, been Army officers. A former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the Ning and Rong brothers, so their claim to a special relationship with the Jia family was a strong One.
Xi-feng considered the probabilities. Somehow I dont think they would have told her. At all events, there is no point in harrving them about it now. We shall just have to put that question behind us. The important thing now is to make sure that Mother gets what she wants. Id rather we went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble. She turned to Patience. Take some of my gold things again and get us another two hundred taels. -As soon as she has the money ready, you can take it to Mother immediately, and that should be the end of the matter, she told Jia Lian. Might as well raise four hundred taels while you are about it, said Jia Lian. We could do with another two hundred ourselves. I dont see that at all, said Xi-feng. We dont really need two hundred taels ourselves. And in any case, if we raise so much now, where is the money corning from later for getting the things out of pawn? Patience fetched the now familiar gold necklaces and told Brighties wife to take them to the pawnshop. Soon afterwards Brighties wife was back again with the cash and Jia Lian went in person to hand it over to his mother. While Jia Lian was taking the money to Lady Xing, Xi-feng and Patience continued to ask themselves who could have leaked the information about the surreptitious removal of Grandmother Jias valuables. Its too bad! said Xi-feng. Poor Faithful will be in trouble over this, and all because of us. While they were still wondering who it could have been, Lady Wang was announced. This was a surprise, for Xi-feng could think of no reason why she should be visiting them. She and Patience hurried out to greet her. Lady Wang had only one maid, a trusted junior, in attend- 458 ance. There was an angry expression on her face and she walked swiftly through the house into the inner room and sat down grimly on the kang, all without uttering a word. Xi-feng, concealing her apprehension behind a smile, hurriedly served her with tea. Its an unusual honour to have you here, Aunt. Patience, leave the room! Lady Wang commanded. Yesm, said Patience, wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried out, taking all the other maids with her. She stood by the outer door until they were all outside, then closed it after her and sat down at the top of the steps to prevent anyone going in. As Xi-feng, now thoroughly alarmed, watched her aunt and wondered why she had come, Lady Wang, who appeared to be on the point of weeping, drew an embroidered pouch from her sleeve and threw it on the kang. Look at that! Xi-feng hastily picked it up and found herself, to her great surprise, looking at a lewd picture, beautifully embroidered in silks. Where did you get it from? she asked. The tears that had collected in Lady Wangs eyes pouted down her cheeks now and the voice in which she answered was choked and trembling. Where did I get it from? I sit all day at the bottom of a well. As you seemed such a conscientious young woman, I thought I could leave things to you and enjoy some leisure, but it seems that you are no better at managing than I. Fancy leaving a thing like that in the Garden - on a rockery, too, in broad daylight, where everyone could see it! It was picked up by one of Grandmothers maids. If your mother-in-law hadnt fortunately spotted the girl carrying it, it would have gone straight to Grandmother. I think its for you to tell me how it came to be dropped there. It was Xi-fengs turn to look angry. How do you know its mine? Lady Wang sighed and shed a few more tears. How can you ask me that? Who in this household apart from you and Lian could a thing like this belong to? The old 459 women would have no use for a thing like this and none of the girls would know where to get one from. Obviously that wretched, worthless Lian must have got hold of it from somewhere and you, treating it, I suppose, as a great joke, were only too happy to receive it from him. I know that young couples do go in for this sort of thing why try to deny it? But the young people in the Garden are still innocent. Suppose one of their maids had picked it up and shown it to them? It doesnt bear thinking of. Or suppose a maid had picked it up and told someone from outside that she had found it in the Garden? What sort of reputation would that leave our family with?
She was surrounded by handsome young noblemen, all asking for her hand in marriage. There were matchmakers hustling her towards a bridal carriage against her will. Then the scene changed again. Now she was being kidnapped. A gang of ruffians with swords and clubs was threatening her, mauling her. She started screaming for help. By now the old nuns and lay-sisters were wide awake, and had come hurrying into the hall with candles to discover the cause of the disturbance. They found her lying on the ground, with her arms outstretched, frothing at the mouth. She was woken from this apparent coma, only to fix her eyes into a rigid stare and cry out, her cheeks burning a fierce crimson Buddha is my Protector! Dont touch me, you ruffians! The women were too scared to do anything but call out Wake up! Wake up! Were here now! I want to go home! replied Adamantina. Wholl be my friend and take me home? But this is your home! While the others stayed talking to her, one of the nuns was sent to pray at the shrine of the Goddess of Mercy. She shook the bamboo-box of tallies kept by the altar, and on consulting the relevant passage in the divination-book read that the Yin spirit of the south-west corner had been offended. Of course! exclaimed one of the others, when she reported back. The south-west corner of the Garden was originally uninhabited, so it would be sure to contain a high concentration of Yin essence. Some busied themselves making soup, others brought water. One of the nuns, who had come with Adaniantina from the South and was for that reason closer and more devoted to her than the others, sat next to her on the couch and put her arms protectively round her. Adamantina turned her head Whos that? Its only me. Adamantina looked at her curiously for a minute. Oh it really is! she cried, and flung her arms round the nun, sobbing hysterically. Oh Mother, save me, or Im going to die! The nun called out to her in an attempt to bring her to her senses, and began to massage her gently. The old women brought in tea, and they sat up together till dawn when finally Adamantina dozed off. The nun sent for the doctor, and several doctors came and took her pulses. There were as many differing diagnoses as there were doctors. Excessive worry damaging the spleen phlogistic intrusion into the haematic system offence caused to an evil spirit a combination of internal and external chill. None of these seemed conclusive. Finally a doctor came whose first question after reading her pulses was -294 Did the young lady practise meditation? The women informed him that it was a regular thing with her. -294 And did this illness develop quite suddenly last night? Yes, it did. Indubitably a case of heat in the cardiac orb affording entrance to a vagrant evil spirit. Will she be all right? Luckily the meditation does not seem to have been too far advanced and the spirit was therefore not able to penetrate too deeply. She will most probably recover. He wrote out a prescription for the Dephlogistication of the Cardiac Orb, after one dose of which Adamantina began to show signs of improvement. News of her attack soon spread, and it became a sublect of gossip for the lads in town. All that chastity and religion was bound to be too much for a girl of her age. Especially such an attractive, lively thing... Sooner or later shell get soft on some lucky fellow and run away. A few days later Adamantina was slightly better. But her concentration seemed to have gone and she often found herself drifting off into a dreamlike state. The news did not reach Xi-chun for a few days. She was sitting in her room when Landscape came hurrying in. Miss, have you heard whats happened to Sister Adamantina? No - what is it? I heard Miss Xing and Mrs Zhu talking about it yesterday. Remember that day she was here playing Go? Apparently that very night she had a fit. She was talking about bandits trying to carry her away and all sorts of other strange things. She still hasnt quite recovered. Dont you think its peculiar? Xi-chun thought silently to herself So for all her fastidious purity, Addies worldly karma is still not complete. If only I had been born into a different family! If only I were free to become a nun! I would never be tempted by evil spirits. I know I would be able to subdue every unholy thought and achieve total detachment from the world and all its entanglements. With this thought she experienced a sudden sense of illumination, which she tried to express in the following gtha Since at first there was no space, Things can have no proper place.
He is taking his studies more seriously now, replied Lady J ia. His father has been extremely strict with him, and he is turning into quite a little scholar. I am so glad to hear that. Yuan-chun gave orders for their luncheon to be served in the outer reception-hall, and two ladies-in-waiting, assisted by four junior eunuchs, escorted them out. The seating had been arranged in accordance with Jia family precedence, and the ladies sat down to an immaculately presented meal, details of which our narrative omits. When luncheon was over, the four ladies returned to give thanks. After further desultory chat, they saw that it was nearly five oclock, and anxious not to overstep their limit, took their leave. Yuan-chun sent one of her ladiesin-waiting to accompany them as far as the Inner Gate, where the same four eunuchs were waiting to guide them out. Lady Jia and company stepped into their chairs and were carried to the Outer Gate, where they were joined by Jia She and the menfolk. The whole family returned in procession together. The Visitation was repeated the following day and the day after, and as the arrangements made were identical to the last detail, we need not elaborate any further here. -1094 Meanwhile, in the Xue household, things were going from bad to worse. Ever since Xue Pans disappearance, Jin-gui had felt the lack of a sparring partner. Caltrop Lily had moved out to live with Bao-chai, and the only person left within range was Moonbeam. But since her promotion to the Masters bed, Moonbeam had acquired a new selfassurance, and Jin-gui soon observed that her stratagem in giving Moonbeam to Pan had misfired. Her maid had indeed become her strongest rival. Very well, she thought to herself one day, when she had been drinking heavily and was lying on her kang in a maudlin frame of mind, lets see what shes worth... A round or two with Moonbeam might be just the seltzer she needed. Come on! she taunted her. Wheres our precious Lord and Master disappeared to, eh? Wheres he hiding? You do know, of course, dont you? Ive not the least idea, replied Moonbeam coolly. If he wouldnt tell you, Mrs Pan, no one else is likely to know. Spare me the "Mrs", will you! said Jin-gui with a malicious smile. You and that Lily think you run the place, dont you? I cant get near that little Miss Unmolestable, with all her friends in high places to take care of her - all right! I wont stick my neck out in that direction! But youre still my maid, I dont have to take cheek from you! If youre so sure of yourself, why not get on with it and strangle me? Then you and Lily can have the field to yourselves. Im just in your way - go on, say it! Moonbeam wasnt taking this lying down. She looked J in-gui straight in the eye Mrs Pan, you have no right to accuse me like that! When have I ever said a word against you? Just because you cant do anything to her, theres no need to take it Out on me! Youre just being a bully! You know what the real trouble is, so why pretend you dont? She burst into floods of tears and Jin-gui, who was now back in her element, clambered fuming down from the kang and went after her. Moonbeam had learned a thing or two in the Xia household and fought back every inch of the way. Jin-gui, ignoring her cries and protestations of innocence, attacked her with whatever she could lay hands on, and chairs, tables, cups and bowls were soon flying in every direction. Aunt Xue happened to be in Bao-chais room and heard the terrible racket they were making. Caltrop, she ordered without thinking, go over and see whats going on, will you? Try and get them to quieten down. You cant possibly send Caltrop, Bao-chai reminded her. That would only make things worse. Very well then, I shall go myself, declared Aunt Xue. I dont think you should, Mama, advised Bao-chai. We shall have to let them fight it out. Theres nothing we can do, Im afraid. What an intolerable state of affairs! cried Aunt Xue, and leaning on one of her maids she set off in the direction of Jin-guis apartment. Bao-chai followed reluctantly giving Caltrop strict tructions to stay behind. As they approached Jin-guis apartment, they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside.
Besides, I know youre a bit short of help. Listen, all you have to do is take your medicine like a good girl and look on the bright side a bit, and youll soon start to build up your strength. And then we can start having meetings of our poetry club again, and everything will be fine. Tans right, echoed Xiang-yun. Wont that be fun! Oh, if only you knew! sobbed Dai-yu. I feel so weak. I dont think Ill ever pull through. Thats no way to talk, said Tan-chun. We all fall ill, we all have our troubles. Theres no cause for you to be so pessimistic. Be sensible and have a good rest now. Yun and I had better go over to Grannies. Well come and see you again later. If theres anything you need, tell Nightingale and Ill send it over for you. Tan, when you see Grannie, you wont say Im very ill, will you? Please! Tears were streaming down Dai-yus face as she spoke. Just curtsey for me and say Im not feeling very well but its nothing serious and shes not to worry. Of course. Now dont fuss. Just rest and get better. Tan-chun and Xiang-yun went on their way. When they had gone, Nightingale settled Dai-yu down once more. She left all the fetching and carrying to Snow-goose, and herself stayed constantly at Dai-yus side, trying her best not to betray her own distress by shedding any more tears. Dai-yu closed her eyes and lay still for a while. But sleep would not come. The garden outside, which had always been such a haven of quiet and solitude, now seemed alive with sounds - the wind, insects buzzing, birds chattering, the fall of human footsteps, children crying faintly in the distance - all of which drifted in through the window and set her nerves on edge. She told Nightingale to let down the curtains around her bed. Presently Snowgoose appeared, carrying before her in both hands a bowl of Birds Nest Soup, which she gave to Nightingale, who whispered through the curtains Would you like some soup, Miss? A faint yes was heard from inside, and handing the soup back to Snowgoose for the moment, Nightingale climbed up and helped Dai-yu into a comfortable sitting position. Turning to take the bowl again, she first tasted the contents herself, then held it carefully to Dai-yus lips, while supporting her firmly round the shoulder with one arm. Dai-yu opened her eyes feebly, took a couple of sips, then showed by a shake of her head that she could not manage any more. Nightingale handed the bowl back to Snowgoose and gently settled her down again. For a few minutes all was quiet and Dai-yu seemed more peaceful. Then a whisper was heard from outside the window Is Nightingale in? Snowgoose hurried out. It was Aroma. Come in, she whispered. Hows Miss Lin? asked Aroma. They walked together towards the doorway and Aroma listened aghast as Snowgoose described what had happened that morning and the preceding night. No wonder! she exclaimed. Kingfisher said something of the sort just now and had Master Bao so worried that he sent me straight round to find out how she is. As they were talking, Nightingale lifted the portiere and beckoned to Aroma, who tiptoed into the room Is Miss Lin asleep? Nightingale nodded. Has Snowgoose told you? she added. Aroma nodded, then frowned and said This is dreadful! Master Bao had me worried to death last night too! What do you mean? asked Nightingale. Aroma explained When he went to sleep in the evening he seemed perfectly all right. But in the middle of the night he started screaming his head off , first about a pain in his heart, and then about being stabbed by a knife - he was quite delirious, and didnt quieten down till after the dawn watch. Wouldnt you have been scared? Hes not allowed to go to school today, and the doctor has been sent for to prescribe something for him. While they were talking, Dai-yu could be heard coughing again from inside the bed-curtains, and Nightingale hurried over to hold up the spittoon. Dai-yu opened her eyes feebly Whos that youre talking to? Its Aroma, Miss. Shes come to ask how you are. Aroma was already standing close by the bed. Dai-yu told Nightingale to help her up and gestured to Aroma to sit down on the bed. Aroma perched on the edge and said in her best bedside manner Are you sure you ought to be sitting up like this, Miss?
The colour rose in Aunt Xues cheeks and she sighed Please dont ever mention it again. Since the day Pan married that wretched wife we havent had a moments peace. The bickering, the nastiness, its been too awful. Ive tried talking to her several times, but she is quite impervious to reason. And I cant bear quarrelling with them all the time, so I just end up trying to turn a blind eye. Yes, she decided to change Caltrops name because she said she didnt like it. Oh well, said Grandmother Jia, whats in a name when alls said and done?" I shall die for shame! cried Aunt Xue. Im sure all of you know the real reason. It wasnt the name. It was the fact that Ba6-chai had thought of it in the first place. Thats what she really objected to. What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia. Aunt Xue had been dabbing at her eyes all the while with her handkerchief. She heaved another deep sigh before she was able to continue. Surely you must know? Every single thing my daughter-in-law does is aimed at provoking Bao-chai. She wont leave her alone. The other day, when you sent someone round to see me, we were in the middle of one of our scenes! That must have been the day I heard you had a little bit of a liver upset, said Grandmother Jia tactfully. I was going to send someone over to see how you were, but then I heard that you were feeling better so I thought no more about it. You should take my advice, dear, and stop worrying. Theyre a newly married couple and you must give them time to settle down. And youre so lucky to have Chai. She is such a gentle, unflappable girl. She may be young, but my word, she has the aplomb of someone twice her age! When my maid came back and told us what had happened that day and the way she coped with it, we were all singing her praises. Such a wonderful disposition! Shes a girl in a million. When she gets married, if you dont mind my saying so, her mother-in-law will take her to her bosom and the whole household will be devoted to her, I am certain of it. Earlier, Bao-yu had found the general tenor of the conversation rather distasteful, and was just saying something about having to leave when his grandmother embarked upon this eulogy of Bao-chai, and he found himself listening with rapt attention. Whats the use? said Aunt Xue. Whatever her qualities, she is still only a daughter. With a son as hopeless -as Pan, I can have no peace I never stop worrying in case he has gone off to one of his haunts, had too much to drink again and landed himself in another brawl. In fact the only time I ever feel at all reassured is when hes over here with his cousins Zhen and Lian. At this, Bao-yu chirped up Theres really nothing to fear, Auntie. I can vouch for Cousin Pans friends. They are all serious businessmen and far too respectable to get into trouble. In that case, said Aunt Xue with a smile, perhaps I shouldnt worry. Supper was over by now, and Bao-yu excused himself, saying he still had some preparation to do that evening. The maids were serving tea, when Amber came into the room and whispered something in Grandmother Jias ear. She turned to Xi-feng Youd better go quickly, my dear. Its Qiao-jie. Xi-feng had no idea what the matter could be and the others were as puzzled as she was. Patience sent one of the younger maids round with a message for you, Mrs Lian, explained Amber, crossing over to where Xi-feng sat. Miss Qiao-jie does not seem at all well and would you please go over as soon as possible. Youd better go straight away, said Grandmother Jia. You dont have to stand on ceremony for your Aunt Xue. Yes Grannie, said Xi-feng, and she took her leave of Aunt Xue. As she was on her way out she heard Lady Wang say You go ahead. Ill be along shortly. Tell the maids to be quiet and not to make a lot of fuss. Little ones get so easily unsettled. And make sure that kitten and puppy are kept well out of the way. Poor child! I suppose little upsets are to be expected in a family as greatly blessed as ours. Xi-feng promised Lady Wang to carry out her instructions and left with her maid. After her departure, Aunt Xue went on to inquire after Dai-yus health.
A brief search soon revealed the missing item. Has Ying-chun gone back yet? Jia Zheng asked her in the course of conversation. How is she getting on with the Suns? The poor girl could do nothing but cry while she was here, replied Lady Wang. She says her husband is an absolute monster. Jia Zheng sighed as she told him Ying-chuns sad tale. I knew they were unsuited, he commented. But what could I do? Brother She insisted on going ahead with it. The child will have her share of suffering, Im afraid. Theyve not been married long, dont forget, replied Lady Wang. We must hope that time will sort things out for them. She suddenly laughed. Whats the joke? asked Jia Zheng. -384 Oh, I just remembered some nonsense of Bao-yus. He came here first thing this morning specially to talk to me about Ying-chun. Oh yes? What did he have to say? Lady Wang gave a humorous account of her early morning interview with Bao-yu and of his brilliant plan, which despite himself Jia Zheng found rather amusing. Speaking of Bao-yu, he said, in a more serious tone, the boy spends all his time loafing about in the garden - it simply wont do. With ones daughters - well, one has ones disappointments, I realize, but in the long run girls get married and leave the family anyway. With a son, however, it is totally different. If he should fall by the wayside, the whole future of the family could be threatened. It so happens that only the other day a friend recommended a tutor, a widely-read scholar, a man of the highest principles, and what is more a southerner like ourselves. But I have come to the conclusion that s6uth-erners are altogether too easy-going for the boys up here in the capital, who misbehave themselves abominably and are most of them smart enough to get by without having to do a stroke of work. Theyre a bumptious breed to begin with, and if their teacher mollycoddles them and is not prepared to take them down a peg or two, its a waste of everyones time. That is why it has never been a family practice to engage outside tutors, and why we have always had a member of the clan, an older man, with a decent smattering of culture of course, to run the school. Dai-ru, the present preceptor, may be rather a mediocre scholar, but hes certainly an effective disciplinarian, and sees to it that the work gets done. Bao-yus present state of idleness is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and in my opinion the best solution would be for him to resume his studies at the Family School. I agree with you entirely, said Lady Wang. Since your last posting he has been constantly ill, and what with one thing and another has fallen a long way behind with his studies. I think the routine of going to school would do him good. Jia Zheng nodded, and they continued chatting for a while longer. -1307 Little time was lost. The very next day, as soon as Bao-yu was up and had finished washing and combing his hair, a deputation of pages arrived and sent in the message Sir Zheng wishes to see Master Bao. Hurriedly tidying his clothes, Bao-yu went straight over to his fathers study. He paid his morning respects and stood to attention. Tell me, Jia Zheng began, what you have been doing recently in the way of work? A fair amount, were you going to say? A very magnum opus of your worthless doodling, no doubt... I have observed you of late. Your idleness goes from strength to strength. I am also constantly hearing of some new ailment of yours, or shall we rather say ingenious pretext to play truant. I trust I find you fully recovered? Another thing I gather you spend the greater part of your time fooling around with your cousins in the garden, and that even the maidservants are permitted to participate in your infantile antics. Isnt it time you grew up and acquired a little self-esteem? You must understand that those verses you write are not going to impress anyone. The only thing the examiners are interested in is a well-written composition. And the effort you have expended in that direction has so far been non-existent. Now listen carefully to what I have to say. From today, I want you to forget all about your verses and couplets. You are to concentrate exclusively on Octopartite Compositions. I will give you twelve months grace. If by the end of that time you are still in your present unregenerate state, you may as well give up altogether, and I for my part shall have to think again about owning a creature like you as my son.
The rest can stay here and look after his apartment. Bao-yu remained silent throughout all of this, grinning inanely. Grandmother J ia took him by the hand and led him out, Aroma and the others clustering round to support him as far as the garden gate. When they reached her apartment, Grandmother Jia told Lady Wang to sit down, and herself supervised the putting in order of the inner room. When this was done, she spoke to Lady Wang You know why I have brought him over here, dont you? In the first place, there are so few people living in the garden now, and I cant help feeling theres something odd about the way those crab-trees in his courtyard died so suddenly, and then so suddenly flowered. Before now he could always rely on his jade to keep any evil influences at bay. But now that it is lost, I am afraid the evil can get in more easily. So I thought it best for him to stay here with me. He had better not go out for a few days. When the doctor comes, he can see him here. Of course you are right, said Lady Wang promptly. Your good luck will shelter him from any such influences, now that he is here. My luck! Nothing of the sort! It is quieter here, that is all, and there are plently of sutras for him to, read, to help settle his mind. Ask him if he agrees. When his mother put the question to him, Bao-yu merely smiled. Finally, prompted by Aroma, he answered, Yes Mother. Lady Wang was moved to tears by the pitiful spectacle her son presented, but contained herself in Grandmother Jias presence. Grandmother Jia could see that she was somewhat overwrought, and told her to go back to her own apartment. Leave him to me. I shall look after him. When his father gets home this evening, tell him there is no need for him to come and see me today. I do not want him to know yet. When Lady Wang had left, Grandmother Jia told Faithful to bring her one of her sedative remedies. Bao-yu took it and there we must leave them, for the present. Jia Zheng, on his way home that evening, heard from within his carriage the following conversation in the street If you want to get rich, I know of an easy way... Oh? Whats that? I heard today that at Rong-guo House one of the young nobs has lost a jade, and theyve posted a notice of reward, with all the details - shape, size, colour, etc. Ten thousand theyre offering to anyone who hands it in, and five thousand for information! Jia Zheng did not catch every word. But he heard enough to be considerably alarmed. He hurried home, and on arrival summoned one of the janitors and questioned him bout the whole affair. I knew nothing of all this until today, sir, replied the janitor. The first I heard of it was this afternoon, when Mr Lian gave us Her Old Ladyships orders to put the posters up. We are doomed! said Jia Zheng to himself with a bitter sigh. This son of mine is the bane of our lives! When he was a child he was the talk of the, neighbourhood. It has taken us these last ten years or more to stop their tongues, and now we have to go putting up a poster like this, announcing our troubles to the world! He went in without further delay and questioned Lady Wang, who told him the whole story. When he learnt that the reward was the old ladys idea, Jia Zheng knew that he could not very well openly oppose it. He criticized Lady Wang instead for her part in it, and going out once more, gave orders for the posters to be taken down without Grandmother Jias knowledge. As it turned out, some local loafers had already pulled them down. Despite this, a day or two later, a man did arrive at the main gate of Rong-guo House, claiming to have brought the jade. The servants were ecstatic. Give it here! they cried. Well take it in for you. Not so fast! The man fumbled inside his gown, and brought out the reward poster. Look here, he said, pointing to the wording on the poster. This is what your masters put up, isnt it? Ten thousand taels for return of jade - plain as daylight. I may be a pauper today, my man, but wait till I come into my ten thousand. Youll sing a different tune then. The gateman could see he was a difficult customer. Well at least give us a look, so we can go in and report. At first the man refused. But eventually he allowed himself to be persuaded, and producing it from within his gown, he exhibited the jade to them fleetingly on the palm of his hand, saying Isnt this what you are looking for?
Glad tidings to the Mistress of this House I bring. It was Huans turn next. He wrote his out and began to recite -347 Plants should put out buds in spring Our crab trees timings topsy-turvy. Of all the wonders of the world Ours is the only winter-flowering tree. Then Jia Lan made a careful copy of his poem, in immaculate kai-shu calligraphy, and presented it to his great-grandmother, who asked Li Wan to read it out for her. -827 Your mist-congealed beauty blighted in the spring, Your frosted petals blush now in the snow. Hail Tree of Wisdom! Whose Rebirth Adds lustre to our Family Hearth. When she reached the end, Grandmother Jia commented I dont know much about poetry, but I should judge Lans good, while I should say that Huans was poor. Come on now, everybody come and have something to eat. Bao-yu was affected by her jolly mood. But then he thought to himself Last year when the crab-trees died was the year Sky-bright died. Now the crab-trees have come back to life. Thats all very well for us but Skybright can never live again... This thought threw him into a sudden depression then he remembered what Qiao-jie had recently said, that Xifeng might be sending him pretty Fivey. Perhaps it was her imminent arrival that the strange blossoming portended? This prospect dispelled his gloom and he became his smiling self once more. Grandmother Jia stayed a while longer, then returned to her apartment, leaning on Pearland escorted by Lady Wang and the others. As she was leaving, Patience came hurrying up, her face wreathed in smiles Mrs Lian heard that you were here viewing the flowers, she said, and though she couldnt come herself, she asked me to come and attend to Your Ladyships and to bring this parcel. It contains two rolls of red silk for Master Bao to decorate the trees with, and comes with Mrs Lians congratulations on the happy event. Aroma came forward to receive the parcel and presented it to Grandmother Jia, who beamed with delight. Trust Fengie to think of the right thing! What a nice idea! So distinguished! Aroma gave Patience a smile. Please thank Mrs Lian for Master Bao when you go back, will you? she said. The happy event she is referring to is one that will make all of us happy, Im sure.. When Aroma said this, it dawned on Grandmother Jia that Xi-feng was thinking of Bao-yus marriage, and her face lit up. Aiyo! she exclaimed. Of course! It never occurred to me! Fengie may be laid up in bed, but shes still the cleverest of us all. What a perfect thing to send! As she said this, she was already walking away from Green Delights, followed by her entourage. Patience whispered to Aroma Actually Mrs Lian says this flowering is an ill-omen, and youre to cut strips of this red silk and hang them on the trees that will help turn the bad luck into good. And in future youre to avoid any superstitious chat about it. Aroma nodded and saw Patience out. Earlier that day, Bao-yu had been lounging around indoors, casually dressed in a fur-lined gown with slits at the sides. When he caught sight of the flowering crab-trees through the window, he went out to look at them. The more he gazed at the blossom the more lovely and poignant it seemed, the more strangely it seemed to reflect the mysterious vagaries of destiny, the joy and pathos of life. It was the embodiment of his own thoughts and feelings. Then, when he heard that Grandmother Jia was coming over, he hurried in to change into more formal attire, choosing a pale fox-lined robe with cut-away archers sleeves and a darker jacket, also fox-lined, to go with it. He emerged again properly dressed to receive his grandmother, and in his hurry quite forgot to put on his Magic Jade. When Grandmother Jia left he went on again to change back into his comfortable clothes, and it was then that Aroma detected the absence of the jade and asked him where it was. I was in such a rush when I came in to change, he replied. I took it off and left it on the kang-table. Then I forgot to put it on again. Aroma looked but it was not on the table. She searched everywhere but could see no sign of it. She began to feel frightened, and broke into a cold sweat. Please dont worry, Bao-yu begged her.
The eunuchs were about to report to the emperor again, and foreseeing that the other concubines would soon arrive to pay their last respects, asked the Jia relatives if they would kindly step outside and wait in one of the ante-chambers of the Palace. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang had no choice but to conform to court regulations, and wrench themselves away. Holding back their tears, they left the chamber with sorrowful hearts. They could see messages being passed within the Palace, and shortly afterwards a eunuch came out and sent for an official from the Imperial Board of Astronomy. Grandmother Jia knew Only too well what this meant. He was requesting an auspicious date for the funeral. It was all over. But still she dared not make a move. It was not long before a junior eunuch came out to make the official announcement Her Grace the Jia Concubine has passed away. It was the nineteenth of the twelfth month. Spring Commencement fell on the eighteenth of the twelfth month of that year, being the year Jia Yin the nineteenth of the month was therefore also, astrologically speaking, within the month Yin of the following Mao year. Her Grace was forty-three years old. Grandmother Jia rose, and doing her best to remain composed, left the Palace, climbed into her sedan and was carried home. Jia Zheng and company had also been informed, and they too made the sad journey home. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-yu and other members of the family were lined up on both sides of the courtyard before the main hall of Rong-guo House to greet first Grandmother Jia, then Jia Zheng and Lady Wang as they returned. Our narrative passes over the tearful family scene. Early next day, all members of the family with official rank went to the Palace to pay their last respects, and to mourn as the rites prescribed. The details of Yuan-chuns tomb were the responsibility of the Minister of Works, and Jia Zheng found himself being frequently entertained by his President, and consulted by his colleagues. It was a very busy time - not at all like the period of the previous court funerals for the Dowager Empress and the Zhou Concubine. Because Yuan-chun had died without issue, she was given the posthumous title Illustrious and Chaste Imperial Concubine. This was in conformity with state precedent. But of this no more. Everyone in the Jia family was kept extremely busy, travelling to and from the Palace daily for the duration of the funeral Luckily Xi-fengs health had improved a little of late, and she was able to get up and manage the household. She was also preparing to celebrate the return of Wang Zi-teng. Her own elder brother, Wang Ren, now that his uncle was to be a Privy Councillor and in a posi t ion of such influence, was also on his way to the capital with his family. Xi-feng was glad of this. The knowledge that she would have these extra Wangs around her also gave her renewed confidence, and had a beneficial effect on her health. Lady Wang, no w that Xi-feng was up and about again, unloaded half of her responsibilities onto her, and with the reassuring prospect of having her elder brother back in the capital soon, felt more at peace. Bao-yu was not entitled to attend any of his eldest sisters funeral ceremonies, as he held no official rank. He did no work either, and was left undisturbed in his idleness the Preceptor attributed his state to the recent family events, while Jia Zheng was far too busy to keep a check on his sons studies. Our hero might have been expected to seize this as an ideal opportunity to amuse himself in the delightful company of his sister and cousins. But from the day he lost his jade, he just sat around all the time d9ing nothing, and if he spoke, did so in an incoherent mumble. When Grandmother Jia and the others returned from the Palace, he went over to pay his respects if told to do so if not, he stayed where he was. All this time Aroma and his other maids grew more and more guilty and apprehensive. They dared not take him to task, for fear that he might have a tantrum. Each day he drank, his tea and ate his meals, when they were placed before him. But he would as soon have gone without. It eventually dawned on Aroma that this was not just a mood of his, but a genuine illness. When she had a free moment, she slipped over to the Naiads House, and had a word with Nightingale. If only your Mistress would talk to him, and try to cheer him up, she said.
He could manage on his own. I dont believe you! said Grandmother Jia. It was you at your tricks again, Ill be bound. Hark at you! A camel among sheep! Just because you re so grown-up now, and so good at your compositions... Bao-yu smiled. No, seriously, Lan managed perfectly well on his own. The Preceptor was very pleased and said he had a brilliant future ahead of him. If you dont believe me, Grannie, send for him and test him yourself. If that is the truth, said Grandmother Jia, then I am overjoyed to hear it.. But I have a feeling that you are making it all up. If he really can do such things at his age, he may well distinguish himself when he grows up. She looked at Li Wan, and thought of Lans father Jia Zhu. What a consolation that would be for your elder brothers death, she went on, addressing Bao-yu again. And what a well-earned reward for all his mothers efforts in bringing him up! In time he will be a pillar of support to the family, as his father would have been! The thought brought tears to her eyes. Li Wan was also moved, but seeing the old lady becoming somewhat emotional, she checked her own tears and said with a brave smile Whatever good fortune we may enjoy, Grannie, we owe it all to you. I only pray that Lan will live up to your expectations and bring fortune to the whole family. His progress should be a source of joy. Please dont go upsetting yourself. She turned to Bao-yu. -1152 And please dont you go giving him exaggerated ideas of his achievements, Bao. He is only a child, remember. He may take you seriously and not realize that you are only trying to encourage him and then he will become proud and conceited and never do well. Well said, my dear, commented Grandmother Jia. But remember too that he is still very young and should not be driven too hard. Children only have a certain amount of strength. Push them too soon and you can ruin them. Then they may never be able to study properly, and all your efforts will have been in vain. Li Wan could contain herself no longer and burst into floods of tears. As she was hurriedly drying her eyes, Jia Huan and Jia Lan came into the room to pay their evening respects to Grandmother Jia. Lan then greeted his mother and returned to stand respectfully at his great-grandmothers side. I have just been hearing from your uncle Bao, said Grandmother Jia, how well you did with your couplet, and what praises you won from the Preceptor. Lan smiled modestly. Faithful now came over to say that dinner was ready. I want to invite Mrs Xue, said Grandmother Jia, and Amber promptly sent a maid over to Lady Wangs apartment. Bao-yu and Jia Huan withdrew from the room, while Li Wans maid Candida and the younger maids came forward to clear away the backgammon pieces. Li Wan stayed to wait on Grandmother Jia, and Jia Lan stood at his mothers side. The two of you can stay to dinner with me, said Grandmother Jia. Yes Grandmother, replied Li Wan. A minute or two later dinner was brought in, and the maid returned from Lady Wangs apartment with the following message Her Ladyship says that Mrs Xue will not be able to come. She was only over on a short visit and went home after lunch. -640 - Grandmother Jia told Jia Lan to occupy the seat next to her. Our narrative omits any further details of that evenings meal. After dinner, when she had washed her hands and rinsed her mouth, Grandmother Jia reclined on her couch and chatted idly with her granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson. A junior maid came in and asked Amber to say that Mr Zhen who, in the temporary absence of Jia Zheng and Jia Lian, had that day been supervising business at Rong-guo House was waiting outside to pay his evening respects. Tell him that I have been informed, said Grandmother Jia, but that he need not bother to come in. He can go home and rest. He must be tired after the days work. The maid relayed this to the old women outside, Cousin Zhen was informed, an4 returned to Ning-guo House. The following day he came over again to Rong-guo House, to see to the days business. After the pages on the gate had produced a series of miscellaneous matters for his attention, it was reported by another page that the farm-bailiff had arrived with the seasonal produce. Cousin Zhen asked to see the inventory, which was presented to him by the page, and he proceeded to read through the various items, mostly fresh fruit, with some game and vegetables.
I have just seen Mrs Lians maid and she told me that her mistress is with Mrs Zhu in Sweet-rice Village. Im on my way there now. Tell me, how is Aroma these days? And how was it that Skybright died so suddenly? What was wrong with her? And Miss Ying - she moved out very suddenly, didnt she? Just look at this place, it already looks deserted! Bao-yu did his best to answer her. He also invited her to accompany him back to Green Delights and have some tea there. I cant at the moment, said Caltrop. Wait till Ive seen Mrs Lian and given her my message and Ill come and see you then. Whats this important message that you are in such a hurry to give her? said Bao-yu. It has to do with your Cousin Pan getting married. I see, said Bao-yu. Who did they finally settle on? They seemed to be wrangling about it for months. It seemed to be Miss Zhang one day, Miss Li the next, and the day after that Miss Wang. One wondered what the unfortunate girls had done to deserve being considered for such a fate. Well you can forget about them now, said Caltrop, because its all been settled. What family does the one theyve chosen belong to? said Bao-yu. A family that was related to our family by marriage once 588 before, said Caltrop. Your Cousin Pan called in on them last year during his travels. They are Imperial Purveyors like us, registered with the Ministry of Finance, and one of the wealthiest families in the capital. All your folk here seemed to have heard of them when we told them. In fact everyone in the city, from Imperial Princes to shopkeepers, has heard of the Cassia Xias. Oh, said Bao-yu. Why do they call them that? They are, as I say, very, very rich, said Caltrop, and they own a great deal of land. Several hundred acres of their land are devoted just to growing cassia alone. All the cassia sold in shops in the city is supplied by them, and all the cassia, both cut flowers and potted plants, on display in the Palace. Thats how they got the nickname. Old Mr Xia that used to be head of the business is dead now. Theres only his widow left and a young Miss Xia. No son. Its sad to think that the family may die out. Spare your sorrow, Said Bao-yu. What about this young lady? Why did Mr Xue take a fancy to her? Partly I suppose it was because they were destined for each other and partly it was a case of beauty in the eye of the beholder, said Caltrop smiling. Years ago when they were little and their two families were often visiting each other, your cousin and Miss Xia used to play together and call each others parents Auntie and Uncle. When your cousin went to call on them last year, Mrs Xia, having no son of her own and seeing him now for the first time as a grown-up man, felt more as if she was welcoming a long-lost son. She was quite overcome, laughing and crying by turns and of course she insisted that he and her daughter should see each other. Well it seems that the daughter has grown into a great beauty, and is educated, too, having been taught by a private tutor. Your cousin was quite bowled over. Mrs Xia even had the older men from the shop who were travelling with your cousin to stay with her. They must have spent three or four days in her house. Shed like to have kept them even longer and they had quite a job persuading her that they needed to be getting back. When they did get back, your cousin could speak of nothing else. Almost as soon as hed set foot in the door he was telling 589 Mrs Xue that she must get him the young lady for his wife. Mrs Xue was quite agreeable. Shed seen Miss Xia when she was a little girl, and she knew the families were well-matched. So after talking it over with Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, she sent someone to see Mrs Xia about the betr6thal and it was settled almost immediately. The only snag is, theyve fixed the date for the wedding a bit on the early side, which means a terrible rush to get ready. Still, Im longing for her to be here. Think of it another person to write poetry with! Hmn, maybe, said Bao-yu. All the same, I am a bit worried for you. What do you mean? said Caltrop. Im afraid I dont understand you. I should have thought it was obvious enough, said Bao- yu. Isnt there a fear that if somebody else appears on the scene Cousin Pan will lose interest in you?
Oh, youre a silly girl! said Bao-yu impatiently. Im sure you must have misheard. She certainly is a silly girl, the other little maid piped up. A sharp little creature, she had sensed at once what Bao-yu was hoping for and was willing to supply it. T not only heard exactly what Mrs Song said I even managed to slip out and see Skybright myself. How did you come to do that? Bao-yu asked her. 562 Remembering how much kinder than any of the other senior maids Skybright had always been to me, said the girl, I thought to myself that though I couldnt do anything else for her in her trouble, I could at least go to visit her. Even if someone saw me and reported me to Her Ladyship and I got a beating, it would be worth it after all she had done for me. So, at the risk of a beating, I stole round to her cousins place to see her. Although she was so near death, her mind was quite unaltered. She held my hand and opened her eyes wide when she saw me. Wheres Bao-yu gone? she said. When I told her, she sighed. Oh, she said, I shant be able to see him, then. Cant you hold out a bit? I asked her. She smiled at me. No, she said. You see, Im not really dying Im going to heaven to be a flower-spirit. The Jade Emperor has given me the job of looking after the flowers. She said, I have to leave at half-past two to take up the job, and Bao-yu wont be home until a quarter to three, so we shall miss seeing each other by only a quarter of an hour. Usually when people are dying, King Yama sends his demons to fetch their souls, and if you want to delay a bit, all you have to do is burn a bit of spirit money and make a little offering of some rice and tea, and they will leave you alone for a few minutes while they go after the money and stuff. But when the heavenly messengers summon you, its different. You cant keep them waiting for a single moment. At the time I didnt quite believe her, but when I got back I kept my eye on the clock and sure enough it was exactly a quarter to three, as shed said it would be, when they told us youd got back and we were to go over and wait for you. You cant read, said Bao-yu, so you wouldnt know about these things. But there are in fact flower-spirits Ive read about them. Not only is there a spirit in charge of all the flowers, but there are also lesser spirits in charge of each separate kind of flower. I wonder which Skybright is going to be. The little maid quickly glanced round the Garden for inspiration. Her eye lit on some hibiscus bushes which, this being now the second half of autumn, were already in full bloom. I asked her myself, she said. Tell me what kind of 563 flower you are going to be responsible for, I said, so that after you are gone we shall know where and when to make you offerings. Ill tell you, she said, but you mustnt let anyone else but Bao-yu know about it. These are immortal matters which are supposed to be kept secret. Then she told me the hibiscus flower. Bao-yu found nothing extraordinary in this. On the contrary, after hearing it, his sorrow turned instantly into delight. He looked round and smiled happily as his eyes rested on the hibiscus bushes. Such a flower is worthy to be looked after by such a person! he said. I felt sure that someone of her qualities would have work to do in the world. But - he became sad once more as he reflected - although her sufferings are over, it still means that I shall never see her again. Then it occurred to him that, though he had failed to be with her at the end, there was nothing to stop him going to see her now and paying his last respects to her body. After the five or six years she had been with him and all that she had done for him in that time, he surely owed it to her. He hurried back to carry out this resolve, running into Musk and Ripple on his way. They had just started out again to look for him. Back at Green Delights he hurriedly dressed up again and, telling the girls that he was going to pay a call on Dai-yu, slipped out of the Garden and made his way, on his own this time, to the place where he had visited Skybright the day hefore, expecting to find her laid out there in her coffi 1. Skybright had died not, as the lying maid had said, that afternoon, but early in the morning.
But I cant possibly let her give me some of her clothes just because Ive lost one of mine. Please take them back and thank her most kindly for me. I do appreciate the thought. She gave her a little purse, and Felicity departed with some reluctance, carrying the bundle. Minutes later she was back, this time accompanied by Patience. Xiu-yan -384 - hurried out to greet them and asked them both to be seated. Patience smiled and said Mrs Lian says you should accept them as one of the family and not be so polite. But Im not being polite, replied Xiu-yan. Honestly. Id be embarrassed to take them. Mrs Lian says, persisted Patience, that if you wont take them it must either be because theyre too old or because you dont like the idea of wearing her things. She says that if I take them back shell be cross with me. Xiu-yan blushed and smiled gratefully Well, in that case, how can I possibly refuse? Please convey my thanks to Mrs Lian. She served them both tea, after which Felicity and Patience left. They were almost home again when they met one of Aunt Xues women. She greeted them, and Patience asked her where she was going. Mrs Xue and our young lady sent me over to convey their regards to all their Ladyships and young madams and young ladies. I was at Mrs Lians just now asking for you, and she told me youd gone into the Garden. Have you just been to Miss Xings by any chance? Why, how did you know that? asked Patience. Oh, a little birdie told me... Its most generous I think, what you and your mistress are doing... Patience gave a little laugh. Wont you come in and have a chat later on? I still have things to do. Another day, replied the old woman and went on her way, while Patience went in to report to Xi-feng. When the serving-woman returned to the Xue household, which was in its usual state of upheaval, thanks to the disruptive behaviour of Xia Jin-gui, she recounted the story of Xing Xiu-yans humiliation, and both Aunt Xue and Bao-chai began to weep. Its only because Pans away, said Bao-chai, that she has to go on suffering like this. We are lucky that Feng has been looking after her. In future we must keep more of an eye on her ourselves. She is after all practically one of the family now. As she was speaking Xue Ke came in. In all the years hes spent here Pan hasnt made a single decent friend! he said. Theyre a pack of rogues the lot of them! Im sure they dont care in the slightest what happens to him. Theyre only curious to know the latest news. This last couple of days Ive told them all to go away, and Ive given the janitors instructions not to -let any of them in. Is it that actor Jiang and his friends again? asked Aunt Xue. No, as a matter of fact he hasnt been here at all. Its a different crowd. Xue Kes words intensified Aunt Xues anxiety. Though I - have -a son, she said it is as though I had none. Even if Pan wins this reprieve, his life is ruined. You are only my nephew, Ke, but you show much more sense than Pan. I can see that from now on I shall have to depend on you. Be sure to work hard and make the most of your life. And think of your bride-to-be, who comes from a family that has fallen on hard times. It is always hard when a daughter goes out into the world and gets married. One can only pray that her husband will turn out well and be capable of providing for her. Imagine if Xiu-yan were to turn out like this creature here... Gesturing in the direction of Xia Jin-guis room Aunt Xue continued But I dont want to talk about her. I know Xiu-yan to be an honest and thoughtful girl, thrifty and unspoilt. The sooner Pans business is settled the sooner we can get the two of you married and set my poor heart at rest. Dont forget that Bao-qin is still waiting to be married, Xue Ke reminded his aunt. I know how concerned you are about that. Dont-worry on our account. They stayed chatting together for a few minutes longer and then Xue Ke returned to his room. He ate his dinner and began to think about Xiu-yan in the Garden, forced by poverty t6 be so utterly dependent on the Jias. The two of them had travelled by the same boat on their original journey to the capital, and he had been able to see for himself that she was a pretty, good-natured girl.
She looked J in-gui straight in the eye Mrs Pan, you have no right to accuse me like that! When have I ever said a word against you? Just because you cant do anything to her, theres no need to take it Out on me! Youre just being a bully! You know what the real trouble is, so why pretend you dont? She burst into floods of tears and Jin-gui, who was now back in her element, clambered fuming down from the kang and went after her. Moonbeam had learned a thing or two in the Xia household and fought back every inch of the way. Jin-gui, ignoring her cries and protestations of innocence, attacked her with whatever she could lay hands on, and chairs, tables, cups and bowls were soon flying in every direction. Aunt Xue happened to be in Bao-chais room and heard the terrible racket they were making. Caltrop, she ordered without thinking, go over and see whats going on, will you? Try and get them to quieten down. You cant possibly send Caltrop, Bao-chai reminded her. That would only make things worse. Very well then, I shall go myself, declared Aunt Xue. I dont think you should, Mama, advised Bao-chai. We shall have to let them fight it out. Theres nothing we can do, Im afraid. What an intolerable state of affairs! cried Aunt Xue, and leaning on one of her maids she set off in the direction of Jin-guis apartment. Bao-chai followed reluctantly giving Caltrop strict tructions to stay behind. As they approached Jin-guis apartment, they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside. Whats the meaning of this? cried Aunt Xue. Look at the state things are in! What a disgraceful way to behave! Other people can hear what goes on, you know. Arent you ashamed of what our relatives will think? Arent you afraid of being made a laughing-stock? Me a laughing-stock - thats rich! Jin-gui yelled from inside. Its this topsy-turvy family of yours thats a laughing-stock.Theres no respect, no proper order, not a single thing right in this godforsaken dump! I was brought up differently, I can tell you! In my home people knew their place. Ive had as much from you family as I can take! Sister-in-law pleaded Bao-chai, Mother only came because she heard the two of you fighting. If she seemed to be blaming you, and didnt distinguish between you and Moonbeam, its only because she was upset. Im sure she didnt mean anything by it. Wouldnt it be better to explain whatever it is thats troubling you, and all of us try to get along peaceably together? Poor Mother, were worrying her to death. Yes, added Aunt Xue, before you start accusing me, kindly explain what the trouble is. Youre such a saint, arent you! said Jin-gui, addressing herself to Bao-chai. Im sure a fine lady like you will marry a gentleman and live in a nice home - not like me, stranded here, trampled under foot, taken advantage of by all and sundry! I might as well be a widow! What a fool I am! Dont judge me too harshly. Im only. a poor father-less creature thats never been taught any better. And Im sure youd rather I spared you the sordid details of what goes on in here between my husband and his various womenfolk! Only the thought of what her mother must be suffering enabled Bao-chai to contain her intense anger and shame at these words. Sister-in-law, she pleaded, please dont say any more. No one is judging you, no one is taking advantage of you - we never did with Lily and of course we dont with you. At this Jin-gui started whacking the side of the kang and shrieked at the top of her voice Lily! How could I ever compare with her? Im not worth the ground she treads on, am I? Shes been here longer than I have, she understands you and knows how to butter you up, and I dont, Im just a newcomer! I know! Theres no need to remind me of it! But remember we cant all be Imperial Concubines youd better watch your step and make sure you dont end up like me, married to a great half-baked booby, left in the lurch for all the world to mock at! Aunt Xue could contain herself no longer and rose to her feet I am not just defending her because she is my daughter she has tried her best to make peace with you but you seem quite determined to provoke her.

Whatever your trouble is, leave the poor girl alone! If you have to punish someone, why not strangle me instead? Please dont you get angry too, Mama, begged Baochai. We only came to try and help. If all were going to do is make things worse, I honestly think we should go. Lets give her time to think it all over. And dont you go causing any more trouble either! This last remark was addressed to Moonbeam. And so the two of them left and returned to their own apartment. As they crossed the courtyard, they saw one of Lady Jias personal maids coming out to greet them with Caltrop. Which way did you come? asked Aunt Xue, adding I hope Lady Jia is well. Very well, thank you maam, replied the maid. Her Old Ladyship asked me t9 send you her best regards, to thank you for the lychees you sent the other day, and to congratulate Miss Qin on her engagement. How long have you been here? asked Bao-chai. Quite a time, was her reply. The colour rose in Aunt Xues cheeks when she realized how much the maid must have overheard. Im afraid weve been having some dreadful scenes here recently, she said. We must be a laughing-stock over on your side. Oh maam, its nothing serious, said the maid. Every family has its little troubles. Thats as natural as plates clinking in a picnic-hamper. Youre worrying too much. She went inside with them and sat for a while before returning to Grandmother Jias. A moment or two later, Bao-chai was busy giving Caltrop s 9 me instructions when suddenly Aunt Xue cried out Ai! My chest! She lay down on the kang, sending Bao-chai and Caltrop into a great state of panic. But if you wish to know the outcome, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 84 -587 Bao-yu is given an impromptu examination, and his betrothal is discussed for the first time Jia Huan visits a convulsive child, and old hostilities are resumed Bao-chai diagnosed her mothers sudden pain as an upward movement of humour from the liver into the chest, brought on by the recent scene with Jin-gui. Without waiting for a doctor, she sent a servant out instantly to buy a few drams of Woody Vine Hooks, and made a strong brew for Aunt Xue to drink. Then Caltrop helped administer a leg-pummelling and chest-massage. The pain eased a little but Aunt Xues anger at Jin-guis outrageous behaviour, and her distress that Bao-chai should have had to submit to such humiliation, continued unabated. Eventually, after another dose of daughterly reasoning, she fell asleep, and the humour was given a chance to subside. Now please dont worry any more, Mama, pleaded Bao-chai, when she awoke. In a day or two, when you feel up to it, why not go over and see Lady Jia and Aunt Wang?
His excitement at the thought of seeing her again spurred him on. Sir, he ventured, I have a draft Apertura for your approval. Go ahead. Bao-yu intoned his opening sentence Non omnes Sapientiae Alumni sunt, neque possunt carere Stabili Patrimonjo. Jia Zheng nodded. Thank you. That will do for today. In future, please bear in mind these two Golden Rules for Composition. Before raising your brush, always be certain of the sequence of your Dispositio and the clarity of your Inventio. Tell me, was your grandmother aware that I sent for you? Yes sir. Off you go then. You had better go over and see her now. Sir! Bao-yu manoeuvred his way backwards out of the study and set off along the covered way, imitating to perfection the scholars leisurely gait. As soon as he reached the moon-gate, however, and had placed its large protective screen between himself and the study, he broke into a run and raced ahead towards Grandmother Jias apartment. Careful you dont trip! Tealeaf shouted after him. The Masters coming. Bao-yu was much too excited to pay any attention. As he neared the entrance to Grandmother Jias apartment, he could hear the sounds of conversation and laughter coming from within. He could make out, among others, the voices of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Tan-chun. When the maids saw him coming, they quickly drew aside the portiere and whispered in his ear as he passed through Mrs Xue is here, you know. Bao-yu hurried in to greet his aunt, and then paid his respects to Grandmother Jia. He gave her a full account of his interview with Jia Zheng, and her face radiated pride and delight. Wheres Cousin Chai? he asked, turning to the assembled company. She couldnt come with me today, said Aunt Xue, with a rather unconvincing smile. She and Caltrop have a lot of sewing to catch up on at home. Bao-yu was very disappointed, and only a sense of duty kept him from leaving at once. Dinner was served and Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue sat up at the table of honour, while Tan-chun and the others took their places down below. Where will Bao-yu be sitting? asked Aunt Xue. Up here with me, said Grandmother Jia with a smile. -768 Li Gui told me to have my dinner before seeing Father, Bao-yu hastily informed her. So I asked for a quick meal when I got in from school. I had a dish of something and a bowl of rice steeped in tea. You all go ahead, please. In that case, said Grandmother Jia, Feng can come and sit with us. Your mother says it 5 one of her vegetarian days today, so she can eat alone. Thats right, said Lady Wang to Xi-feng. You eat with them. Dont wait for me. I shall be having my vegetables at home. Xi-feng politely took her seat and the maids put out the wine cups and chopsticks. Then Xi-feng went round with the wine kettle, and, when everyones cup was filled, returned to her seat. -768 After they had all had a drink of wine, Grandmother Jia asked Aunt Xue Didnt I hear you say Caltrop just then? Thats funny. One of my maids was talking only the other day about someone called Lily, and I couldnt for the life of me think who she meant. When I asked her, she told me it was Caltrops new name. Do tell me what she wants to go and change her name for? The colour rose in Aunt Xues cheeks and she sighed Please dont ever mention it again. Since the day Pan married that wretched wife we havent had a moments peace. The bickering, the nastiness, its been too awful. Ive tried talking to her several times, but she is quite impervious to reason. And I cant bear quarrelling with them all the time, so I just end up trying to turn a blind eye. Yes, she decided to change Caltrops name because she said she didnt like it. Oh well, said Grandmother Jia, whats in a name when alls said and done?" I shall die for shame! cried Aunt Xue. Im sure all of you know the real reason. It wasnt the name. It was the fact that Ba6-chai had thought of it in the first place. Thats what she really objected to. What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia. Aunt Xue had been dabbing at her eyes all the while with her handkerchief.
If I understand you correctly, we shall have to conceal Bao-yus betrothal from her... Xi-feng turned at once to the various maids present Is that clear? Not a word of Master Baos betrothal to anyone! If I catch one of you talking about it I shall show no mercy. Feng dear, continued Grandmother Jia, I have noticed that since your illness you have taken less interest in what happens in the Garden. You really must give it more of your attention. Its not just the sort of thing we have been talking about. Any repetition of that disgraceful drinking and gambling that was discovered among the servants last year must be prevented at all costs. Be rather more particular, will you, and keep a watchful eye on what goes on. They need to be- disciplined, and you seem to be the one they respect most. Yes, Grannie, said Xi-feng. The ladies sat talking for a while longer, then left to go their separate ways. From now on Xi-feng began to inspect the Garden on a more regular basis. One day, in the course of one of her tours of inspection, she was walking along the bank by Amaryllis Eyot when she heard an old woman shouting outside the courtyard and went to investigate. As she drew near the old serving-woman caught sight of her, dropped her hands to her side and stood to attention, mumbling a confused Good morning, maam. Why are you making such a racket out here? asked Xi-feng. You and Mrs Zhu have given me a job to do here, maam, replied the woman, looking after the flowerbeds and fruit-trees. Id done nothing wrong, and Miss Xings maid accused us of stealing.. And why should she do that? asked Xi-feng. - Yesterday our Blackie came with me here to play, replied the woman. She didnt know any better and went inside Miss Xings apartment to have a look around. I sent her home straight away. Then early this morning I heard one of the maids say theyd lost something. When I asked what it was, she started questioning me all about it Thats no cause for you to lose your temper, retorted Xi-feng. what This Garden belongs to Mrs Zhus family not hers! protested the old woman. We work for Mrs Zhu and I wont be called a thief! Xi-feng spat straight in the old - womans face and said harshly Hold your tongue! Thats quite enough! Youre responsible for things here and if something is lost the maids are quite right to hold you accountable for it. How dare you talk such nonsense! Call Steward Lin and have her dismissed! The maids were carrying out her orders when Xing Xiu-yan came hurrying out. She greeted Xi-feng and said with an anxious smile You mustnt do that! It was nothing really. And its all over now. My dear girl, said Xi-feng, that is not the right attitude to take. Its the principle Im concerned with. The servants must learn to know their place. Xiu-yan saw that the woman was on her knees begging for mercy, and asked Xi-feng at once to go inside with her and sit down. I know her sort, said Xi-feng. They think they can get away with anything - except when Im around. When Xiu-yan continued to plead for the woman, however, and insisted on putting the blame on her own maid, she relented. Out of consideration for Miss Xing, she announced, I shall let you off this once. The old woman came forward to kotow first to Xi-feng then to Xiu-yan, and left. Once she had gone, Xiu-yan asked Xi-feng to be seated. What was it that you lost? inquired Xi-feng pleasantly. Nothing of any importance, replied Xiu-yan with a smile. Just an old red padded jacket of mine. I told them to look for it and when it didnt turn up thought no more about it. My maid was silly to question that woman. She was bound to take offence. My maid was very thoughtless and Ive already given her a good talking to. The whole affair is over and best forgotten. While she was speaking, Xi-feng had been inspecting Xiu-yans clothes and the general appearance of her apartment. Her few padded or fur-lined clothes looked rather worn and ineffective as protection against the cold. Most of her quilted bedding looked on the thin side too. She glanced at the furniture and the ornaments on her table, all of them provided by Grandmother Jia, and noticed how immaculately clean and tidy they had been kept. Xi-feng felt a warm respect towards her.
Were not that silly. Youre the one who should stop and think a minute. Try to remember where you put it, instead of laying the blame on us! Aroma could tell that Musk was in earnest and cried out in alarm Heaven save us then! Oh little ancestor, where can you have put it? You must try to remember! I do, replied Bao-yu, I remember quite clearly putting it on the kang-table. Have another look for it. The maids were too scared to tell anyone else, and joined together in a furtive search. This went on for most of the day but there was still no sign of the jade. They emptied every box, and rummaged in every trunk, until there simply was nowhere left to look and they began to wonder if perhaps one of the visitors might have picked it up earlier in the day. How would anyone dare do such a thing? said Aroma. Everyone knows how important it is, and that Master Baos very life hinges on it. Ask about it, but be very discreet. If you find out that one of the maids has taken it and is playing a trick on us, kotow to her and beg for it back. If its a junior maid whos stolen it, dont tell a soul, just do whatever is necessary to get it back. Give her whatever you like in exchange. This is very serious. It would be terrible if we lost the jade, worse even than losing Master Bao himself! Musk and Ripple set off on this mission. Aroma hurried out after them with a few final words of instruction On second thoughts, leave the people who were here at lunch-time till last. If it turns out to be someone else, we dont want to offend them and cause a lot of ill-feeling to no purpose. The two maids split up to make their inquiries, but everywhere they went it was the same story. Nobody knew anything about it. Everybody was equally taken aback by the news. They hurried back to report their lack of success, and stared at one another in despondent silence. Bao-yu himself was now beginning to look rather stunned, and Aroma was so desperate that she could only weep helplessly. What could they do? There was nowhere left to look. They were too scared to tell any of the elder members of the family. The entire establishment at Green Delights was immobilized with fear and resembled a group of wooden statues or clay dolls. One by one the others who had heard the news began to arrive, among them Tan-chun, who immediately gave orders for the Garden gate to be shut and sent an old serving-woman and two maids on another comprehensive search, announcing to everyone present. that there would be a substantial reward for the recovery of the jade. They were all keen to establish their own innocence, and this, with the added incentive of winning the reward, now led to a flurry of indiscriminate searching. Every nook and cranny of the Garden was explored, not excluding the lavatories, but to no avail. It was as hopeless as hunting for an embroidery needle, and as evening drew on there was still no trace of the missing jade. Li Wan now sensed the urgency of the situation and said I have a suggestion to make. Its not the sort of thing I would usually like to suggest but in the present circumstances I feel I must... They all gave her their attention. Things are so desperate that I think we have to try anything. Now apart from Bao-yu, all the residents of the Garden are girls. I should like you all to ask your maids to remove their dresses, so that we can search everyone properly. If that produces no results, then we should send them to search the older serving-women and cleaners. Do you all agree? The consensus of opinion was that she was right. With so many people involved, and such confusion, this seemed the only way of establishing anyone 5 innocence. Tan-chun was the only one to abstain from making any comment. The maids were eager. to clear themselves, and Patience was the first to volunteer. One by one they all undid their dresses and filed past, while Li Wan supervised the examination. Tan-chun could contain herself no longer. My dear Wan, cant you see what a futile waste of time this all is? Supposing someone has stolen it do you really think he or she would be foolish enough to carry it around? Anyway, why should anyone want to steal it? It means a lot to us, but outside this household its quite valueless. If you ask me, someones doing this out of spite. They all knew immediately whom she was referring to. Jia Huan had been in and out of Green Delights many times that day. No one was prepared to mention his name, however, and she was obliged to be more specific herself It must be Huan.
I feel so weak. I dont think Ill ever pull through. Thats no way to talk, said Tan-chun. We all fall ill, we all have our troubles. Theres no cause for you to be so pessimistic. Be sensible and have a good rest now. Yun and I had better go over to Grannies. Well come and see you again later. If theres anything you need, tell Nightingale and Ill send it over for you. Tan, when you see Grannie, you wont say Im very ill, will you? Please! Tears were streaming down Dai-yus face as she spoke. Just curtsey for me and say Im not feeling very well but its nothing serious and shes not to worry. Of course. Now dont fuss. Just rest and get better. Tan-chun and Xiang-yun went on their way. When they had gone, Nightingale settled Dai-yu down once more. She left all the fetching and carrying to Snow-goose, and herself stayed constantly at Dai-yus side, trying her best not to betray her own distress by shedding any more tears. Dai-yu closed her eyes and lay still for a while. But sleep would not come. The garden outside, which had always been such a haven of quiet and solitude, now seemed alive with sounds - the wind, insects buzzing, birds chattering, the fall of human footsteps, children crying faintly in the distance - all of which drifted in through the window and set her nerves on edge. She told Nightingale to let down the curtains around her bed. Presently Snowgoose appeared, carrying before her in both hands a bowl of Birds Nest Soup, which she gave to Nightingale, who whispered through the curtains Would you like some soup, Miss? A faint yes was heard from inside, and handing the soup back to Snowgoose for the moment, Nightingale climbed up and helped Dai-yu into a comfortable sitting position. Turning to take the bowl again, she first tasted the contents herself, then held it carefully to Dai-yus lips, while supporting her firmly round the shoulder with one arm. Dai-yu opened her eyes feebly, took a couple of sips, then showed by a shake of her head that she could not manage any more. Nightingale handed the bowl back to Snowgoose and gently settled her down again. For a few minutes all was quiet and Dai-yu seemed more peaceful. Then a whisper was heard from outside the window Is Nightingale in? Snowgoose hurried out. It was Aroma. Come in, she whispered. Hows Miss Lin? asked Aroma. They walked together towards the doorway and Aroma listened aghast as Snowgoose described what had happened that morning and the preceding night. No wonder! she exclaimed. Kingfisher said something of the sort just now and had Master Bao so worried that he sent me straight round to find out how she is. As they were talking, Nightingale lifted the portiere and beckoned to Aroma, who tiptoed into the room Is Miss Lin asleep? Nightingale nodded. Has Snowgoose told you? she added. Aroma nodded, then frowned and said This is dreadful! Master Bao had me worried to death last night too! What do you mean? asked Nightingale. Aroma explained When he went to sleep in the evening he seemed perfectly all right. But in the middle of the night he started screaming his head off , first about a pain in his heart, and then about being stabbed by a knife - he was quite delirious, and didnt quieten down till after the dawn watch. Wouldnt you have been scared? Hes not allowed to go to school today, and the doctor has been sent for to prescribe something for him. While they were talking, Dai-yu could be heard coughing again from inside the bed-curtains, and Nightingale hurried over to hold up the spittoon. Dai-yu opened her eyes feebly Whos that youre talking to? Its Aroma, Miss. Shes come to ask how you are. Aroma was already standing close by the bed. Dai-yu told Nightingale to help her up and gestured to Aroma to sit down on the bed. Aroma perched on the edge and said in her best bedside manner Are you sure you ought to be sitting up like this, Miss? Why not? replied Dai-yu. Stop behaving as if its the end of the world, will you? Who was that you mentioned just now, with a pain in the heart during the night? Oh that wasnt real! said Aroma. That was just a nightmare Master Bao had. Its very thoughtful of Aroma, thought Dai-yu to herself.
With Jia Lian out of the room, and all remaining household business soon disposed of, Zhou Ruis wife was able to come to the real purpose of her visit. Ive just come from Miss Lins, maam. I dont like the look of it at all! Theres not a spot of colour left in her cheeks, and to touch her shes nothing but skin and bones. I tried asking her what the matter was, but she wouldnt speak, just sat there crying. Before I left, Nightingale asked if you could advance them a couple of months allowance. She said that with Miss Lin so ill, and her so proud anyway about not being beholden to a soul for anything, shed made bold to ask about it herself. The medicine Miss Lin is taking goes on the general account of course, but she said they might be needing some extra money for incidental expenses. I said Id mention it to you, maam. Xi-feng lowered her head for a moment, then replied Oh very well, Ill sen4 her a few taels to be going on with. Theres no need to tell Miss Lin though. Im against advances on principle. If one person starts well never hear the end of it. Do you remember the scene Mrs Zhao and Miss Tan-chun had about this very question? Besides, as you know, with so many expenses and so little coming in to pay for them, things are extremely tight at present. After a pause, she continued Some people are under the illusion that its all caused by bad management on my part. Some even have the nerve to suggest that I am lining the Wang nest at the Jia familys expense. But you know better, my dear Mrs Zhou. Youve seen far too much of what really goes on to pay any attention to such gossip. Why I never heard such downright wicked lies in all my days, maam, said Zhou Ruis wife. Bless my soul! Where would this great rambling household be now, I should like to know, without you to keep everything running smoothly the way you do? Id like to see any other lady try to take it on. Why, a grown man with six arms and three heads would crumple under the strain of what you have to bear, for certain sure! Theres no justice left in this world! Suddenly she broke into a cackle of laughter. Mind you, Mrs Lian, the things people will say! The other day when Mr Zhou came home from town, he told me how people are all talking about us, trying to guess just how rich the family is. Take this for example "The Jias have got rooms piled high with silver and gold! Every stick of furniture in the house is inlaid with gold and studded with precious stones!" Or sometimes they gossip about Her Grace "That daughter of theirs at Court," theyll say, "you can bet your last buckle shes managed to smuggle home half the Emperors things. That time she went on that grand visitation, we saw it with our own eyes - cartloads of gold and silver she brought along with her, had the old home twinkling away like a fairy palace And when the family laid on that big do at the Temple which must have cost them a fortune, they didnt bat an eyelid! Those lions outside the main gate are solid jade, and theyve a golden kylin in the garden - used to be two, till one was stolen! Youd expect the ladies to be grand of course but in that set-up the maids are quite as genteel and ladylike as the ladies themselves! They never do a hands turn, just lounge around drinking wine, playing music or perhaps a little chess, or doing a spot of leisurely painting now and then... Theres never any shortage of others to do their work. All they need fuss about is which silk gown to slip into next. If you could see the delicacies they eat or the clothes they wear, you wouldnt believe your eyes. And the children! So pampered, if they were to ask for a moonbeam someone would be off to fetch it down for the pretty little darlings to play with!" Theres even a song about us -2507 Moneybags Ning And Rolling Rong Treat their cash Like piles of dung. -2400 It seems so fine, But please beware! If you look too... Mrs Zhou broke off in mid flow. The last two lines of her song were in fact -2400 If yoli look too close, The cupboards bare! She had been so carried away with her rendition that she only stopped in the nick of time. Xi-feng could tell that the song carried a sting in its tail. I know the sort of thing, she remarked casually. But what could have given rise to that story about the golden kylin?
Or with those other two, whom you trained and moulded in your own Image. Parfumee I can understand -1536 she is young and precocious and inclined to use her intelligence for putting other people down, so its hardly surprising that she should be disliked. Number Fours unpopularity I blame myself for. It dates from that time when you and I had quarrelled about something and I allowed her to wait on me in your place. The others must have resented my giving her special treatment, and that, ultimately, must be the reason for what has happened to her today. But why Skybright? You and she started together with my grandmother when you were little girls. Its true she is a bit better-looking than the rest of you, but she has never taken advantage of that fact no one has ever been made to feel threatened by it. Even her forthrightness - and she could be quite sharp-tongued on occasion - has never, as far as I am aware, given serious offence. I suppose it must be as you say her good looks have been her undoing. He concluded by once more bursting into tears. Mulling over what he had just said, Aroma concluded that it could only mean that he suspected her. There seemed little point in protesting. She sighed. Theres One above who knows the truth of the matter but I dont suppose we shall find out who it was for a while yet. At all events, crying isnt going to help. Much better keep your spirits up and next time Her Old Ladyship is feeling cheerful, explain what has happened and ask to have Skybright back again. You only say that to humour me, said Bao-yu bitterly. According to you I am to wait until Mothers anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable opportunity arises for talking to Grandmother but what makes you think that Skybrights illness will wait that long? Ever since she came into our family as a child she has lived comfortably. She has 540 -1536 never had to experience a single day of real hardship. Sending her to that place now is like taking a potted orchid that has just started putting out its first tender spears of growth and setting it down in a pigsty. Apart from being physically ill, she must be in a terrible state mentally as well. And she has no kind parents to look after her, dont forget only that worthless cousin and his wife. I doubt shell last there a fortnight. I may not even be able to see her again. Curfew for the common people, but the Prefect can light a fire, said Aroma drily. What a fuss youd have made if Id said anything so unlucky! How can you bear to talk so glibly about her dying? It isnt unlucky to talk about what has already been fore-told, said Bao-yu. There was a portent of her coming death last spring. Oh? said Aroma in some surprise. What was that? The crabapple tree in the courtyard here only one half of it budded this year the other side seems to have died. I knew at the time that something awful must be going to happen now I can see that it must have been a portent of her death. Aroma laughed out loud. Forgive me, but I just cant help myself. You really are an old woman! And you supposed to be so educated! How can what happens to trees and plants have anything to do with human beings? Bao-yu sighed. What do you know about it? Not only plants and trees, but all things that live and grow have feelings. And like us, they are most responsive to those who most appreciate them. There are plenty of examples from history the juniper tree in front of the temple of Confucius, the milfoil that grows beside his tomb, the cypress in front of Zhu-ge Liangs shrine, the pine-tree that grows in front of Yue Feis grave all those paragons of the vegetable world, mightily endowed with vital essence and able to withstand the ravages of the centuries, have withered and dried up in times of disorder, only to flourish once more when times were prosperous. In the course of a thousand or more years all of them have died and come 541 -1536 to life again several times over. If those are not portents, what are they? On a somewhat less exalted level there are the peonies beside Yang Gui-feis Aloeswood Pavilion, the rhododendrons of the Duan-cheng-lou and the ever green grass on Lady Brights grave. Surely you cant deny that all these are instances of sympathy between plants and humans? I see no reason to doubt that our crab-apple tree too was reacting to a human situation. By the time his idiotic discourse had ended, Aroma did not know whether to laugh or groan.
Yes maam, replied Patience, and hurried off. -320 A few minutes later, when she returned with Jia Huan, the others pretended hardly to notice his arrival. One of them made him a pot of tea and placed it on a table in the inner room. Then they all shuffled out and left the scene clear for Patience. She gave him an ingenuous smile. Master Baos jade has gone missing.. .1 dont suppose youve seen it anywhere have you? Jia Huans face instantly flushed to an ugly shade of purple . He glowered at her. Just because somebodys lost something, does that mean that I automatically become the suspect and get called in for interrogation? Have I got a criminal record or something? Patience decided to change tack, and said with a smile Of course no one would dream of suggesting you stole it! They just thought that perhaps you might have hidden it somewhere as a practical joke, and that by asking you if youd seen it I might be able to get a few clues as to where they should look for it. Its his jade, isnt it? replied Jia Huan indignantly. Hes the one that wears the thing - ask him, not me! Youre all so keen to please him, thats your trouble! If somethings found I never get to hear of it! But the moment anythings lost, its me that gets the blame! He got up and stomped out of the room. The maids stepped back to let him through. All this only served to exasperate Bao-yu. The amount of trouble that wretched thing has caused! he said. Ive no desire for it and I wish you would all forget about it. Now look what weve done. Huan will go and tell everybody and well never hear the end of it. Little ancestor, please. .. came tearfully from where Aroma stood in the throng of distraught maids. Its all very well for you to say "forget about it"! But what you seem to have forgotten is that if their Ladyships get to hear, the likes of us will be torn to shreds and ground to powder! This was followed by prolonged wailing. It soon became clear to them all that things could not be hushed up for much longer. They would have to agree on a story to tell Grandmother Jia and the other ladies. Thats easy, said Bao-yu. Just tell them I smashed it myself. No no! Thats no good! said Patience. Cant you see? Theyll want to know why you smashed it, and then things will look just as black for Aroma and the others. And besides, what if they want to see the pieces? Well then, say I lost it on a trip to town. There was a moments silence as they all pondered this suggestion. We might possibly have got away with that, said someone at last. But during the past few days you havent been to school, and you havent been out anywhere either. Yes I have, Bao-yu corrected them. A few days ago I went to the Earl of Lin-ans to watch the plays. You can say I lost it then. No, that wont do, said Tan-chun. If you lost it as long ago as that, theyll want to know why it hasnt been reported till now. They were still busy discussing the relative merits of these various fictions when suddenly they heard the voice of Aunt Zhao, cursing and wailing her way towards them. If you lose something, why cant you look for it yourselves, instead of sneaking up and blaming my boy? Well, here he is! Take him! Sacrifice him if you think it will do you any good! Kill him! Hack him to pieces! Do what you like with him! She propelled Jia Huan into the room, crying Thief! Hurry up and confess your crime! This brought loud and angry protestations from Huan. Li Wan was just bracing herself to intervene and make the peace when a maid came rushing in and announced Her Ladyship is here! Aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was now inevitable. Bao-yu and the girls went out at once to receive Lady Wang. Aunt Zhaos wrath subsided for a moment and she followed them out. From the startled look on their faces Lady Wang could see that what she had heard must be true. Is it really lost? she cried. No one dared reply. Lady Wang walked in, sat down and called Aroma forward. Aroma fell trembling to her knees. In a choked voice she murmured Yes. Well, get up! said Lady Wang. We must have a thorough search made. Come on, this helpless attitude will never do. Aroma was sobbing and could not say a word.
Ive come to warn you, said Magpie, addressing herself in an urgent whisper to Bao-yu. I heard my mistress just now jabbering to Sir Zheng about something, and though I couldnt make out what they were talking about, I heard him say Bao-yu a couple of times. I thought Id better put you on your guard in case he asks to see you tomorrow about anything. 436 She turned and hurried out again as soon as she had finished speaking. Aroma told someone to run after her and ask her to stay for a cup of tea, but she was afraid of being shut inside the Garden when they closed the gate, and insisted on going back immediately. Bao-yu knew that in Aunt Zhaos twisted imagination he was regarded as an enemy, and though he did not know what she had said, the mere fact that she had been talking about him was enough to make him feel uncomfortable all over, much as Monkey did when he heard Tripitaka reciting the spell for tightening the iron band round his head. After giving the matter some thought, he concluded that the only practical way in which he could prepare himself for the morrow would be by revising his texts. Should his father take it into his head to test him, he reasoned, then if only he could be word-perfect in his texts, it would not be so difficult to bluff his way through whatever else he might ask him. Having made the decision, he hurriedly threw a gown over his shoulders and prepared to begin some revision, bitterly regretting that Jia Zhengs silence on the subject of lessons since his last return from duty had lulled him into a false sense of security. I ought to have had more sense, he told himself. One really ought to do a little bit every day, to keep in practice. He began to reckon up how much he could still recite from memory. He found that there was little more than The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean and the two halves of the Analects that he could be absolutely sure of. The first half of Mencius he knew reasonably well, but certainly not well enough to be able to carry on from any sentence given him at random. The second half was virtually terra incognita. Of the Five Classics he was fairly familiar with the Poetry Classic because he was frequently having to read bits of it in connection with his own versifying. Though far from word-perfect, he probably knew it well enough to scrape through a test. He could not remember any of the other classics at all but fortunately his father had so far never asked him to study them, so probably it would not matter. When it came to Old Style Prose, the case was rather different. Over the past few years he had read extracts from the Zuo, Gong-yang and Gu-liang 437 commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals and various Han and Tang pieces, but he had only dipped into them as the fancy took him he had not done any serious work on them. There was certainly no question of his being able to remember them. There was even less likelihood of his being able to pass muster on the Examination Essay. He had always detested this style of writing in any case. The Sage himself didnt write that way, he argued, so how could one hope to expound the inner meaning of his teachings through such a medium? It was no more than a device used by vulgar fortune-seekers for starting themselves off on the golden road to success. Before he left, Jia Zheng had selected a hundred of these essays for him to read but Bao-yu had only glanced at them occasionally, reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there as some particularly felicitous expression or the extravagance, humour or melancholy of the writer happened to catch his attention. He had never settled down to the serious analytical examination of even a single essay. He began to revise but the trouble was that whatever he revised now, he was sure to be asked about something else next day, and the whole night would not be long enough to revise everything. It soon became apparent that all he was succeeding in doing was getting himself into an even worse state of nerves than he had been in to begin with and, while studying to no purpose himself, preventing a whole roomful of girls from sleeping as well. Aroma and the other senior maids could at least occupy themselves by trimming his lamp, pouring him cups of tea and so forth but the younger ones could neither go to bed nor find any employment to keep themselves awake, and sat about the place, drooping and nodding in various attitudes of fatigue. Skybright became indignant. Lazy little wretches! You sleep all day as it is. Just for once in your lives you are asked to stay up late, and look at you! If you dont liven yourselves up a bit, I shall come and stick pins in you all!
It began with a preface on the general philosophy of the Qin, which I found most profound, and then it explained the technical side in great detail. I realized that playing the Qin is a form of meditation and spiritual discipline handed down to us from the ancients. I had a few lessons when we lived in Yangchow, and made some progress. But since then Ive become so out of -1344 practice, and now my fingers are all "overgrown with brambles", as they say! The first Qin Handbook I found only had the names of the Airs, it didnt have the words and music. But now Ive found another with the Airs written out in full. Its so interesting! Of course, I realize that I shall never be able to do justice to the score. To think what the great Master Musicians of the past could do - like Master Kuang, whose playing could summon wind and thunder, dragon and phoenix! And to think that Confucius could tell from his Music Master Xiangs first notes that he was listening to a musical portrait of King Wen! To play a Rhapsody of Hills and Streams and share its inner meaning with a fellow music-lover... Dai-yu fluttered her eyelids and slowly bowed her head. Bao-yu was completely carried away Oh coz! How wonderful it all sounds! But Im afraid I still dont understand these peculiar characters. Please teach me how to read some of them. I dont need to teach you. Its easy. But Im such a fool! Please help me! Take that one there - all I can make 6ut is Hook, with Big on top and Five in the middle. Dai-yu laughed at him. The Big and Nine on top mean you stop the string with the thumb of your left hand at the ninth fret. The Hook and Five mean you hook the middle finger of your right hand slightly and pull the fifth string towards you. So you see, its not what we would call a character, its more a cluster of signs telling you what the next note is and how to play it. Its very easy. Then there are signs for all the graces - the narrow and the wide vibrato, the rising and the falling glissando, the mordent,, the tremulo, the falling glissando with open-string drone... Bao-yu was beside himself with joy. As you understand it so perfectly, coz, why dont we start studying the Qin together? The essence of the Qin, replied Dai-yu, is restraint. It was created in ancient times to help man purify himself and lead a gentle and sober life, to quell all wayward passions and to curb every riotous impulse. If you wish to play, then you must first -2214 seek out a quiet chamber, a studio with distant view, or upper room or some secluded nook mong rocks and trees, on craggy mountain-top, by waters edge... -1344 Let the weather be clear and calm, a gentle breeze, a moonlit night. Light some incense, and sit in silent meditation. Empty the mind of outward thoughts. Poise Breath and Blood in Perfect Harmony. Your Soul may now commune with the Divine, and enter into that mysterious Union with the Way. As the ancients said, true music-lovers have always been few. If there is no one able to share your musics true delight, then sit alone, and -1494 serenade the breeze and moonlight, hymn the ancient pines and weather-worn rocks let wild monkeys and venerable cranes hear your song, rather than the vulgar mob, whose dull ears would only sully the precious virtue of the Qin. So much for the setting. The next two essentials are finger-technique and touch. And before you think of playing, be sure to dress in a suitable style - preferably in a swansdown cape or other antique robe. Assume the dignified manner of the ancients, a manner in keeping with the chosen instrument of the sages. Wash your hands. Light the incense. Sit on the edge of your couch. Place the Qin on the table before you, and sit with your chest opposite the fifth fret. Raise both hands slowly and gracefully. You are now ready, in body and mind, to begin. You must while playing observe carefully the dynamic markings - piano, forte , allegro, adagio - and maintain a relaxed but serious manner at all times. Goodness me! cried Bao-yu. I was thinking we could do it for fun! If its as complicated as that, Im not sure Id be up to it! While they were talking Nightingale came in, and on seeing Bao-yu in the room, inquired with a smile To what are we to attribute this joyful event, Master Bao?
Its going to! The last two voices were those of Li Wens younger sister Qi, and Lady Xings niece Xiu-yan. Such an opportunity was altogether too tempting. Picking a brickbat from the ground, Bao-yu lobbed it into the water right in front of the four girls. There was a resounding splash and they jumped for their lives, with cries of What the. .. Whos that trying to give us a scare? Of all the mean. A beaming Bao-yu sprang from his hiding-place. Having a lovely time, are you? And why wasnt I invited, pray? It was Tan-chun who replied Typical! I knew it! That had "Bao-yu" written all over it! Well Im not going to waste my breath scolding you, just hurry up and catch us another fish to make up for that one. It was practically on the hook when you had to come along and scare it away. Not likely! said Bao-yu with a grin. Here you are on a fishing excursion and leaving me out - its you who owe me a penalty! Everyone laughed. I know, he went on. As were all fishing today, why dont we try a round of "Fateful Fish"? Its very simple.If you catch a fish it means a year of good luck, and if you dont a year of bad luck. Come on, whos going to have first go? Tan-chun offered the rod to Li Wen, but she declined. Oh well, said Tan-chun, it looks as if Ill have to start. She turned to Bao-yu. If you scare mine away again, brother, youll be for it. I only wanted to make you all jump. Youll be perfectly safe this time, I promise. Tan-chun cast her line, and in just a few seconds a little leaf-wriggler swallowed the hook and down went the float. She pulled in and landed her catch, alive and jumping. Scribe, after a lot of scrambling about, managed to get a grip on the thing, and carrying it over in both hands, placed it carefully in a little earthenware jar of fresh water. Tan-chun passed the rod on to Wen. She too felt a tug on the line almost immediately, and pulled in excitedly, only to find nothing on the hook. She cast out again, and this time stood there angling for ages. At last the line tautened and she pulled in again. Another false alarm. She picked up the hook to examine it, and discovered that it was buckled. No wonder I couldnt catch anything! She laughed and without more ado told Candida to straighten it out for her, put on some fresh bait and fasten on the reed-float securely. This time after only a few minutes, down went the float, in she pulled with great determination, and there it was - a little two-inch silver carp. Delighted, she turned to Bao-yu. You next. Qi and Xiu-yan must go first, replied Bao-yu. I insist. Xiu-yan was silent. You go first, Cousin Bao, protested Qi. As she spoke a big bubble popped on the water. Come On! cried Tan-chun. Theres no need to overdo it. Look, the fish are all over there by you, Qi. You have a go quickly! -384 Qi took the rod with a giggle of embarrassment. Sure enough, down went her float and she had a catch first time. Xiu-yan was the last of the girls to have her turn. She caught one and passed the rod back to Tan-chun, who handed it on to Bao-yu. I shall follow in the footsteps of old Sire Jiang, he declared. Straight was his hook, His bait a single grain Yet of their own accord The fish unto him came... -384 Walking solemnly down the jetty, he sat at the waters edge in the pose of the Fisherman Sage. Unfortunately, at the approach of this human shadow, the fish took refuge in the far end of the pond, and for all his exertions in the higher art of angling, a long time seemed to pass without the slightest sign of a bite. When once a fish did venture near and deigned to blow a few bubbles near the bank, he jerked the rod and scared it away. Oh dear! he sighed. Its no good. The trouble is that Im so confoundedly impatient, and the fish are so slow on the uptake. We must be incompatible. I shall never catch anything at this rate. Come on now, help me! Feel yourself being drawn, theres my brave little fish! There was a peal of laughter from the girls.
What was that you said? asked Jia She of the page. Its snowing, sir, and theyve sounded the first evening watch. Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed already more than an inch thick on the ground. I hope your two curios are well wrapped? said Jia Zheng. They are, replied Feng. Dont forget, if you change your minds, Im sure we can come to some agreement about the price. Ill bear it in mind, said Jia Zheng. I shall wait to hear from you then. Its cold - please dont bother to see me out. Goodbye. Jia She and Jia Zheng instructed Jia Lian to accompany Feng Zi-ying to the gate. For the sequel, please read the following chapter. CHAPTER 93 A Zhen retainer seeks shelter in the Jia household And shady activities are revealed behind the Iron Threshold When Feng Zi-ying had gone, Jia Zheng sent for one of the men on the gate. I see theres an invitation here from the Earl of Lin-an, he said. Do you know what sort of an occasion it is? I did inquire, sir, replied the servant. Its only the arrival of a new company of actors at the Prince of Nan-ans. They are said to be first-class, and his lordship wants to celebrate by putting on a dramatic entertainment for a couple of days. Just an informal party for friends, nothing requiring a presentation I should say, sir. As the servant was speaking Jia She came over. Will you be going tomorrow? he asked his brother. I really ought to, replied Jia Zheng. The Earl has always been most affable. Another servant came in from the gate and reported to Jia Zheng Theres a clerk from the Ministry, sir will you please go in to the office tomorrow. The President has some important business for you, so could you be there a little earlier than usual. This received a brief acknowledgement. from Jia Zheng. Two family servants came in next, wh6se job it was to collect the land rents from the Rong-guo country estates. They paid their respects, made their kotow and stood humbly to one side. Are you from Hao-family village? asked Jia Zheng. Yes, sir. Jia Zheng did not inquire any further into their business. He and Jia She talked a little longer and then both left for their apartments, Jia She accompanied by servants bearing lanterns. When they had gone, Jia Lian asked the rent-collectors for their report. Weve been as fast as we could with the tenth-month rents, sir, replied one of them. They were due to arrive tomorrow, but we ran into trouble a few miles from town. Our wagons were seized by a patrol and everything was tipped out onto the ground. They didnt let us get a word in. I tried to explain that it was rent-produce for Rong-guo House, not ordinary goods in transit, but they couldnt have cared less. And when I told our wagoner to keep on going, some of the highway-patrol beat him up and impounded two wagons. Ive come on ahead to report, sir. The only thing now is for you to send someone to the local yamen and demand our goods back. And youd be doing everyone a good turn, if you had those hooligans in the highway-patrol brought to order. You may not know it, but the regular goods-wagons have an even worse time with them. They tip out the contents and make off with them, and if the poor old wagoner dares to open his mouth in protest, he has his brains beaten out. What a preposterous state of affairs! exclaimed Jia Lian. He wrote a note at once and handed it to one of his men. Take this to the yamen responsible for impounding the wagons. We want our wagons and all our goods back at once. If we discover the smallest thing missing therell be trouble. He sent for Zhou Rui. Zhou was out, so he sent for Brightie instead, only to be informed that Brightie had gone out at midday and had still not returned. The lazy bastards! Theyre never here when theyre wanted! All they do from one year to the next is slack around at our expense! Shouting to his pages to find them both at once, Jia Lian retired to his apartment for the night. Next morning brought a reminder from the Earl of Linan. I shall be busy at the Ministry, said Jia Zheng to his brother. And Lian will have to stay here to sort out this trouble with the rent-wagons. You had better take Baoyu with you for the day.
Whether in your ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound classical models. The Two Incomparables we should call you, not because you are incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are incomparably hard to knock any sense into though whereas Bao-yu seems to think that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang. 506 This not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny provoked general laughter. Let me see that poem, said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost immediately began praising it. I like this poem, its got guts in it. Boys from families like ours dont need to read themselves half blind in order to get started on a career. Provided theyve read enough to show that they are better educated than the rabble and are capable of holding down a job, they can hardly fail to get on. Why waste a lot of time and energy on turning the boy into a book-worm? What I like about this poem is that it is just the sort of good amateur, not-too-brainy poem youd expect a young chap of our class to write. He sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to Jia Huan as a reward and smilingly patted him on the head. You go on writing poems like this, young fellow! Well have no trouble getting you a posting when the time comes, dont you worry! Jia Zheng protested. Whatever you think of the poem, it hardly justifies talking in this way about the boys future. Meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could continue but Grandmother Jia intervened. Why dont you two go now? Im sure your gentlemen must be waiting for you, and it would be discourteous to neglect them. Besides, it must be all often oclock and if you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy themselves unconstrainedly for a while before they go to bed. The two brothers at once got up to go, and after a parting cup offered to them on behalf of all the rest, they went off, taking Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian with them, but leaving Baoyu and the two younger boys with the womenfolk. What happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter. CHAPTER 76 Flute-playing at Convex Pavilion provokes too much melancholy And linked verses at Concave Pavilion betray a morbid sensitivity After Jia She and Jia Zheng had left, taking the two younger men with them, Grandmother Jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both tables should combine to make a single party. The serving-women cleared and wiped the table, replenished and replaced the plates of foodstuff, and set out clean winecups and chopsticks. While they were doing this, Grandmother Jia and the other members of the family were putting on more clothing, washing their hands rinsing their mouths out, and drinking tea. When all was ready they arranged themselves round the one table. As they did so, Grandmother Jia noticed, for the first time that evening, that Bao-chai and Bao-qin were not there. With Li Wan and Xi-feng also away ill, the family gathering seemed sadly depleted. She commented on this fact to Lady Wang. In past years, when Sir Zheng was away, we invited your sister to enjoy the Mid-Autumn moon with us. To be sure, we had some very happy times with her, but the recollection that one of our dear ones was missing - in my case a son, in yours a husband, in the childrens a father somewhat dampened our enjoyment. This year, now that he is back, I was looking forward to a really jolly family party but now, unfortunately, its your sister and her children who cant be with us. Well, I suppose as shes got two more members of her family with her this year we could hardly expect her to leave them behind and come over here simply to keep me amused. But what a pity that Feng should have chosen this time to be ill! She is always such a tonic as good as ten other people at a party! It only goes to show. One cant have everything. 508 She sighed. Fetch me a bigger cup, she said presently, and pour me some good hot wine. Lady Wang smiled. You have both your sons with you this year, Mother. Surely that is a gain? There may have been more females present in previous years, but surely having all your own children about you is better? Yes, yes, of course it is, said Grandmother Jia.
To her mind, the strange flowering of the crab-trees had been the first of a series of ill omens, followed by the still stranger loss of the Precious Jade, and now by her sisters death. With the family fortunes so evidently on the decline, how could she find it in herself to rally Bao-yus spirits? Besides, as brother and sister, they were obliged to maintain a certain distance. She did visit him once or twice, but he seemed indifferent to her presence and she made no further efforts. Bao-chai also knew of the missing jade. Her mother had already told her of her proposed betrothal to Bao-yu, the day she discussed it with Lady Wang and all but consented. Although it is your Aunt Wangs proposal, she had said to Bao-chai, I have still not given my final consent. I said we should have to wait until Pan comes home. What do you say to the idea? Are you willing? Mother, replied Bao-chai, in a most serious tone, you dont need to ask me. A daughters future lies in her parents hands. Since Father is dead, the decision is entirely yours. Consult Pan, if you wish, but why me? Aunt Xue was most touched by this display of modesty in her daughter, proof that her basically sound character had not been in any way spoiled by her luxurious upbringing. She would not mention Bao-yus name to her again. Bao-chai for her part maintained a strict taboo from that day forth on those two syllables. So when she came to hear of the missing jade, despite the concern she felt, she refrained from inquiring any further and contented herself with what she gleaned from those around her, while maintaining a show of complete indifference. Aunt Xue, on the other hand, sent a maid over several times to inquire after Bao-yu. She was also greatly concerned about her own son, and awaited her elder brothers arrival with impatience. His influence would surely secure Pans release. With the death of the Imperial Concubine, she could see how busy the Jias were. But as Xi-feng was well enough to take charge of the household management, she did not feel it necessary to visit them often. The one to suffer most during all this was Aroma, although she tried to remain quiet and calm, and to comfort Bao-yu and minister to his needs. He seemed to understand nothing, and she could only watch over him in secret anguish. After a few days, Yuan-chuns coffin was laid out in the Imperial Chapel of Rest, and Grandmother Jia and the other senior members of the family attended funeral services there for several days. Bao-yu was becoming daily more and more of an imbecile. He had no fever and was not in any physical pain, but he was eating little and sleeping less and becoming quite incoherent in his speech. Aroma, Musk and the other maids were at their wits end, and several times went to report to Xi-feng, who came over constantly to see how he was. At first she had thought that he was simply upset that his jade had not been found. But now, seeing the deranged state into which he was sinking, she sent for the doctor. The doctor paid daily visits, and more than one kind of medicine was prescribed, but all seemed to do more harm than good. To all inquiries as to where he felt pain, he was quite unable to reply. When Yuan-chuns funeral ceremonies were over, Grandmother Jias thoughts turned again to Bao-yu, and she came to the Garden to visit him, accompanied by Lady Wang. Aroma told Bao-yu to go out and greet her properly. Bao-yu was still able to get about, and managed to greet his grandmother presentably, with Aroma at his side prompting him at every turn. My dear boy! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. I am so relieved! I was led to believe that you were seriously ill. But now I see that you are quite your normal self. Lady Wang too seemed pleasantly surprised. Bao-yu said nothing and gave an inane grin. They went in and sat down. When Grandmother Jia asked him a question, he could only repeat whatever Aroma said. It soon became clear to them all that so far from being his normal self, he was now little more than a halfwit. The more Grandmother Jia saw, the more it puzzled and distressed her. When I came in, she said, he seemed quite well. But I can see now that he really is seriously ill. He seems to have quite lost his wits. Will someone please tell me what has happened? Lady Wang realized that they could not keep it from her any longer.
And the top element of the word taken as a whole was very like dang 6 meaning "to pawn", so we should go straight to the pawnshop. Then he pointed out that by adding a ren 7 "man" to the left-hand side, the compound chang 8 meaning "to redeem" was formed. Find the man in the pawnshop, pay the price, and the lost object will be redeemed... What are we waiting for? cried the girls. Search the neighbourhood! If we work our way through the pawn-shops, were sure to find the right one sooner or later. And once weve found the jade, it will be easy enough to find the thief. Find the jade and we neednt even bother who the thief is, said Li Wan. Turning to Steward Lins wife she continued Go and tell Mrs Lian what you have just told us. Then she can tell Her Ladyship and set her mind at rest. And ask Mrs Lian to send someone out to search the pawnshops. Lins wife set off at once. Things seemed more hopeful now, and relative calm was restored. They were waiting in a somewhat bemused state for Xiu-yan to return when they saw Tealeaf beckoning from the gateway one of the junior maids. She ran out and he said Quick! Go in and tell Master Bao and their Ladyships and the ladies and young misses that Ive got the most wonderful piece of news! Well come on! burst 6 ut the maid. What is it? Out with it! Tealeaf started laughing and clapping his hands. All right, Ill tell you. And then you can go in and tell them, and we can split the reward between us. Guess what? The most reliable information has reached me as to the whereabouts of the Missing Jade! The outcome of all this excitement will be related in the next chapter. CHAPTER 95 A rumour comes true and the Imperial Consort passes away A counterfeit is deceptively like the real thing, and Bao-yu loses his wits There was Tealeaf at the entrance to Green Delights, proclaiming his discovery of the missing jade. A junior maid hurried in to tell Bao-yu. The others, when they heard, propelled Bao-yu towards the entrance to question Tealeaf, while they stood listening in the covered gallery. Bao-yu, greatly relieved at the news, walked out and asked Tealeaf Where did you find it? Come on, give it to me. Tealeaf replied Im afraid I couldnt bring it with me. I need a guarantor. But how did you find it? Tell me, and Ill send someone to fetch it. I heard that Steward Lin was going to consult the word-diviner, said Tealeaf, so I went along with him. When I heard the word pawnshop, I didnt wait to hear the rest, but went racing round the pawnshops. I described the jade to them, and eventually one of them said, Weve got it. I asked him to hand it over, but he insisted on having the pawn-ticket. When I asked him how much it had been pawned for, he said he had one for three hundred taels and another for five hundred. The one for three hundred was brought in the day before yesterday, the one for five hundred came in today. Quick, interrupted Bao-yu. Take three hundred taels and five hundred. Get them both, and we can see which is the right one. But Aroma called out jeeringly from within Youre not going to take any notice of him, are you? I remember my elder brother telling me when I was a little girl, that the people who deal in that kind of jade pawn one or two from their stock when they are short of cash. Every pawnshop must have at least one of them. At first everyone had been carried away by Tealeafs story. But now, after reflecting on what Aroma had just said, they all began to laugh. Come inside, Master Bao. Dont listen to that fool. Whatever it is hes talking about, it obviously isnt the real thing. Bao-yu laughed too. At that moment, Xiu-yan returned fr6m her mission. On her arrival at Green Bower Hermitage, she had come straight to the point. Would Adamantina consult the planchette for them? Her request met with a scornful laugh. I thought you were above such worldly things, Xiu-yan. I am sure we should never have been such friends if I had known you would ever let idle talk induce you to come bothering me. Anyway, Im afraid this planchette you mention is something I am not familiar with. With this, she clearly intended to dismiss the subject, and Xiu-yan regretted ever having come.
said Bao-chai. Theres nothing unusual about my going. You are not being asked to connive at a gaol-break. And incidentally, I dont see why it should be necessary to send anyone to my apartment. Why not simply invite Cousin Shi to stay with you for a few days? Wouldnt that be simpler? While we are on the subject, where is Cousin Shi? said You-shi. I sent her off just now to look for Cousin Tan, said Baochai. She was to bring Cousin Tan here so that I could explain to her about going to Mothers too. By coincidence Miss Shi and Miss Tan were at that very moment announced. As soon as they were seated, Bao-chai told Tan-chun about her intention of moving outside for a few days to look after her mother. 486 Very wise, said Tan-chun. But why only stay outside until Aunt is better? Why not move outside altogether? Thats rather a strange way to talk, said You-shi, laughing. Its as though you wanted to drive our kinswoman out. Well, why not? said Tan-chun bitterly. Better be driven out now by me than by someone else later on. Kinsfolk are lucky. They dont have to stay here. Not like the members of this happy family - all glaring at each other like angry fighting-cocks, wondering which will be the first one to strike! You-shi laughed. I think today must be my unlucky day. I seem to have caught all you young ladies in a thoroughly unpleasant mood. If you dont like the heat, you should stay away from the fire, said Tan-chun. Whos been upsetting you then? She thought for a bit. Its not likely to have been Cousin Feng. Not this time. So who was it? You-shis vague answer evaded the question. Tan-chun knew that she was afraid to speak openly for fear of causing trouble. Come on! she said tauntingly. Dont act the innocent! Its not high treason to tell us. No ones going to chop your head off. Look at me. Last night I slapped Wang Shan-baos wifes face. Thats an offence deserving hard labour at the very least, yet nothings happened so far, bar a bit of muttering. I dont think anyone is going to give me a beating. Did you really slap her face? Bao-chai asked incredulously. Tan-chun treated them all to a lively account of what had happened, after which You-shi, seeing that there was no longer any point in concealment, proceeded to tell them about her recent encounter with Xi-chun. Oh, shes always like that, said Tan-chun. Its her nature. Xi-chun is so peculiar, nothing the rest of us say or do is ever going to alter her. By the way - she returned to the subject that was uppermost in her mind - I made some inquiries first thing this morning to find out why nothing was happening. Apparently its because Cousin Feng is ill again. I also sent someone to inquire about Wang Shan-baos wife. It seems that she has been given a beating. For interfering. 487 Quite right, too! said You-shi and Li Wan. But Tan-chun took a more cynical view. It would be a comparatively easy way of disarming suspicion. We must wait and see. You-shi and Li Wan looked thoughtful, but neither made any comment. Shortly after this the maids came in to say that dinner was ready. Xiang-yun and Bao-chai went back to their apartment to pack, in preparation. for their respective moves. Our narrative leaves them at this point. You-shi and Tan-chun, after taking their leave of Li Wan, made their way to Grandmother Jias apartment. The old lady was reclining on her couch listening, while Lady Wang told her about the Zhens the offences they had been charged with, the confiscation of their property and their coming up to the capital now for questioning. Grandmother Jia was obviously much shaken by what she heard, but brightened up somewhat when You-shi and Tan-chun arrived. Where have you both come from? she asked them. I suppose you know that Feng and Wan are both ill now? I wonder how they are today. They are both a little better, said You-shi. Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed. I think weve heard enough about other peoples troubles for the time being. Its time we started thinking about the arrangements for our Mid-Autumn party. The catering arrangements have all been made, said Lady Wang. It only remains for you to decide where you want it. I suppose the nights are getting too chilly now for us to have it out in the Garden.
If he wouldnt tell you, Mrs Pan, no one else is likely to know. Spare me the "Mrs", will you! said Jin-gui with a malicious smile. You and that Lily think you run the place, dont you? I cant get near that little Miss Unmolestable, with all her friends in high places to take care of her - all right! I wont stick my neck out in that direction! But youre still my maid, I dont have to take cheek from you! If youre so sure of yourself, why not get on with it and strangle me? Then you and Lily can have the field to yourselves. Im just in your way - go on, say it! Moonbeam wasnt taking this lying down. She looked J in-gui straight in the eye Mrs Pan, you have no right to accuse me like that! When have I ever said a word against you? Just because you cant do anything to her, theres no need to take it Out on me! Youre just being a bully! You know what the real trouble is, so why pretend you dont? She burst into floods of tears and Jin-gui, who was now back in her element, clambered fuming down from the kang and went after her. Moonbeam had learned a thing or two in the Xia household and fought back every inch of the way. Jin-gui, ignoring her cries and protestations of innocence, attacked her with whatever she could lay hands on, and chairs, tables, cups and bowls were soon flying in every direction. Aunt Xue happened to be in Bao-chais room and heard the terrible racket they were making. Caltrop, she ordered without thinking, go over and see whats going on, will you? Try and get them to quieten down. You cant possibly send Caltrop, Bao-chai reminded her. That would only make things worse. Very well then, I shall go myself, declared Aunt Xue. I dont think you should, Mama, advised Bao-chai. We shall have to let them fight it out. Theres nothing we can do, Im afraid. What an intolerable state of affairs! cried Aunt Xue, and leaning on one of her maids she set off in the direction of Jin-guis apartment. Bao-chai followed reluctantly giving Caltrop strict tructions to stay behind. As they approached Jin-guis apartment, they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside. Whats the meaning of this? cried Aunt Xue. Look at the state things are in! What a disgraceful way to behave! Other people can hear what goes on, you know. Arent you ashamed of what our relatives will think? Arent you afraid of being made a laughing-stock? Me a laughing-stock - thats rich! Jin-gui yelled from inside. Its this topsy-turvy family of yours thats a laughing-stock.Theres no respect, no proper order, not a single thing right in this godforsaken dump! I was brought up differently, I can tell you! In my home people knew their place. Ive had as much from you family as I can take! Sister-in-law pleaded Bao-chai, Mother only came because she heard the two of you fighting. If she seemed to be blaming you, and didnt distinguish between you and Moonbeam, its only because she was upset. Im sure she didnt mean anything by it. Wouldnt it be better to explain whatever it is thats troubling you, and all of us try to get along peaceably together? Poor Mother, were worrying her to death. Yes, added Aunt Xue, before you start accusing me, kindly explain what the trouble is. Youre such a saint, arent you! said Jin-gui, addressing herself to Bao-chai. Im sure a fine lady like you will marry a gentleman and live in a nice home - not like me, stranded here, trampled under foot, taken advantage of by all and sundry! I might as well be a widow! What a fool I am! Dont judge me too harshly. Im only. a poor father-less creature thats never been taught any better. And Im sure youd rather I spared you the sordid details of what goes on in here between my husband and his various womenfolk! Only the thought of what her mother must be suffering enabled Bao-chai to contain her intense anger and shame at these words. Sister-in-law, she pleaded, please dont say any more. No one is judging you, no one is taking advantage of you - we never did with Lily and of course we dont with you. At this Jin-gui started whacking the side of the kang and shrieked at the top of her voice Lily! How could I ever compare with her?
Caltrop had persuaded herself that when there was another woman in the house - someone who would take a share of the responsibilities and whose authority she herself could fall back on - life would be somehow easier for her than it was at present. The young lady Xue Pan was marrying was said to be not only beautiful but educated it followed, in Caltrops reasoning, that she must be gentle and ladylike as well. Caltrop awaited her arrival even more impatiently than Xue Pan, and resolved to serve her, when she came, with all the devotion and care of which she was capable. The young lady of whom Caltrop entertained such high expectations was still only seventeen. It is true that she was not at all bad-looking she could even read quite a number of words and if subtle deviousness of character had been an examinable qualification, she might have come out a good second to Xi-feng. Her chief drawback sprang from the fact that she had lost her father at a very early age and as her widowed mother had no other child of her own and doted on her excessively, she had been thoroughly spoiled. By treating her every whim as law and gainsaying her nothing, her mother had turned her into a monster. In her own estimation Miss Xia was a bodhisattva all other creatures were as dust beneath her feet. The exterior she presented to the world made one think of the flowers in spring underneath it there were lightnings and tornadoes. At home, in the bosom of the family, her maids learned to gauge the severity of her tantrums if she was only slightly vexed, she would curse them if she was 592 gravely displeased, they would be beaten. As for her views on matrimony Miss Xia - or Xia Jin-gui to give her her full name - considered that if she wanted to be mistress in her own house, it behoved her to put her maidenly modesty and the gentleness that was habitual with her aside and show a little authority. It would be necessary to keep the others in their place. Xue Pan in particular, because of his wilfulness and intransigence, must be broken in as quickly as possible, or she would never be able to establish her dominion and plant her flag in this new territory. The discovery that there was a beautiful and intelligent young concubine in this household she was entering aroused feelings in her akin to those expressed by the founder of the Song dynasty when he likened the world to a bedroom and declared that none but he should snore in it. Because of her name Jin-gui, which means cassia and the abundance of cassia-trees cultivated by her family, Xia Jin-gui had always insisted on strict avoidance of the syllables jin and gui and the word cassia by her maids and any other inferiors who had to do with her. Of course, cassiaflowers had from time to time to be referred to somehow or other, so, bearing in mind the myth about the cassia-tree that grows beside the palace of Chang E in the moon, she decreed that cassia should always be referred to in her presence as Chang Es flower. The notion that in doing this she was in some way conferring on herself the status of a moon-goddess was perhaps not entirely absent from her mind. At all events, the luckless maid who carelessly let out a jin or a gui in her presence or who was incautious enough to utter the dread word cassia was in for a savage beating and would probably lose her pay for a month or two as well. Now Xue Pan was one of those fickle natures always ready to be off with the old love and on with the new and in spite of all his bluster, he was only pot-valiant, having little stamina, or stomach either, for a long-drawn-out trial of strength. While the novelty of his marriage still lasted, he was, in any case, only too willing to defer in everything to his beautiful young bride. Jin-gui quickly grasped what sort of person she had to deal with and exploited her advantage to 593 -347 the utmost. During the first month of their marriage things stood about equally between them, but by the end of the second month Jin-guis star was definitely in the ascendant. One day, after drinking rather more than was good for him, Xue Pan went to see Jin-gui about something he wanted them both to do. On meeting with determined opposition to his proposal, he finally lost patience with her and, after some angry shouting, walked out on her in a temper. Jin-gui wept abandonedly, refused to eat or drink, and eventually succeeded in persuading everyone that she was ill. A doctor was summoned who pronounced her to be suffering from a collision of blood and air and prescribed a lenitive medicine to ease the clogged passages of the breath.
The instant he entered the door, he let out a great wail and burst into tears. Dai-yu, who had only just that minute finished washing and putting up her hair, was shocked to see the state he was in and asked in some alarm Whatevers the matter? Whos upset you? Bao-yu, however, was already slumped over the table, sobbing his heart out and far too distraught to reply to her questions. From her chair Dai-yu studied him anxiously for a while, before asking again Well, at least let me know if Im the culprit or not... Thats not it! Its nothing like that! he replied at last, with a despairing motion of his hand. Then why the tears and everything? I just think the sooner we all die the better! Theres no joy left in life! What do you mean? Have you gone quite mad? Im not in the slightest mad. Let me explain and Im sure youll feel as I do. When Ying was here, you saw how she looked, you heard everything she said, didnt you? Why is it that the minute theyre grown up, girls are married off and have to suffer so? When I think of the happy times we all had together when we first started the Crab-flower Club, always inviting each other round for parties and holding poetry contests - there seemed no end of wonderful things to do. And now? Bao-chai has already moved out, which means Caltrop cant come over either, and with Ying gone as well, our band of kindred spirits is being broken up, everything is being spoiled! I had thought of a plan, to get Grannie on our side and rescue Ying. But when I told Mother, she just called me naive and silly and wouldnt take me seriously. So I had to give up the idea. You only have to look around you! Our Gardens altered so much in such a short time. What could become of it in the next few years just doesnt bear thinking about. Now do you see what I mean, and why I cant help despairing? As she listened to all that he was saying, Dai-yu very slowly bowed her head and moved back almost imperceptibly onto the kang. She did not say a word, but only sighed and curled up facing the wall. This was how Nightingale found them when she came in to serve tea. Her attempts to puzzle out what could have happened were cut short by the arrival of Aroma. So this is where you are! she said as she came into the room. Youre wanted at Her Old Ladyships, Master Bao. I thought Id find you here... Recognizing Aromas voice, Dai-yu sat up a little and nodded to her to sit down. Bao-yu noticed that her eyes were red from crying. I got a bit carried away, coz, he said. Please dont take it to heart so. What you must do is look after yourself properly and get fit and well. And when I say that, I mean it. So have a rest now. Im wanted at Grannies. Ill be back. With these words he set off. Whats up with you two then? whispered Aroma. Oh, hes upset about Miss Ying, Dai-yu replied. Im all right. My eyes have been itching and Ive been rubbing them, thats all. Aroma said nothing and hurried out after Bao-yu. He reached Grandmother Jias only to find that she had already retired for her midday nap, and was obliged to go back to Green Delights. In the afternoon he woke from his sleep feeling very bored, and picked up a book to read. Aroma hurried off to make tea, eager to sustain him in his studies. He had chanced upon an anthology of early verse, and as he turned its pages found himself reading a stanza by Cao -1307 Cao Come drink with me and sing, For lifes a fleeting thing. Full many a day has fled Like the morning dew... -1307 Far from distracting him, this only served to increase his ennui, and he put the book down and picked up another. This time it was The Gathering at Orchid Pavilion and other Prose Selections from the Jin Dynasty. After a page or two he suddenly closed it, and when Aroma returned with his tea, she found him sitting there, head propped on hand, looking his most dazed and distant. Why have you given up so soon? she asked. Bao-yu took his tea without a word of reply, drank a sip, then mechanically replaced the cup. Aroma was out of her depth and could do nothing but stand there dumbly looking on. Suddenly he stood up, and muttered sarcastically -2240 Oh gemlike ecstasy... -1307 Aroma half-wanted to laugh, but on reflection thought it safer not to probe too far.
Bao-yu recited his first line -384 Prince Heng was fond of a pretty face and of martial arts also- Jia Zheng copied the words down and then shook his head over what he had written. Vulgar and pedestrian! No, no, it isnt vulgar, said one of the literary gentlemen. That is what the Ballad Style is like. Wait and see how it goes on. -320 All right, well let it pass, said Jia Zheng. Bao-yu continued. -1094 So he trained the ladies of his court to ride and draw the bow. In ravishing songs and beguiling dances the Prince took no delight, But to watch the pike-drill he was fain of fair maids in a row. -5947 He waited while Jia Zheng finished writing down the lines. The literary gentlemen professed themselves particularly impressed by the ravishing songs line, claiming to see a quality of rugged strength in it which they deemed highly appropriate in a ballad. The fourth line, which they called pure narrative, was also, they thought, exactly as it should be. You shouldnt praise the boy so, said Jia Zheng. You will turn his head. Lets see how he manages to develop this in his second stanza. Bao-yu recited -1094 As he watched them drill, he scarcely saw the clouds of dust arise Twas the lovely Colonels lamplit face that swam before his eyes. Bravo! shouted the literary gentlemen. He scarcely saw the clouds of dust leads us on to the lamplit face of the heroine. A most ingenious development! The way every word is used in these two lines is quite masterful! Bao-yu continued -384 When the rosy lips framed their harsh commands he could smell the mouths sweet breath But the weapons oft shook in the fair white hands, too weak for such exercise. The literary gentlemen laughed and clapped their hands. What a wonderful picture! I think friend Bao must have been among those present at the time. He saw the white hand shake and smelt the perfume. How else could he describe it all so vividly? Bao-yu laughed. Women drilling, however bold and fierce they might be, could never look quite the same as men. One can assume the occasional softness creeping in without having had any special experience. Oh, get on! said Jia Zheng. We can do without the comment. Bao-yu thought a little before beginning the next stanza. -384 The lotus belt round the Colonels waist in a clove-shaped knot was tied The change of rhyme from eyes to eyed is one example of that smooth, flowing development we were just now talking about, said the literary gentlemen. Also, this line has just that touch of charm and prettiness that the subject calls for. I dont agree, said Jia Zheng. I dont like this line at all. We have already heard about her mouths sweet breath and her fair white hand in the last stanza. Why does he need to go on in this strain? I think it is mere weakness of invention that leads to this piling up of descriptive bric-a-brac. A long ballad needs a few ornamental, descriptive passages, said Bao-yu, otherwise it would seem too bare. You are continuing the same kind of description into a new stanza, said Jia Zheng. When are you going to get on to her warlike side? If you have another two or three lines of this kind of stuff, its going to seem like drawing legs on a snake! All right, said Bao-yu. Ill try to make a quick change to the warlike side and then finish the whole description off in this one stanza. 572 What a genius! said Jia Zheng sarcastically. You begin with a line that looks like the first item in a long catalogue, and now you are talking about instant changes and abrupt conclusions. I think you may find that you have bitten off rather more than you can chew! Bao-yu hung his head and pondered a while before finally coming out with this line Yet it was not strung pearls that hung from it but the good sword at her side. -5947 Will that do? he asked anxiously. The literary gentlemen banged on the table and cheered. Well leave it, said Jia Zheng. Carry on. If it will do, Ill continue as Ive planned, said Bao-yu. If not, it would be better to cross it out and Ill try to think of something completely different and develop in another direction. Jia Zheng shouted at him angrily. -5947 Hold your tongue, sir! Do it again if its not good enough, indeed! How many times do you propose to go on trying? Ten times? A hundred? Save your energy and get on!
Very well, tell us your one joke then, said Grandmother Jia. It is about a hen-pecked husband, said Jia Zheng. He got no further. Already his audience were convulsed. It was not that what he had said was the least bit funny, simply that they had never heard him talking about such things before. This is sure to be good, said Grandmother Jia. In that case, said Jia Zheng, laughing himself, let me persuade you to drink a cup of wine. Very well, said Grandmother Jia. At once Jia She and Jia Zheng rose to their feet. Jia She held a winecup in both his hands while Jia Zheng poured wine into it from a wine-kettle. Then Jia Zheng took the cup from Jia She and ceremoniously set it down in front of Grandmother Jia. The two men stood in stiffly deferential attitudes beside her while she drank some, then, having completed their little pantomime, resumed their places. Jia Zheng proceeded with his story. This hen-pecked husband was so afraid of his wife that he never dared stay long away from the house. But one Mid-Autumn Festival he chanced to be out shopping in the street when a friend caught sight of him and insisted on dragging him off to his house for a drink. Without meaning to, the husband became very drunk - so much so that he had to stay at his friends house for the night. When he woke up the next morning, he was full of remorse. However, there was nothing for it but to hurry back home and apologize. When he got back, his wife was washing her feet. Very well, she said when he had finished apologizing, if you will lick my feet clean, I will forgive you. 503 The man began to lick, but a feeling of nausea overcame him and. he showed signs of wanting to be sick. When his wife saw this, she was furious. How dare you? she screamed, and looked as if she was about to give him a beating. The husband knelt down in terror and begged to be forgiven. Please, my dear! It isnt that I find your feet in the least distasteful. Its just that I drank rather a lot of yellow wine last night and ate lots of very rich mooncakes, so today I am feeling a little queasy . Grandmother Jia and the rest all laughed and Jia Zheng poured Grandmother Jia another cup of wine. Someone had better change this yellow wine for samshoo, she said. We dont want you husbands having this sort of trouble with your wives tomorrow! This produced another laugh. The drumming recommenced and the branch, starting from Jia Theng, began circulating again. This time it stopped with Bao-yu. Bao-yu had been feeling uncomfortable to start with because of Jia Zhengs presence, but became ten times more so when he found himself stuck with the branch. If I tell a joke and its no good, he thought, he will say Ive no invention. But if I tell a good one, hell say I have no aptitude for serious things, only frivolous ones, and that will be even worse. Id much better not tell one at all. Having reached this decision, he stood up and asked his father to excuse him. Im sorry, he said, I cant tell jokes. May I do something else, please? You may compose a poem on the theme of Mid-Autumn Moon, said Jia Zheng. If it is good, I shall reward you if it is not - I shall deal with you tomorrow. This is a game we are playing, said Grandmother Jia testily. Do you have to make the boy write poetry? He can do it if he wants to, said Jia Zheng. He was smiling. Very well, let him do it then, said Grandmother Jia. Fetch him a brush and. paper somebody. 504 No padding, now! Jia Zheng told Bao-yu. No crystal, ice, jade, silver, light, bright, white - anything of that sort. I want something original that will give me some idea of what you have been doing with your mind during this past year or two. Bao-yu found these injunctions by no means uncongenial, and having succeeded, in quite a short time, in thinking of a quatrain, he wrote it out and handed it to his father. Jia Zheng said nothing, but was observed to nod after he had finished reading it which Grandmother Jia interpreted to mean that he could not have found the poem too bad. Well? she asked him. Jia Zheng wanted to make her happy. Not at all bad, he said. Its a pity he wont study, but his verses are really quite elegant.
Sometimes when shes in the mood, she gets herself up like a regular harlot - she obviously fancies herself as some sort of man-killer! Another possibility is that shes fallen out with Bao-qin and this is a plot to disgrace me and drag the family name in the mud... Xue Ke could not help finding all this rather daunting, and was racking his brains for some means of dealing with the situation, when to his great alarm he heard a splutter of laughter outside the window. But to discover who was laughing, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 91 In the pursuance of lust, Moonbeam evolves an artful strata gem In a flight of Zen, Bao-yu makes an enigmatic confession We saw in our last chapter how Xue Ke was startled from his troubled reflections by a sudden splutter of laughter from outside his window. Moonbeam again! Or Jin-gui! he thought to himself. I shall ignore them and see what happens. He listened for a while but there was no further sound. Not daring to touch the wine and sweetmeats, he closed the door and was about to undress when he heard a faint tap at the paper casement. He was already rattled by Moonbeams behaviour and beginning to feel out of his depth. Hearing the tapping and yet unable to detect a presence outside the window, he didnt know what to think. He did up his gown again and sat down abstractedly by the lamp. He took a sweetmeat from the table and turned it over restlessly in his hand, studying it from every angle. Suddenly something made him look round. A small peephole of the lick-and-spittle variety had appeared in the window. Going across and putting his eye to the hole, he squinted through and received a blast of air in the face that quite startled the wits out of him. It was followed by another splutter of laughter. Rushing back, he blew out the. lamp and lay down in the darkness, holding his breath. A voice came from outside Are you going to sleep without trying the wine and sweetmeats? Xue Ke recognized it as Moonbeams voice but said nothing and lay there pretending to be asleep. A few seconds later, in a disgruntled tone Miserable spoilsport! You dont know what youre missing! This time he could not identify the voice with any certainty. It sounded like Moonbeam, but there was something of Xia Jin-guis expression in it too. Whoever it was, there was no longer any doubt in his mind as to their intentions. He tossed and turned for most of that night, and it was not until after five oclock that he finally fell asleep. Shortly after dawn someone knocked at the door. Whos there? Xue Ke called out. No answer. He got out of bed to open the door and saw Moonbeam, her hair combed simply back, wearing a tight little sleeveless jacket, its gold-striped neck-line cut in the shape of a guitar, its buttons seductively undone. She had a new-looking viridian scarf around her neck and instead of a skirt was sporting pomegranate-red linedpantaloons of a flowery design, and a pair of smart red embroided slippers. She had come before doing her morning toilet, to remove the sweetmeats before the rest of the household arose. Though rather taken aback to see her advancing into his room en nglig, he asked politely Why are you up so early this morning? Moonbeam blushed in reply, piled the sweetmeats onto one plate and went out holding it in both hands. Xue Ke interpreted this as pique at her failure o seduce him the previous evening. Oh well, he thought to himself, its too bad if Ive annoyed them. At least theyll lose interest and leave me alone. He decided that he could forget about the whole business, and called for water to wash his face. It would be wise, he decided, to stay at home and take a couple pf days rest, for his own health and peace of mind, and also to avoid tile unwelcome attentions of Xue Pans so-called friends, who seeing the Xue family deprived of its head and observing his own youth and inexperience, had caught the scent of money in the air. Some of them would have been content to act as messengers some professed a knowledge of legal phraseology or claimed contacts behind the scenes and offered to deliver bribes to the officials and minions involved in the case others advised him to make some money out of it for himself, while a few even tried scaring him with false rumours. Since he first encountered them, Xue Ke had done his utmost to avoid these unsavoury elements, but was aware that by openly rebuffing them he might create further trouble for himself.
This left only the cousins wife to answer the caller - or rather callers, for when she went outside to look, it turned Out to be Cook Liu and Fivey with a bundle containing Skybrights things. Cook Liu was also holding several strings of cash. Weve brought these from Miss Aroma for your young lady, she said. Which room is she in? The young woman laughed. This room here. Where else would we keep her? As Cook Liu and Fivey went into the outer room, a lurking figure dodged into the inner room at the back. Cook Liu knew something of the young wifes reputation and assumed that it must be one of her lovers. Since Skybright appeared to be asleep, she put the things down beside her and hurried out again. But Fivey had sharper eyes than her mother and had recognized the lurking figure as Bao-yu. Didnt Miss Aroma say when we were leaving that shed been looking for Master Bao? she asked her mother. Goodness, I nearly forgot! said Cook Liu. Mrs Song told me just now that she thought shed seen him go out of the side gate. And there was someone waiting for him outside the gate too, wasnt there? Theyll be wanting to close presently. She turned back and asked the young woman if she had seen him. No, said the cousins wife, beginning to feel nervous. What would Master Bao be doing at our house? Hearing her say this, Cook Liu began to go again but Bao-yu, partly because he was afraid of being shut out of the Garden and partly because he feared that the cousins wife might return to the attack if he remained after the visitors had gone, threw discretion to the winds and, lifting up the door-curtain, came rushing out after them. 548 Mrs Liu! Wait for me! Well go back together! Cook Liu was mightily astonished. My dear young master! Whatever has brought you to this place? Bao-yu sped on ahead without replying. Call him back, Ma! said Fivey. Tell him not to be in so much of a hurry. Hell run into someone if hes not careful and theyll find out what hes been up to. Theres no need for him to hurry in any case. That person we saw waiting for him will see to it that the gates kept open for him. She and her mother ran after Bao-yu to try and catch up with him. The cousins wife stared after them disconsolately -374 her beautiful young gentleman had got away. Bao-yu did not stop running until he was inside the Garden gate. Only then did he feel safe again, though his heart was still beating wildly. Fortunately no one appeared to have noticed his absence, and when he got back to Green Delights he managed to put Aroma off by saying that he had been visiting Aunt Xue. Shortly after this, as she was making up his bed, Aroma asked him how they should sleep. Oh, anyhow, said Bao-yu. I dont mind. It should be explained that during the year or two that had elapsed since her unofficial promotion by Lady Wang, Aroma had been taking herself very seriously and no longer, either at night or when they were alone together in the daytime, permitted herself those affectionate intimacies that had been customary between her and Bao-yu in the past. A slight distance seemed to have grown up between them since their younger, more carefree days. Partly it was being so much busier that kept her from him for although the most important matters remained outside her control, it was she who organized the sewing and other maids-work, took care of Bao-yus and the junior maids pocket-money for them, attended to their clothing and other equipment, and assumed responsibility for the general maintenance of the apartment. Partly it was because she had a fear of infecting him for she still continued, though very infrequently, to cough blood. It was mainly for this last reason that she had for some time 549 -827 now ceased sleeping in the same room. But Bao-yu was nervous at night and liked to have someone near at hand whom he could call to when he woke up. Because she knew that Sky-bright was a light sleeper, Aroma entrusted all the night-time duties, like answering him when he called, getting up and making tea for him and so forth, to her, so that it had long since been the custom for Skybright to sleep in the same room with him beside his bed. Now that Skybright was no longer with him, Aroma made her own bed up beside Bao-yus in Skybrights place. Observing the somewhat dazed manner in which Bao-yu was conducting himself that evening, Aroma urged him to go to bed early, and as soon as she had got him settled, went to bed herself.
By all means. Jia Zheng sent a page to fetch Jia Lian, who was instructed to take the pearl and the precious net through to Grandmother Jias apartment. He also sent a servant to invite Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xi-feng to come and view them. There are two other items, Jia Lian explained to the ladies. A folding screen and a musical clock. The whole lot is going for twenty thousand taels. What! said Xi-feng sharply. I grant you theyre fine pieces. Hut we definitely havent the cash to spare. Besides were not like provincial viceroys and governors, who are expected to make such offerings. No over the years Ive come to the conclusion that the most sensible way to secure our financial future is to invest in land and property-trust-land for provision of sacrificial funds, and free burial-grounds for the clan with permanent caretakers quarters. Such things would be there for the family to fall back on in hard times, an insurance against ruin. I dont know if Grannie, Father and Mother agree with me or not? Of course, if Sir Zheng and Father want to buy these things, its entirely their decision. Grandmother Jia led the chorus in Xi-fengs support. Youre absolutely right, my dear. Give them back to me then, said Jia Lian grumpily. Sir Zheng only sent me to show them to Grandmother as a possible palace-offering. No one said anything about buying them for ourselves. Trust you to pour cold water on the whole idea before Grandmother has even had a chance to speak! Jia Lian returned to the study with the curios, and reported that Grandmother Jia did not wish to buy them. No one denies their quality, he said to Feng Zi-ying. But we just cant afford them. Ill keep my eyes open though, and if I come across a likely buyer Ill definitely let you know. Feng packed them away again, evidently disappointed. He sat and chatted for a while without much enthusiasm, and soon made motions of leaving. Wont you stay to dinner? asked Jia Zheng. I have already taken up too much of your time... Not at all. We should be delighted. As they were speaking Jia She was announced. He was already in the room, and after greeting Feng engaged him in conversation for a few minutes. Presently wine was served and various delicacies were set on the table. After the fourth or fifth round of wine, the subject of the curios came up again. Actually its rather hard to sell stuff like this, confessed Feng. The market is restricted to the few illustrious families such as yours. Oh come, I am sure you will find someone, Jia Zheng consoled him. Besides, observed Jia She in a rather maudlin tone, we are not exactly the great and glorious house we once were, you know. Nothing but a hollow facade... How is Mr Zhen over at Ning-guo House by the way? asked Feng. I saw him the other day and in the course of conversation he mentioned this new wife of his sons. Not a patch on his first, so he was saying. Who is she anyway? I never did ask her name. Shes a Hu-theyre an old local family. Her father was once Taotai of the Metropolitan Circuit, Jia Zheng informed him. Oh, I know Intendant Hu.... said Feng. Heard that he lets some pretty rum things go on in his house too. Still, the main thing is that the gal should have turned out all right. I heard from someone at the Grand Secretariat that Yu-cun is to be promoted again, put in Jia Lian. Really?. Im glad to hear that, said Jia Zheng. Has it been made official yet? Most probably, said Jia Lian. Yes, I heard the same myself when I was at the Board of Civil Office earlier today, said Feng. Am I right in thinking that he is a relation of yours, sir? He is, answered Jia Zheng. A close one? It is a long story, said Jia Zheng. He comes originally from Hu-zhou in Chekiang. He left home and was lodging in Soochow, eking out a rather unsatisfactory existence, when he was befriended by a gentleman named Zhen Shi-yin, who provided the means or him to better himself. Yu-cun later went on to become a palace graduate, and passed out with flying colours and an immediate posting as a magistrate in one of the provinces. He took one of this benefactors maidservants as his concubine she is now, I believe, his principal wife. Old Zhen himself was reduced to destitution by a strange series of calamities, and finally disappeared without trace.
He was about to leave when he heard a faint sound coming from inside, too faint to identify. He stood still and listened again, in the hope of hearing it more clearly. There it was! A distinct little tap! He was still trying to think what it could be, when a voice said Why have you made that move, and not countered there? It was a game of Go! But Bao-yu did not have time to recognize the voice of the speaker. He heard Xi-chun reply Why should I bother? If you take me there, I shall simply counter here, and if you take me again I shall take you again. I shall still be one move ahead, and in the end I shall be able to connect. And what if I take you here? Aiyo! exclaimed Xi-chun. You had an inside counterattack up your sleeve. Im defenceless. That other girls voice was so familiar! But he still couldnt quite place it. It wasnt one of his cousins, he was sure of that. And yet Xi-chun was unlikely to be entertaining an outsider. Lifting the door-curtain very gently aside, he peeped in. The Go-partner was none other than the nun from Green Bower Hermitage, the Dweller Beyond The Threshold, Adamantina. He dared not intrude any further. The girls were totally absorbed in their game, and had neither of them noticed that they were being spied upon. Bao-yu continued to stand there and watch. Adamantina leant low over the board and said to Xi-chun Do you want to lose that whole corner? Of course not! Its perfectly safe. All those pieces of yours are "dead"., arent they? Are you sure? Go ahead and try. All right. Theres my move. Now lets see what you can do. A smile crossed Adamantinas face. She placed her next piece to link up with one she already had on the edge of the board, and then pounced on one of Xi-chuns pieces and annihilated her entire corner. She laughed Thats called "Pulling Your Boots Off Upside Down"! Before Xi-chun had time to reply, their unobserved observer, unable to contain himself any longer, burst out laughing. The two girls were startled out of their wits. What do you mean by sneaking in here without saying a word? exclaimed Xi-chun. What an ill-mannered way to behave, honestly! How long have you been there? I came in just as you started to play for that corner. I had to watch it out. He bowed to Adamantina. Greetings, Reverend Sister! he said with a smile. Wherefore this rare excursion from the mystic portals of Zen? What karma brings thee to Mayas dusty realm? She blushed from ear to ear, said nothing, lowered her head and stared at the Go-board. Bao-yu could see that he had embarrassed her, and tried to make up for it. Seriously, he said, with a charming smile, how can common mortals compare with those who, like you, have renounced the world? In the first place, you have achieved inner peace. And with that peace comes a deep spirituality. And with that spirituality a clear insight As he was speaking, Adamantina lifted her eyes a fraction and glanced at him. She looked down again at once, and a deep flush spread slowly across her face. Bao-yu realized that she was deliberately trying to ignore him, and sat down awkwardly beside the table. Xi-chun wanted to continue the game, but after a silence Adamantina said Lets play another day. Having said this, she stood up, straightened out her dress and sat down again. Then, turning to Bao-yu, she asked, in a zany tone of voice Where have you come from? It came as a great relief to Bao-yu that she should speak to him at all, and he was grateful of the chance to remedy his earlier blunder. But then it suddenly struck him that her question might not be as straightforward as it sounded. Was this one of her Zen subtleties? He sat there tongue-tied and red in the face. Adamantina smiled and turned to talk to Xi-chun. Xi-chun smiled too. -347 Cousin Bao, she said, whats so hard about that? Havent you heard the saying "I come from whence I come"? To judge by the colour of your face anyone would think you were among strangers. Dont be shy! Adamantina seemed to take this banter personally. She experienced a strange stirring of emotion, and her face grew hot. She knew she must be blushing again, and became extremely flustered. Rising to her feet, she said Ive been here a long time.
Old Zhen himself was reduced to destitution by a strange series of calamities, and finally disappeared without trace. We only came to know Yu-cun, continued Jia Zheng, when my brother-in-law, Lin Ru-hai, who at that time was the Yangchow Salt Commissioner, engaged him as private tutor for his daughter - this was after his dismissal. Then Yu-cun learned of the general reinstatement for dismissed officials and planned to come up to the capital to take advantage of it. My niece - Ru-hais daughter - was, as it so happened, just about to come and visit us here, so her father persuaded her tutor to travel with her and act as her escort. He also sent me a letter of recommendation, asking me to put in a good word for him where I could. I formed a favourable impression of him, and from then on we saw a good deal of one another. One thing I remember finding most extraordinary about Yu-cun he seemed to have familiarized himself with every detail of our family history. There was nothing he did not know. Who our ancestors were, how they won their titles, every ramification of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo family trees, exactly how many of us there are, who we all are, where we all live, what we all do - why, he was a mine of information! I liked him for it, I must say. Jia Zheng smiled, and went on Hes done extremely well for himself in the last few years too. Promoted from Prefect to Censor, then in a few years to Vice-president of the Board of Civil Office, then President of the Board of War. He was demoted three grades for some incident, but now it seems he is to be promoted again. How hard it is to predict the vicissitudes of human life, commented Feng Zi-ying. And yet there is a pattern in all things, said Jia Zheng. Take your p earl for instance. The big one is like a man blessed with fortune the little ones are his dependants, sheltering in the shade of his influence. If the big one goes, then the little ones are helpless. If the head of a family is in trouble, his wife and children are taken from him, his relations are left destitute, even his friends he may see no more. Prosperity may crumble in the twinkling of an eye, like the passing of a spring cloud or the falling of an autumn leaf. What joy is there in public life? My kinsman Yu-cun has had a comparatively easy time of it. But take a case nearer home, the Zhen family, like our own in so many respects . They too were ennobled for their services to the Throne. Their style of life has always been very like ours. We used to see a great deal of them. I remember not many years ago when they were here in the capital, they sent one of their men round to convey their respects, and all seemed well. Yet not long afterwards their family estate was confiscated, and goodness alone knows what has become of them now. We have had no news of them for so long. My heart goes out to them. Whats this about a pearl? asked Jia She. Jia Zheng and Feng Zi-ying gave him a description of the Mother Pearl. We need have no fears, said Jia She, resuming the previous topic of conversation. Nothing can happen to us. Of course not, sir, said Feng, with Her Grace to protect your interests at Court, with such enviable connections and such a host of relations, and with a family that from Lady Jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record... Granted, said Jia Zheng somewhat grimly. But our respectability is more than balanced by our lack of ability and positive achievement. We are living on borrowed time, and one day it will run out. Do lets put an end to this depressing conversation, said Jia She, and have another drink. They did so, and after a few more rounds dinner was served. After dinner, tea was brought in and Fengs page came in and murmured something in his masters ear. Feng took his leave. What was that you said? asked Jia She of the page. Its snowing, sir, and theyve sounded the first evening watch. Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed already more than an inch thick on the ground. I hope your two curios are well wrapped? said Jia Zheng. They are, replied Feng. Dont forget, if you change your minds, Im sure we can come to some agreement about the price. Ill bear it in mind, said Jia Zheng. I shall wait to hear from you then. Its cold - please dont bother to see me out.
You are at present a Youth of Promise, or as our text has it Puer Verendus. Whether or not you Fulfil this Promise depends entirely on your own efforts. Are you to be a Man of Merit, Vir Nominis, or are you to be a Man No Longer Esteemed by his Fellow-Men, Vir Non lam Verendus? I shall allow you an initial period of one month in which to revise your old texts thoroughly, and a further month in which to study models of Octopartite Composition. At the end of the second month I intend to set you your Maiden Theme. If I detect any sign of slackness on your part, y6u need not expect me to be lenient. As the saying goes -1414 Perfection comes through ceaseless effort Effortless ease brings but perditidn. Be sure to bear in mind all that I have said. Yes sir. And so we must leave Bao-yu for the present, submitting reluctantly to his daily lessons. During his absence at school, Green Delights became unrecognizably quiet and the days passed slowly and uneventfully. Aroma even found time to do some sewing. One day she sat down to finish a betel-nut refresher bag she had been embroidering, and fell to thinking of the great change wrought in all their lives by Bao-yus new routine. How easy life was for the maids now that he was away all day! If things had only been like this earlier, Skybright might never have come to such a wretched end. Poor Skybright! Aroma sighed for does not the hare in the trap set the foxs heart a-beating? It was the shortest step from grieving for Skybright to brooding over her own future. What was to become of her? What sort of a life would she lead, asBao-yus concubine? Bao-yu himself was no problem. She knew how to handle him. But what if he were to marry someone like Mrs Lian or Mr Pans new wife? Was she fated to be a second You Er-jie or Caltrop? To judge from Lady Jia and Lady Wangs attitude in the past, and from the frequent hints dropped by Mrs Lian, it seemed a foregone conclusion that he would marry Miss Lin. Now there was a complicated young lady... With this new turn of thought Aromas colour deepened, her heart beat faster and her aim with the needle became more and more erratic. Finally she aband9ned her embroidery altogether and set off for the Naiads House, determined to put Dai-yus disposition t 9 wards her to the test. Dai-yu was reading a book. When she saw Aroma come in, she moved over slightly and nodded to her to sit down. I hope youre feeling quite better, Miss, began Aroma, anxious to create the right impression. Not really, replied Dai-yu. I suppose I do feel a little less weak. What have you been doing at home? Now that Master Baos at school, replied Aroma, its very quiet at home, so I thought Id come round for a chat. Nightingale came in with tea and Aroma rose promptly to her feet. Please sit down, Nightingale dear. She laughed as she continued. Youve been making fun of us, so Ripple was telling me the other day... You dont take any notice of what she says, do you? said Nightingale with a smile. All I meant was that with Master Bao away at school all day, and Miss Chai and Caltrop both living out, things must be dull for you. -384 Aroma seized her opportunity Caltrop, did I hear you say? Oh, that poor girl! I feel so sorry for her! This new wife of Mr Pans is a Total Eclipse if ever there was one! Shes even worse than a certain person... Here Aroma held up two fingers, indicating the Second Young Lady of the household - Xi-feng. This Mrs Pan doesnt seem to care a bit what people think. That certain person was bad enough, said Dai-yu. To think that You Er-jie is dead! I know, said Aroma. They were both human beingsafter all. It was only their positions that were different. Why did she have to be so malicious? It hasnt done the family name any good. This was the first time Dai-yu had heard Aroma gossip like this, and she began to suspect what was at the back of it. Its hard to tell, she said. In every family affair, one side or the other has to win. If its not the East Wind its the West. A concubine should know her place, said Aroma.
Of course, if what you say is not true, you may as well give up hope of living! I wouldnt dare lie to you, madam, said Picture, weeping. You have only to ask Mr and Mrs Zhen. If they say my brother wasnt given these things, I shant complain if you beat us both to death. I shall certainly ask, said Xi-feng. But even if he was given them, you are still to blame. Who said that you could have things brought in to you secretly? I shall let you off this once if you will tell me honestly who brought them in, but you mustnt ever do this again. Dont let her off! said Xi-chun. There are so many maids. If the older ones see her getting away with it, theres no knowing what they will get up to. You may want to forgive her, but I dont. She seems to me a pretty sensible girl as a rule, said Xifeng. We all make mistakes sometimes. Im only proposing 476 that we should let her off this once. If she does anything like this again, we shall punish her for this offence as well. -Come on now, what about this person who brought you the things? she asked Picture. Tell me who it was. -1094 Oh, I can tell you that, said Xi-chun. Its sure to have been that old Zhang woman from the rear gate. Shes always around here, whispering guiltily to the maids and doing little favours for them - in return for which, of course, they give her their protection. Xi-feng told one of the women to make a note of this. The silver and the other things she gave to Zhou Ruis wife to take care of until Pictures statement about their provenance could be verified. This old Mamma Zhang whom Xi-chun had named as the go-between who had brought things in for Pictures brother was a close kinswoman of Wang Shan-baos wife, being in fact the mother-in-law of one of her children. However, since becoming Lady Xings chief confidante, Wang Shanbaos wife had had little time for kinsfolk or former colleagues, and her treatment of Mamma Zhang had caused that matron to take umbrage. On two occasions there had been words between them, and for some time now the two of them had not been on speaking terms. The satisfaction of learning that the guilty bearer of these objects was a hated enemy almost compensated Wang Shan-baos wife for the indignity of being slapped by Tan-chun and taunted by Tan-chuns maid. She endeavoured to impress Xi-feng with the gravity of what they had discovered. This smuggling is a very serious business, Mrs Lian. No doubt the things we are looking for got into the Garden by the same way. I think you ought to look into this. I fully intend to do so, said Xi-feng. I dont need you to tell me. They took leave of Xi-chun then and made their way to Ying-chuns. Ying-chun was asleep when they arrived and the maids had already gone to bed. They had to knock a long while at the gate before anyone answered. Theres no need to disturb your mistress, Xi-feng said to the girl who admitted them, and made straight for the maids 477 -1014 room, followed by the rest of the party. Knowing that Wang Shan-baos wife was Chesss maternal grandmother, Xi-feng watched her very attentively to see if she would show any favouritism. Wang Shan-baos wife began on the trunks of the other maids. None of them contained anything of interest. Coming to Chesss trunk last of all, she merely picked up one or two things lying on the top of it before hurriedly pronouncing that there was nothing there, and would have shut it up again if Zhou Ruis wife had not intervened to prevent her. -1174 Now just a minute. Whether there is or not, youve got to go through it properly, the same as you did the rest, out of fairness to the others. -1094 She stretched her own hand out as she said this and, diving into the trunk, fetched out, successively, a pair of mens padded socks, a pair of mens satin slippers, and a packet containing a little Loving Couple ornament and a letter. All these things she handed over to Xi-feng. From handling so many bills, invoices and accounts during her years as a household manager, Xi-feng had learned to recognize quite a large number of characters and was able to make out the whole of the crude missive, written on pink Double Happiness notepaper, that Thou Ruis wife had just thrust into her hand.
Dai-yus strange illness and stranger recovery gave rise to a great deal of whispering and speculation in the household, which soon reached the ears of Xi-feng. Lady Wang and Lady Xing vaguely suspected something, and Grandmother Jia herself had a shrewd idea what was at the bottom of it all. The four ladies were gathered one day in Grandmother Jias apartment, and in the course of their conversation the subject of Dai-yus illness came up. There is something I want to say to you all, said Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu and Miss Lin have been together ever since they were little, and this has never troubled me, as I have always thought of them as children. But of late I have noticed how frequent these illnesses of hers are becoming - how suddenly they come, and how suddenly they go - a sure sign that she is growing up. It really wont do to allow them to stay together indefinitely. What do you all think? After a thoughtful silence Lady Wang replied, choosing her words with care Miss Lin reads such a lot into things. And Bao-yus childish manner is deceptive he can be extremely stupid and tactless. If we remove either one of them from the Garden, wont it be too obvious? It has always been said that every boy becomes a groom and every girl becomes a bride. Dont you think, Mother, that a better solution would be to go ahead as quickly as possible and get them both married? Grandmother Jia frowned. I know that Miss Lins peculiar temperament is in some ways attractive. But I dont think we could possibly have her as a wife for Bao-yu. Besides, Im- afraid that with such a delicate constitution she is unlikely to live to any age. Im sure Bao-chai is in every respect the more suitable choice. Of course we all agree with you there, Mother, said Lady Wang. But we must find a husband for Miss Lin too. If we do not, and if she has taken a fancy to Bao-yu -after all, it is only natural for a girl to have such feelings as she grows up - it might make things very -difficult if she were then to discover that he was already betrothed to Bao-chai. There can be no question, replied Grandmother Jia, of marrying an outsider before one of the family. The order must be first to marry Bao-yu, then to have Miss Lin betrothed. Besides Miss Lin is two years younger than Bao-yu anyway. If I understand you correctly, we shall have to conceal Bao-yus betrothal from her... Xi-feng turned at once to the various maids present Is that clear? Not a word of Master Baos betrothal to anyone! If I catch one of you talking about it I shall show no mercy. Feng dear, continued Grandmother Jia, I have noticed that since your illness you have taken less interest in what happens in the Garden. You really must give it more of your attention. Its not just the sort of thing we have been talking about. Any repetition of that disgraceful drinking and gambling that was discovered among the servants last year must be prevented at all costs. Be rather more particular, will you, and keep a watchful eye on what goes on. They need to be- disciplined, and you seem to be the one they respect most. Yes, Grannie, said Xi-feng. The ladies sat talking for a while longer, then left to go their separate ways. From now on Xi-feng began to inspect the Garden on a more regular basis. One day, in the course of one of her tours of inspection, she was walking along the bank by Amaryllis Eyot when she heard an old woman shouting outside the courtyard and went to investigate. As she drew near the old serving-woman caught sight of her, dropped her hands to her side and stood to attention, mumbling a confused Good morning, maam. Why are you making such a racket out here? asked Xi-feng. You and Mrs Zhu have given me a job to do here, maam, replied the woman, looking after the flowerbeds and fruit-trees. Id done nothing wrong, and Miss Xings maid accused us of stealing.. And why should she do that? asked Xi-feng. - Yesterday our Blackie came with me here to play, replied the woman. She didnt know any better and went inside Miss Xings apartment to have a look around. I sent her home straight away. Then early this morning I heard one of the maids say theyd lost something. When I asked what it was, she started questioning me all about it Thats no cause for you to lose your temper, retorted Xi-feng. what This Garden belongs to Mrs Zhus family not hers!
The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid. She became very thin, yet had lost all interest in food. The doctor was called in and medicines were prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good. Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went for her with a cudgel or a knife but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst and of course he could not he could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The only result of it was that Jin-guis power over her husband grew all the stronger. At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind. Finding herself now under attack from that quarter, she was unwilling to yield an inch and gave back as good as she got. When, after a few slanging-matches, Jin-gui grew really angry and began not only to curse her but to lay hands on her as well, she did not quite dare to return blow for blow, but she put on a fine display of hysteria, shrieking, rolling about on the floor and threshing about with her limbs. Thereafter she was constantly threatening suicide, and at any hour of the day or night they might have to snatch knives or scissors from her grasp or take down the noose which she had fastened for herself over a beam. Between the two of them Xue Pan was driven half distracted. He could only look on helplessly while they quarrelled, until finally the rumpus got too much for him and he would slip out of the house and take refuge elsewhere. 606 Sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling, if she was feeling cheerful, Jin-gui would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards. She was inordinately fond of gnawing bones, especially the bones of fowls. To satisfy this craving she had ducks and chickens killed every day. The meat she gave to other people it was only the bones, crisp-fried in boiling fat, that she kept for herself, to nibble with her wine. Sometimes, if the bone she was gnawing was giving her trouble and she grew impatient, she would swear like a trooper. That ponce and his poxy strumpet seem to enjoy themselves, she would say self-pityingly. Why cant I get any enjoyment? Aunt Xue and Bao-chai no longer attempted to intervene. Now they could only sit in their own room and weep in silence while they listened to the profanities next door. Xue Pan was helpless. He bitterly regretted the brief madness which had led him to chain himself to this demon wife. Soon everyone in the two mansions, both masters and servants, had heard about the Xues predicament and all felt sorry for them. -1094 By this time Bao-yus hundred days of convalescence had ended and he was allowed to go out. One of the first things he did was to call on Jin-gui. There was nothing exceptionable in her behaviour or appearance on the occasion when he saw her she seemed to be just the same sort of delicate, flowerlike creature as all the other girls. How did so beautiful a person come to have so appalling a character? It was a mystery which continued to occupy him for some time after the visit. When, a few days later, he called in to wish his mother good morning, his visit happened to coincide with that of Ying-chuns nurse. She brought distressing news about Sun Shao-zus behaviour. Whenever she is on her own, the young mistress does nothing but cry, said the woman. Shes longing for you to send for her so that she can enjoy a day or two of freedom. Ive been meaning for some days to send for her, said 607 Lady Wang, but so many disagreeable things have been happening lately that I keep forgetting. Bao-yu spoke to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day. Tomorrow is a good day, according to the calendar. We will send for her tomorrow. Just then a servant arrived from Grandmother Jias with a message for Bao-yu. He was to go first thing next morning to the Tian Qi Temple to burn incense in payment of a vow she had made for his recovery. Eager for outings after his long confinement, he was hardly able to sleep that night for excitement.
Dai-yu, who for Bao-chais sake had tried to disguise her annoyance at the way the old woman had come barging in, called out after her Please thank Miss Bao-chai for her kind present. La-di-da-di-da! the old. girl could still be heard burbling away to herself. Only Bao-yu would have the style to match such a fine lady... Dai-yu pretended not to hear. Really, said Aroma, trying to laugh the whole thing off, when people reach her age they just talk utter nonsense. You dont know whether to scold or laugh. -294 Snowgoose passed the lychees to Dai-yu. I couldnt put them away, would you? They chatted a little longer and. then Aroma left. That evening, when Dai-yu went into her side-room to undress for the night, she caught sight of the lychees again. They reminded her of the old womans visit, and revived the pain she had felt at her tactless gossiping. Dusk was falling, and in the stillness a thousand gloomy thoughts seemed to close in and oppress her mind. My health is so poor... And times running out. I know Bao-yu loves me more than anyone else. But Grannie and Aunt Wang still havent mentioned it! If only my parents had settled it for us while they were still alive.. But suppose they had? What if they had married me to someone else? Who could ever compare with Bao-yu? Perhaps Im better off like this after all! At least Ive still some hope. Like the rope on a pulley her secret hopes and fears spun up and down, tangling themselves tighter and tighter round her heart. Finally, with a sigh and a few tears, she lay down in her clothes, weary and depressed. She became vaguely aware of one of the junior maids coming in and saying Miss Lin, Mr Jia Yu-cun is outside and wants to see you. What could he want? thought Dai-vu to herself. Im not a regular student of his. Im not even a boy. He just happened to coach me when I was a little girl. Anyway, all the times hes come to see Uncle Zheng hes never once asked after me, so why should I have to see him now? She told the maid to convey her respects and thank Mr Yu-cun for calling, but to say that poor health obliged her to stay in bed. But Miss, said the maid, I think hes come to congratulate you, and some people have come to take you to Nanking. As she was speaking, a group including Xi-feng, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Bao-chai advanced into the room and announced cheerfully Congratulations my dear! And bon voyage! What do you mean? asked Dai-yu in great confusion. Come on now. It was Xi-feng who replied. You neednt try and pretend you havent heard the news. Your fathers been promoted to Grain Intendant for Hupeh Province and has made a second and highly satisfactory marriage. He doesnt think it right that you should be left here on your own, and has asked Yu-cun to act as go-between. Youre engaged to be married to a relation of your new stepmothers, a widower himself I believe. Theyve sent some servants to fetch you home. Youll probably be married straight away. Its all your stepmothers idea. In case youre not properly taken care of on the voyage, she has asked your cousin Lian to accompany you. Xi-fengs words made Dai-yu break out in a cold sweat. She now had a feeling that her father was still alive. She began to panic, and said defiantly Its not true! Its all a trick of Xi-fengs! She saw Lady Xing give Lady Wang a meaningful look She wont believe us. Come, we are wasting our time. Aunt Wang! Aunt Xing! Dont go! Dai-yu begged them, fighting back her tears. But she received no reply. They all gave her a curious smile, and then left together. As she stood there and watched them go, panic seized her. She tried to speak, but the only sound that came was a strangled sobbing from the back of her throat. Then she looked about her and saw that somehow she had been transported to Grandmother Jias apartment. In that same instant she thought to herself Grannies the only one that can save me now! and fell at the old ladys feet, hugging her by the knees. Save me Grannie, please! Id rather die than go away with them! That stepmothers not my real mother anyway. I just want to stay here with you!
You-shi was highly sensitive to remarks about her familys reputation and had already been embarrassed and upset by Xi-chuns reference to people talking. Because Xi-chun was only a girl, she had done her best not to lose her temper but this last remark was too much to stomach. Unable to contain herself any longer, she burst out angrily. What do you mean, dragged down to my level? You 482 turn your maids offence into an occasion for making a completely unwarranted attack upon me, and when I bear your ridiculous attacks with patience, it seems merely t6 encourage you to indulge in further insults. Very well, Miss Holy Purity! I shall be careful to keep away from you in future, in case your priceless reputation is sullied by my presence. She swept out angrily, indicating to her maids as she went that they should bring Picture with them. It will be much better for all concerned if you dont ever come here again, Xi-chun called out alter her. It will save a lot of argument. You-shi heard this and grew even angrier but reflecting that Xi-chun was, however vexing, a young unmarried daughter of the family and therefore not a person with whom she could engage in open wrangling, she swallowed her anger and hurried off without answering, out of the Garden and into the inner part of the mansion. What she heard there will be related in the chapter which follows. CHAPTER 75 Midnight revellers are startled by a sound of evil omen And Mid-Autumn moon-watchers listen to quatrains of unequal merit When You-shi swept angrily out of Xi-chuns apartment, it had been her intention to visit Lady Wang, but one of the old women in her suite whispered in her ear to advise her against going there. Some people from the Zhen family have just arrived there, madam, with a lot of things. I think its something secret theyve come about. It probably wouldnt be very convenient for you to go there now. Thats funny, said You-shi. I heard your master saying last night that he had read in the Gazette that the Zhens had been attainted. It said that there was a search and confiscation order on their estate and that the family were being brought under arrest to the capital for questioning. What can any of them be doing here? You may well ask, madam. It was some of the womenfolk we saw there. They were in a terrible state, very worried and frightened. I expect they are doing something they ought not to be. You-shi abandoned her idea of visiting Lady Wang and went back to see Li Wan, with whom she had been talking a little earlier when Xi-chun called her away. Li Wan had been visited in the meantime by her doctor and as she was feeling much livelier than she had done for some days, she had remained sitting up after her visit. You-shi found her propped up on pillows and with the bedclothes pulled up round her, eager for conversation. Unfortunately You-shi, who had been so affable on her earlier visit, was now in no mood to talk and sat at Li Wans bedside silent and preoccupied. U Wan wondered if she was feeling hungry. 484 Have something to eat, she said. What would you like? She turned to Candida. What nice little snack have we got that we could offer Mrs Zhen? Please dont bother, said You-shi. Youre hardly likely to have interesting snacks in the house after being an invalid for so many days. And in any case Im not hungry. Someone sent me some rather good wheatmeal tea yesterday, said Li Wan. Why dont you try a bowl of that? She told Candida to mix some for her with sugar and boiling water. You-shi made no reply and continued to brood. The women and maids who had come with her tried to think of some means of distracting her. You havent done your face yet since this morning, madam, said one of them. Why not take this opportunity of having a wash? You-shi nodded. Li Wan at once sent Candida for her dressing-case and mirror. Candida offered You-shi the use of her own make-up. Our mistress doesnt use make-up, Mrs Zhen. If you dont mind using my stuff, youre very welcome to some of this. Its true that I havent got any, said Li Wan, but you ought to have borrowed some from one of the young ladies to lend her. Fancy offering her your own, and in front of everyone else! Its a good job it was Mrs Zhen. Some people would have been most offended. Oh, thats all right, said You-shi, and began to wash. The maid with the basin bent down to hold it out to her.
asked Aunt Xue, adding I hope Lady Jia is well. Very well, thank you maam, replied the maid. Her Old Ladyship asked me t9 send you her best regards, to thank you for the lychees you sent the other day, and to congratulate Miss Qin on her engagement. How long have you been here? asked Bao-chai. Quite a time, was her reply. The colour rose in Aunt Xues cheeks when she realized how much the maid must have overheard. Im afraid weve been having some dreadful scenes here recently, she said. We must be a laughing-stock over on your side. Oh maam, its nothing serious, said the maid. Every family has its little troubles. Thats as natural as plates clinking in a picnic-hamper. Youre worrying too much. She went inside with them and sat for a while before returning to Grandmother Jias. A moment or two later, Bao-chai was busy giving Caltrop s 9 me instructions when suddenly Aunt Xue cried out Ai! My chest! She lay down on the kang, sending Bao-chai and Caltrop into a great state of panic. But if you wish to know the outcome, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 84 -587 Bao-yu is given an impromptu examination, and his betrothal is discussed for the first time Jia Huan visits a convulsive child, and old hostilities are resumed Bao-chai diagnosed her mothers sudden pain as an upward movement of humour from the liver into the chest, brought on by the recent scene with Jin-gui. Without waiting for a doctor, she sent a servant out instantly to buy a few drams of Woody Vine Hooks, and made a strong brew for Aunt Xue to drink. Then Caltrop helped administer a leg-pummelling and chest-massage. The pain eased a little but Aunt Xues anger at Jin-guis outrageous behaviour, and her distress that Bao-chai should have had to submit to such humiliation, continued unabated. Eventually, after another dose of daughterly reasoning, she fell asleep, and the humour was given a chance to subside. Now please dont worry any more, Mama, pleaded Bao-chai, when she awoke. In a day or two, when you feel up to it, why not go over and see Lady Jia and Aunt Wang? It would do you a world of good. Caltrop and I can take care of things here while youre away. And Im sure there will be no more trouble from her. Aunt Xue nodded. Perhaps I will in a couple of days. The news finally arrived that Yuan-chun had recovered, and everyone in the Jia family was greatly relieved. A day or two later a party of eunuchs arrived from the palace with a consignment of presents and parcels of money. They announced that it. was Her Graces wish to reward the family for the diligence they had shown in visiting her during her Indisposition. The eunuchs handed over the carefully labelled gifts one by one. Jia She, Jia Zheng and the other menfolk went in to report to Grandmother Jia, and then all returned to express their thanks or the largesse. When the eunuchs had drunk their tea and gone, there was a family gathering in Grandmother Jias apartment. After a few minutes, while they were still chatting, an old serving-woman came in with a message The pages have reported that theres a visitor at the other side on important business for Sir She, milady. With Grandmother Jias permission, Jia She left to see to his own affairs. When he had gone, she suddenly thought of something and her face lit up with a smile. Its so touching, she said, turning to Jia Zheng, the way Her Grace remembers Bao-yu! The other day she made a point of asking about him. Her solicitude, replied Jia Zheng with a sarcastic smile, is as generous as it is undeserved. Increasing idleness is the only fruit that young tree will ever bear. But I gave him a glowing report! protested Grandmother Jia. I said how well he was doing at his compositions. I only wish it were the truth, said Jia Zheng with a crushing smile. But you and your friends are always asking him to write verses and things for you - Im sure hes making progress, whatever you say. Hes still young, be patient with him. "A single spoonful never made a bouncing babe," as the saying goes. Jia Zheng affected a dutiful smile. Yes, Mother. Which brings me, the old lady continued, to the other thing I want to talk about. Now that Bao-yu is growing up, its time you and his mother started thinking seriously of choosing a nice wife for him.
Thats what Id like to know! It was only to do with Master Bao marrying Miss Chai! The words struck Dai-yus ears like a clap of thunder. Her heart started thumping fiercely. She tried to calm herself for a moment, and told the maid to come with her. The maid followed her to the secluded corner of the garden, where the Flower Burial Mound was situated. Here Dai-yu asked her Why should she hit you for mentioning Master Baos marriage to Miss Chai? Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, replied Simple, have decided that as the Master is leaving soon, they are going to arrange with Mrs Xue to marry Master Bao and Miss Chai as uickly as possible. They want the wedding to turn his luck, and then... Her voice tailed off. She stared at Dai-yu, laughed and continued Then, as soon as those two are married, they are going to find a husband for you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu was speechless with horror. The maid went on regardless But how was I to know that theyd decided to keep it quiet, for fear of embarrassing Miss Chai? All I did was say to Aroma, that serves in Master Baos room "Wont it be a fine to-do here soon, when Miss Chai comes over, or Mrs Bao... what will we have to call her? Thats all I said. What was there in that to hurt sister Pearl? Can you see, Miss Lin? She came across and hit me straight in the face and said I was talking rubbish and disobeying orders, and would be dismissed from service! How was I to know their Ladyships didnt want us to mention it? Nobody told me, and she just hit me! She started sobbing again. Dai-yus heart felt as though oil, soy-sauce, sugar and vinegar had all been poured into it at once. She could not tell which flavour predominated, the sweet, the sour, the bitter or the salty. After a few moments silence, she said in a trembling voice Dont talk such rubbish. Any more of that, and youll be beaten again. Off you go! She herself turned back in the direction of the Naiads House. Her body felt as though it weighed a hundred tons, her feet were as wobbly as if she were walking on cotton-floss. She could only manage one step at a time. After an age, she still had not reached the bank by Drenched Blossoms Bridge. She was going so slowly, with her feet about to collapse beneath her, and in her giddiness and confusion had wandered off course and increased the distance by about a hundred yards. She reached Drenched Blossoms Bridge only to start drifting back again along the bank in the direction she ha4 just come from, quite unaware of what she was doing. Nightingale had by now returned with the handkerchief, but could not find Dai-yu anywhere. She finally saw her, pale as snow, tottering along, her eyes staring straight in front of her, meandering in circles. Nightingale also caught sight of a maid disappearing in the distance beyond Dai-yu, but could not make out who it was. She was most bewildered, and quickened her step. Why are you turning back again, Miss? she asked softly. Where are you heading for? Dai-yu only heard the blurred outline of this question. She replied I want to ask Bao-yu something. Nightingale could not fathom what was going on, and could only try to guide her on her way to Grandmother Jias apartment. When they came to the entrance, Dai-yu seemed to feel clearer in mind. She turned, saw Nightingale supporting her, stopped for a moment, and asked What are you doing here? I went to fetch your handkerchief, replied Nightingale, smiling anxiously. I saw you over by the bridge and hurried across. I asked you where you were going, but you took no notice. Oh! said Dai-yu with a smile. I thought you had come to see Bao-yu. What else did we come here for? Nightingale could see that her mind was utterly confused. She guessed that it was something that the maid had said in the garden, and only nodded with a faint smile in reply to Dai-yus question. But to herself she was trying to imagine what sort of an encounter this was going to be, between the young master who had already lost his wits, and her young mistress who was now herself a little touched. Despite her apprehensions, she dared not prevent the meeting, and helped Dai-yu into the room. The funny thing was that Dai-yu now seemed to have recovered her strength.
Li Wan replied for Aunt Xue. You dont understand. Its not the same now. Theyre very busy at present, so she cant possibly come. Xi-chun supposed that this was the real reason for Baochais absence, and dropped the matter. As they were talking, Grandmother Jia and the rest of the family arrived back from their visit of condolence. When they saw that Aunt Xue was there, preliminary courtesies were dropped for once and everyone wanted to know the latest in the Pan affair. Aunt Xue told them the whole story. Bao-yu was present, and pricked up his ears when he heard Jiang Yu-hans name mentioned. Although he thought it inadvisable to show much interest in front of the others, secretly he asked himself why his old actor-friend had not been to look him up, if he was back in town. Then, noticing that Bao-chai had not accompanied her mother, and trying to imagine what could be keeping her at home, he began to drift into one of his brown studies, and was only aroused and restored to a more cheerful frame of mind by the unexpected arrival of Dai-yu. He stayed for dinner with the others at Grandmother Jias. After dinner everyone retired to their respective apartments, except for Aunt Xue, who stayed the night in Grandmother Jias guest-room. Bao-yu returned to Green Delights, and was divesting himself of his going-out clothes, when suddenly he remembered the cummerbund Jiang Yu-han had once given him as a first-meeting present. Do you remember that crimson cummerbund I gave you? he asked Aroma. The one you wouldnt wear? Have you still got it? Ive put it away somewhere. Why do you ask? Oh, I just wondered. Didnt you hear what terrible trouble Mr Pan got into, all because he made friends with such riffraff! Will you never learn? Havent you more sense than to go bringing up a thing like that? Instead of filling your head with such stuff, what you should be doing is quietly concentrating on your studies. Oh for goodness sake! Im not the one thats got into trouble! I just happened to think of it, thats all. I couldnt care less whether youve still got it or not. If Id known you were going to start giving me a lecture... Aroma smiled. Im not giving you a lecture. Its just that you know what people say about actors. Now that youre studying the classics and learning all the proper rules of behaviour, you should try to conform and get on in the world. When your sweetheart comes along, surely youll want to make a good impression then? Goodness! exclaimed Bao-yu, aroused by the mention of the word sweetheart, that reminds me! There was such a crowd at Grannies, I didnt have a chance to speak to Cousin Lin, and she didnt speak to me either. She left before I did, so shes probably home by now. Ill be back in a minute. He was gone. Dont stay too long! Aroma called after him. Now Ive done it! I should never have opened my mouth! Bao-yu did not reply, but made his way directly to the Naiads House, head bowed in thought. On arrival there, he found Dai-yu at her table, poring over a book. Have you been back long, coz? he asked, walking over and standing by her side. As you were ignoring me, she said, returning his smile, there was little point in my staying... He laughed. Everyone was talking at once, and I couldnt get a word in. Looking down at the page open in front of her, Bao-yu found that he couldnt understand a single character on it. Some of them seemed familiar, like the characters for Peony and Vast but on closer inspection he saw that even they had been in some way changed. There was the character for Hook, with a Five inside it, and a Nine and Big on top and there was a Five next to a Six, with Wood below and another Five at the very bottom. It was all very puzzling. You must be very advanced, to be able to decipher this esoteric script! he said. Dai-yu gave a little chee! Not much of a scholar really are you! Fancy never having seen a Qin tablature before! Its music! Of course! But why dont I know any of the characters? Do you know what they mean? No, of course not thats why Im reading it... Do you really? I never knew you could play. Did you know about the Qins hanging on the wall in the main library? There are quite a few. I remember the year before last Father had a friend who was a Qin player - Antiquarian Ji I think be was called.
Wed certainly never have told her about that! Xi-feng considered the probabilities. Somehow I dont think they would have told her. At all events, there is no point in harrving them about it now. We shall just have to put that question behind us. The important thing now is to make sure that Mother gets what she wants. Id rather we went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble. She turned to Patience. Take some of my gold things again and get us another two hundred taels. -As soon as she has the money ready, you can take it to Mother immediately, and that should be the end of the matter, she told Jia Lian. Might as well raise four hundred taels while you are about it, said Jia Lian. We could do with another two hundred ourselves. I dont see that at all, said Xi-feng. We dont really need two hundred taels ourselves. And in any case, if we raise so much now, where is the money corning from later for getting the things out of pawn? Patience fetched the now familiar gold necklaces and told Brighties wife to take them to the pawnshop. Soon afterwards Brighties wife was back again with the cash and Jia Lian went in person to hand it over to his mother. While Jia Lian was taking the money to Lady Xing, Xi-feng and Patience continued to ask themselves who could have leaked the information about the surreptitious removal of Grandmother Jias valuables. Its too bad! said Xi-feng. Poor Faithful will be in trouble over this, and all because of us. While they were still wondering who it could have been, Lady Wang was announced. This was a surprise, for Xi-feng could think of no reason why she should be visiting them. She and Patience hurried out to greet her. Lady Wang had only one maid, a trusted junior, in attend- 458 ance. There was an angry expression on her face and she walked swiftly through the house into the inner room and sat down grimly on the kang, all without uttering a word. Xi-feng, concealing her apprehension behind a smile, hurriedly served her with tea. Its an unusual honour to have you here, Aunt. Patience, leave the room! Lady Wang commanded. Yesm, said Patience, wondering what on earth could be the matter, and hurried out, taking all the other maids with her. She stood by the outer door until they were all outside, then closed it after her and sat down at the top of the steps to prevent anyone going in. As Xi-feng, now thoroughly alarmed, watched her aunt and wondered why she had come, Lady Wang, who appeared to be on the point of weeping, drew an embroidered pouch from her sleeve and threw it on the kang. Look at that! Xi-feng hastily picked it up and found herself, to her great surprise, looking at a lewd picture, beautifully embroidered in silks. Where did you get it from? she asked. The tears that had collected in Lady Wangs eyes pouted down her cheeks now and the voice in which she answered was choked and trembling. Where did I get it from? I sit all day at the bottom of a well. As you seemed such a conscientious young woman, I thought I could leave things to you and enjoy some leisure, but it seems that you are no better at managing than I. Fancy leaving a thing like that in the Garden - on a rockery, too, in broad daylight, where everyone could see it! It was picked up by one of Grandmothers maids. If your mother-in-law hadnt fortunately spotted the girl carrying it, it would have gone straight to Grandmother. I think its for you to tell me how it came to be dropped there. It was Xi-fengs turn to look angry. How do you know its mine? Lady Wang sighed and shed a few more tears. How can you ask me that? Who in this household apart from you and Lian could a thing like this belong to? The old 459 women would have no use for a thing like this and none of the girls would know where to get one from. Obviously that wretched, worthless Lian must have got hold of it from somewhere and you, treating it, I suppose, as a great joke, were only too happy to receive it from him. I know that young couples do go in for this sort of thing why try to deny it? But the young people in the Garden are still innocent. Suppose one of their maids had picked it up and shown it to them? It doesnt bear thinking of. Or suppose a maid had picked it up and told someone from outside that she had found it in the Garden?
At first she would not accept them and protested under her breath You shouldnt, Mr Yun. Think how dreadful it would look for both of us if Mrs Lian found out. Dont be silly. Keep them. Shell never know. If you dont, Ill take it as a personal insult. Crimson smiled vainly and took them from him. If you insist. But I dont want them. I really dont know what to think... Her face was burning again. Jia Yun laughed, and said Its the thought that counts... By now they had reached the inner gate and Jia Yun concealed the remaining gifts inside his gown while Crimson urged him on his way. You must go now, she said. If ever you want anything here, contact me. Now that Im in service with Mrs Lian, you can approach me directly. Yun shook his head bitterly. Shes too much of a tyrant. I shant be coming back in a hurry. Dont forget what I said just now though. If I do have a chance to see you again, Ive more to tell you. Crimson blushed from ear to ear. Youd really better go now. Come again as often as you like. If youve become distant from Mrs Lian, youve only yourself to blame. All right, I understand. Jia Yun went on his way and Crimson stood in the gateway, - following him into the distance with a thoughtful gaze. Then she turned and werit inside again. Xi-feng meanwhile was giving instructions for her dinner, and asked the maids if they had cooked her congee. They hurried off to inquire, and returned after a short while to report that the congee was ready. I should like a couple of dishes of those pickled vegetables that have just come up from the South, to go with it,, Xi-feng said. Autumn took charge of this and detailed the other maids to proceed with service. Patience came in and said with a smile Theres something I forgot to mention earlier, maam. At midday, while you were over at Her Old Ladyships, one of the prioresss women from Water-moon Priory came to see you, to ask for a couple of jars of southern pickle and for an advance of a few months allowance. The prioress has been in poor health, she told me. I asked what the matter was, and she said it had all started four or five days ago. She had been having trouble with some of the Buddhist and Taoist novices at the Priory, who despite several warnings kept leaving their lights on at night. Then one night she noticed the lamps still burning at midnight, and called to them several times. Hearing n6 reply and thinking that they must have fallen asleep with their lights on, she went herself to put them out. When she came back to her room, the strangest thing happened she saw a man and a woman sitting together on the kang, and when she asked them who they were, had a noose slipped round her neck by way of reply. Her cries for help aroused the other sisters, who lit their lamps and came hurrying to the scene to find her prostrate on the floor and foaming at the mouth. Thank heavens they managed to bring her round. She still cannot eat proper meals, which is why she thought of asking for some pickles. Since you were not in I felt I could hardly give her any on my own authority, so I explained where you were, said that I would mention it to you later, and sent her back to the Priory. I should have forgotten all about it if I hadnt heard you asking for pickles just now yourself. Xi-feng stared thoughtfully for a moment. Theres no shortage of pickles, she said at last. Send her some by all means. You can see Mr Qin in a day or two about the money. As she was speaking, Crimson came in to report the arrival of a messenger from Jia Lian. Business had detained him out of town, and he would not be back that night. This had received a perfunctory acknowledgement from Xi-feng, when suddenly there was a burst of crying from the back of the house and one of the junior maids came running breathlessly into the courtyard. Patience was already there and now several of the other maids gathered round and began whispering among themselves. Whats going on out there.? asked Xi-feng. One of the maids has had a bit of a fright, replied Patience. She says shes seen a ghost or something... Which maid? asked Xi-feng sharply. The maid in question entered the room. Whats all this nonsense about ghosts? asked Xi-feng. I was out at the back just now, maam, replied the maid, asking one of the women for more charcoal to put on the braziers, when I heard this eerie noise coming from that small empty building.
Though I - have -a son, she said it is as though I had none. Even if Pan wins this reprieve, his life is ruined. You are only my nephew, Ke, but you show much more sense than Pan. I can see that from now on I shall have to depend on you. Be sure to work hard and make the most of your life. And think of your bride-to-be, who comes from a family that has fallen on hard times. It is always hard when a daughter goes out into the world and gets married. One can only pray that her husband will turn out well and be capable of providing for her. Imagine if Xiu-yan were to turn out like this creature here... Gesturing in the direction of Xia Jin-guis room Aunt Xue continued But I dont want to talk about her. I know Xiu-yan to be an honest and thoughtful girl, thrifty and unspoilt. The sooner Pans business is settled the sooner we can get the two of you married and set my poor heart at rest. Dont forget that Bao-qin is still waiting to be married, Xue Ke reminded his aunt. I know how concerned you are about that. Dont-worry on our account. They stayed chatting together for a few minutes longer and then Xue Ke returned to his room. He ate his dinner and began to think about Xiu-yan in the Garden, forced by poverty t6 be so utterly dependent on the Jias. The two of them had travelled by the same boat on their original journey to the capital, and he had been able to see for himself that she was a pretty, good-natured girl. How unjust of destiny to give a creature like Xia Jin-gui a life of wealth and luxury and turn her int6 a spoilt shrew,- while for a girl like Xiu-yan there was nothing but hardship! What was in the mind of the Great Arbiter Yama when he made such a dispensation? These gloomy thoughts stirred Xue Ke to. express his sense of injustice in poetic form. His was a untutored pen, but he did as best he could. -1120 As the flood-dragon flounders on the shore, So our two hearts languish under like privations. When will we drink this bitter cup no more And soar unfettered through the constellations? He read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall. He felt a little self-conscious however, and thought to himself What if someone sees the and makes fun of me He read them through again. Oh who cares! I will put them up. I can read them anyway, to cheer myself up. A final reading made him change his mind yet again, however, and he slipped them between the pages of a bo6k. Im old enough for us to be married now, he mused to himself. But who could have foreseen this family crisis, and who knows when it will ever end? What an ordeal for a gentle girl like Xiu-yan! How lonely and wretched she must feel! At that moment the door was pushed open and Moonbeam came in carrying a round covered-tray and a jug of wine, which she deposited with a simpering smile on the table. He rose and asked her to be seated. Still smiling she said Four plates of sweetmeats and a small jug of wine, with Mrs Pans compliments, Master Ke. Its most kind of her, replied Ke, but surely she could have sent one of the younger maids? She didnt need to bother you, Miss Moonbeam. Oh Master Ke, theres no need to be so polite. Its all in the family after all... Mrs Pan knows what trouble youve been put to on account of Mr Pan, and shes been meaning for a long time to thank you herself but was afraid the others might take it the wrong way. In this household, as I think you know, sir, theres a lot goes on beneath the surface. People are only waiting to pounce on a little thing like a present, and then they start inventing all kinds of stories. Thats why shes been ever so slightly discreet and asked me to come over personally with these few things today when no one was looking... She gave Xue Ke a saucy smile and continued And please, no more of that Miss Moonbeam - it makes me feel most uncomfortable. We are only here to serve, and if we can serve Mr Pan, then why not you as well? Xue Ke was young and had a trusting nature. It was odd that Pans womenfolk should suddenly start treating him like this but Moonbeams explanation was a plausible one, he reflected. You can leave the sweetmeats, he said. "But take the wine back with you. Ive never been much of a drinker.
Finding Bao-chai unable to speak, her face bright red, her body burning hot to the touch, she immediately panicked and burst into tears. Bao-qin tried to comfort and support her aunt, while Caltrop was so affected by Bao-chais appearance that she could only stand by the bedside calling her name and weeping. Baochai was too weak to speak or move her hands. Her eyes were dry, her nose blocked. They sent for the doctor, whose prescription gradually brought her round and to the familys intense relief the immediate crisis seemed to have been averted. The news had already reached the various inner apartments of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions, and a maid soon arrived from Xi-fengs with one of her Ten Fragrances Revivifying Pills, followed by a maid with one of Lady Wangs Most Precious Pills. Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and all the ladies from both mansions including You-shi all sent maids to inquire how she was getting on, but all agreed that her illness should be kept a secret from Bao-yu. She went on taking various remedies for seven or eight days with no real improvement it was only when she remembered her own Cold Fragrance Pills and took three of these that she began to recover. By the time Bao-yu learnt of her illness, she was already better and he did not go to visit her. A letter arrived from Xue Ke, which Aunt Xue did not show to Bao-chai, for fear of upsetting her. She read it herself and went straight to Lady Wang to beg for her help, at the same time giving her an account of Bao-chais condition. After Aunt Xue had gone to bed, Lady Wang went in to plead with Jia Zheng. With the higher-ranking officials a word is usually sufficient but these provincials clearly need a more tangible incentive, he said somewhat grimly. We shall have to dip into our pockets. Lady Wang went on to talk of Bao-chai The poor girl! I feel responsible for her she is almost one of the family. The sooner she and Bao-yu are married the better. It is ruining her health the way things are. 1 agree, replied Jia Zheng. But her family are very disorganized at present. And besides, it is midwinter. New Year will soon be upon us, and we shall all be busy putting our affairs in order. 1 propose the following timetable the betrothal can take place sometime during the winter early next year they can exchange presents and the ceremony itself should be fixed for sometime after Mothers birthday. I should like you to put this to your sister. I will, replied Lady Wang. The next day she told Aunt Xue, who thought the proposal a good one. After lunch the two of them went to see Grandmother Jia. Have you just come over, my dear? inquired Grandmother Jia of Aunt Xue, after the usual courtesies had been exchanged. No, I was here yesterday, replied Aunt Xue. But as it was rather late, I was not able to come and pay my respects. Lady Wang repeated Jia Zhengs proposal to Grandmother Jia, who seemed very happy with it. While they were talking, Bao-yu came into the room. Have you had your lunch yet? asked his grandmother. Ive been home for lunch, he replied, and now Im on my way back to school. I called in. to see you, Grannie, and also I heard that Aunt Xue was here and wanted to pay my respects. Turning to Aunt Xue he continued Is Cousin Chai quite better now? Aunt Xue smiled. Yes she is. Bao-yu noticed that his arrival had caused a sudden lull in the conversation. After sitting with them for a few minutes, he also noticed that Aunt Xue was not being as affectionate towards him as usual, and mused to himself Even if shes not in a good mood, I dont see why they have to stop talking to me altogether... He set off for school greatly perplexed by what had happened. That evening on his return he paid his usual evening calls and made his way to the Naiads House. Lifting the door-curtain, he went in and was received by Nightingale. Seeing that there was no one in the inner room, he asked Nightingale where Dai-yu had gone, and was informed that she had gone to call on Grandmother Jia. Miss Lin heard that Mrs Xue was there, said Nightingale, and wanted to pay her respects. Havent you been there this evening, Master Bao? Yes, Ive just come from there, but I didnt see Miss Lin. Wasnt she there? No. Where could she have gone?
What is all this? Has someone done you wrong? If so, stand up, and tell me. It is something I shouldnt really say, but in the circumstances I feel I must. Well, tell me then. And take your time. You and Her Old Ladyship have made an excellent decision, in choosing Miss Bao-chai as Bao-yus future bride ... began Aroma. But, I wonder, maam, if you have noticed which of the two young ladies Bao-yu is more closely attached to, Miss Chai, or Miss Lin? As they have lived together since they were children, replied Lady Wang, I suppose he would be a little closer to Miss Lin. More than a little! protested Aroma, and went on to give Lady Wang a detailed history of how things had always stood between Bao-yu and Dai-yu, and of the various incidents that had occurred between them. These are all things that you would have seen for yourself, maam, she added, with the exception of his outburst during the summer, which I have not mentioned to a soul until now. Lady Wang drew Aroma towards her. Yes, most of what you have told me I have been able to deduce for myself. What you have said simply bears out my own observations. But you must all have heard the Masters words. Tell me, how did Bao-yu react? As things are at present, maam, Bao-yu smiles if someone talks to him, but otherwise he just sleeps. He heard nothing. In that case, what are we to do? It is not my place to say, replied Aroma. Your Ladyship should inform Her Old Ladyship of what I have said, and think of a suitable way of solving the problem. Then you had better go, said Lady Wang, and leave it to me. Now would not be a good moment to bring it up there are too many people in the room. I shall wait for an opportunity to tell Her Old Ladyship, and we will discuss what to do. Lady Wang returned to Grandmother Jias apartment. The old lady was talking to Xi-feng, and when she saw Lady Wang come in, asked What did Aroma want? What was all that mysterious whispering about? Lady Wang answered her directly, and told the whole story of Bao-yus love for Dai-yu, as Aroma had told it her. When she had finished, Grandmother Jia was silent for a long while. Neither Lady Wang nor Xi-feng dared say a word. At last, Grandmother Jia sighed and said Everything else seemed somehow soluble. It does not matter so much about Dai-yu. But if Bao-yu really feels this way about her, it seems we have run into an insoluble problem. Xi-feng looked very thoughtful for a minute, then said Not insoluble. I think I can see a solution. But I am not sure if you would agree to it or not, Aunt. Whatever your idea is, said Lady Wang, speak up and let Mother know. Then we can all discuss it together. There is only one solution that I can think of, said Xifeng. It involves two things a white lie, and a piece of discreet substitution. Substitution? What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia. First of all, replied Xi-feng, whether Bao-yu knows anything yet or not, we let it be known that Sir Zheng proposes to betroth him to Miss Lin. We must watch for his reaction. If he is quite unaffected, then there is no need to bother with my plan. But if he does seem at all pleased at the news, it will make things rather more complicated. Supposing he is pleased? asked Lady Wang. What then? Xi-feng went over and whispered at some length in Lady Wangs ear. Lady Wang nodded, smiled and said Well, well... An ingenious idea, I must say! Come on, you two! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Let me in on the secret what are you whispering about? Xi-feng was afraid that Grandmother J ia might not grasp her idea at once, and might inadvertently give the game away. She leant across and whispered in the old ladys ear. Grandmother Jia did seem rather puzzled at first. Xi-feng smiled, and added a few more words of explanation. Grandmother Jia finally said with a smile Why not? But isnt it rather hard on Bao-chai? And what about Miss Lin? What if she gets to hear of it? We shall only tell Bao-yu replied Xi-feng. No one else will be allowed to mention it. That way no one need know. A maid came in and informed them that Mr Lian had returned.
Bao-yu promptly untied his original from around his neck. But look, he said, theyre so different, how could I ever get them mixed up? That reminds me, Grannie, of something that happened the other night, as I was going to bed. I had just taken my jade off and hung it inside the bed-curtains, when I noticed a halo around it, and the whole inside of my bed was lit up with a rosy glow. You silly boy! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Theres red thread in your pelmet. That must have been the lamp-light showing through. But it couldnt have been. The lamps were all out and it was pitch-black in my room, and I still saw it glowing. Lady Xing and Lady Wang exchanged a meaningful smile. A certain rosy event had been much in the forefront of their minds recently. Xi-feng too could not restrain herself from remarking cryptically No doubt this heralds the Big Event... What big event? asked Bao-yu. Nothing you would understand, put in Grandmother Jia promptly. Now come along. Its been a hectic day for you, and you ought to go and rest, and not waste any more time here telling tall stories. Bao-yu stayed a minute or two longer and then returned to the Garden. When he was out of the room, Grandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang Well, have you been to see Mrs Xue, and put it to her yet? Yes Mother, we have, replied Lady Wang. Feng has been so busy with little Qiao-jie the last few days, and we just havent had a chance to go until today. Anyway, my sister seems very happy with the idea, but she says she will have to wait until Pan comes home before saying anything final. She must consult him first, as the eldest man in the family. Quite right, said Grandmother Jia. We shall have to bide our time until they have had a chance to talk it over. In the meantime, not a word of this to anyone. We must leave these matrimonial confabulations and accompany the unwitting subject of them, who on his arrival at Green Delights confided to Aroma Grannie and Feng were being most mysterious about something just now. I dont know whats going on. Aroma looked thoughtful for a moment. Ive no idea either, she finally returned, with a peculiar smile, adding as if it were an afterthought I wonder, was Miss Lin there when they were talking? Of course not! You know shes been ill and has to stay in. Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of Musk and Ripple having a tiff in the next room. What is the matter with you two? Aroma called out. Its all Ripples fault! replied Musk. Shes been cheating at cards! She took my money fast enough when she won, but now that Ive won she wont let go of a penny. And now Im cleaned right out! Oh come on! Bao-yu chided them with a laugh. Stop being so stupid! Who, wants to quarrel over a few coins? They both pouted and went off in high dudgeon, leaving Aroma. to settle Bao-yu down for the night. Now Aroma was sure that the mysterious conversation Bao-yu had referred to in some way concerned his betrothal. She had only feigned ignorance for fear that in his present mood, mention of such a touchy subject might provoke another of his fits. She herself was most anxious to know the latest news, and while she lay, awake that night she decided to go and see Nightingale first thing in the morning. Nightingale would be sure to know, and would be able to tell her what was going on. And so the next day she rose early, and after seeing Bao-yu off to school, completed her own toilet and strolled through the Garden to the Naiads House. Nightingale was out in the front courtyard picking flowers, and greeted her with a smile Hello, Aroma. Do come in and sit down. Thank you. Busy with your flowers, I see... How is Miss Lin? She has lust finished her toilet. Shes waiting for her medicine to be warmed up. Nightingale took Aroma inside. Dai-yu was reading a book, which provided Aroma with a ready-made topic of conversation. She gave an ingratiating smile Itd be a wonder if you didnt feel tired sometimes, Miss, reading at such an early hour. If Master Bao would only follow your good example! Dai-yu smiled wanly and put her book down. Meanwhile Snowgoose had come in with a small tray .containing two cups, one of medicine and one of water.
Hyperactivity of the liver Wood. The hepatic humour, unable to disperse naturally, has encroached upwards on the spleen Earth, with consequent loss of appetite. The extreme distemper has also caused a reversal of the elemental sequence, and the lungs Metal have certainly been damaged. Since humour cannot circulate, it has congealed into phlegm. Upsurge and expectoration of blood. TREATMENT -384 1. Sedation of liver. 2. Restoration of lungs. 3. Fortification of both heart and spleen. The usual tonics are too violent in their action. For the present, I suggest my own Black Ethereal Essence, to be taken with Elixir Pneumoferriferum. Prescriptions for both humbly appended for esteemed approval. The doctor wrote out a prescription of seven items and an adjuvant to go with it. Jia Lian took the paper and glanced down the list. I see you include Hares Ear in your prescription, he said. Forgive me if I am wrong, but I thought that was ruled out in haematic eruptions? You must be thinking, replied Doctor Wang with a knowledgeable smile, of its emetic properties, which, as is well known, contra-indicate this particular herb in cases of haemoptysis or epistaxis. But allow me to inform you that in preparation with Turtles Blood as in my prescription, Hares Ear constitutes the only effective remedy we have for draining the humour of the Lesser Yang periphery of the gall-bladder. You see, the judicious admixture of Turtles Blood has the remarkable effect of inhibiting the emetic properties of Hares Ear, while enabling it to restore the hepatic Yin and check the phlogistic disturbance. In the words of the Ars Medicandi "ObstruFta obstruit, aperitque aperta." And the - at first sight - paradoxical inclusion of Hares Ear is none other than the classic stratagem of the loyal counsellor befriending the usurper... I see, said Jia Lian, nodding appreciatively. Thank you for enlightening me, Doctor Wang. The doctor continued I should like the young lady to take two doses of the decoction, and then we shall see whether to alter the prescription, or perhaps try a new one altogether. I have another appointment, so I hope youll excuse me. I shall call again another day. As Jia Lian saw him out, he asked And what have you prescribed for my cousin? Oh theres very little the matter with him. Another dose of the dispersant I have prescribed should put him right. With these words Doctor Wang stepped into his carriage. Jia Lian dispatched a servant to purchase the various drugs needed and went in to inform Xi-feng of Dai-yus diagnosis. They had not been talking long when Zhou Ruis wife arrived to consult Xi-feng about a few trivial details of domestic management. After listening for a while, Jia Lian rose to leave. Carry on, Mrs Zhou, I must be going. With Jia Lian out of the room, and all remaining household business soon disposed of, Zhou Ruis wife was able to come to the real purpose of her visit. Ive just come from Miss Lins, maam. I dont like the look of it at all! Theres not a spot of colour left in her cheeks, and to touch her shes nothing but skin and bones. I tried asking her what the matter was, but she wouldnt speak, just sat there crying. Before I left, Nightingale asked if you could advance them a couple of months allowance. She said that with Miss Lin so ill, and her so proud anyway about not being beholden to a soul for anything, shed made bold to ask about it herself. The medicine Miss Lin is taking goes on the general account of course, but she said they might be needing some extra money for incidental expenses. I said Id mention it to you, maam. Xi-feng lowered her head for a moment, then replied Oh very well, Ill sen4 her a few taels to be going on with. Theres no need to tell Miss Lin though. Im against advances on principle. If one person starts well never hear the end of it. Do you remember the scene Mrs Zhao and Miss Tan-chun had about this very question? Besides, as you know, with so many expenses and so little coming in to pay for them, things are extremely tight at present. After a pause, she continued Some people are under the illusion that its all caused by bad management on my part. Some even have the nerve to suggest that I am lining the Wang nest at the Jia familys expense. But you know better, my dear Mrs Zhou. Youve seen far too much of what really goes on to pay any attention to such gossip.
The Apertura lamented the fact that those who rejected the Hedonist Doctrine of Yanxius Yanxianam ilam Voluptatis Doctrinam were still unable to find the True Path of Confucian Orthodoxy Orthodoxiae Confucianae Veram Viam, but were instead blindly drawn into the fold of that prevalent and deplorable Mician Heresy of Universal Love Micianam illam Caritatis Universae Heterodoxiam. Nicely put, Jia Zheng commented, and continued reading. A little further on he paused. Tell me, he asked, evidently impressed by what he read, did you write this unaided? Yes sir. He nodded pensively. Nothing brilliant about it of course, but for a first attempt not at all bad, I must say. Ah, Mencius! I recall how during my tour of duty as an examiner I had occasion to set as one of my Themes "Soi Nobilitatis Sapientiaeque Alumni suntpotis". All the first-degree candidates, I regret to say, had their heads crammed full of the standard compositions on the Theme, and not a single one of them could come up with anything original. All plagiarisms. Are you familiar with the quotation? -768 Yes sir. Mencius, Book One, Part Two "Only Good Breeding and a Heritage of Culture have the power to sustain a man in the face of Adversity" Good, replied Jia Zheng. I should like you to show me what you can do. Something of your own, please, not another feat of memorization. An Apertura will do. -768 Bao-yu lowered his head in concentration and began racking his brains for a pithy opening phrase, while Jia Zheng stood thoughtfully in the doorway, hands clasped behind his back. Just at that moment, a diminutive pageboy went flashing past. As he caught sight of the Master in the doorway, he froze, his body slightly inclined, his arms hanging limp at his side. What is your errand, boy? asked Jia Zheng brusquely. Please, sir, Mrs Xue has just arrived at Her Old Ladyships and Mrs Lian has sent me with special instructions to the kitchen, sir, jabbered the unfortunate boy. Jia Zheng made no reply, and he fled. -768 Now Bao-yu assumed that if Aunt Xue had come over for a visit, then Bao-chai whom he had greatly missed since her departure from the Garden was sure to have come with her. His excitement at the thought of seeing her again spurred him on. Sir, he ventured, I have a draft Apertura for your approval. Go ahead. Bao-yu intoned his opening sentence Non omnes Sapientiae Alumni sunt, neque possunt carere Stabili Patrimonjo. Jia Zheng nodded. Thank you. That will do for today. In future, please bear in mind these two Golden Rules for Composition. Before raising your brush, always be certain of the sequence of your Dispositio and the clarity of your Inventio. Tell me, was your grandmother aware that I sent for you? Yes sir. Off you go then. You had better go over and see her now. Sir! Bao-yu manoeuvred his way backwards out of the study and set off along the covered way, imitating to perfection the scholars leisurely gait. As soon as he reached the moon-gate, however, and had placed its large protective screen between himself and the study, he broke into a run and raced ahead towards Grandmother Jias apartment. Careful you dont trip! Tealeaf shouted after him. The Masters coming. Bao-yu was much too excited to pay any attention. As he neared the entrance to Grandmother Jias apartment, he could hear the sounds of conversation and laughter coming from within. He could make out, among others, the voices of Lady Wang, Xi-feng and Tan-chun. When the maids saw him coming, they quickly drew aside the portiere and whispered in his ear as he passed through Mrs Xue is here, you know. Bao-yu hurried in to greet his aunt, and then paid his respects to Grandmother Jia. He gave her a full account of his interview with Jia Zheng, and her face radiated pride and delight. Wheres Cousin Chai? he asked, turning to the assembled company. She couldnt come with me today, said Aunt Xue, with a rather unconvincing smile. She and Caltrop have a lot of sewing to catch up on at home. Bao-yu was very disappointed, and only a sense of duty kept him from leaving at once. Dinner was served and Grandmother Jia and Aunt Xue sat up at the table of honour, while Tan-chun and the others took their places down below.
Her voice tailed off. She stared at Dai-yu, laughed and continued Then, as soon as those two are married, they are going to find a husband for you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu was speechless with horror. The maid went on regardless But how was I to know that theyd decided to keep it quiet, for fear of embarrassing Miss Chai? All I did was say to Aroma, that serves in Master Baos room "Wont it be a fine to-do here soon, when Miss Chai comes over, or Mrs Bao... what will we have to call her? Thats all I said. What was there in that to hurt sister Pearl? Can you see, Miss Lin? She came across and hit me straight in the face and said I was talking rubbish and disobeying orders, and would be dismissed from service! How was I to know their Ladyships didnt want us to mention it? Nobody told me, and she just hit me! She started sobbing again. Dai-yus heart felt as though oil, soy-sauce, sugar and vinegar had all been poured into it at once. She could not tell which flavour predominated, the sweet, the sour, the bitter or the salty. After a few moments silence, she said in a trembling voice Dont talk such rubbish. Any more of that, and youll be beaten again. Off you go! She herself turned back in the direction of the Naiads House. Her body felt as though it weighed a hundred tons, her feet were as wobbly as if she were walking on cotton-floss. She could only manage one step at a time. After an age, she still had not reached the bank by Drenched Blossoms Bridge. She was going so slowly, with her feet about to collapse beneath her, and in her giddiness and confusion had wandered off course and increased the distance by about a hundred yards. She reached Drenched Blossoms Bridge only to start drifting back again along the bank in the direction she ha4 just come from, quite unaware of what she was doing. Nightingale had by now returned with the handkerchief, but could not find Dai-yu anywhere. She finally saw her, pale as snow, tottering along, her eyes staring straight in front of her, meandering in circles. Nightingale also caught sight of a maid disappearing in the distance beyond Dai-yu, but could not make out who it was. She was most bewildered, and quickened her step. Why are you turning back again, Miss? she asked softly. Where are you heading for? Dai-yu only heard the blurred outline of this question. She replied I want to ask Bao-yu something. Nightingale could not fathom what was going on, and could only try to guide her on her way to Grandmother Jias apartment. When they came to the entrance, Dai-yu seemed to feel clearer in mind. She turned, saw Nightingale supporting her, stopped for a moment, and asked What are you doing here? I went to fetch your handkerchief, replied Nightingale, smiling anxiously. I saw you over by the bridge and hurried across. I asked you where you were going, but you took no notice. Oh! said Dai-yu with a smile. I thought you had come to see Bao-yu. What else did we come here for? Nightingale could see that her mind was utterly confused. She guessed that it was something that the maid had said in the garden, and only nodded with a faint smile in reply to Dai-yus question. But to herself she was trying to imagine what sort of an encounter this was going to be, between the young master who had already lost his wits, and her young mistress who was now herself a little touched. Despite her apprehensions, she dared not prevent the meeting, and helped Dai-yu into the room. The funny thing was that Dai-yu now seemed to have recovered her strength. She did not wait for Nightingale but raised the portiere herself, and walked into the room. It was very quiet inside. Grandmother Jia had retired for her afternoon nap. Some of the maids had sneaked off to play, some were having forty winks themselves and others had gone to wait on Grandmother Jia in her bedroom. It was Aroma who came out to see who was there, when she heard the swish of the portiere. Seeing that it was Dai-yu, she greeted her politely Please come in and sit down, Miss. Is Master Bao at home? asked Dai-yu with a smile. Aroma did not know that anything was amiss, and was about to answer, when she saw Nightingale make an urgent movement with her lip from behind Dai-yus back, pointing to her mistress and making a warning gesture with her hand.
Dai-yu and Xiang-yun laughed when they saw that the pavilion was in darkness. Theyve gone to sleep. Never mind. All the better. Lets sit outside here on the covered verandah and look at the moonlight on the water. They found a couple of drum-shaped bamboo stools to sit down on. A great white moon in the water reflected the great white moon above, competing with it in brightness. The girls felt like mermaids sitting in a shining crystal palace beneath the sea. A little wind that brushed over the surface of the water making tiny ripples seemed to cleanse their souls and fill them with buoyant lightness. If only I were in a boat now, with some wine to drink! said Xiang-yun. If this were my own home, I should jump into a boat now immediately. Theres an old saying Who seeks perfection must abandon joy, said Dai-yu. If you ask me, I think we are very well the way we are. Why do we have to be in a boat to enjoy this? Xiang-yun laughed. 516 One conquest breeds appetite for another. That applies to most of us, you know, not only to generals. While she was speaking, a flute began to play. They listened for some moments to its plaintive rise and fail. Grandma and Aunt Wang are obviously enjoying themselves, said Dai-yu, smiling. The flute is a very happy touch. We shall put it to our own purposes, you and I. It shall inspire our verse. We both like pentameters, dont we? Lets do linked pentameters as we did on that other occasion. What rhyme? said Xiang-yun. We could use a number for a rhyme, said Dai-yu. Lets count the uprights in the railing as far as that angle over there. Whatever the number is shall be our rhyme. Thats a very ingenious idea, said Xiang-yun. The two girls got up and walked along the railing to count. It turned out that there were exactly eight posts from one angle of the railing to the next. Hmn, said Xiang-yun. Eight. I wonder how far we shall get with that rhyme. The danger with this sort of thing always is that after a time the rhyming becomes forced - or else one simply cant go on at all. Well, you begin. Id like to have been able to see afterwards which of us had done better, said Dai-yu, but unfortunately we havent got anything to write with. Ill write it out tomorrow, said Xiang-yun. I may not be very clever, but Ive got a reasonably good memory. All right, said Dai-yu. Ill start with something very prosy and obvious. -1344 DAI-YU -534 Fifteenth night of the Eighth, Mid-Autumn moon - -384 Xiang-yun thought a bit before following. -1344 XIANG-YUN Whose joys the First Full Moons do emulate, -534 Under your crystal-constellation heaven - -1344 DAI-TU -534 The sounds of music everywhere pulsate. At many a hoard the reckless winecups fly - 517 Ha! I like the reckless winecups, said Xiang-yun. I must try to do them justice. Let me see. She thought for a bit. -1344 XIANG-YUN -384 Where friends are met your feast to celebrate. The air is crisp, the wind more bracing blows You finished the couplet very well, said Dai-yu, but that second line is a bit weak, isnt it? Weve got a long way to go and the rhyming will soon begin to get harder, said Xiang-yun. I want to save up any good ideas I may have until later. Mind you produce some good lines later then, said Dai-yu. Otherwise you are going to look pretty silly! She proceeded to finish the couplet. -1344 DAI-YU -534 In the clear sky the cold stars scintillate. -384 Grey hairs are mocked when they for cakes dispute - I dont like that line, said Xiang-yun. It sound like an allusion, but I think you have just made it up to confuse me. That shows you dont read much, said Dai-yu. Its a perfectly good allusion. Theres a story about quarrelling over cakes in the Official history of the Tang Dynasty. Ill show you it tomorrow. Well, anyway, Im not going to be confused, said Xiang yun. I can cap that line. -1344 XIANG-YUN Green girls divide the melons, eight and eight. New scents the jade-like cassia have enriched - Now that really is a bogus allusion, said Dai-yu.
ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself principally to Zhou Rui Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start fighting all over again? And as if that wasnt bad enough, you have to drag in this brat of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you disappear and leave them to it! He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks. Its no good punishing only him, said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia Lian sat down to discuss family business. In the servants quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhens part to cover up for incompetence others said he was just inept at handling people while others saw it as yet another instance of his unpleasant character. Wasnt it he who recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? Whats probably happened is that Bao Ers wife wont oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so now hes taken it out on the husband... There were many differing interpretations. Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zhengs promotion at the Ministry of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out, but went around promising work to contractors and negotiating percentages for himself, and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to the apartment of his erstwhile patroness. Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in a temper and beating the servants, was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story from him. It may all have been over a trifle, she commented, but we must put a stop to such behaviour at all costs. If they think they can get away with it now, when the family fortunes are supposed to be flourishing, what is going to happen when the younger generation takes over? Theyll have a mutiny on their hands. I remember a year or so ago witnessing the most appalling scene at Ning-guo House - Big Jiao sprawled all over the steps, blind drunk and swearing sixteen to the dozen. None of us was spared. I dont care if he has rendered distinguished services in the past. Servants should know their place, and show a proper sense of respect. The trouble with Cousin Zhens wife - please dont misunderstand me - is that she is much too unsuspecting and lets her staff get away with anything. This Bao Er of theirs - or whatever his name is - is typical. Come to think of it, hasnt he been rather useful to you and Zhen in the past? Arent you being a bit ungrateful to start flogging him now? Stung to the quick, Jia Lian sheepishly tried to change the subject. Presently he remembered a pressing engagement and left. Crimson now came in to report the arrival of Jia Yun. I wonder what hes after this time? mused Xi-feng to herself. Then aloud to Crimson Youd better show him in. Crimson went out. She looked Jia Yun in the face and gave him a cheeky smile. He swift on the uptake as ever advanced towards her and said Did you tell Mrs Lian that I was here, Miss Crimson? She blushed. I suppose you have a lot of important business, Mr Yun... On the contrary, I only wish I had had cause to come here and trouble you more often, Miss Crimson... I remember last year when you were employed at Uncle Baos He was about to say more but Crimson, who was afraid someone might interrupt them, asked in haste Did you ever get my handkerchief? Her words provoked Jia Yun to such a pitch of excitement that he was ready to burst. But before he could say a word a maid came out from Xi-fengs room, and he and Crimson were obliged to go in together at once. They walked side by side, close enough for him to whisper When I leave, be sure to see me out. Ive something to tell you that might amuse you... She blushed fiercely and flashed her eyes at him without a word. Going ahead to inform Xi-feng of his approach, she returned to usher him in, lifting the door-curtain and beckoning to him, while announcing in her most formal tone of voice Madam will be pleased to see you now, sir. With a smile Jia Yun advanced with her into the room and greeted Xi-feng. He conveyed his mothers regards, which Xi-feng returned politely before asking And what brings you here today?
I thought Id better put you on your guard in case he asks to see you tomorrow about anything. 436 She turned and hurried out again as soon as she had finished speaking. Aroma told someone to run after her and ask her to stay for a cup of tea, but she was afraid of being shut inside the Garden when they closed the gate, and insisted on going back immediately. Bao-yu knew that in Aunt Zhaos twisted imagination he was regarded as an enemy, and though he did not know what she had said, the mere fact that she had been talking about him was enough to make him feel uncomfortable all over, much as Monkey did when he heard Tripitaka reciting the spell for tightening the iron band round his head. After giving the matter some thought, he concluded that the only practical way in which he could prepare himself for the morrow would be by revising his texts. Should his father take it into his head to test him, he reasoned, then if only he could be word-perfect in his texts, it would not be so difficult to bluff his way through whatever else he might ask him. Having made the decision, he hurriedly threw a gown over his shoulders and prepared to begin some revision, bitterly regretting that Jia Zhengs silence on the subject of lessons since his last return from duty had lulled him into a false sense of security. I ought to have had more sense, he told himself. One really ought to do a little bit every day, to keep in practice. He began to reckon up how much he could still recite from memory. He found that there was little more than The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean and the two halves of the Analects that he could be absolutely sure of. The first half of Mencius he knew reasonably well, but certainly not well enough to be able to carry on from any sentence given him at random. The second half was virtually terra incognita. Of the Five Classics he was fairly familiar with the Poetry Classic because he was frequently having to read bits of it in connection with his own versifying. Though far from word-perfect, he probably knew it well enough to scrape through a test. He could not remember any of the other classics at all but fortunately his father had so far never asked him to study them, so probably it would not matter. When it came to Old Style Prose, the case was rather different. Over the past few years he had read extracts from the Zuo, Gong-yang and Gu-liang 437 commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals and various Han and Tang pieces, but he had only dipped into them as the fancy took him he had not done any serious work on them. There was certainly no question of his being able to remember them. There was even less likelihood of his being able to pass muster on the Examination Essay. He had always detested this style of writing in any case. The Sage himself didnt write that way, he argued, so how could one hope to expound the inner meaning of his teachings through such a medium? It was no more than a device used by vulgar fortune-seekers for starting themselves off on the golden road to success. Before he left, Jia Zheng had selected a hundred of these essays for him to read but Bao-yu had only glanced at them occasionally, reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there as some particularly felicitous expression or the extravagance, humour or melancholy of the writer happened to catch his attention. He had never settled down to the serious analytical examination of even a single essay. He began to revise but the trouble was that whatever he revised now, he was sure to be asked about something else next day, and the whole night would not be long enough to revise everything. It soon became apparent that all he was succeeding in doing was getting himself into an even worse state of nerves than he had been in to begin with and, while studying to no purpose himself, preventing a whole roomful of girls from sleeping as well. Aroma and the other senior maids could at least occupy themselves by trimming his lamp, pouring him cups of tea and so forth but the younger ones could neither go to bed nor find any employment to keep themselves awake, and sat about the place, drooping and nodding in various attitudes of fatigue. Skybright became indignant. Lazy little wretches! You sleep all day as it is. Just for once in your lives you are asked to stay up late, and look at you! If you dont liven yourselves up a bit, I shall come and stick pins in you all! As she said this, there was a loud bang from the outer room. It turned out to have been caused by a little maid who had dozed off while sitting on the kang and in doing so had 438 bumped her head against the partition. Waking with a start just as Skybright was uttering this threat, she assumed that the bump on the head she had just received must have been dealt her by Skybright.
Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly. Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I havent got that sort of gauze in my windows so though rosy-misted casement is a great improvement, I dont think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would be a bit presumptuous. But why? said Dai-yu, smiling. My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to lend furs and horses and feel no resentment when they came back the worse for wear. And that was to mere acquaintances we two are members of the same family. I agree with you that one ought to share with ones friends, said Bao-yu, and not only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them. But for a mere male to arrogate to himself what properly belongs to you girls would be quite a different matter. It would be better to alter young man and maiden and let it be your elegy. After all, you were always very well-disposed towards Skybright. Id rather give the elegy to someone else than throw away your rosy-misted casement. Lets make it The mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted And the maid beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated. I should be very happy to alter it in that way, even though it would mean that the elegy would cease to have anything to do with me. 584 She wasnt my maid, said Dai-yu. It doesnt make sense. Besides, mistress and maid are such an unpoetical combination. I might want to use this version when Nightingale is dead, but that wont be for a long while yet, I imagine. Come now, its not very nice to talk about Nightingale dying, said Bao-yu, laughing. You started it, said Dai-yu. I know what, said Bao-yu. Ive got a still better solution. Why dont we just say I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated? Dai-yu momentarily changed colour yet though the words filled her with an almost unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded approvingly at his suggestion. Yes, thats a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. Im sure you must have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xings place first thing tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Yings betrothal has been decided on. I expect they want you there for the ceremony. Whats the hurry? said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. Ive not been feeling particularly well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow. How typical! said Dai-yu. I should try to grow out of these childish ways if I were you. You are getting too old- She broke off in a fit of coughing. Bao-yu at once became concerned about her. Theres a nasty wind here. I dont know why we are standing around in the cold like this. Wed better be getting back now. Theres no sense in making ourselves ill. I ought to be going back now in any case, said Dai-yu. Its time I went to bed. Well see each other again tomorrow. She began to walk away. Bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction. Suddenly it occurred to him that 585 Dai-yu was unaccompanied and he told the little maid to run after her and see her back to her apartment. Back at Green Delights he found some old women with a message from his mother. It was as Dai-yu had said. He was to go over first thing next morning to his Uncle Shes house. The family that Jia She was proposing to marry his daughter into was called Sun. They were a Da-tong family whose menfolk had all, for several generations, been Army officers. A former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the Ning and Rong brothers, so their claim to a special relationship with the Jia family was a strong One. Only one member of the family was at present living in the capital, a young man called Sun Shao-zu who had been given the post of Military Provost in the metropolitan garrison as an hereditary entitlement.
The doctor was called in and medicines were prescribed, but they seemed to do her no good. Meanwhile Jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband. Sometimes, when drink had made him bold, Xue Pan would try to assert himself. Once or twice he went for her with a cudgel or a knife but Jin-gui only offered him her body to belabour, or stretched her neck out and defied him to do his worst and of course he could not he could only bluster. This soon became the established pattern of their quarrels. The only result of it was that Jin-guis power over her husband grew all the stronger. At this point Jin-gui began directing her attention on Moonbeam, picking on her and finding fault with her. But Moonbeam was made of more inflammable stuff than Caltrop. Up to now she and Xue Pan had got on together so swimmingly that she had all but dismissed Jin-gui from her mind. Finding herself now under attack from that quarter, she was unwilling to yield an inch and gave back as good as she got. When, after a few slanging-matches, Jin-gui grew really angry and began not only to curse her but to lay hands on her as well, she did not quite dare to return blow for blow, but she put on a fine display of hysteria, shrieking, rolling about on the floor and threshing about with her limbs. Thereafter she was constantly threatening suicide, and at any hour of the day or night they might have to snatch knives or scissors from her grasp or take down the noose which she had fastened for herself over a beam. Between the two of them Xue Pan was driven half distracted. He could only look on helplessly while they quarrelled, until finally the rumpus got too much for him and he would slip out of the house and take refuge elsewhere. 606 Sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling, if she was feeling cheerful, Jin-gui would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards. She was inordinately fond of gnawing bones, especially the bones of fowls. To satisfy this craving she had ducks and chickens killed every day. The meat she gave to other people it was only the bones, crisp-fried in boiling fat, that she kept for herself, to nibble with her wine. Sometimes, if the bone she was gnawing was giving her trouble and she grew impatient, she would swear like a trooper. That ponce and his poxy strumpet seem to enjoy themselves, she would say self-pityingly. Why cant I get any enjoyment? Aunt Xue and Bao-chai no longer attempted to intervene. Now they could only sit in their own room and weep in silence while they listened to the profanities next door. Xue Pan was helpless. He bitterly regretted the brief madness which had led him to chain himself to this demon wife. Soon everyone in the two mansions, both masters and servants, had heard about the Xues predicament and all felt sorry for them. -1094 By this time Bao-yus hundred days of convalescence had ended and he was allowed to go out. One of the first things he did was to call on Jin-gui. There was nothing exceptionable in her behaviour or appearance on the occasion when he saw her she seemed to be just the same sort of delicate, flowerlike creature as all the other girls. How did so beautiful a person come to have so appalling a character? It was a mystery which continued to occupy him for some time after the visit. When, a few days later, he called in to wish his mother good morning, his visit happened to coincide with that of Ying-chuns nurse. She brought distressing news about Sun Shao-zus behaviour. Whenever she is on her own, the young mistress does nothing but cry, said the woman. Shes longing for you to send for her so that she can enjoy a day or two of freedom. Ive been meaning for some days to send for her, said 607 Lady Wang, but so many disagreeable things have been happening lately that I keep forgetting. Bao-yu spoke to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day. Tomorrow is a good day, according to the calendar. We will send for her tomorrow. Just then a servant arrived from Grandmother Jias with a message for Bao-yu. He was to go first thing next morning to the Tian Qi Temple to burn incense in payment of a vow she had made for his recovery. Eager for outings after his long confinement, he was hardly able to sleep that night for excitement. Next day he rose at dawn, and as soon as he had washed and dressed, set off by carriage, accompanied by two or three old nannies, and drove through the West Gate of the city to the Tian Qi Temple outside the walls.
When he got there be found Jia Zheng already sipping his wheatmeal tea and 551 apparently in very good humour. Bao-yu made his morning salutation to his parents after which he in turn was greeted by Jia Huan and Jia Lan. Jia Zheng ordered the three of them to sit down and drink their wheatmeal tea. Bao-yu is not as diligent as you two in his schoolwork, he told the two younger boys, but he is much better than you at making up poems and couplets. No doubt all three of you will be called upon to contribute poems at this place we are going to. Bao-yu will have to help you out a bit. This was music indeed in the ears of Lady Wang, who had never before heard her husband praise Bao-yu in such terms. She waited until Jia Zheng and the boys had gone before getting up to make her morning call on Grandmother Jia but before she could get away, Parfumees foster-mother and two of the other foster-mothers came in saying that there was something they wished to speak to her about. Ever since Your Ladyship was good enough to let me take Parfumee home with me, said Parfumees foster-mother, shes been refusing to eat and drink and behaving like a crazy girl, and now Nenuphar and Etamine are the same. The three of them have been carrying on something dreadful, threatening to kill themselves and I dont know what. All they want, they say, is to shave their hair off and become nuns. Well, I thought, theyre only children after a day or two theyll get over this. But not a bit of it two days have gone by already and theyre worse than ever. Neither words nor blows have an effect on them. Were all at our wits end. Weve come to ask Your Ladyship if you will either let them have their way and go into a convent or else deal with them as you see fit and hand them over to somebody else, because we can do nothing with them. Nonsense! said Lady Wang impatiently. Its not for them to decide what is to become of them. The Buddhist vocation is not to be undertaken on a mere childish caprice. Give each of them a flogging and see if they misbehave then! It was the custom for nuns from the various temples which the Jia ladies patronized to visit the mansion over the MidAutumn festival bringing the first-fruits of their offerings. Euergesia, the prioress of Water-moon Priory, who had come 552 -374 along with the rest, had been invited to stay on for a few days and happened to be at hand during this interview. This holy old fraud pricked her ears up when she heard of three young persons wanting to become nuns. A few young novices to wait on her and help about the priory were just what she was looking for. She set to work on Lady Wang accordingly. No doubt it is because this is such a blessed household thanks to all Your Ladyships good works that these young peoples hearts have been turned towards the faith, she said. It is true that the Buddhas gate is not to be entered lightly but it is also written that the Buddhas truth is for all sorts and conditions of men. And not only men, for when the Blessed Lord made his vow, it was to work for the salvation of all sentient beings. These three young people have no parents and are far from the place where they were born. Having had a taste of luxury during their years here with you, yet being born to a lowly fate and trained in a profession that at best is vanity, they cannot but tremble when they think what the future may hold for them. I believe that is why, out of the midst of this sea of suffering, they have turned towards the light and resolved to abjure the world and its vanities and prepare themselves for the life to come. That is a noble decision, Your Ladyship. I dont think you ought to stand in the way of it. Lady Wang was a good woman at heart and had only opposed the young actresses determination to become nuns because she thought it proceeded from mere childish waywardness and feared that when put to the test they would find the vows of celibacy and abstinence too much for them and fall into mortal sin. But what the old nun said sounded plausible and besides, she was at this moment very much preoccupied with other matters. Lady Xing had sent someone over to say that she wanted Ying-chun to spend a few days with her so that she could be exhibited to the representatives of a family seeking her in marriage, and Lady Wang herself was facing a visit from an official match-maker who was coming to discuss the matrimonial prospects of Tan-chun.
Better get rid of him. Out of my sight! he barked. Then turning from Bao Er to Zhou Rui That is all. Carry on with your work. The two servants left. Not long afterwards Cousin Zhen was resting in the study when he heard the most terrific din break out in the direction of the main gate. He sent a servant to inquire, who came back to report that a fight had started between Bao Er and an adopted son of Zhou Ruis. Who is this adopted son? asked Cousin Zhen. He San is his name, sir, replied the servant. A worthless fellow who spends most of his time drinking and causing trouble. He sometimes comes round here and hangs about in the porters lodge. Apparently he got involved in the argument between Bao Er and Zhou Rui. This is the limit! exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Have Bao Er and this He San character bound immediately! What about Zhou Rui? He disappeared when the fighting started, sir. Find him at once! This is preposterous! Yes, sir! In the midst of this commotion, Jia Lian returned and Cousin Zhen told him what had happened in his absence. What next! cried Lian. He sent an extra servant to help apprehend Zhou Rui, who soon realized that escape was impossible, gave himself up and was led before the masters. Tie him up as well! ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself principally to Zhou Rui Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start fighting all over again? And as if that wasnt bad enough, you have to drag in this brat of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you disappear and leave them to it! He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks. Its no good punishing only him, said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia Lian sat down to discuss family business. In the servants quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhens part to cover up for incompetence others said he was just inept at handling people while others saw it as yet another instance of his unpleasant character. Wasnt it he who recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? Whats probably happened is that Bao Ers wife wont oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so now hes taken it out on the husband... There were many differing interpretations. Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zhengs promotion at the Ministry of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out, but went around promising work to contractors and negotiating percentages for himself, and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to the apartment of his erstwhile patroness. Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in a temper and beating the servants, was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story from him. It may all have been over a trifle, she commented, but we must put a stop to such behaviour at all costs. If they think they can get away with it now, when the family fortunes are supposed to be flourishing, what is going to happen when the younger generation takes over? Theyll have a mutiny on their hands. I remember a year or so ago witnessing the most appalling scene at Ning-guo House - Big Jiao sprawled all over the steps, blind drunk and swearing sixteen to the dozen. None of us was spared. I dont care if he has rendered distinguished services in the past. Servants should know their place, and show a proper sense of respect. The trouble with Cousin Zhens wife - please dont misunderstand me - is that she is much too unsuspecting and lets her staff get away with anything. This Bao Er of theirs - or whatever his name is - is typical. Come to think of it, hasnt he been rather useful to you and Zhen in the past? Arent you being a bit ungrateful to start flogging him now? Stung to the quick, Jia Lian sheepishly tried to change the subject. Presently he remembered a pressing engagement and left. Crimson now came in to report the arrival of Jia Yun. I wonder what hes after this time? mused Xi-feng to herself. Then aloud to Crimson Youd better show him in. Crimson went out.
Will it come up? Will it... He thought he recognized the voice of Li Wans cousin, Li Wen. Then came a laugh There! Its gone! You see, I told you it wouldnt bite! There was no mistaking Tan-chuns voice. Of course it wont if you keep moving about like that, Wen! Look! Its going to! The last two voices were those of Li Wens younger sister Qi, and Lady Xings niece Xiu-yan. Such an opportunity was altogether too tempting. Picking a brickbat from the ground, Bao-yu lobbed it into the water right in front of the four girls. There was a resounding splash and they jumped for their lives, with cries of What the. .. Whos that trying to give us a scare? Of all the mean. A beaming Bao-yu sprang from his hiding-place. Having a lovely time, are you? And why wasnt I invited, pray? It was Tan-chun who replied Typical! I knew it! That had "Bao-yu" written all over it! Well Im not going to waste my breath scolding you, just hurry up and catch us another fish to make up for that one. It was practically on the hook when you had to come along and scare it away. Not likely! said Bao-yu with a grin. Here you are on a fishing excursion and leaving me out - its you who owe me a penalty! Everyone laughed. I know, he went on. As were all fishing today, why dont we try a round of "Fateful Fish"? Its very simple.If you catch a fish it means a year of good luck, and if you dont a year of bad luck. Come on, whos going to have first go? Tan-chun offered the rod to Li Wen, but she declined. Oh well, said Tan-chun, it looks as if Ill have to start. She turned to Bao-yu. If you scare mine away again, brother, youll be for it. I only wanted to make you all jump. Youll be perfectly safe this time, I promise. Tan-chun cast her line, and in just a few seconds a little leaf-wriggler swallowed the hook and down went the float. She pulled in and landed her catch, alive and jumping. Scribe, after a lot of scrambling about, managed to get a grip on the thing, and carrying it over in both hands, placed it carefully in a little earthenware jar of fresh water. Tan-chun passed the rod on to Wen. She too felt a tug on the line almost immediately, and pulled in excitedly, only to find nothing on the hook. She cast out again, and this time stood there angling for ages. At last the line tautened and she pulled in again. Another false alarm. She picked up the hook to examine it, and discovered that it was buckled. No wonder I couldnt catch anything! She laughed and without more ado told Candida to straighten it out for her, put on some fresh bait and fasten on the reed-float securely. This time after only a few minutes, down went the float, in she pulled with great determination, and there it was - a little two-inch silver carp. Delighted, she turned to Bao-yu. You next. Qi and Xiu-yan must go first, replied Bao-yu. I insist. Xiu-yan was silent. You go first, Cousin Bao, protested Qi. As she spoke a big bubble popped on the water. Come On! cried Tan-chun. Theres no need to overdo it. Look, the fish are all over there by you, Qi. You have a go quickly! -384 Qi took the rod with a giggle of embarrassment. Sure enough, down went her float and she had a catch first time. Xiu-yan was the last of the girls to have her turn. She caught one and passed the rod back to Tan-chun, who handed it on to Bao-yu. I shall follow in the footsteps of old Sire Jiang, he declared. Straight was his hook, His bait a single grain Yet of their own accord The fish unto him came... -384 Walking solemnly down the jetty, he sat at the waters edge in the pose of the Fisherman Sage. Unfortunately, at the approach of this human shadow, the fish took refuge in the far end of the pond, and for all his exertions in the higher art of angling, a long time seemed to pass without the slightest sign of a bite. When once a fish did venture near and deigned to blow a few bubbles near the bank, he jerked the rod and scared it away.
A sort of blankness came over him. Chess had gone. Picture had gone. Parfumee and the other four little actresses had gone. Skybright was dead. Now, it seemed, Bao-hai and her lot had gone, too. And though Ying-chun was supposed to have left only temporarily, to judge from the number of visits made by match-makers during the past weeks, it would riot be very long before she was getting married. The Gardens little society was breaking up. Oh well, he thought, no good fretting about it now. Ill go and enjoy Dai-yus company for a while and after that, Ive still got Aroma to go back to. It looks as if we three will soon be the only ones left. In that philosophical frame of mind he went back to the Naiads House but Dai-yu had still not returned. Just as he was wondering where else he could go, a maid from Lady Wangs apartment came up to him with a message from his mother. 565 The Masters back now and wants to see you. He says hes got a good subject for a poem and you are to come at once. Bao-yu was obliged to accompany the girl to his mothers apartment but by the time he got there, his father had already gone. Lady Wang ordered some of her women to accompany him to his fathers study outside. He found Jia Zheng discussing the highlights of the chrysanthemum-viewing party with his literary gentlemen. Shortly before the gathering broke up, he was telling them, there was some discussion about an episode from the history of the last dynasty. It was a story in which the romantic, the edifying, the heroic and the pathetic were all exemplified - indeed, one of the most remarkable stories I have ever heard. Everyone present agreed that it deserved a poem to commemorate it. Pray tell us the story, said the literary gentlemen, intrigued. It seems that there was a member of the Imperial clan called Prince Heng, Jia Zheng began, who had gone out to become Military Governor of Qing-zhou. As well as being a fanatically keen soldier, the Prince was inordinately fond of female company, and in the free time left over from his official duties, found a way of combining these two interests by recruiting a large number of beautiful young women whom he had trained in military arts. Every day these young women would be made to engage in mock combat and other warlike exercises for the Princes entertainment. The most beautiful and also the most militarily accomplished of these young women was a certain Miss Lin, who, because she was the fourth daughter in her family, was known by the name of Fourth Sister Lin. Prince Heng thought so highly of her that he gave her a colonelcy and put her in command of the whole female troop. From then on he took to calling her Colonel Winsome or the Winsome Colonel. How priceless! exclaimed the literary gentlemen rapturously. The Winsome Colonel! What a marvellous combination! Surely this Prince Heng must have been one of the most eccentrically romantic persons the world has known? 566 -5947 One could certainly call him that, said Jia Zheng. But there is stranger still to follow. Stranger still? said the literary gentlemen with surprise. Then this must be a very strange tale indeed. In the second year of his governorship, said Jia Zheng, a horde of bandits, latter-day descendants of the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows of the Han period, swept over the whole of Shantung Province, looting and pillaging as they went. The Prince, scorning to mobilize fully against an enemy whom he regarded as a mere rabblement of sheep and curs, took the field against them himself at the head of only a light force of cavalry. But the rebel leadership, by an unexpected combination of cunning and low trickery, defeated him in two successive engagements. In the second of these the Prince himself died fighting. In Qing-zhou the civil and military authorities were in a panic. What could you or I hope to do when the Prince himself has failed? they asked each other, and began to make plans for yielding up the city to the rebels. But Fourth Sister Lins reaction to the grim news was to gather her fellow-officers together and address them as follows Our beloved Princes goodness to us was such that we could never have repaid even a small fraction of it as long as we lived. Now that he has laid down his life for his country, I feel that we in turn ought to lay our lives down for him. Those who feel as I do, follow me. Those who do not are free to leave now, while there is time. We will follow you! the girls cried with a single voice and that night, under the cover of darkness, they rode out from the walls of Qing-zhou into the midst of the rebel camp.
I can explain things to her. Off you go then. Jia Zheng took his leave. He felt extremely uneasy about the whole idea. Official business soon engulfed him, however - acceptance of his new papers of appointment.. recommendations of staff from friends and relatives, an endless round of social gatherings of one sort or another and he delegated all responsibility for the marriage plans to Grandmother J ia, who in turn left the arrangements to Lady Wang and Xi-feng. Jia Zhengs only contributioh was to designate a twenty-frame building in a courtyard behind the Hall of Exalted Felicity, to he side of Lady Wangs private apartment, as Bao-yus new home. Grandmother Jias mind was now quite made up, and when she sent someone to communicate this to Jia Zheng he just replied Very well. But of this, more later. Bao-yu, after his brief interview with his father, was escorted back by Aroma to his kang in the inner room. Intimidated by the Masters presence in the next room, none of the maids dared speak to him and he soon fell into a deep sleep. As a consequence he did not hear a word of the conversation between his father and Grandmother J ia. Aroma and the others did, however, and stood in complete silence taking it all in. Aroma had heard rumours of this marriage-plan, rumours whose. likelihood, it is true, had been strengthened by Bao-chais repeated absence from family gatherings. Now that she knew it for a fact, all became crystal clear. She was glad. Theyve shown some sense at last! she thought to herself, Those two will make by far the better match. And I shall be better off too. With Miss Chai here Ill be able to unload a lot of my responsibilities. The only trouble is, Master Bao still thinks of no one but Miss Li.... Its a good thing he didnt hear just now. If he knew what they are planning, I dread to think what trouble wed have. This cast a shadow over her previous optimism. Whats to be done? she continued to brood to herself. Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship obviously dont know about the secret feelings Master Bao and Miss Lin have for each other, and in their enthusiasm they could tell him their plan, to try and cure him. But if he still feels as he did -when he first saw Miss Lin, for instance, and hurled his jade to the ground and wanted to smash it to pieces or last summer in the Garden, when he mistook me for her and poured his heart out to me or when Nightingale teased him by saying that Miss Lin was going away, and had him in such floods of tears - and if they go and tell him now that hes betrothed to Miss Chai and will have to give Miss Lin up for ever, so far from turning his luck theyll probably kill him! Unless of course hes going through one of his deaf-and-dumb spells, in which case he probably wont even nonce. Id better tell them what I know, or three people may suffer! Aromas mind was made up. As soon as Jia Zheng had taken hi leave of the ladies, she left Ripple to look after Bao-yu, and went into the outer room. She walked over to Lady Wang and whispered that she would like a word with her privately in the room to the rear of Grandmother J ias apartment. Grandmother Jia imagined it to be some message from Bao-yu and did not pay much attention, but continued to engross herself in the wedding arrangements. Lady Wang rose to leave, and Aroma followed her into the rear chamber, where she at once fell on her knees and began crying. Lady Wang had no idea what it was all about, and taking her by the hand, said Come now! What is all this? Has someone done you wrong? If so, stand up, and tell me. It is something I shouldnt really say, but in the circumstances I feel I must. Well, tell me then. And take your time. You and Her Old Ladyship have made an excellent decision, in choosing Miss Bao-chai as Bao-yus future bride ... began Aroma. But, I wonder, maam, if you have noticed which of the two young ladies Bao-yu is more closely attached to, Miss Chai, or Miss Lin? As they have lived together since they were children, replied Lady Wang, I suppose he would be a little closer to Miss Lin. More than a little! protested Aroma, and went on to give Lady Wang a detailed history of how things had always stood between Bao-yu and Dai-yu, and of the various incidents that had occurred between them.
They had just started out again to look for him. Back at Green Delights he hurriedly dressed up again and, telling the girls that he was going to pay a call on Dai-yu, slipped out of the Garden and made his way, on his own this time, to the place where he had visited Skybright the day hefore, expecting to find her laid out there in her coffi 1. Skybright had died not, as the lying maid had said, that afternoon, but early in the morning. As soon as she had breathed her last, the cousin and his wife had gone to the mansion to tell Lady Wang in the hope of getting some money out of her for the funeral. Lady Wang had given them ten taels and told them to get the body out of the house as quickly as possible and have it cremated. The girl died of a consumption, she said. You mustnt keep the body in the house, whatever you do. Impressed by this advice, they had hurried off with the money and made arrangements to have the body encoffined 564 and carried to the burning ground outside the city without delay. Skybrights clothes and jewellery, worth between three and four hundred taels, they kept for themselves a nice little sum to put by for their old age. When all the arrangements had been completed, they shut up the house and accompanied the hearse outside the city to see the body cremated. Bao-yu arrived, therefore, to find the house locked up and nobody at home. Once more frustrated, he stood for some minutes gazing blankly at the door. Finally, since there was nothing else he could do, he turned round and walked back to the Garden. The thought of returning to his room was distasteful to him. He decided to call in at Dai-yus on the way back but Dai-yus maids told him that their mistress was out. Shes gone to see Miss Bao, they said. -5947 Bao-ya made his way to All-spice Court. To his surprise he found it silent and deserted, and when he peeped inside, he could see that it had the empty, cheerless look of an uninhabited house. He had a vague recollection of having heard some days previously that Bao-chai was thinking of moving out but he had been so busy with homework during the past few days that it had gone out of his mind. Now it appeared that she really had moved. A sort of blankness came over him. Chess had gone. Picture had gone. Parfumee and the other four little actresses had gone. Skybright was dead. Now, it seemed, Bao-hai and her lot had gone, too. And though Ying-chun was supposed to have left only temporarily, to judge from the number of visits made by match-makers during the past weeks, it would riot be very long before she was getting married. The Gardens little society was breaking up. Oh well, he thought, no good fretting about it now. Ill go and enjoy Dai-yus company for a while and after that, Ive still got Aroma to go back to. It looks as if we three will soon be the only ones left. In that philosophical frame of mind he went back to the Naiads House but Dai-yu had still not returned. Just as he was wondering where else he could go, a maid from Lady Wangs apartment came up to him with a message from his mother. 565 The Masters back now and wants to see you. He says hes got a good subject for a poem and you are to come at once. Bao-yu was obliged to accompany the girl to his mothers apartment but by the time he got there, his father had already gone. Lady Wang ordered some of her women to accompany him to his fathers study outside. He found Jia Zheng discussing the highlights of the chrysanthemum-viewing party with his literary gentlemen. Shortly before the gathering broke up, he was telling them, there was some discussion about an episode from the history of the last dynasty. It was a story in which the romantic, the edifying, the heroic and the pathetic were all exemplified - indeed, one of the most remarkable stories I have ever heard. Everyone present agreed that it deserved a poem to commemorate it. Pray tell us the story, said the literary gentlemen, intrigued. It seems that there was a member of the Imperial clan called Prince Heng, Jia Zheng began, who had gone out to become Military Governor of Qing-zhou. As well as being a fanatically keen soldier, the Prince was inordinately fond of female company, and in the free time left over from his official duties, found a way of combining these two interests by recruiting a large number of beautiful young women whom he had trained in military arts.
He has been posthumously awarded the rank of Grand Secretary, by Imperial Decree, Jia Lian went on, and the title Lord Wen-qin. The Court has given instructions for the family to accompany the coffin en cortege to Nanking, and all local mandarins have been instructed to look after them en route. The whole family left yesterday for the South. Uncles widow asked me to convey her respects. She said that there was so much she wanted to talk to you about, but that she would not be able to come to the capital at present. My brother-in-law Wang Ren is coming here, so I heard, and if they meet him on the way, they will tell him to come and give us the latest news. Lady Wang responded to all of this with a grief that the reader can surely imagine. Why dont you lie down for a while, Aunt? said Xi-feng. In the evening, we can talk further about Bao-yus affairs. Having uttered these comforting words, Xi-feng returned with Jia Lian to her own apartment, where she informed him of all that had been decided and told him to give instructions for the cleaning and refurbishing of the courtyard that was to be the couples new home. But of this no more for the present. A day or two after these events, Dai-yu, having eaten her breakfast, decided to take Nightingale with her to visit Grandmother Jia. She wanted to pay her respects, and also thought the visit might provide some sort of distraction for herself. She had hardly left the Naiads House, when she remembered that she had left her handkerchief at home, and sent Nightingale back to fetch it, saying that she would walk ahead slowly and wait for her to catch up. She had just reached the corner behind the rockery at Drenched Blossoms Bridge - the very spot where she had once buried the flowers with Bao-yu - when all of a sudden she heard the sound of sobbing. She stopped at once and listened. She could not tell whose voice it was, nor could she distinguish what it was that the voice was complaining of, so tearfully and at such length. It really was most puzzling. She moved forward again cautiously and as she turned the corner, saw before her the source of the sobbing, a maid with large eyes and thick-set eyebrows. Before setting eyes on this girl, Dai-yu had guessed that one of the many maids in the Jia household must have had an unhappy. love-affair, and had come here to cry her heart out in secret. But now she laughed at the very idea. How could such an ungainly creature as this know the meaning of love? she thought to herself. This must be one of the odd-job girls, who has probably been scolded by one of the senior maids. She looked more closely, but still could not place the girl. Seeing Dai-yu, the maid ceased her weeping, wiped her cheeks, and rose to her feet. Come now, what are you so upset about? inquired Dai-yu. Oh Miss Lin! replied the maid, amid fresh tears. Tell me if you think it fair. They were talking about it, and how was I to know better? Just because I say one thing wrong, is that a reason for sister to start hitting me? Dai-yu did not know what she was talking about. She smiled, and asked again Who is your sister? Pearl, answered the maid. From this, Dai-yu concluded that she must work in Grandmother Jias apartment. And what is your name? Simple. Dai-yu laughed. Then Why did she hit you? What did you say that was so wrong? Thats what Id like to know! It was only to do with Master Bao marrying Miss Chai! The words struck Dai-yus ears like a clap of thunder. Her heart started thumping fiercely. She tried to calm herself for a moment, and told the maid to come with her. The maid followed her to the secluded corner of the garden, where the Flower Burial Mound was situated. Here Dai-yu asked her Why should she hit you for mentioning Master Baos marriage to Miss Chai? Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, replied Simple, have decided that as the Master is leaving soon, they are going to arrange with Mrs Xue to marry Master Bao and Miss Chai as uickly as possible. They want the wedding to turn his luck, and then... Her voice tailed off. She stared at Dai-yu, laughed and continued Then, as soon as those two are married, they are going to find a husband for you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu was speechless with horror.
His admission of guilt has now been officially entered in the records. You, the appellant, an outsider with no first-hand knowledge of the case, in presuming to fabricate this unfounded appeal are guilty of contempt of court. In view of the mitigating circumstances of family loyalty, your offence will be overlooked in this instance. -1344 APPEAL REJECTED Theres no hope left then! cried Aunt Xue. What can we do now? That isnt all, said Bao-chai. Theres a P.S. She read on For confidential instructions, ask the boy - urgent. Aunt Xue immediately questioned the boy, who supplied the following information The people at the yamen know how rich we are, maam, and Master Ke says well have to use family connections here in the capital, and send another large bribe, if were to get a rehearing and a lighter sentence. He says you must act quickly, maam, as delay now could mean hardship for Mr Pan. Aunt Xue dismissed the boy and went at once to see her sister again. Lady Wang pleaded strenuously with Jia Zheng, but the most he was prepared to do was send someone to have a word with the judge. He refused to contemplate the use of pecuniary considerations. Aunt Xue, fearing that this gesture would prove ineffective, begged Xi-feng to speak to Jia Lian. The judges price was high - the figure ran into several thousands of taels but in the end an agreement was reached, and the way was clear for Xue Ke to proceed with his plan. The case was officially re-opened, and all the parties concerned were summoned once more to the district yamen - the beadle, eye-witnesses, relatives of the deceased, etc. Xue Pan was brought out from the cells. The clerk of the court called the roll, and the judge ordered the chief beadle to verify the original depositions. Then Mrs Zhang nee Wang and Zhang Er, the deceaseds mother and uncle, were called to give evidence. Mayt please Yeronner, began Mrs Zhang, punctuating her delivery with sobs, we Zhangs are country folk and live to the south of town. Papa Zhangs been gone these eighteen years. We had the three boys, but our eldest and second have both passed away. The only one as I had left was our third, and now hes gone too! More sobs. Twenty-three this year hedve been, anitplease Yeronner, and still a single lad. Hed took this job at Lis Bar by way 0 helpin me out, seem as wed so little comin in. Itdve been bout midday when this man come to the door-I can see im now -"Theres been a fight at Lis Bar!" says he, "And your boys been killed!" My poor heart, Yeronner! I was took that bad! I runned to Lis and there was my boy lyin on the ground, the blood runnin out is poor ead! I tried askin im what ad appened, but e couldnt say nothing, e was ardly breathin, and then ... well, then e was gone! If I could only get my hands on that wickedevilmurderin A growl of disapproval rippled through the ranks of the court underlings. Mrs Zhang rapidly kotowed to the bench All Im askin for is reglar justice Yeronner! He was all I ad left in the world! Next witness - Gaffer Li! called the judge peremptorily. Gaffer Li, proprietor of Lis Bar, came forward and knelt before the bench. Was this fellow Zhang employed for casual work on your premises? asked the judge. He was a regular waiter, replied Li. I see here that in your original deposition, as recorded at the Inquest, you state that Xue Pan dealt Zhang San a fatal blow on the head. Tell me, did you personally observe this blow? No, Your Honour. I was behind the counter at the time, in the tap-room. I heard that one of the customers in a private room had ordered some wine. Then a little later I heard that someone had been hurt. I ran in and saw Zhang San lying on the floor. He couldnt speak. I informed the beadle, and sent someone to tell Mrs Zhang. I have no idea how the fight started. There was a gentleman sitting at Mr Xues table, Your Honour. Perhaps he could supply the necessary information... What! thundered the judge impressively. In your original deposition it says quite plainly that you saw the incident with your own eyes. Are you now trying to tell me that you saw nothing? When I made that first statement, Your Honour, I was in such a fluster that I must have got my facts a bit muddled...
Increasing idleness is the only fruit that young tree will ever bear. But I gave him a glowing report! protested Grandmother Jia. I said how well he was doing at his compositions. I only wish it were the truth, said Jia Zheng with a crushing smile. But you and your friends are always asking him to write verses and things for you - Im sure hes making progress, whatever you say. Hes still young, be patient with him. "A single spoonful never made a bouncing babe," as the saying goes. Jia Zheng affected a dutiful smile. Yes, Mother. Which brings me, the old lady continued, to the other thing I want to talk about. Now that Bao-yu is growing up, its time you and his mother started thinking seriously of choosing a nice wife for him. Marriage is going to be a most important step in his life. We neednt worry too much how, closely related to us she is, or how much money theyve got but we must be sure that shes sweet-natured, and a pretty sort of girl. Thank you for reminding me, Mother, replied Jia Zheng rather stiffly. But although of course I appreciate the importance of choosing a suitable bride, the first step, as I see it, must lie with Bao-yu himself. Without a marked improvement on his part, any alliance we might hope to arrange would be doomed, and would certainly be a regrettable error for the young lady concerned. His present shiftless attitude can only spell matrimonial disaster. His response did not please Grandmother Jia. - I know that its your decision! she replied testily, and that Im an interfering old busybody! But let me say just this even if I did rather spoil him when he was little, and even if he isnt quite as grown-up and responsible as you think he ought to be, I still think he has always been a nice, well-mannered, honest boy. I think youre quite wrong to treat him as a neer-do-well, or as some sort of threat to a young girls happiness. Hes not like that at all. Oh perhaps I am prejudiced! Hes preferable to young Huan, anyway. Or would you like to correct me there as well? Jia Zheng was by now feeling extremely uncomfortable. You are of course by far the more experienced judge of character, Mother, he replied swiftly. You may be right in thinking that fate has favoured him. Perhaps it is my own - how shall I put it. - impatience to detect a sense of purpose in the lad that has made of me a crabbed old father, and of Bao-yu the - eh - "crab-apple of my eye"? The labour required on his part in the manufacture of this sparkling piece of verbal merriment did not quite nullify its object, viz. the humouring of the old lady, and she smiled, whereupon the other ladies contributed a polite round of laughter. Yes, said Grandmother Jia, and dont forget how much older you are. Its that and your experience as a civil servant that have made you so mellow and wise. She turned to Lady Xing and Lady Wang with a formidable glance and went on mischievously If you could have seen him when he was a boy! He was quite impossible! Far worse than Bao-yu! It was only marriage that taught him a thing or two about life. And now he wont stop complaining about poor Bao. If anything, the boy is more mature for his age than his father was. The ladies thought this assault on the bastion of Jia Zhengs dignity a great joke, and started laughing and calling Grandmother Jia a tease. Then the junior maids came in and informed Faithful that lunch was ready to be served. Speak up! called out Grandmother Jia, her good humour quite restored. Let me in on the secret! Faithful smiled and passed on the message. Well in that case, said Grandmother Jia, everyone can go home for lunch, except Feng and Cousin Zhens wife. Id like them to stay and keep me company. Jia Zheng, Lady Wang and Lady Xing waited until lunch was served and then, after a few more prods from the old lady, they left and went their separate ways. On their return, Jia Zheng, in the course of conversation with Lady Wang, brought up the subject of his recent contretemps with Grandmother Jia How Mother idolizes that boy! If only he can do well enough to scrape through his exam, then she will have something to feel proud of, a return for all her love, and he will have something to offer in the event of his marriage. How true! concurred Lady Wang. Jia Zheng sent a maid out at once with the following orders for Li Gui Tell Bao-yu I wish to see him this evening.
said Dai-yu with a smile. I thought you had come to see Bao-yu. What else did we come here for? Nightingale could see that her mind was utterly confused. She guessed that it was something that the maid had said in the garden, and only nodded with a faint smile in reply to Dai-yus question. But to herself she was trying to imagine what sort of an encounter this was going to be, between the young master who had already lost his wits, and her young mistress who was now herself a little touched. Despite her apprehensions, she dared not prevent the meeting, and helped Dai-yu into the room. The funny thing was that Dai-yu now seemed to have recovered her strength. She did not wait for Nightingale but raised the portiere herself, and walked into the room. It was very quiet inside. Grandmother Jia had retired for her afternoon nap. Some of the maids had sneaked off to play, some were having forty winks themselves and others had gone to wait on Grandmother Jia in her bedroom. It was Aroma who came out to see who was there, when she heard the swish of the portiere. Seeing that it was Dai-yu, she greeted her politely Please come in and sit down, Miss. Is Master Bao at home? asked Dai-yu with a smile. Aroma did not know that anything was amiss, and was about to answer, when she saw Nightingale make an urgent movement with her lip from behind Dai-yus back, pointing to her mistress and making a warning gesture with her hand. Aroma had no idea what she meant and dared not ask. Undeterred, Dai-yu walked on into Baoyus room. He was sitting up in bed, and when she came in made no move to get up or welcome her, but remained where he was, staring at her and giving a series of silly laughs. Dai-yu sat down uninvited, and she too began to smile and stare back at Bao-yu. There were no greetings exchanged, no courtesies, in fact no words of any kind. They just sat there staring into each others faces and smiling like a pair of half-wits. Aroma stood watching, completely at a loss. Suddenly Dai-yu said Bao-yu, why are you sick? Bao-yu laughed. Im sick because of Miss Lin. Aroma and Nightingale grew pale with fright. They tried t6 change the subject, but their efforts only met with silence and more senseless smiles. By now it was clear to Aroma that Dai-yus mind was as disturbed as Bao-yus. Miss Lin has only just recovered from her illness, she whispered to Nightingale. Ill ask Ripple to help you take her back. She should go home and lie down. Turning to Ripple, she said Go with Nightingale and accompany Miss Lin home. And no stupid chattering on the way, mind. Ripple smiled, and without a word came over to help Nightingale. The two of them began to help Dai-yu to her feet. Dai-yu stood up at once, unassisted, still staring fixedly at Bao-yu, smiling and nodding her head. Come on, Miss! urged Nightingale. Its time to go home and rest. Of course! exclaimed Dai-yu. Its time! She turned to go. Still smiling and refusing any assistance. from the maids, she strode out at twice her normal speed. Ripple and Nightingale hurried after her. On leaving Grandmother Jias apartment, Dai-yu kept on walking, in quite the wrong direction. Nightingale hurried up to her and took her by the hand. This is the way, Miss. Still smiling, Dai-yu allowed herself to be led, and followed Nightingale towards the Naiads House. When they were nearly there, Nightingale exclaimed Lord Buddha be praised! Home at last! She had no sooner uttered these words when she saw Dai-yu stumble forwards onto the ground, and give a loud cry. A stream of blood came gushing from her mouth. To learn if she survived this crisis, please read the next chapter. -576 39
Bao-yu handed it to her and she gulped it down greedily as if it were the most delicious nectar. He watched her with tears running down his cheeks, suddenly ashamed of his own fastidiousness. If theres anything you want to tell me, he said, youd better tell me now, while theres nobody else about. What have I got to tell? said Skybright. Im living now from day to day and from hour to hour. I know Im done for it cant be more than four or five days now at the most. If it werent for one thing, I could die content. I know Im a bit better-looking than the others, but Ive never tried to make up to you. Why will they insist that I am some sort of vampire? Its so unfair. And now I have so little time left. I ought not to say this, but if Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently. She began to cry again. Bao-yu took her hands in his own. They felt like bundles of dried twigs, so wasted had she become. She was still wearing a pair of silver bangles on either wrist. Better take these off, he said he was crying himself as he spoke. You can put them on again when you are better. 545 He took them off for her and put them under the pillow. Its a pity about these nails, he said. It took you such a long time to grow them. By the time you are better, I expect youll find that quite a lot of them will have broken off. She wiped her eyes, curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them. Here! She put the pieces into his hand. To remind you of me. Then she reached down inside the bedding and managed, after a great deal of struggling, to take off the old red chemise she was wearing and hold it out to him. Because of her weakness, the effort of doing this made her pant so much that she could not speak but Bao-yu understood what she wanted. He removed his outer garment, took off the shirt he was wearing underneath it and laid it over her, and put on the chemise she was holding out to him. He did not bother to do the buttons up, since it would be hidden anyway beneath his outer garment. While he was fastening his belt on again, he noticed that she was staring at him, trying to say something. Help me up! Even with Bao-yus assistance it cost her a good deal of effort to sit fully upright. Once she was sitting up, she stretched one of her arms out and tried drawing the shirt on herself. Bao-yu draped it over her shoulders and eased each of her arms in turn into the sleeves, then gently laid her down again. If anyone sees that when you get back and asks you whose it is, said Skybright, weeping, theres no need to tell them any lies. Tell them its mine. Since Ive got such a bad reputation anyway, I might as well have something to show for it when Im gone! At that moment the door-curtain was lifted and the cousins wife came into the room, all dazzling smiles. Very nice! Ive heard all that you two have been saying. She directed a bold look at Bao-yu. And what are you doing, a young master like you, coming to see us servants in our 546 -374 quarters? Bet you heard I was young and good-looking and came here to flirt with me! Please, I beg of you, dont speak so loud! said Bao-yu entreatingly. I shouldnt really be here, but your cousin was with me for many years I came here to see her because she is ill. The young woman smiled and nodded approvingly. Thats right. They say you have a good heart. She took him by the hand and pulled him after her into the inner room. If you dont want me to make a noise, you can easily stop me. You have only to do one little thing. She got her backside up onto the kang and drawing him down on top of her, put up her legs and gripped him tightly between them. This was something totally outside Bao-yus experience. His heart started pounding wildly, his face turned scarlet, and his whole body began to tremble. It would have been hard to say what feeling was at that moment uppermost in his mind embarrassment, shame, fear or annoyance. All he could manage to say was Dont fool about, please! The young woman leered up at him through half-closed eyes. Get away with you!
When Sir Zheng comes in, all you need do is repeat Her Ladyships instructions. Its very charitable of Her Ladyship to deal so generously with these worthless people, commented Lai Da. Ill make sure I pick a good un to take them all home, carrying on Her Ladyships good work, so to speak. And Ill bring young Master Qin in here, sir, for you to deal with. As for that anonymous bill-sticker, Ill track him down, and when I lay my hands on him Ill teach him a lesson he wont forget in a hurry. Jia Lian nodded. Good. Jia Qin was summoned and disposed of, and Lai Da dealt with the girls in accordance with Lady Wangs instructions. When Jia Zheng came home that evening, Jia Lian and Lai Da both went in to report. Jia Zheng was not a man to look for unnecessary trouble, and was content to consider the matter closed. The news that the Jia household had dismissed twenty-four girl novices soon spread, and every young rake in town fancied the idea of getting hold of one of them for himself. What did happen to the girls in the end, and whether or not they ever reached home, our story does not relate, and it would be idle to speculate. Let us return instead to the Naiads House. With the slight improvement in Dai-yus health, Nightingale was less busy than usual. Hearing of the arrival of the novices, and curious about the event that called for their presence at Court, she decided to pay a visit to Grandmother Jias apartment, in the hope of finding out more from one of the maids there. She arrived just as Faithful was coming off duty and the two of them were able to sit down for a chat. Nightingale mentioned the novices. Their presence in the Garden came as a complete surprise to Faithful who exclaimed Thats the first Ive heard of it! Ill ask Mrs Lian about it later on, shell be sure to know. At that moment two old women from Mr Fu Shis establishment came to call on Grandmother Jia, and Faithful went to take them through. Grandmother Jia had just retired for her midday nap, however, so the women exchanged a few words with Faithful and went on their way again. Where are those two from? asked Nightingale. Theyre a tiresome pair, replied Faithful. Theyre always calling on Her Old Ladyship and telling her how wonderful their Miss Fu is - so sweet-natured, beautiful, well-mannered, softly spoken, a perfect needlewoman, deft with her writing-brush, nimble with her abacus, a paragon of daughterly obedience, kind and ladylike towards the servants, and so on and so forth... Every time they come they treat Her Old Ladyship to the same recital. I cant bear that sort of thing, but Her Old Ladyship seems to love it. And the strange thing is that Bao-yu, who normally finds old women like that most irritating, makes an exception of these two. A few days ago, when they were here last, they said that Mr Fu wouldnt look at any of his sisters suitors and there are plenty of them, but had set his heart on her marrying into a family like ours. They sung her praises all over again. Somehow they always seem to say just the thing to please the old lady. Nightingale looked thoughtful for a moment. Then she asked with affected nonchalance If Her Old Ladyship is so pleased with what they say, why doesnt she marry Bao-yu to the young lady? Faithful was on the very point of explaining to Nightingale the real reason, when she heard a call from inside Her Old Ladyship is awake! She hurried in, leaving Nightingale to make her own way home. As Nightingale reached the Garden and began to walk towards the Naiads House, she thought to herself Anyone would suppose Bao-yu to be the only boy in the world, from the amount of time we all spend thinking about him! My poor mistress lust seems to get more and more besotted with him. Whenever I see her sinking into one of her depressions, I can tell its because of him. Thats what has been making her fall ill all the time too. What with all the uncertainty about the bond of gold and jade, and now this Miss Fu - I dont know! I always thought Bao-yu loved Miss Lin, but from what Faithful said it seems he just flits from one girl to the next. My poor mistress! All your heartache is wasted on him! Nightingale had begun by feeling sad on Dai-yus account, but the more she thought about it the more wretched and confused she began to feel herself.
Tell Mr Qin to wait for me in the inner library. Brightie disappeared. Jia Qin went as instructed to the library. On his way he noticed a lot of pointing and muttering among the servants. He could not make out what it was all about, but it was clearly something to do with him. This was beginning to seem less and less like a summons from the Palace. He would have dearly liked to ask one of them what was going on, but felt too uneasy to do so and could only wait there in ever increasing suspense. When Jia Lian arrived, Jia Qin greeted him and stood nervously with his hands at his side. I wonder what Her Grace requires the nuns for at such short notice? he ventured. I had to race all the way here. Luckily I was out there anyway today with the monthly allowance and was able to come back with Lai Da. But Im sure you know all about that. All about what! Youre the one that should know! Jia Qin could make neither head nor tail of this, and stood there tongue-tied. A fine mess youve made of things! continued Jia Lian. Sir Zhengs in a fuming rage! But Ive done nothing! protested Jia Qin. Ive delivered the allowance on time every month, the girls know their services by heart... Jia Lian could see that he knew nothing of what had happened. He and Qin had played together as children, and he sighed. You ass! Take a look at this! He pulled one of the posters from his boot-flap and threw it in Jia Qins direction. Jia Qin picked it up and read it. His face grew ashen pale. Who. could have done this? Ive never done anyone any harm. Why should anyone want to blacken my name like this? I only go there once a month with the money - this is all lies! Sir Zheng will be very hard on me, I know he will! I shall die of shame! If my mother finds out, shell flog me to death! He checked that there was no one else in the room and knelt before Jia Lian. Uncle! Please help me! Please! He went on knocking his head on the ground, tears streaming down his face. Several thoughts were going through Jia Lians mind. Debauchery is Uncle Zhengs pet abomination. If he finds out that there really has been any such thing well be in for a major scene. It will only help smear the family name, besides. And give the anonymous author the greatest satisfaction, and then we can expect more of such p6sters in the future. No, why not take advantage of Uncle Zhengs absence, talk to Lai Da and hush the whole thing up. So far theres no proof that anything ever happened. And no one need be any the wiser. Having reached this decision, Jia Lian spoke to Jia Qin again Theres no point in trying to fool me. Dont think I dont know about every one of your mucky little pranks. Now listen if you want to get out of this, you must deny everything, absolutely everything, no matter how hard Sir Zheng presses you. Do you understand? Now get up off the ground, you pathetic creature! Jia Lian sent for Lai Da and asked him for his opinion. As a matter of fact, sir, said Lai Da, Mr Qin was behaving in a very unbecoming manner. When I arrived at the Temple they were all drinking. Id say the man who wrote the posters was telling the truth.. . Do you hear that, Qin? said Jia Lian. Is Lai Da maligning you too?. Jia Qin was by now puce in the face and speechless with embarrassment. Jia Lian took Lai Da by the hand and pleaded with him Spare. the lad, Lai. Say you found him at home. When you take him in to see the Master, theres no need to say that Ive already seen him. And tomorrow you can ask the Master not to bother with questioning the nuns. Send for a broker and have them all sold off. If Her Grace should really need them again, we can always buy some more. Lai Da reflected that there was nothing to be gained by letting the incident blow into a storm. The familys name would only suffer. So he agreed to Jia Lians proposal. You go with Mr Lai now, Qin, ordered Jia Lian. And do whatever he tells you. Jia Qin kotowed once more to Jia Lian and followed Lai Da out. When they reached a secluded spot, he also kotowed to Lai Da. Excuse me for saying so, Master Qin, said Lai, but it was your fault for behaving in such a manner.
Jia Lian took the paper and glanced down the list. I see you include Hares Ear in your prescription, he said. Forgive me if I am wrong, but I thought that was ruled out in haematic eruptions? You must be thinking, replied Doctor Wang with a knowledgeable smile, of its emetic properties, which, as is well known, contra-indicate this particular herb in cases of haemoptysis or epistaxis. But allow me to inform you that in preparation with Turtles Blood as in my prescription, Hares Ear constitutes the only effective remedy we have for draining the humour of the Lesser Yang periphery of the gall-bladder. You see, the judicious admixture of Turtles Blood has the remarkable effect of inhibiting the emetic properties of Hares Ear, while enabling it to restore the hepatic Yin and check the phlogistic disturbance. In the words of the Ars Medicandi "ObstruFta obstruit, aperitque aperta." And the - at first sight - paradoxical inclusion of Hares Ear is none other than the classic stratagem of the loyal counsellor befriending the usurper... I see, said Jia Lian, nodding appreciatively. Thank you for enlightening me, Doctor Wang. The doctor continued I should like the young lady to take two doses of the decoction, and then we shall see whether to alter the prescription, or perhaps try a new one altogether. I have another appointment, so I hope youll excuse me. I shall call again another day. As Jia Lian saw him out, he asked And what have you prescribed for my cousin? Oh theres very little the matter with him. Another dose of the dispersant I have prescribed should put him right. With these words Doctor Wang stepped into his carriage. Jia Lian dispatched a servant to purchase the various drugs needed and went in to inform Xi-feng of Dai-yus diagnosis. They had not been talking long when Zhou Ruis wife arrived to consult Xi-feng about a few trivial details of domestic management. After listening for a while, Jia Lian rose to leave. Carry on, Mrs Zhou, I must be going. With Jia Lian out of the room, and all remaining household business soon disposed of, Zhou Ruis wife was able to come to the real purpose of her visit. Ive just come from Miss Lins, maam. I dont like the look of it at all! Theres not a spot of colour left in her cheeks, and to touch her shes nothing but skin and bones. I tried asking her what the matter was, but she wouldnt speak, just sat there crying. Before I left, Nightingale asked if you could advance them a couple of months allowance. She said that with Miss Lin so ill, and her so proud anyway about not being beholden to a soul for anything, shed made bold to ask about it herself. The medicine Miss Lin is taking goes on the general account of course, but she said they might be needing some extra money for incidental expenses. I said Id mention it to you, maam. Xi-feng lowered her head for a moment, then replied Oh very well, Ill sen4 her a few taels to be going on with. Theres no need to tell Miss Lin though. Im against advances on principle. If one person starts well never hear the end of it. Do you remember the scene Mrs Zhao and Miss Tan-chun had about this very question? Besides, as you know, with so many expenses and so little coming in to pay for them, things are extremely tight at present. After a pause, she continued Some people are under the illusion that its all caused by bad management on my part. Some even have the nerve to suggest that I am lining the Wang nest at the Jia familys expense. But you know better, my dear Mrs Zhou. Youve seen far too much of what really goes on to pay any attention to such gossip. Why I never heard such downright wicked lies in all my days, maam, said Zhou Ruis wife. Bless my soul! Where would this great rambling household be now, I should like to know, without you to keep everything running smoothly the way you do? Id like to see any other lady try to take it on. Why, a grown man with six arms and three heads would crumple under the strain of what you have to bear, for certain sure! Theres no justice left in this world! Suddenly she broke into a cackle of laughter. Mind you, Mrs Lian, the things people will say! The other day when Mr Zhou came home from town, he told me how people are all talking about us, trying to guess just how rich the family is. Take this for example "The Jias have got rooms piled high with silver and gold!
Without even stopping to thank his hosts, Xue Ke followed the boy out of the courtyard, sending one of the Jia maids in with a message to the ladies enclosure. When Aunt Xue heard the news, she went white in the face. Taking Bao-qin with her, she made a distracted farewell and went straight out to her carriage, leaving the whole assembly in a state of high alarm. We had better send someone over with them, said Grandmother Jia. I am sure everyone is most anxious to learn what this is all about. They all agreed. The players continued with their programme. But we must leave them and follow Aunt Xue, who on her arrival at home saw two yamen runners waiting in the inner gateway. With them were some employees from the family pawnshop. When Mrs Xue arrives, they were saying, shell be able to explain everything. When the yamen runners saw this elderly lady sweeping up to the gate with her large retinue of male and female attendants, and realized the distinguished position of the. person they were dealing with, they stood to attention and let her pass. Aunt Xue went on through the reception hall and could already hear the sound of heavy wailing coming from her daughter-in-laws apartment. She quickened her step. Bao-chai came out to meet her, her face wet with tears. Have you heard, Mama? Please dont panic! We must try to do something! They went inside together. Aunt Xue had already been told the main facts by one of the servants on her way in, and was still sobbing and trembling from the shock. But who? Who was it? she asked agitatedly. Madam, said one of the servants, details like that are not going to make much difference at present. The law says "a life for a life". So we must think what to do. Think! cried Aunt Xue hysterically. Whats the earthly good of thinking at a time like this? The best thing as we see it, continued the servant, is this. First, send young Master Ke with some money tonight to visit Mr Pan in prison. Then, first thing tomorrow, Master Ke must get himself a good scrivener, someone well-versed in legal terminology. He must offer him a good fee to make sure this death-sentence is quashed.. Then, when thats been done, we must ask one of the Jia gentlemen here to pull a few strings. But first of all, we must tip the yamen runners outside a few taels. Then we can get on with the rest of the plan. Aunt Xue was not convinced. Just find the mans family, she said. Give them whatever they want for funeral expenses and compensation. If they dont press the charge, surely hell be let off lightly? Bao-chais voice could be heard through the door-curtain No, Mama, that will never do. The m6re money we hand out the more trouble well cause in the long run. We should do as the boy says. What have I left to live for? sobbed Aunt Xue. Let me go there and see him once! Then the two of us can die together! Bao-chai begged her to take heart, and at the same time called out for the boy to set off with Xue Ke at once. The maids helped Aunt Xue indoors again. Xue Ke came by on his way out. Send someone home with letter as soon as you have any news, Bao-chai instructed him. You must stay there. Were counting on you. Xue Ke promised to do his utmost and left. While Bao-chai applied herself once more to the task of soothing her agitated mother, Xia Jin-gui took the opportunity of launching an undisturbed attack on Caltrop So a murder was nothing to this family, was it? she screamed at her. You all came straight up to town afterwards as if nothing had happened, did you? Well it looks as if you spoke once too often, Miss Swanky Panky! Because this time its the real thing, and look at you! Wheres all your money and all your fine friends and posh relatives now? Youre all so scared you dont know if youre coming or going! And in a few days, when they put Pan away, then I suppose youll bugger off and leave me here to carry the can single-handed! She broke into one of her dramatic wails. Aunt Xue heard every word and was so furious that she fainted. Bao-chai was at her wits end. And in the midst of this pandemonium one of Lady Wangs senior maids arrived, to ask if there was any news. This presented Bao-chai with an additional problem. She was fully aware of her delicate position since the official betrothal visit a few days previously, and knew that strictly speaking she should shun all contact with her future bridegrooms family including the domestic staff.
The hours slipped by. Soon it was nearly midnight. Cousin Zhen was by now more than a little drunk. They had all just put on some extra clothes and had some hot tea the wine-cups had been cleared and clean ones put in their place and a fresh lot of newly heated wine was just being poured, when suddenly a long-drawn-out sigh was heard from the foot of one of the garden walls. It was heard by all of them, quite clearly and unmistakably, and they could feel the hair on their scalps rise as they listened to it. Whos there? Cousin Zhen shouted in a voice that he tried to make fierce and challenging. But though he repeated the question several times, there was no reply. Its probably one of the servants, said You-shi. Nonsense! snapped Cousin Zhen. There are no servants living behind any of these walls. In any case, thats the Hall of the Ancestors over there. What would anyone be doing behind that wall? A rustle of wind passed, at that very moment, along the foot of it and a distant sound like the opening and closing of a door could be heard from inside the ancestral temple. An oppressive feeling of dread came over them the night air seemed suddenly to have grown colder the moon appeared less bright than it had been a few minutes before and they could feel their skins crawling with terror. Shock had made Cousin Zhen almost sober but though he managed to keep better control of himself than the others, he was very much shaken and had lost all appetite for enjoyment. Nevertheless he forced himself and the others to sit a little longer before retiring finally to bed. He rose quite early next morning. It was the fifteenth, one of the two days in each month on which offerings have to be made to the ancestors. Entering the ancestral temple with the other male members of the family, he took the opportunity of looking round inside it very carefully but everything 499 was as it should be there was no sign whatever of anything untoward having happened. He put down the previous nights terror to the effects of drunkenness - a mild attack of the horrors - and resolved to make no further mention of it. When the service was over, he shut the temple up again and made sure that the doors were securely locked and barred. After dinner that evening Cousin Zhen went over with You-shi to Rong-guo House. He found Jia She and Jia Zheng in Grandmother Jias room. The two of them were sitting on the kang, talking and laughing with the old lady, while Jia Lian, Bao-yu, Jian Huan and Jia Lan stood on the floor below. After greeting them and exchanging a word or two with each of them in turn, he sat, or rather half-sat, in polite discomfort, on a stool next to the door. Grandmother Jia vouchsafed a gracious smile in his direction. How is your Cousin Baos archery these days? Cousin Zhen jumped to his feet to reply. Greatly improved, Lady Jia. It isnt only his form that is better he is beginning to handle the bow with much greater strength. Thats the point at which to stop then, said Grandmother Jia. We dont want him straining himself. No, no, certainly not, said Cousin Zhen. I quite agree. Those mooncakes you sent yesterday were very good, said Grandmother Jia. The melons looked all right, but theres not much inside them when you cut them open. Those mooncakes are good, arent they? said Cousin Zhen. They were made by our new pastry-cook. I tried them myself to make sure they were all right before venturing to send you any. As for the melons weve been lucky in previous years, but for some reason none of them this year seem to be any good. I think we must blame the weather, said Jia Zheng. The rains this year were excessive. The moon must be up by now, said Grandmother Jia. Lets go and make our Mid-Autumn offering. She got up and, leaning on Bao-yus shoulder, led the way 500 into the Garden. The main gate was wide open and hung with great horn lanterns. When they reached Prospect Hall, they found servants with lighted lamps waiting for them on the terrace and a table on which incense smoked in a square container and on which offerings of melons and other fruit and mooncakes had been set out on dishes. Lady Xing and all the other female members of the family were waiting inside the hall. Moonlight and lanterns gleaming pale Through a thin aromatic veil It was indeed a scene of indescribable beauty. A carpet for kneeling on had been laid on the terrace at the foot of the table on the side nearest the hall.
If theres anything you want to tell me, he said, youd better tell me now, while theres nobody else about. What have I got to tell? said Skybright. Im living now from day to day and from hour to hour. I know Im done for it cant be more than four or five days now at the most. If it werent for one thing, I could die content. I know Im a bit better-looking than the others, but Ive never tried to make up to you. Why will they insist that I am some sort of vampire? Its so unfair. And now I have so little time left. I ought not to say this, but if Id known in advance that it would be like this, I might have behaved rather differently. She began to cry again. Bao-yu took her hands in his own. They felt like bundles of dried twigs, so wasted had she become. She was still wearing a pair of silver bangles on either wrist. Better take these off, he said he was crying himself as he spoke. You can put them on again when you are better. 545 He took them off for her and put them under the pillow. Its a pity about these nails, he said. It took you such a long time to grow them. By the time you are better, I expect youll find that quite a lot of them will have broken off. She wiped her eyes, curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them. Here! She put the pieces into his hand. To remind you of me. Then she reached down inside the bedding and managed, after a great deal of struggling, to take off the old red chemise she was wearing and hold it out to him. Because of her weakness, the effort of doing this made her pant so much that she could not speak but Bao-yu understood what she wanted. He removed his outer garment, took off the shirt he was wearing underneath it and laid it over her, and put on the chemise she was holding out to him. He did not bother to do the buttons up, since it would be hidden anyway beneath his outer garment. While he was fastening his belt on again, he noticed that she was staring at him, trying to say something. Help me up! Even with Bao-yus assistance it cost her a good deal of effort to sit fully upright. Once she was sitting up, she stretched one of her arms out and tried drawing the shirt on herself. Bao-yu draped it over her shoulders and eased each of her arms in turn into the sleeves, then gently laid her down again. If anyone sees that when you get back and asks you whose it is, said Skybright, weeping, theres no need to tell them any lies. Tell them its mine. Since Ive got such a bad reputation anyway, I might as well have something to show for it when Im gone! At that moment the door-curtain was lifted and the cousins wife came into the room, all dazzling smiles. Very nice! Ive heard all that you two have been saying. She directed a bold look at Bao-yu. And what are you doing, a young master like you, coming to see us servants in our 546 -374 quarters? Bet you heard I was young and good-looking and came here to flirt with me! Please, I beg of you, dont speak so loud! said Bao-yu entreatingly. I shouldnt really be here, but your cousin was with me for many years I came here to see her because she is ill. The young woman smiled and nodded approvingly. Thats right. They say you have a good heart. She took him by the hand and pulled him after her into the inner room. If you dont want me to make a noise, you can easily stop me. You have only to do one little thing. She got her backside up onto the kang and drawing him down on top of her, put up her legs and gripped him tightly between them. This was something totally outside Bao-yus experience. His heart started pounding wildly, his face turned scarlet, and his whole body began to tremble. It would have been hard to say what feeling was at that moment uppermost in his mind embarrassment, shame, fear or annoyance. All he could manage to say was Dont fool about, please! The young woman leered up at him through half-closed eyes. Get away with you! From what Ive been told, youve had plenty of practice with other girls. What makes you so bashful today all of a sudden? Bao-yu became even redder. Please let me go. If youve got anything to talk about, lets discuss it like reasonable human beings.
They were almost home again when they met one of Aunt Xues women. She greeted them, and Patience asked her where she was going. Mrs Xue and our young lady sent me over to convey their regards to all their Ladyships and young madams and young ladies. I was at Mrs Lians just now asking for you, and she told me youd gone into the Garden. Have you just been to Miss Xings by any chance? Why, how did you know that? asked Patience. Oh, a little birdie told me... Its most generous I think, what you and your mistress are doing... Patience gave a little laugh. Wont you come in and have a chat later on? I still have things to do. Another day, replied the old woman and went on her way, while Patience went in to report to Xi-feng. When the serving-woman returned to the Xue household, which was in its usual state of upheaval, thanks to the disruptive behaviour of Xia Jin-gui, she recounted the story of Xing Xiu-yans humiliation, and both Aunt Xue and Bao-chai began to weep. Its only because Pans away, said Bao-chai, that she has to go on suffering like this. We are lucky that Feng has been looking after her. In future we must keep more of an eye on her ourselves. She is after all practically one of the family now. As she was speaking Xue Ke came in. In all the years hes spent here Pan hasnt made a single decent friend! he said. Theyre a pack of rogues the lot of them! Im sure they dont care in the slightest what happens to him. Theyre only curious to know the latest news. This last couple of days Ive told them all to go away, and Ive given the janitors instructions not to -let any of them in. Is it that actor Jiang and his friends again? asked Aunt Xue. No, as a matter of fact he hasnt been here at all. Its a different crowd. Xue Kes words intensified Aunt Xues anxiety. Though I - have -a son, she said it is as though I had none. Even if Pan wins this reprieve, his life is ruined. You are only my nephew, Ke, but you show much more sense than Pan. I can see that from now on I shall have to depend on you. Be sure to work hard and make the most of your life. And think of your bride-to-be, who comes from a family that has fallen on hard times. It is always hard when a daughter goes out into the world and gets married. One can only pray that her husband will turn out well and be capable of providing for her. Imagine if Xiu-yan were to turn out like this creature here... Gesturing in the direction of Xia Jin-guis room Aunt Xue continued But I dont want to talk about her. I know Xiu-yan to be an honest and thoughtful girl, thrifty and unspoilt. The sooner Pans business is settled the sooner we can get the two of you married and set my poor heart at rest. Dont forget that Bao-qin is still waiting to be married, Xue Ke reminded his aunt. I know how concerned you are about that. Dont-worry on our account. They stayed chatting together for a few minutes longer and then Xue Ke returned to his room. He ate his dinner and began to think about Xiu-yan in the Garden, forced by poverty t6 be so utterly dependent on the Jias. The two of them had travelled by the same boat on their original journey to the capital, and he had been able to see for himself that she was a pretty, good-natured girl. How unjust of destiny to give a creature like Xia Jin-gui a life of wealth and luxury and turn her int6 a spoilt shrew,- while for a girl like Xiu-yan there was nothing but hardship! What was in the mind of the Great Arbiter Yama when he made such a dispensation? These gloomy thoughts stirred Xue Ke to. express his sense of injustice in poetic form. His was a untutored pen, but he did as best he could. -1120 As the flood-dragon flounders on the shore, So our two hearts languish under like privations. When will we drink this bitter cup no more And soar unfettered through the constellations? He read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall. He felt a little self-conscious however, and thought to himself What if someone sees the and makes fun of me He read them through again. Oh who cares! I will put them up. I can read them anyway, to cheer myself up. A final reading made him change his mind yet again, however, and he slipped them between the pages of a bo6k.
We have had no news of them for so long. My heart goes out to them. Whats this about a pearl? asked Jia She. Jia Zheng and Feng Zi-ying gave him a description of the Mother Pearl. We need have no fears, said Jia She, resuming the previous topic of conversation. Nothing can happen to us. Of course not, sir, said Feng, with Her Grace to protect your interests at Court, with such enviable connections and such a host of relations, and with a family that from Lady Jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record... Granted, said Jia Zheng somewhat grimly. But our respectability is more than balanced by our lack of ability and positive achievement. We are living on borrowed time, and one day it will run out. Do lets put an end to this depressing conversation, said Jia She, and have another drink. They did so, and after a few more rounds dinner was served. After dinner, tea was brought in and Fengs page came in and murmured something in his masters ear. Feng took his leave. What was that you said? asked Jia She of the page. Its snowing, sir, and theyve sounded the first evening watch. Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed already more than an inch thick on the ground. I hope your two curios are well wrapped? said Jia Zheng. They are, replied Feng. Dont forget, if you change your minds, Im sure we can come to some agreement about the price. Ill bear it in mind, said Jia Zheng. I shall wait to hear from you then. Its cold - please dont bother to see me out. Goodbye. Jia She and Jia Zheng instructed Jia Lian to accompany Feng Zi-ying to the gate. For the sequel, please read the following chapter. CHAPTER 93 A Zhen retainer seeks shelter in the Jia household And shady activities are revealed behind the Iron Threshold When Feng Zi-ying had gone, Jia Zheng sent for one of the men on the gate. I see theres an invitation here from the Earl of Lin-an, he said. Do you know what sort of an occasion it is? I did inquire, sir, replied the servant. Its only the arrival of a new company of actors at the Prince of Nan-ans. They are said to be first-class, and his lordship wants to celebrate by putting on a dramatic entertainment for a couple of days. Just an informal party for friends, nothing requiring a presentation I should say, sir. As the servant was speaking Jia She came over. Will you be going tomorrow? he asked his brother. I really ought to, replied Jia Zheng. The Earl has always been most affable. Another servant came in from the gate and reported to Jia Zheng Theres a clerk from the Ministry, sir will you please go in to the office tomorrow. The President has some important business for you, so could you be there a little earlier than usual. This received a brief acknowledgement. from Jia Zheng. Two family servants came in next, wh6se job it was to collect the land rents from the Rong-guo country estates. They paid their respects, made their kotow and stood humbly to one side. Are you from Hao-family village? asked Jia Zheng. Yes, sir. Jia Zheng did not inquire any further into their business. He and Jia She talked a little longer and then both left for their apartments, Jia She accompanied by servants bearing lanterns. When they had gone, Jia Lian asked the rent-collectors for their report. Weve been as fast as we could with the tenth-month rents, sir, replied one of them. They were due to arrive tomorrow, but we ran into trouble a few miles from town. Our wagons were seized by a patrol and everything was tipped out onto the ground. They didnt let us get a word in. I tried to explain that it was rent-produce for Rong-guo House, not ordinary goods in transit, but they couldnt have cared less. And when I told our wagoner to keep on going, some of the highway-patrol beat him up and impounded two wagons. Ive come on ahead to report, sir. The only thing now is for you to send someone to the local yamen and demand our goods back. And youd be doing everyone a good turn, if you had those hooligans in the highway-patrol brought to order. You may not know it, but the regular goods-wagons have an even worse time with them. They tip out the contents and make off with them, and if the poor old wagoner dares to open his mouth in protest, he has his brains beaten out.
Tan-chun also called out in an effort to rouse her, and eventually Dai-yu came round. She could not speak, and her only explanation was another gesture towards the window. Tan-chun understood. She opened the door and went outside, to discover the old woman, with a stick in her hand, chasing a scruffy little maid. Im trying to get on with my gardening, she was grumbling. Youve no business to be here. Just wait till we get home and I get my hands on you! Ill learn you! The little girl merely cocked her head, stuck a finger in her mouth and stared at the old woman with a cheeky grin. Have you both taken leave of your senses? exclaimed Tan-chun severely. How dare you use language like that here? When the old woman saw who it was, she pulled herself up smartly and answered with her most ingratiating smile Its my daughters girl here, Miss Tan-chun. She would follow me over you see, and I knew shed only be a nuisance so I was shooing her along home. Dearie me, if Id stopped to think where I was Id never have dared raise my voice Im sure. Thats quite enough, said Tan-chun. Off you go both of you. Miss Lin is not feeling very well today - so hurry up and go! Yes Miss! Straightaway Miss! The old girl bustled off and her granddaughter went running after her. Returning indoors, Tan-chun found Xiang-yun holding Dai-yus hand and crying helplessly, while Nightingale was supporting her mistress with one hand and using her free hand to rub her chest. Slowly the life returned to Dai-yus eyes and she looked up. Tan-chun smiled kindly Did you take offence at what that old woman said? Dai-yu answered with a feeble shake of the head. It was her own granddaughter she was shouting at, Tan-chun went on to explain. She told me all about it. People like her are the end. They never know when to hold their tongue. Dai-yu sighed and held Tan-chuns hand. Oh Tan... she cried feebly, but could say no more. There, you mustnt start worrying, said Tan-chun. Were cousins and cousins should stick by one another. Thats why I came to see you. Besides, I know youre a bit short of help. Listen, all you have to do is take your medicine like a good girl and look on the bright side a bit, and youll soon start to build up your strength. And then we can start having meetings of our poetry club again, and everything will be fine. Tans right, echoed Xiang-yun. Wont that be fun! Oh, if only you knew! sobbed Dai-yu. I feel so weak. I dont think Ill ever pull through. Thats no way to talk, said Tan-chun. We all fall ill, we all have our troubles. Theres no cause for you to be so pessimistic. Be sensible and have a good rest now. Yun and I had better go over to Grannies. Well come and see you again later. If theres anything you need, tell Nightingale and Ill send it over for you. Tan, when you see Grannie, you wont say Im very ill, will you? Please! Tears were streaming down Dai-yus face as she spoke. Just curtsey for me and say Im not feeling very well but its nothing serious and shes not to worry. Of course. Now dont fuss. Just rest and get better. Tan-chun and Xiang-yun went on their way. When they had gone, Nightingale settled Dai-yu down once more. She left all the fetching and carrying to Snow-goose, and herself stayed constantly at Dai-yus side, trying her best not to betray her own distress by shedding any more tears. Dai-yu closed her eyes and lay still for a while. But sleep would not come. The garden outside, which had always been such a haven of quiet and solitude, now seemed alive with sounds - the wind, insects buzzing, birds chattering, the fall of human footsteps, children crying faintly in the distance - all of which drifted in through the window and set her nerves on edge. She told Nightingale to let down the curtains around her bed. Presently Snowgoose appeared, carrying before her in both hands a bowl of Birds Nest Soup, which she gave to Nightingale, who whispered through the curtains Would you like some soup, Miss? A faint yes was heard from inside, and handing the soup back to Snowgoose for the moment, Nightingale climbed up and helped Dai-yu into a comfortable sitting position.
It came to me last night. If we report the whole thing to Grannie, we can get her permission to fetch Ying and move her back to Amaryllis Eyot. Why not? Shell be able to lead her old carefree life, well all be together again, and that Mr Sun can go to hell and take his temper with him! If he dares to try and ask for her back, well simply refuse to let her go. He can come a hundred times, well never give in. Well just say that its Grannies orders, and he wont be able to do a thing. Dont you think its a brilliant plan? My dear child! exclaimed Lady Wang, her voice registering both amusement and motherly vexation at this effusion. There you go again carried away by yet another of your silly ideas! How can you be so hopelessly naive? Cant you see that sooner or later every girl has to leave home, and that once shes married her own family has no business to interfere? She must look to her own future. If fate has been kind to her, well and good. If not, she must learn to live with it all the same. You must know the old rhyme When rooster crows at break of day, All his hen-folk must obey. No choice for a dogs wife But to make the best of a dogs life. -587 Not all the girls can be called to court like your elder sister, you know. Besides, Ying is still an inexperienced wife, and her husband a young man. Their temperaments differ, and if at this early stage they dont get on very well together, thats only to be expected. Given time, when theyve both learned to understand one another better and have a family of their own, things will sort themselves out, Im sure they will. Youre certainly not to breathe a word of this to your grandmother! If I discover that you have, I shall be extremely cross. Now, off you go, Ive heard quite enough of your nonsense. Realizing that his mother was adamant, Bao-yu sat there a while longer in silence, then walked listlessly out of the room. Choking with frustration, he made his way back to the Garden and straight to the Naiads House. The instant he entered the door, he let out a great wail and burst into tears. Dai-yu, who had only just that minute finished washing and putting up her hair, was shocked to see the state he was in and asked in some alarm Whatevers the matter? Whos upset you? Bao-yu, however, was already slumped over the table, sobbing his heart out and far too distraught to reply to her questions. From her chair Dai-yu studied him anxiously for a while, before asking again Well, at least let me know if Im the culprit or not... Thats not it! Its nothing like that! he replied at last, with a despairing motion of his hand. Then why the tears and everything? I just think the sooner we all die the better! Theres no joy left in life! What do you mean? Have you gone quite mad? Im not in the slightest mad. Let me explain and Im sure youll feel as I do. When Ying was here, you saw how she looked, you heard everything she said, didnt you? Why is it that the minute theyre grown up, girls are married off and have to suffer so? When I think of the happy times we all had together when we first started the Crab-flower Club, always inviting each other round for parties and holding poetry contests - there seemed no end of wonderful things to do. And now? Bao-chai has already moved out, which means Caltrop cant come over either, and with Ying gone as well, our band of kindred spirits is being broken up, everything is being spoiled! I had thought of a plan, to get Grannie on our side and rescue Ying. But when I told Mother, she just called me naive and silly and wouldnt take me seriously. So I had to give up the idea. You only have to look around you! Our Gardens altered so much in such a short time. What could become of it in the next few years just doesnt bear thinking about. Now do you see what I mean, and why I cant help despairing? As she listened to all that he was saying, Dai-yu very slowly bowed her head and moved back almost imperceptibly onto the kang. She did not say a word, but only sighed and curled up facing the wall. This was how Nightingale found them when she came in to serve tea. Her attempts to puzzle out what could have happened were cut short by the arrival of Aroma. So this is where you are! she said as she came into the room. Youre wanted at Her Old Ladyships, Master Bao.
They stayed chatting together for a few minutes longer and then Xue Ke returned to his room. He ate his dinner and began to think about Xiu-yan in the Garden, forced by poverty t6 be so utterly dependent on the Jias. The two of them had travelled by the same boat on their original journey to the capital, and he had been able to see for himself that she was a pretty, good-natured girl. How unjust of destiny to give a creature like Xia Jin-gui a life of wealth and luxury and turn her int6 a spoilt shrew,- while for a girl like Xiu-yan there was nothing but hardship! What was in the mind of the Great Arbiter Yama when he made such a dispensation? These gloomy thoughts stirred Xue Ke to. express his sense of injustice in poetic form. His was a untutored pen, but he did as best he could. -1120 As the flood-dragon flounders on the shore, So our two hearts languish under like privations. When will we drink this bitter cup no more And soar unfettered through the constellations? He read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall. He felt a little self-conscious however, and thought to himself What if someone sees the and makes fun of me He read them through again. Oh who cares! I will put them up. I can read them anyway, to cheer myself up. A final reading made him change his mind yet again, however, and he slipped them between the pages of a bo6k. Im old enough for us to be married now, he mused to himself. But who could have foreseen this family crisis, and who knows when it will ever end? What an ordeal for a gentle girl like Xiu-yan! How lonely and wretched she must feel! At that moment the door was pushed open and Moonbeam came in carrying a round covered-tray and a jug of wine, which she deposited with a simpering smile on the table. He rose and asked her to be seated. Still smiling she said Four plates of sweetmeats and a small jug of wine, with Mrs Pans compliments, Master Ke. Its most kind of her, replied Ke, but surely she could have sent one of the younger maids? She didnt need to bother you, Miss Moonbeam. Oh Master Ke, theres no need to be so polite. Its all in the family after all... Mrs Pan knows what trouble youve been put to on account of Mr Pan, and shes been meaning for a long time to thank you herself but was afraid the others might take it the wrong way. In this household, as I think you know, sir, theres a lot goes on beneath the surface. People are only waiting to pounce on a little thing like a present, and then they start inventing all kinds of stories. Thats why shes been ever so slightly discreet and asked me to come over personally with these few things today when no one was looking... She gave Xue Ke a saucy smile and continued And please, no more of that Miss Moonbeam - it makes me feel most uncomfortable. We are only here to serve, and if we can serve Mr Pan, then why not you as well? Xue Ke was young and had a trusting nature. It was odd that Pans womenfolk should suddenly start treating him like this but Moonbeams explanation was a plausible one, he reflected. You can leave the sweetmeats, he said. "But take the wine back with you. Ive never been much of a drinker. Occasionally if pushed to it I can manage a cup, but usually I dont drink at all. Surely you and Mrs Pan knew that? Ask anything else of me! pleaded Moonbeam. But I wouldnt dare take it back - you know Mrs Pans temper. If I tell her you dont drink, shell never believe me shell say-Ive failed in my duty. Reluctantly Xue Ke allowed her to leave the wine too. Moonbeam began to leave, but on reaching the doorway she took a quick look outside and glanced back at Xue Ke with a smile. Pointing in the direction of Xia Jin-guis apartment she said I think she might even come over herself to thank you for all youve done... Xue Ke was not sure how to take this, and began to feel rather nervous. Please convey my thanks to Mrs Pan will you? The weather is cold, and she must be careful not to catch a chill. Besides she is my cousin s wife and there 5 no need for her to go to such lengths. Moonbeam said nothing but tittered and went on her way. At first Xue Ke had been prepared to accept the offering as a genuine expression of gratitude on Jin-guls part. But now Moonbeams suggestive behaviour had aroused his suspicions, and he began to think there was something fishy going on.
Besides, Ying is still an inexperienced wife, and her husband a young man. Their temperaments differ, and if at this early stage they dont get on very well together, thats only to be expected. Given time, when theyve both learned to understand one another better and have a family of their own, things will sort themselves out, Im sure they will. Youre certainly not to breathe a word of this to your grandmother! If I discover that you have, I shall be extremely cross. Now, off you go, Ive heard quite enough of your nonsense. Realizing that his mother was adamant, Bao-yu sat there a while longer in silence, then walked listlessly out of the room. Choking with frustration, he made his way back to the Garden and straight to the Naiads House. The instant he entered the door, he let out a great wail and burst into tears. Dai-yu, who had only just that minute finished washing and putting up her hair, was shocked to see the state he was in and asked in some alarm Whatevers the matter? Whos upset you? Bao-yu, however, was already slumped over the table, sobbing his heart out and far too distraught to reply to her questions. From her chair Dai-yu studied him anxiously for a while, before asking again Well, at least let me know if Im the culprit or not... Thats not it! Its nothing like that! he replied at last, with a despairing motion of his hand. Then why the tears and everything? I just think the sooner we all die the better! Theres no joy left in life! What do you mean? Have you gone quite mad? Im not in the slightest mad. Let me explain and Im sure youll feel as I do. When Ying was here, you saw how she looked, you heard everything she said, didnt you? Why is it that the minute theyre grown up, girls are married off and have to suffer so? When I think of the happy times we all had together when we first started the Crab-flower Club, always inviting each other round for parties and holding poetry contests - there seemed no end of wonderful things to do. And now? Bao-chai has already moved out, which means Caltrop cant come over either, and with Ying gone as well, our band of kindred spirits is being broken up, everything is being spoiled! I had thought of a plan, to get Grannie on our side and rescue Ying. But when I told Mother, she just called me naive and silly and wouldnt take me seriously. So I had to give up the idea. You only have to look around you! Our Gardens altered so much in such a short time. What could become of it in the next few years just doesnt bear thinking about. Now do you see what I mean, and why I cant help despairing? As she listened to all that he was saying, Dai-yu very slowly bowed her head and moved back almost imperceptibly onto the kang. She did not say a word, but only sighed and curled up facing the wall. This was how Nightingale found them when she came in to serve tea. Her attempts to puzzle out what could have happened were cut short by the arrival of Aroma. So this is where you are! she said as she came into the room. Youre wanted at Her Old Ladyships, Master Bao. I thought Id find you here... Recognizing Aromas voice, Dai-yu sat up a little and nodded to her to sit down. Bao-yu noticed that her eyes were red from crying. I got a bit carried away, coz, he said. Please dont take it to heart so. What you must do is look after yourself properly and get fit and well. And when I say that, I mean it. So have a rest now. Im wanted at Grannies. Ill be back. With these words he set off. Whats up with you two then? whispered Aroma. Oh, hes upset about Miss Ying, Dai-yu replied. Im all right. My eyes have been itching and Ive been rubbing them, thats all. Aroma said nothing and hurried out after Bao-yu. He reached Grandmother Jias only to find that she had already retired for her midday nap, and was obliged to go back to Green Delights. In the afternoon he woke from his sleep feeling very bored, and picked up a book to read. Aroma hurried off to make tea, eager to sustain him in his studies. He had chanced upon an anthology of early verse, and as he turned its pages found himself reading a stanza by Cao -1307 Cao Come drink with me and sing, For lifes a fleeting thing. Full many a day has fled Like the morning dew...
I'll get a dealer here right away and have her sold that's the only way to settle this. Then you won't be troubled by her any more. Come, girl!' she said to caltrop, 'get your things together and come with me.' She turned to the other servants. 'Quickly now, go and get the dealer! It doesn't matter what we sell her for just let's get rid of this - this thorn in the flesh, and perhaps we shall have a bit of peace again in this household!' Xue Pan, seeing that his mother was really angry, stood with bowed head throughout this tirade and made no attempt to reply. It was Jin-gui's strident wail from inside the window that answered her. 'Whether you want to sell the girl or not, Mrs Xue, I think you might leave me out of it. Are you implying that I'm such a vinegar-wife that I can't tolerate an inferior? And what do you mean, "thorn in the flesh"? Thorn in whose flesh? Even if I did hate her so much, I wouldn't let him have my own maid to replace her with.' 'What sort of manners are these?' Aunt Xue was trembling all over and her voice was choking. 'Since when did it become acceptable for a young woman to shout at her mother-in-law through the window? I was under the impression that you had been brought up in an educated household. All this shouting and screaming - I can't make out what you are trying to say.' Xue Pan stamped his foot and shouted at Jin-gui despairingly. 'Oh stop, stop! You'll have everyone laughing at us.' Jin-gui, thinking, no doubt, that having gone so far she might as well go all the way, only shouted the louder. 'Why should I care if people laugh at us? Your darling chamber-wife has been trying to do me in. Is this a time to start worrying about whether people are laughing at us or not? Why don't you keep her and sell me instead? Everyone knows how rich the Xues are and how they make use of their money in order to trample on other people. And every- 604 one knows about their fine relations who will always step in and slap anyone down for them who is giving them trouble. what are you waiting for? I dont know why you married me in the first place if you find me so unsatisfactory. Im sure I didnt ask you to come running round to our house, begging and entreating my mother to let you have me as your wife. She rolled about on the bed, weeping and screaming and beating her bosom. Xue Pan was beside himself. Whether he rebuked her, reasoned with her, beat her, or begged her to be silent, it seemed unlikely that anything he did would have much effect. He could only stump in and out of the room, sighing and groaning inarticulately, and concluded by exclaiming, with great bitterness, that he was a very unlucky man. Meanwhile Bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors. Aunt Xue continued to insist that Caltrop must be sold. Bao-chai smilingly expostulated. People like us dont sell servants, Mamma, we only buy them. I think anger is interfering with your judgement. What would people think if they heard that we were planning to sell a servant? They would laugh us to scorn. If Pan and his wife are dissatisfied with Caltrop, let her stay here and work for me. I could do with another maid. If we keep her, it will seem to them like a provocation, said Aunt Xue. Much better send her away and be done with it. I cant see that it makes any difference, said Bao-chai. Provided she never goes into the front part of the house, then as far as they are concerned, it will be just as if she had been sold. Caltrop was already at Aunt Xues feet begging to be allowed to stay and protesting her willingness to serve Bao-chai as a maid. Aunt Xue was obliged to relent. From now on Caltrop spent all her time with Bao-chai and stopped going into the front part of the house altogether. She had at least security now but for all that she was not entirely happy. Sometimes on fine, clear nights she would gaze wet-checked at the moon at other times she might be heard unaccountably sighing to herself while she trimmed a lamp. 605 The fact was that although she had lived with Xue Pan for several years, she had never borne him a child. Some defect in the blood had made her unable to conceive. And now she was ill too. The effect of all the emotional and physical outrage to which she had recently been subjected was that a flood of fiery humour was released into her liver, leading eventually to a drying up of the menstrual fluid.
Are you feeling low again? He feigned a laugh. I was rather depressed earlier on. I needed to be on my own for a bit in a quiet place. I feel better now. I think I shall take a stroll. He walked straight out into the Garden. When he reached the Naiads House, he called from the courtyard Is Cousin Lin at home? Whos that? replied Nightingale. She raised the door-curtain and saw him standing there. Oh its you, Master Bao, she said with a smile. Miss Lin is inside. Please come in and sit down. As Bao-yu went in with her, Dai-yus voice could be heard from the inner room Nightingale, please ask Master Bao to come in and wait a moment. Bao-yu, walking towards the inner room, stopped to admire the pair of calligraphic scrolls that hung one on either side of the doorway. The calligraphy looked recent and had been done on strips of dark purple paper, splashed with gold and decorated with a pattern of clouds and dragons. The two lines ran -347 Through casement green the moon shines brightly still In bamboo chronicles the ancients are but empty words. -347 Bao-yu read them with an appreciative smile and passed through into the inner room. What are you doing, coz? he inquired with a smile. Dai-yu stood up, took a couple of steps towards him, smiled and said Please sit down. Im copying out part of this sutra. I only have two lines left to do. Ill lust finish and then we can sit and chat. She told Snowgoose to pour him some tea. Please carry on writing, said Bao-yu. Dont take any notice of me. His attention had been caught by a painting hanging on the centre wall of the room. It was a vertical scroll showing Chang E, the Moon Goddess, with one of her attendants, and another fairy, also with an attendant who was carrying what seemed to be a long bag containing clothes. Apart from the clouds that surrounded the figures, there were no background details of any kind. The linear style of the picture was reminiscent of the Song master Li Long-mian. It bore the title The Contest in the Cold, written in the antique ba-fen style. Have you hung this picture of the Contest in the Cold here recently, coz? asked Bao-yu. Yes. I remembered it yesterday while they were tidying the room, and so I brought it out and told.them to hang it up. Whats the allusion in the title? Dai-yu laughed. Surely you know! Its such a well-known poem... I cant quite recall it at present, confessed Bao-yu, smiling rather sheepishly. Please tell me. Dont you remember Li Shang-yins. lines Braving the cold, Fairy Frost and Lady Moon Parade their rival charms...? Of course! exclaimed Bao-yu. How exquisite! And what an unusual subject! This is the perfect time of year to have it up too. He continued to amble round the room, inspecting it in a leisurely fashion, and Snowgoose brought him a cup of tea. He drank his tea, and in a few minutes Dai-yu finished the section of the sutra she was copying, and stood up. Forgive me, she said. You know you dont have to stand on ceremony with me, he replied with a smile. He observed that she was wearing a little pale blue fur-lined dress embroidered with flowers, and an ermine-lined sleeveless jacket, while her hair was coiled up in her everyday style and had no flowers in it but Only a flat hairpin of purest gold. Her padded underskirt was pink , and embroidered with flowers. How graceful she seemed, as a jade tree leaning in the wind how gentle, as a fragrant lotus whose petals are moist with dew! Have you been playing your Qin at all these last few days? he inquired. Not for a day or two. This sutra-copying makes my hands too cold. Maybe. its just as well, said Bao-yu. I know the Qin is a fine thing in its way, but I cant see that it does any real good. I have never heard of it bringing prosperity or long life it only seems to cause sorrow and distress. And it must be such a labour to memorize those tablatures. I think, coz, that with your delicate constitution you should avoid anything so strenuous. Dai-yu smiled somewhat scornfully. Is that the Qin you play? Bao-yu went on, pointing to one hanging on the wall. Isnt it rather short? Not really, explained Dai-yu. When I was a little girl and first started learning, I couldnt reach on an ordinary Qin, so we had this one specially made.
So theyve finally broken in my frisky colt! Come along now, your father will be expecting to see you Im sure. Then you must find something nice and relaxing to do. Yes, Grannie. Bao-yu reported to the study. Back already? said Jia Zheng. Well, has the Preceptor given you a scheme of work? Bao-yu rehearsed his timetable Pre-prandium - General Revision Post-prandium - Calligraphy Meridianum - Exegesis and reading of model compositions. Hm... Jia Zheng nodded. Fair enough. Off you go now and keep your grandmother company for a little while. Lets see if you can turn over a new leaf and behave seriously from now on. No more of the old childish nonsense, eh? Go to bed on time, rise early, and attend your classes regularly. Understood? With a string of fluent Yes Sirs, Bao-yu backed smartly out of the study. He hurried over to see his mother, put in another brief appearance at Grandmother Jias - so brief that he hardly had time to turn around - then dashed off once more, impatient to reach the Naiads House. Im back! he called from outside the doorway. The unexpectedness of his arrival, and the explosion of laughing and clapping that announced it, gave Dai-yu quite a turn. Nightingale drew aside the portiere and he walked in and sat himself down. Does my memory fail me, said Dai-yu, or didnt I hear something to the effect that you were going to school today? Havent you been let off rather early? Goodness! exclaimed Bao-yu. I can hardly believe it! Yes, Father did banish me to that place - what an ordeal! I dont know how I stuck it out! I thought Id never see you all again! But now, one glimpse of you has raised my spirit from the dead! How does the old Song go? Twas scarce a day we were apart It seemed three autumns long! Thats just how I feel. Have you been to see Grandmother and your parents? asked Dai-yu. Yes, yes... And the others? Not yet. Shouldnt you go and see them now? But I dont feel like going anywhere. All I want to do is sit here and chat with you for a bit. Anyway Father says from now on its "early to bed and early to rise" so the others will have to wait until tomorrow. Very well then, said Dai-yu. A short stay. Then you must be sensible and go and lie down. But Im not tired, protested Bao-yu. Just fed up with all that. Its doing me a world of good in fact, being here with you, if youd only stop thinking of all these things I should be doing. A faint smile crossed Dai-yus face. Nightingale, would you make Master Bao a cup of Dragon Well tea? We must see that scholarship is suitably rewarded. Nightingale smiled and went to fetch the tea, which she entrusted. to one of the junior maids. Bao-yu reacted smartly. Scholarship! Why, youre almost beginning to sound like one of them! I cant abide all that hypocritical moralizing. And those absurd Octopartite essays, which they have the nerve to call "Propagation of Holy Writ", are nothing more than a shoddy way of worming themselves into a job. The wh6le thing makes me sick! Not content with botching together a few classical tags, they try to hide the fact that they havent got a single original idea of their own by churning out a lot of far-fetched purple passages -and then pride themselves on having been "subtle" and "profound". Urrghhh! Holy Writ! Holy Pretentious Humbug Id call it! I know Father is forcing that sort of thing down my throat at present, and I just have to grin and bear it, but thats no reason for you to go on about it the moment Im back. I know girls dont have to read Octopartites, replied Dai-yu. But when I was little and was having lessons with your cousin Yu-cun, I looked at a few and remember thinking that some were quite well thought out and sensibly written. One or two were even quite subtle, and had a certain delicate charm. They were rather above my head at the time, but I still enjoyed reading them. Its Silly to run them all down. Anyway, I think if you want to get on in life, this is quite an admirable way of doing it. Bao-yu could hardly believe his ears. What had come over Dai-yu? She had never preached wordly wisdom at him like this before. Not wishing to provoke a full-scale argument, however, he restricted himself to a little snort of amazement.
she cried, and flung her arms round the nun, sobbing hysterically. Oh Mother, save me, or Im going to die! The nun called out to her in an attempt to bring her to her senses, and began to massage her gently. The old women brought in tea, and they sat up together till dawn when finally Adamantina dozed off. The nun sent for the doctor, and several doctors came and took her pulses. There were as many differing diagnoses as there were doctors. Excessive worry damaging the spleen phlogistic intrusion into the haematic system offence caused to an evil spirit a combination of internal and external chill. None of these seemed conclusive. Finally a doctor came whose first question after reading her pulses was -294 Did the young lady practise meditation? The women informed him that it was a regular thing with her. -294 And did this illness develop quite suddenly last night? Yes, it did. Indubitably a case of heat in the cardiac orb affording entrance to a vagrant evil spirit. Will she be all right? Luckily the meditation does not seem to have been too far advanced and the spirit was therefore not able to penetrate too deeply. She will most probably recover. He wrote out a prescription for the Dephlogistication of the Cardiac Orb, after one dose of which Adamantina began to show signs of improvement. News of her attack soon spread, and it became a sublect of gossip for the lads in town. All that chastity and religion was bound to be too much for a girl of her age. Especially such an attractive, lively thing... Sooner or later shell get soft on some lucky fellow and run away. A few days later Adamantina was slightly better. But her concentration seemed to have gone and she often found herself drifting off into a dreamlike state. The news did not reach Xi-chun for a few days. She was sitting in her room when Landscape came hurrying in. Miss, have you heard whats happened to Sister Adamantina? No - what is it? I heard Miss Xing and Mrs Zhu talking about it yesterday. Remember that day she was here playing Go? Apparently that very night she had a fit. She was talking about bandits trying to carry her away and all sorts of other strange things. She still hasnt quite recovered. Dont you think its peculiar? Xi-chun thought silently to herself So for all her fastidious purity, Addies worldly karma is still not complete. If only I had been born into a different family! If only I were free to become a nun! I would never be tempted by evil spirits. I know I would be able to subdue every unholy thought and achieve total detachment from the world and all its entanglements. With this thought she experienced a sudden sense of illumination, which she tried to express in the following gtha Since at first there was no space, Things can have no proper place. From Void all comes To Void must all return. She told a maid to light some incense, and meditated for a while. Then she took down her Go Handbook and began looking through it, studying the tactics 6f such famous Go Masters of old as Kong Rong and Wang Ji-xin. There was Crab Wrapped in Lotus Leaves, and Golden Oriole Strikes Hare but she found neither of these very impressive, and Corner Kill in Thirty Six Moves she found too hard to understand and harder still to remember. It was Dragon-chain of Ten Galloping Horses that really caught her fancy. She was still working it out, when she heard someone come into the courtyard and call out Landscape! But to know who this visitor was, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 88 Bao-yu gratifies his grandmother by praising a fatherless child Cousin Zhen rectifies family discipline by chastising two unruly servants Xi-chun was puzzling over her Go Handbook when she heard someone calling outside Landscape! She recognized the voice as Faithfuls. Landscape went out into the courtyard, and reappeared with Faithful, followed by a younger maid carrying a small parcel wrapped in yellow silk. Whats that? asked Xi-chun, her curiosity aroused. Faithful explained. Next year is Her Old Ladyships eighty-first birthday, and since eighty-one is nine times nine, she has pledged herself to hold a nine-day mass, and to have three thousand six hundred and fifty-one copies made of the Sutra of the Immaculate Diamond. That has all been handed out to copyists. But there is a popular saying "If the Diamond Sutra is the outer shell of the magic, its core is the Sutra of the Heart of Wisdom." In other words, to enhance ones merit, one should slip in a Heart Sutra too. So now Her Old Ladyship wants copies of that as well, and because of its greater importance as scripture and its connection with Our Lady of Mercy, she wants three hundred and sixty-five copies to be done by the young ladies and young mistresses of the family.
Her polite refusals were soon over-ruled by Grandmother Jia Go on, you must, dear. After all, this is your day too! Really? exclaimed Aunt Xue, rising to her feet. Is Miss Lin celebrating something today as well? Grandmother Jia laughed Its her birthday! Oh goodness, I quite forgot! How awful of me! Aunt Xue went up to Dai-yu Im so sorry. I hope youll forgive me for being so forgetful. I must ask Bao-qin to call on you later and wish you happy returns properly. Please dont go to such trouble on my account, murmured Dai-yu with a smile. She looked around her as they all sat down, and noticed that Bao-chai had not come. I hope Cousin Chai isnt ill or anything. Why couldnt she come today? She was going to, replied Aunt Xue. But we needed someone to look after things at home, so in the end she had to stay behind. Dai-yu flushed and said with a slightly puzzled smile Surely now that Cousin Pans married theres no need for her to stay at home? She probably didnt feel in the mood for all the noise and excitement. Im sorry she didnt come. I miss her such a lot. Aunt Xue smiled How very sweet of you, dear. She thinks of you all a great deal too. In a day or two I must tell her to come over and have a chat. The maids were already pouring wine and setting out dishes on the tables, while outside in the courtyard the show had begun. It opened, predictably enough, with a couple of festive pieces. The third selection, however, turned out to be something of a novelty. A chorus of Golden Pages and Jade Maidens came onto the stage, fairy streamers fluttering and flags aloft, to reveal in their midst a gorgeously attired lady, her head draped in black, her costume shimmering with the celestial hues of the Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Jacket. She or rather he, for the part was played by a female impersonator sang a short aria and then left the stage. None of the family could identify the piece at. all, but they overheard one of the guests saying That was "The Transfiguration", from one of their latest productions, "The Palace of Pearls". It tells the story of Chang E, who comes down to earth from her palace in the moon and is about to give her hand to her mortal lover when the Goddess of Mercy opens her eyes to the truth, and she dies before the marriage can take place. In that scene, she is being wafted up to the moon. Didnt you catch the words of her aria? -1467 Tis Love that rules the minds of men, And of this Truth Eternal Obscures all trace That even harvest moons must wane And purest beauty vernal Fade from grace. Alas, twas Mortal Love That veiled my sight, And all but stole me From my Orb of Light. Next on the programme was A Wife Eats Husks, from The Story of the Lute, followed by Bodhidharma and his Disciple Crossing the River, from The Pilgrims Path. This last scene was full of the most spectacular feats of acrobatic mime and other phantasmagorical effects. The excitement had just reached its height when one of the Xue familys servants, his face dripping with sweat, burst into the courtyard auditorium and hurried over to Xue Kes table Master Ke! Come home quickly! And send word in to Madam that she must come too. Its very urgent! Whats happened? asked Xue Ke. Ill tell you when we get home, sir! panted the boy. Without even stopping to thank his hosts, Xue Ke followed the boy out of the courtyard, sending one of the Jia maids in with a message to the ladies enclosure. When Aunt Xue heard the news, she went white in the face. Taking Bao-qin with her, she made a distracted farewell and went straight out to her carriage, leaving the whole assembly in a state of high alarm. We had better send someone over with them, said Grandmother Jia. I am sure everyone is most anxious to learn what this is all about. They all agreed. The players continued with their programme. But we must leave them and follow Aunt Xue, who on her arrival at home saw two yamen runners waiting in the inner gateway. With them were some employees from the family pawnshop. When Mrs Xue arrives, they were saying, shell be able to explain everything. When the yamen runners saw this elderly lady sweeping up to the gate with her large retinue of male and female attendants, and realized the distinguished position of the. person they were dealing with, they stood to attention and let her pass.
When Dai-ru returned to the classroom, Bao-yu was already sitting at a small rosewood desk in the south-west corner of the room, by the window. He had two sets of texts and a meagre-looking volume of model compositions stacked in a pile on his right. Tealeaf was instructed to put his paper, ink, brush and inkstone away in the drawer of the desk. I understand you have been ill, Bao-yu, said Dai-ru. I hope you are quite recovered? -258 Bao-yu rose to his feet. Quite recovered, thank you sir. We must see to it that you apply yourself with zeal from now on. Your father is most insistent that you should do well. Start by revising the texts you have already memorized. Your timetable will be as follows -1467 Pre-prandium - General Revision Post-prandium - Calligraphy Meridianum - Exegesis And conclude the days work by reciting quietly to yourself a few model compositions. That should do for the time being. -294 Yes sir. As Bao-yu sat down again, he glanced around him. Most of the old faces from the Jokey Jin days were gone, and in their place were quite a few new boys. He reflected on their exceptionally boorish appearance, and the face of Qin Zhong came suddenly into his mind. Since the death of his friend there had been no one to keep him company in his studies, no one to share his innermost thoughts. He was overwhelmed with a sense of grief and loneliness, and sat silently staring at his books. Not long afterwards Dai-ru came over to say that as this was his first day he could leave early. Tomorrow, he said, I shall go through a passage with you. On second thoughts, to do justice to your natural intelligence, I should like you to expound a passage or two for me. That will give me a clearer idea of the sort of work you have been doing and the standard you have reached. Bao-yus heart was already thumping. But to learn how he fared the following day, you must read the next chapter. CHAPTER 82 An 0 1d pedant tries to instil some Moral Philosophy into his incorrigible pupil And the ailing Naiad, in a nightmare, confronts the spectres of her fevered mind Bravo! cried Grandmother Jia as Bao-yu came in from school. So theyve finally broken in my frisky colt! Come along now, your father will be expecting to see you Im sure. Then you must find something nice and relaxing to do. Yes, Grannie. Bao-yu reported to the study. Back already? said Jia Zheng. Well, has the Preceptor given you a scheme of work? Bao-yu rehearsed his timetable Pre-prandium - General Revision Post-prandium - Calligraphy Meridianum - Exegesis and reading of model compositions. Hm... Jia Zheng nodded. Fair enough. Off you go now and keep your grandmother company for a little while. Lets see if you can turn over a new leaf and behave seriously from now on. No more of the old childish nonsense, eh? Go to bed on time, rise early, and attend your classes regularly. Understood? With a string of fluent Yes Sirs, Bao-yu backed smartly out of the study. He hurried over to see his mother, put in another brief appearance at Grandmother Jias - so brief that he hardly had time to turn around - then dashed off once more, impatient to reach the Naiads House. Im back! he called from outside the doorway. The unexpectedness of his arrival, and the explosion of laughing and clapping that announced it, gave Dai-yu quite a turn. Nightingale drew aside the portiere and he walked in and sat himself down. Does my memory fail me, said Dai-yu, or didnt I hear something to the effect that you were going to school today? Havent you been let off rather early? Goodness! exclaimed Bao-yu. I can hardly believe it! Yes, Father did banish me to that place - what an ordeal! I dont know how I stuck it out!

All I want to do is sit here and chat with you for a bit.
What then? Xi-feng went over and whispered at some length in Lady Wangs ear. Lady Wang nodded, smiled and said Well, well... An ingenious idea, I must say! Come on, you two! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Let me in on the secret what are you whispering about? Xi-feng was afraid that Grandmother J ia might not grasp her idea at once, and might inadvertently give the game away. She leant across and whispered in the old ladys ear. Grandmother Jia did seem rather puzzled at first. Xi-feng smiled, and added a few more words of explanation. Grandmother Jia finally said with a smile Why not? But isnt it rather hard on Bao-chai? And what about Miss Lin? What if she gets to hear of it? We shall only tell Bao-yu replied Xi-feng. No one else will be allowed to mention it. That way no one need know. A maid came in and informed them that Mr Lian had returned. Lady Wang was worried that Grandmother Jia might inquire into the distressing news that had occasioned his journey, and cast a meaningful glance in Xifengs direction. Xi-feng went out to intercept him, and signalled to him with her lips to accompany her to Lady Wangs apartment and wait there. It was not long before Lady Wang came in, to find Xi-feng red-eyed from weeping. Jia Lian paid his respects to Lady Wang, and gave her an account of the funeral arrangements for Wang Zi-teng at Ten Mile Village. He has been posthumously awarded the rank of Grand Secretary, by Imperial Decree, Jia Lian went on, and the title Lord Wen-qin. The Court has given instructions for the family to accompany the coffin en cortege to Nanking, and all local mandarins have been instructed to look after them en route. The whole family left yesterday for the South. Uncles widow asked me to convey her respects. She said that there was so much she wanted to talk to you about, but that she would not be able to come to the capital at present. My brother-in-law Wang Ren is coming here, so I heard, and if they meet him on the way, they will tell him to come and give us the latest news. Lady Wang responded to all of this with a grief that the reader can surely imagine. Why dont you lie down for a while, Aunt? said Xi-feng. In the evening, we can talk further about Bao-yus affairs. Having uttered these comforting words, Xi-feng returned with Jia Lian to her own apartment, where she informed him of all that had been decided and told him to give instructions for the cleaning and refurbishing of the courtyard that was to be the couples new home. But of this no more for the present. A day or two after these events, Dai-yu, having eaten her breakfast, decided to take Nightingale with her to visit Grandmother Jia. She wanted to pay her respects, and also thought the visit might provide some sort of distraction for herself. She had hardly left the Naiads House, when she remembered that she had left her handkerchief at home, and sent Nightingale back to fetch it, saying that she would walk ahead slowly and wait for her to catch up. She had just reached the corner behind the rockery at Drenched Blossoms Bridge - the very spot where she had once buried the flowers with Bao-yu - when all of a sudden she heard the sound of sobbing. She stopped at once and listened. She could not tell whose voice it was, nor could she distinguish what it was that the voice was complaining of, so tearfully and at such length. It really was most puzzling. She moved forward again cautiously and as she turned the corner, saw before her the source of the sobbing, a maid with large eyes and thick-set eyebrows. Before setting eyes on this girl, Dai-yu had guessed that one of the many maids in the Jia household must have had an unhappy. love-affair, and had come here to cry her heart out in secret. But now she laughed at the very idea. How could such an ungainly creature as this know the meaning of love? she thought to herself. This must be one of the odd-job girls, who has probably been scolded by one of the senior maids. She looked more closely, but still could not place the girl. Seeing Dai-yu, the maid ceased her weeping, wiped her cheeks, and rose to her feet. Come now, what are you so upset about? inquired Dai-yu. Oh Miss Lin! replied the maid, amid fresh tears. Tell me if you think it fair.
It was because the old lady thought so highly of Skybright that she later on gave her as a maidservant to her beloved grandson. Skybright had no recollection of her parents or of the place where she was born. The only relation she knew of was a cousin somewhat older than herself, said to be her fathers sisters son, who was in bondservice elsewhere. After her instalment at the mansion she begged Lai Das wife to have this cousin purchased too and find him some employment with the Jias. The stewardess was touched by the gratitude and respect that Skybright continued to show her after her advancement. At her insistence Lai Da purchased the cousin, gave him a small job as a buyer, and even provided him with a wife. 543 -880 Unfortunately Skybrights cousin was a timorous, poor spirited creature, whereas the wife Lai Da had chosen for him was a lively and rather attractive young woman. Finding her husband unable to provide her with what she wanted, she soon took to going out every day, dressed up to the nines, to exercise her charms on the other servants. She was aided in this by a highly expressive pair of eyes which seldom failed to convey their message. The men were drawn towards her irresistibly, like flies towards carrion, so that there was seldom any lack of volunteers to fill the gap left by her neglectful husband. The couple lived in an apartment not far from the rear side gate of the Garden, and it was to this place that Skybright was taken after her dismissal. The cousins young wife had little stomach for nursing a sick relation, and as soon as she had eaten, was off on her customary rounds, leaving Skybright alone and untended in the outer room. When Bao-yu arrived at the house, he told the old woman who had brought him to wait at the gate and keep a look-out while he went inside. Raising the cotton door-curtain he looked into the room. He could see Skybright at once, lying on an old rush mat on the kang fortunately she still had her own bedding but no one else appeared to be at home, and he wondered for a moment what he should do then, going over to the kang, he plucked timidly at the quilt in which she was wrapped and gently called her name. His eyes were full of tears. Skybright, who had been ill to start with, had been made even more so by the detestable things said to her by her cousin and his wife since her arrival. After coughing through most of the day, she had recently dozed off into a fitful sleep, and it was not until Bao-yu had called her name for the second time that she opened her eyes. What surprise, delight, sorrow, anguish all mixed in one when she saw who it was! She gripped his hand tightly in hers, but for a long time she could only sob. At last she managed to speak. I didnt think I should ever see you again. After that she coughed and coughed. Bao-yu was sobbing now himself. 544 Holy Name, its a good job youve come! she said. Could you get me half a cup of tea? Im so thirsty, but though Ive called and called, no one ever comes. Bao-yu hurriedly wiped his eyes. Wheres the tea? Its over there on the stove, said Skybright. Bao-yu looked at the brick-and-mud-built stove against the wall. There was only a sort of blackened earthenware skillet on it that bore no resemblance to a tea-pot. He found a teacup on the table whose greasy, rancid odour reached his nostrils even before he picked it up. Having located some water, he washed it twice, rinsed it twice, dried it with his handkerchief, sniffed it it still smelt and half filled it with a dusky, reddish liquid from the skillet. Was it tea? He tasted it dubiously. It had a bitter, acrid taste with only a slight suggestion of tea about it. Thats tea, said Skybright, who had raised herself on the pillow. Please let me have it. You cant expect it to be as good as ours. Bao-yu handed it to her and she gulped it down greedily as if it were the most delicious nectar. He watched her with tears running down his cheeks, suddenly ashamed of his own fastidiousness. If theres anything you want to tell me, he said, youd better tell me now, while theres nobody else about. What have I got to tell? said Skybright. Im living now from day to day and from hour to hour. I know Im done for it cant be more than four or five days now at the most.
Why did you have to bring this? asked Bao-yu. Who gave it to you? He had recognized it at once as the Peacock Gold snow-cape, the one that Skybright had so bravely mended for him during her last illness. The maids wrapped it up and told me to bring it, replied Tealeaf. Well, Im not feeling particularly cold,said Bao-yu. I dont think Ill wear it just now. You may as well wrap it up again. The Preceptor supposed that Bao-yu was reluctant to spoil so fine a garment, and noted with gratification this evidence of thrift. Please put it on, Master Bao! pleaded Tealeaf. For my sake! You know Ill get the blame if you catch a cold. With extreme reluctance Bao-yu put it on, sat down again and stared glumly at his books. The Preceptor presumed that he was concentrating once more on his studies and gave the incident no further thought. That afternoon, when the days lessons were over, Baoyu said that he felt unwell and asked to be excused from school the next day. Dai-ru had, of late, come to view his students in a more lenient light, more as compani9ns with whom to while away his old age. His own health was poor, and he was glad to lessen his burden of work by the judicious dispensation of sick-leave. Besides, he knew that Sir Zheng had more important matters on his mind, and that Grandmother Jia always indulged her favourite grandson. With a nod he indicated to Bao-yu that his request was granted. Bao-yu went straight home. After calling briefly on his mother and grandmother, neither of whom questioned his plea of illness, he returned to the Garden. He was not at all his usual smiling talkative self, in fact he hardly said a word to Aroma and the others, but lay down dressed as he was on the kang. Dinners ready, said Aroma. Do you want it now, or will you wait till later? Bao-yu I wont have anything to eat. Im not feeling well. You just have yours. Aroma Well, you might at least take off that lovely cape. Youll crumple it and ruin it. Bao-yu I want to keep it on. Aroma Its not just the cape that Im worried about. Look how carefully its been darned. Youll spoil the stitching. This touched Bao-yu to the quick. He heaved a deep sigh. Oh all right! Put it away then. Wrap it up carefully. I shall never wear it again. He stood up to take it off. Aroma came over to take it from him, but he had already begun to fold it himself Why are you being so industrious today? she asked in surprise. He made no reply but went on folding. Wheres the wrapper? he asked when he had finished. Musk handed it to him, and as he carefully wrapped the cape, she turned to give Aroma a wink. Bao-yu took no notice of them but sat down, looking thoroughly dejected. The clock on the shelf chimed, and he glanced down at his watch. It was already half-past five. Shortly afterwards a junior maid came in to light the lamps. If you wont have a proper meal, at least have a little hot congee, pleaded Aroma. If you go to bed on an empty stomach you could easily catch a fever. And then think of all the trouble well have. He shook his head. Im not hungry. Id only feel worse if I tried to force something down. Well in that case, said Aroma, you should at least have an early night. She and Musk made his bed and Bao-yu lay down. He tossed and turned, but found it quite impossible to get to sleep. Finally, just before dawn, he dozed off, only to awake again half an hour later. Aroma and Musk were already up and about. I heard you tossing and turning till the early hours, said Aroma. I didnt dare disturb you. Then I fell asleep myself. Did you manage to sleep in the end? A bit. But I woke up again almost at once. -347 Have you got a pain anywhere? No. I just feel depressed. Will you be going to school today? No. I asked for the day off yesterday. I thought I might go for a walk in the Garden to try and throw off this depression. But I think it will be too cold. Will you tell them to clear a room for me and put an incense burner and my writing things in it? I wont need you today. I just want to sit quietly on my own for a while. Tell the others I dont want to be disturbed.
Ah, dear Cousin! You, I know, have the heart to share my present trials, as once you shared the joys of that golden autumn, when harmony and conviviality prevailed. Then, united beneath the aegis of the Crab-flower Club, we tasted crustacean delicacies and contemplated chrysanthemums. Once, I recall, you questioned the flowers thus "Who world disdainer, shares your hiding-place? Of all the flowers, why do yours bloom so late?" -347 The lines never fail to rive my heart. For are not you and I late blooms, that tremble at the approaching chill? I have endeavoured to compose a lament in four stanzas, to express these feelings of mine. I beg you, read it not as a piece of literary art, but as a simple vessel for my tears. -8960 Your Affectionate Cousin, Bao-chai. The poem was attached. -946 Alas! the seasons turn, and turning bring once more The chill of autumn to our joy-forsaken door. We have a flower, flos matTis is its name, Heartsease. Poor Mother! What art can heal thy grief, or ease thy heart? My soul aches for thee. The scudding clouds by biting autumn winds are blown The courtyard-walk with withered leaves is thickly strewn. Whither shall I go? To whom shall I turn? My love is gone, And only an anguish too deep for words remains. My heart is desolate. The mighty sturgeon has his pool The stork upon the dam makes his habitation. Fish in scaly armour, Birds in serried plumes, find protection. In my distress I question that inscrutable expanse O bowels of earth! O boundless sky! -946 Will ye not hearken to my cry? Above, the twinkling Milky Way The air cold, Slanting moonlight, The water-clock sunk past midnight. My restless heart grieves still I read once more this sad lament, Before entrusting it to you, My kindred soul and friend! Dai-yu was deeply moved. She knew Id be able to understand! she thought to herself. Thats why she wrote to me rather than anyone else. She was lost in thought, when a voice called from outside Is Cousin Lin at home? Refolding the letter, she replied in a somewhat distant tone Whos that? Her visitors were already on their way into the room -Tan-chun, Shi Xiang-yun and the two Li sisters. The girls exchanged greetings, and Snowgoose served them with tea. During the conversation that followed, Dai-yu found her thoughts turning back to the gathering, two years earlier, at which they had written the chrysanthemum poems Dont you think its strange? she remarked to the others. Since Cousin Chai moved out of the Garden, shes only been to see us a couple of times all together. And now it seems as though nothing will induce her to come. Im beginning to wonder if shell ever visit us again. Tan-chun smiled. Of course she will! Its just that at the moment things are a bit difficult Cousin Pans wife is rather a tricky sort of person, Aunt Xue is getting on in years, and with this latest trouble of Pans on top of everything else, Chai really is needed to look after things at home. Its not like the old days, when she was free to do as she pleased. As she spoke, they heard a sudden gust of wind outside, and a patter of falling leaves against the paper-covered window. A faint scent drifted into the room. They all tried to guess what flower it could be coming from. Its very like cassia-blossom, suggested Dai-yu. Tan-chun laughed. Still a southerner at heart! Its the ninth month, long past cassia-time. Dai-yu smiled. Youre right. But then I didnt say it was, only very like... Anyway, Tan, Xiang-yun butted in, you cant talk. Dont you know the lines -1574 The lotus fragrance drifts for miles, The cassia blooms till autumns end? In the South, the late-flowering cassia is at its best now. Its just that youve never seen it. If you ever have a chance to go to the South, youll be able to see it for yourself. And what should I be doing in the South? retorted Tan-chun with a crushing smile. Anyway, I knew all that ages ago, thanks very much... The Li sisters grinned at each other. You never know, Tan, said Dai-yu. We are "fairy earthlings, fleet of foot", thats what the old proverb says.
Faithful and Amber can eat with you for company, said Grandmother Jia. Good! said You-shi. I was about to suggest that. I like to see people eating together, said Grandmother Jia. She pointed to Butterfly. Now heres a good girl. Why shouldnt she eat with you as well? Go on, child! Go and eat with your mistress. As long as you are here with me, it doesnt matter if you break the rules for once. Come on! said You-shi to the maid encouragingly. Dont pretend to be bashful! Grandmother Jia stopped walking up and down and stood with her hands clasped behind her back to watch them eat. It suddenly struck her that the rice being served was the plain white rice normally eaten by the servants and that You-shi, too, was eating it. Why are you giving Mrs Zhen this stuff? she asked them. There isnt any of Your Old Ladyships rice left, said the maids. You had an extra young lady eating with you today, dont forget. Meals are made to measure nowadays, said Faithful. We cant afford to be extravagant the way we used to be. There have been so many floods and droughts during the past few years, said Lady Wang. Our farms havent been able to make up their quotas. These special kinds of rice are particularly hard to come by. We have had to start rationing them rather carefully. 490 Even the cleverest housewife cant make rice-gruel without rice. Grandmother Jia quoted the proverb amidst general laughter. Faithful turned to address the women waiting outside the door. If Her Old Ladyships rice is all finished, you can get the rice that Miss Tan would have eaten if she hadnt been eating with us and bring it here for Mrs Zhen. No need, said You-shi. What Ive got here is quite enough for me. I dare say it is, said Faithful, but what about me? The women hurried off to fetch the rice. Presently Lady Wang went off to have dinner in her own apartment, leaving You-shi to entertain Grandmother Jia. The time passed quickly, with much good-humoured teasing and laughter, and the first watch had already begun before Grandmother Jia noticed how late it was getting. Youd better be getting back now, she told You-shi. You-shi took her leave. Outside the inner gate she got into her waiting carriage. Her women pulled the blind down, then, taking all the maids with them except Butterfly, who was riding in the carriage with her mistress, hurried on ahead so that they could be waiting for You-shi when she arrived in the other mansion. The men from both gates walked some way along the street to keep it clear of pedestrians while six or seven pages pushed and pulled the carriage it seemed too short a distance and too late an hour for mules as far as the interior of the Ning-guo gateway. There the pages retired, old w6men came forward and raised the blind, and Butterfly dismounted and helped out her mistress. You-shi noticed that there were four or five large carriages waiting below the stone lions which flanked the gate and commented to Butterfly on their presence. I wonder how many horses there are in the stables? If this number came by carriage, you may be sure that a much greater number will have come on horseback. As she and Butterfly entered the outer courtyard, Jia Rongs wife at the head of a party of maids and older women carrying lanterns advanced to meet them. 491 Ive been dying for I dont know how long to have a look at the men while they are gambling, said You-shi, but so far I havent had an opportunity. Tonight is the best chance I shall ever get. Lets go along the wall in front of the windows so that we can peep in at them. The women with lanterns made a detour towards the building in which the men were congregated. One of them went ahead and warned the pages waiting outside not to announce their arrival to the men or make any other noise that would warn those inside of their coming. You-shi and her party were thus able to steal right up to the windows and could hear everything that was going on inside. Among the medley of sounds that met their ears, numbers seemed to predominate, some uttered exultantly and with raucous shouts of laughter, others angrily or despairingly and to the accompaniment of curses and profanities. Cousin Zhen had found the ban on amusements during the seemingly interminable period of mourning for Jia Jing which convention imposed on him extremely irksome. Archery, for some reason, was permitted, and a few months previously he had hit on archery as a means of getting round the ban.
Hearing the tapping and yet unable to detect a presence outside the window, he didnt know what to think. He did up his gown again and sat down abstractedly by the lamp. He took a sweetmeat from the table and turned it over restlessly in his hand, studying it from every angle. Suddenly something made him look round. A small peephole of the lick-and-spittle variety had appeared in the window. Going across and putting his eye to the hole, he squinted through and received a blast of air in the face that quite startled the wits out of him. It was followed by another splutter of laughter. Rushing back, he blew out the. lamp and lay down in the darkness, holding his breath. A voice came from outside Are you going to sleep without trying the wine and sweetmeats? Xue Ke recognized it as Moonbeams voice but said nothing and lay there pretending to be asleep. A few seconds later, in a disgruntled tone Miserable spoilsport! You dont know what youre missing! This time he could not identify the voice with any certainty. It sounded like Moonbeam, but there was something of Xia Jin-guis expression in it too. Whoever it was, there was no longer any doubt in his mind as to their intentions. He tossed and turned for most of that night, and it was not until after five oclock that he finally fell asleep. Shortly after dawn someone knocked at the door. Whos there? Xue Ke called out. No answer. He got out of bed to open the door and saw Moonbeam, her hair combed simply back, wearing a tight little sleeveless jacket, its gold-striped neck-line cut in the shape of a guitar, its buttons seductively undone. She had a new-looking viridian scarf around her neck and instead of a skirt was sporting pomegranate-red linedpantaloons of a flowery design, and a pair of smart red embroided slippers. She had come before doing her morning toilet, to remove the sweetmeats before the rest of the household arose. Though rather taken aback to see her advancing into his room en nglig, he asked politely Why are you up so early this morning? Moonbeam blushed in reply, piled the sweetmeats onto one plate and went out holding it in both hands. Xue Ke interpreted this as pique at her failure o seduce him the previous evening. Oh well, he thought to himself, its too bad if Ive annoyed them. At least theyll lose interest and leave me alone. He decided that he could forget about the whole business, and called for water to wash his face. It would be wise, he decided, to stay at home and take a couple pf days rest, for his own health and peace of mind, and also to avoid tile unwelcome attentions of Xue Pans so-called friends, who seeing the Xue family deprived of its head and observing his own youth and inexperience, had caught the scent of money in the air. Some of them would have been content to act as messengers some professed a knowledge of legal phraseology or claimed contacts behind the scenes and offered to deliver bribes to the officials and minions involved in the case others advised him to make some money out of it for himself, while a few even tried scaring him with false rumours. Since he first encountered them, Xue Ke had done his utmost to avoid these unsavoury elements, but was aware that by openly rebuffing them he might create further trouble for himself. The only safe course, he concluded, was to lie low at home and await the confirmation of Pans sentence. To return to Xia Jin-gui. She had sent Moonbeam over on the previous night with the wine and sweetmeats in order to explore Xue Kes susceptibility to her charms. When Moonbeam returned and described in detail what had happened, Jin-gui realized that she had miscalculated and that by pursuing such a strategy she would cause herself much pointless trouble and forfeit Moonbeams respect. If she were to disguise her disappointment with a few words of feigned indifference, that would do nothing to relieve her own hankering after Xue Ke. Unable for the present to think of any other means of achieving her ends, she sat in moody silence. She was unaware that Moonbeam had been thinking along exactly the same lines as herself. Moonbeam too reckoned that Xue Pan might not be back for some time and felt in dire need of a substitute. She had only been held back from procuring one by the fear of being caught at it by Jin-gui. Now that Jin-gui had made the first move, however, Moonbeam was only too glad to cruise along in her wake. She would step in first and become Xue Kes mistress, and Jin-gui would have no choice but to accept the fait accompli.
exclaimed Aroma. The pair of you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves! Fancy a grown man like him passing himself off as your son! He ought to know better! And as for you... Father Bao indeed! Why youre not even... Aroma stopped short. She blushed and gave a little smile. Bao-yu knew what she meant. Who knows? he quipped. Perhaps he thought of me as his Spiritual Father, like that -747 celebrated celibate of yore whose children could be numbered by the score... I only agreed to it because I thought he was quite clever and a likeable sort of fellow if hes changed his mind, I really couldnt care less. If you want to know, he gives me the creeps, Aroma continued, as Bao-yu opened the letter. Hes for ever trying to worm his way in, and looks so shifty about it. I wouldnt trust him an inch. Bao-yu was too absorbed in examining the contents of the letter to take any notice of what she was saying. She studied his face as he read. A frown, then a smile, which soon gave way to a shake of the head, and finally an expression of impatience. When he seemed to have finished, she asked Whats it all about then? By way of response Bao-yu tore the letter into shreds. Aroma thought it wiser to change the subject. Are you planning to do some work after dinner or not? What a cad! She smiled at this capricious reply Well, what was it about? Oh who cares! Lets have dinner. Then Im going straight to bed. I feel quite sick! He told one of the junior maids to light a fire and threw the remains of Yuns letter into it. Supper was soon served, but Bao-yu was in no mood for it and only sat there staring glumly in front of him. After trying every form of pressure and persuasion Aroma finally succeeded in making him swallow a mouthful, only to see him put his bowl down once more and flop listlessly onto his bed. Suddenly he began to cry. Neither she nor Musk had the slightest idea what was the matter. "Come on, youve got to tell us, protested Musk. Its all this Yuns fault, or whatever his wretched name is. I cant imagine what his stupid letter was all about, to have such a queer effect on you, laughing one minute, crying your heart out the next. If you carry on in this strange way much longer, youll worry us to death, indeed you will! She was on the verge of tears herself. Aroma could not help smiling Musky dear, dont you go making things worse, please. Hes got quite enough on his mind as it is. Unless of course you want people to think the letter had something to do with you... Well, thats a stupid remark I must say! replied Musk. You dont know what it said, anyway. It might have been anything. Why drag me into it? Unless of course its got something to do with you... Before Aroma could reply there was a splutter of laughter from the bed and Bao-yu sat up, gave his clothes a shake and said to them both Come on, thats enough. Lets go to sleep. Ive got to work early in the morning. With these words he settled himself down and went to sleep. The night passed uneventfully, and next morning, after completing his toilet, he set off for school. He had just walked 6ut of the doorway when he remembered something and, calling to Tealeaf to wait, turned back. Musk! She came hurrying out. Whats the matter? If Yun comes today, tell him not to make a nuisance of himself here again or Ill report him to Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng. I will. Bao-yu set off once more, and was on his way out when who should come bustling in but J ia Yun himself. When he saw Bao-yu he promptly saluted and said My heartiest congratulations, Uncle! Bao-yu took this as a reference to th,e business contained in the previous days letter and replied curtly You tactless meddling fool! It makes no difference to you if there are things people care about. But Uncle! protested Yun with a smug smile. If you dont believe me, take a look for yourself. The crowds are outside the gate. What are you talking about? snapped Bao-yu, the anger rising in his voice. At that moment a wave of shouting and cheering came wafting in from the street outside. Hear that! exclaimed Jia Yun. Now will you believe me? Bao-yu was more perplexed than ever. He could distinguish a few words above the general din Have you people no manners?
No crystal, ice, jade, silver, light, bright, white - anything of that sort. I want something original that will give me some idea of what you have been doing with your mind during this past year or two. Bao-yu found these injunctions by no means uncongenial, and having succeeded, in quite a short time, in thinking of a quatrain, he wrote it out and handed it to his father. Jia Zheng said nothing, but was observed to nod after he had finished reading it which Grandmother Jia interpreted to mean that he could not have found the poem too bad. Well? she asked him. Jia Zheng wanted to make her happy. Not at all bad, he said. Its a pity he wont study, but his verses are really quite elegant. Well, thats all right then, said Grandmother Jia. You ought to encourage the boy, so that next time he tries even harder. You are quite right, said Jia Zheng. He turned to one of the old women in attendance. Tell my boys to get out two of the fans I brought back with me from the South, will you, and give them to Bao-yu for me. Bao-yu came forward and kotowed. After he had gone back to his seat, the game continued. This time the branch stopped in Jia Shes hand. He drank his wine and then told the following story. This one is about a dutiful son whose mother was ill. He tried everywhere to get a doctor for her, but couldnt find one, so in the end he was reduced to calling in an old woman who practised acupuncture. Now this old dame knew nothing of physiology, nevertheless she assured the son that it was inflammation of the heart that his mother was suffering from and that she could cure it instantly with her needle. The son became very alarmed. If metal in any form comes into contact with the heart, he said, it means death. Surely youre not going to put a needle in her heart? No, no, I shant put it in the heart, said the old woman. I mean to put it in here, over the ribs. 505 But thats too far from the heart, said the son. Surely if you put it in there, it wont do any good? Oh yes it will, said the old woman. A mothers heart always inclines towards one side. The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly, Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dames acupuncture myself. Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued. This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan. Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly peculiar. When Bao-yus poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his fathers presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal themselves in his choice of words. It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers, said Jia Zheng. Whether in your ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound classical models. The Two Incomparables we should call you, not because you are incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are incomparably hard to knock any sense into though whereas Bao-yu seems to think that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang. 506 This not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny provoked general laughter. Let me see that poem, said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost immediately began praising it. I like this poem, its got guts in it. Boys from families like ours dont need to read themselves half blind in order to get started on a career.
Jia Lian had not forgotten yesterdays unaccounted absence on the part of the two menservants, and on leaving Jia Zheng he gave orders for a general assembly of the staff. This time there was a prompt response. After a few preliminary words of reprimand Jia Lian called forward Lai Da, the chief steward. Fetch the general register for all household departments and call the roll. Then I want you to write out an announcement. I want everyone to know that if I detect a single case of absence without leave, or failure to come when sent for, or negligence in any other respect whatsoever, I shall have the culprit immediately flogged and dismissed. Yes sir! replied Lai Da several times. He went out and relayed this to the assembled servants, who all took due note. Not long afterwards there was an unexpected arrival at the main gate. A man in a felt hat, blue cotton gown and sturdy, leather-patched slippers approached and bowed to the janitors on duty. They eyed him up and down and asked him where he hailed from. From the Zhen family in the South, was his reply. I have with me a letter from my Master, which I beg you to take in to Sir Zheng. When they learned that he was from the Zhen family, the men stood up and made room for the newcomer to sit down. You must be tired. Here, sit down. Well take your letter in for you. One of them went in to report his arrival and deliver the letter to Jia Zheng. He opened it, and this is what he read My dear Zheng, Over many generations our two families have established closeness of friendship and mutual understanding. We have always looked up to your illustrious house with the profoundest respect. Although for my heinous crime a thousand deaths would have been insufficient punishment, thanks td an exceptional act of clemency, I have been favoured with a mild sentence of banishment to the frontier. In the general dispersion of our family establishment, I have a manservant called Bao Yong, who has served me well and though lacking any particular skill, is a thoroughly trustworthy and dependable fellow. If you could see your way to employing him in some humble capacity in your household, my gratitude would be unbounded. I shall write again when I can. With sincere regards, Your fellow-graduate and friend, Zhen Ying-jia. Jia Zheng smiled wrily as he reached the end of the letter. Here we are overstaffed ourselves, he mused aloud to himself, and the Zhens must send us one of theirs. We shall have to try and find room for him somehow, I suppose. He turned to the gateman. Send this fellow in to see me, and find somewhere for him to stay. There must be some way in which he can make himself useful. The gateman went out, and came back with Bao Yong, who prostrated himself before Jia Zheng and performed a threefold kotow. Rising to his feet, he declared solemnly My Master presents his greetings, sir. Then falling on one knee, he continued Bao Yong offers his humble respects, sir. Jia Zheng inquired after Zhen Ying-jia, and surveyed Bao Yong. He was something over five feet tall, broad-shouldered and strongly built, with heavy brows and prominent eyes, a protruding forehead, a long beard and a rough, dark complexion. He stood with his arms hanging respectfully at his side. Have you been with the Zhens since birth? asked Jia Zheng. Or have you only served them for a number of years? Bao Yong Since birth, sir. Jia Zheng Why do you wish to leave them now? Bao Yong 1t was not my wish at all, sir. But the Master insisted that I should, and said that Id find things here very much the same as with them. That is why I have come here. Jia Zheng Your master has not deserved the hardship to which he and his family have been reduced. Bao Yong It is not my place to say such things but I think the Master is far too good a man, far too honest in his dealings with people. That is what has brought this trouble on him. Jia Zheng But honesty is a great virtue. Bao Yong Too much of it doesnt always go down well. Some people are irked by it. Jia Zheng with a smile If that is the case, I feel confident that the Supreme Providence will see justice done. Bao Yong was about to say something when Jia Zheng went on Am I right in thinking that your master has a son called Bao-yu? Bao Yong That is correct, sir. Jia Zheng Tell me, does he work hard at his studies? Bao Yong Thats a very interesting question sir.
You gained the advantage, sir, because you were less vulnerable to a ko threat. Jia Zheng turned to Feng. Please forgive us. How are you keeping? It has been a long while since we last met, said Feng. My visit today is partly of a social nature, and partly occasioned by the presence in the capital of a deputy-prefect from Kwangsi province, who is here for an audience with His Majesty and has brought with him four curios, some of them imported, that would make excellent palace-offerings. The first is a folding screen of twenty-four panels, carved of pure blackwood. Though the stone used for the carved inlay - landscapes, figures, buildings, birds and flowers - is not jade, it is a high quality serpentine. Each panel has a palace scene, with fifty or sixty palace-ladies. It is called "Spring Morning in the Han Palace". The features, gestures and costumes are rendered with great clarity. The finish is quite exquisite, the detail and composition of the highest order. It would be perfect for the main hall of Prospect Garden, sir. The second item is a large wall-clock over three feet high. This is a most unusual item. It has a little figure of a boy on the face that indicates the hour with a pointer, and inside it has a little mechanical orchestra. Those two heavier articles I was not able to bring with me. I have however brought the other two, which I think you will find quite fascinating. Feng produced an embroidered casket wrapped in several layers of white damask-silk. Unwrapping it, he raised the lid, removed the protective pad of silk-wool beneath it and displayed its contents. In the top compartment of the casket lay a little glass container with a fitted lid. In this container, on a piece of crimson silk that lined its inner casing of gold, lay a magnificent lustrous pearl, as large as a longan. This, announced Feng, is known as a Mother Pearl. He asked for a tray and Zhang Guang handed him a teatray of black lacquer, asking Will this do? Perfectly, replied Feng, taking from the inner pocket of his gown a white silk bundle. This too contained pearls, of an ordinary size, which he tipped out onto the tray. He then placed the Mother Pearl in their midst and put the tray down on the table. Like so many perfect drops of water the smaller pearls rolled across the tray towards the large central pearl. And when Feng lifted the Mother, all the little ones clung to her. Not a single one was left on the tray. Amazing! exclaimed Zhan Guang. An interesting phenomenon, observed Jia Zheng. And most appropriately named. Where is the other casket? asked Feng turning to his page, who promptly came forward with a rosewood casket held aloft in both hands. The three men gathered round as it was opened. On its lining of tiger-brocade lay a length of blue gauze-like material, many times folded. And what is this? asked Zhan Guang. This, replied Feng, is called Byssus Net. He took it from the casket and laid it on the table. Folded as it was, it occupied a space no more than five inches long and less than half an inch thick. Feng began to unfold it. When he had done so a dozen times, it extended over the edge of the table. There are still two folds to come, he explained. To unfold it to its full extent we would need to hang it in a room with a high ceiling. This fabric is woven from the Byssus, the so-called Mermaids Tears. In extreme heat it would make a perfect fly and mosquito-net for use in a large reception hall. As you can see, it is extremely light and transparent. Please do not unfold it fully, said Jia Zheng. It might prove hard to fold again. Feng and Zhan Guang carefully folded the net and replaced it in its casket. The price being asked for these four curios is really very reasonable, said Feng. I think he would be willing to part with the four for twenty thousand taels. Ten thousand for the Mother Pearl, five thousand for the Byssus Net and two thousand five hundred each for the screen and striking clock. We. could not possibly buy them, Im afraid, said Jia Zheng. But with your connections in the palace, said Feng, surely they would make an ideal I dare say they would, replied Jia Zheng. I dare say all sorts of things would. But we simply havent the money. I would like Lady Jia to see them, all the same. By all means. Jia Zheng sent a page to fetch Jia Lian, who was instructed to take the pearl and the precious net through to Grandmother Jias apartment.
The old janitor usually let him through without going through the proper procedure of making an announcement, knowing him to be Mrs Pans brother. His visits provided the wherewithal for many a plot. But we anticipate. One day a letter arrived from Xue Pan. Aunt Xue opened it and sent for Bao-chai to read it to her. This is what it said Dear Mother, I am being reasonably treated here in prison, so please set your mind at rest. I had some bad news yesterday however, from the clerk of the court. My sentence was approved at the prefectural level - I presume the family had been in touch with the prefect. But when the case came up before the circuit court, the Taotai rejected the judgement. The secretary here at the yamen has been very helpful and has sent an immediate petition in defence of the original judgement. But the Taotai has issued an official statement reprimanding the local mandarin for malpractice. He wants .me to appear before the circuit court. If I do, I could be in trouble again. We cant have approached the Taotai yet. Please send someone to do this as soon as my letter reaches you. And send Cousin Ke here at once. Any delay may result in my being sent under escort to the circuit court. On no account stint the money! Extremely urgent! This sent Aunt Xue into floods of tears. Bao-chai and Xue Ke did their best to calm her down, while at the same time impressing upon her the need to act swiftly. Once again she was obliged to part with her nephew - bags were packed, money weighed out, and Xue Ke prepared to set off that same night with one of the family shop-assistants. It was a night of feverish activity, and Bao-chai herself stayed up till the early hours, helping and making sure that nothing was overlooked by the servants. The combination of nervous strain and physical exhaustion proved too much for a girl of her gentle nature and refined upbringing, and the next morning she went down with a fever and was unable to swallow water or medicine. Oriole reported this at once to Aunt Xue, who came hurrying over. Finding Bao-chai unable to speak, her face bright red, her body burning hot to the touch, she immediately panicked and burst into tears. Bao-qin tried to comfort and support her aunt, while Caltrop was so affected by Bao-chais appearance that she could only stand by the bedside calling her name and weeping. Baochai was too weak to speak or move her hands. Her eyes were dry, her nose blocked. They sent for the doctor, whose prescription gradually brought her round and to the familys intense relief the immediate crisis seemed to have been averted. The news had already reached the various inner apartments of the Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions, and a maid soon arrived from Xi-fengs with one of her Ten Fragrances Revivifying Pills, followed by a maid with one of Lady Wangs Most Precious Pills. Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and all the ladies from both mansions including You-shi all sent maids to inquire how she was getting on, but all agreed that her illness should be kept a secret from Bao-yu. She went on taking various remedies for seven or eight days with no real improvement it was only when she remembered her own Cold Fragrance Pills and took three of these that she began to recover. By the time Bao-yu learnt of her illness, she was already better and he did not go to visit her. A letter arrived from Xue Ke, which Aunt Xue did not show to Bao-chai, for fear of upsetting her. She read it herself and went straight to Lady Wang to beg for her help, at the same time giving her an account of Bao-chais condition. After Aunt Xue had gone to bed, Lady Wang went in to plead with Jia Zheng. With the higher-ranking officials a word is usually sufficient but these provincials clearly need a more tangible incentive, he said somewhat grimly. We shall have to dip into our pockets. Lady Wang went on to talk of Bao-chai The poor girl! I feel responsible for her she is almost one of the family. The sooner she and Bao-yu are married the better. It is ruining her health the way things are. 1 agree, replied Jia Zheng. But her family are very disorganized at present. And besides, it is midwinter. New Year will soon be upon us, and we shall all be busy putting our affairs in order. 1 propose the following timetable the betrothal can take place sometime during the winter early next year they can exchange presents and the ceremony itself should be fixed for sometime after Mothers birthday.
Thats what the Garden is for. While they were speaking, some of the women came in carrying the dinner-table between them. Lady Wang and You-shi laid chopsticks and carried in the rice. When all was ready, Grandmother noticed that in addition to her own dishes there were two large food-boxes containing dishes from. 488 the other apartments. It was a long-established custom that the occupants of other apartments should send her samples of what they were planning to eat that day themselves as a way of showing her their respect. Ive told you all a number of times to stop doing this, she said. Why wont you ever do as I say? These are only very ordinary things here, said Lady Wang, referring to her own contribution. Its one of my fast-days today, so I have only vegetarian dishes. I know you dont much like bean-curd fried in batter, which is one of the things I am having. The only thing of mine I think you might like is a salad pickle of chopped water-mallow in pepper sauce. That sounds rather nice, said Grandmother Jia. I think Id like to try some of that. Faithful quickly took the saucer containing it out of the box and put it down in front of her. Bao-qin, having first apologized to each of her seniors for sitting down in their presence, took her place at one side of the table. Grandmother Jia said that Tan-chun should eat with her as well, whereupon Tan-chun too made her apologies and sat down. She sat at the other side of the table opposite Bao-qin. Scribe quickly fetched her a bowl and chopsticks. Meanwhile Faithful was pointing out the other dishes to Grandmother Jia. I cant make out what these two here are. They are from Sir She. The stuff in this bowl is creamed chicken and bamboo. Its from Mr Zhen. She brought the bowl of sliced bamboo-shoot over and put it down on the table. Grandmother Jia made a couple of dips into it with her chopsticks. She ordered all the 6ther dishes to be taken back to their senders. Tell them thank you very much Ive tried some, but not to send things to me any more. If I ever want anything, I shall let them know. The women made some reply and went o ff with the boxes. Now bring me my rice-gruel and Ill have a bit of that, said Grandmother Jia. You-shi stepped forward with a bowl of gruel. It was made with red Emperor rice, she told her. After drinking 489 about half of it, Grandmother Jia ordered the other half to be taken to Xi-feng. She pointed to one of the dishes. And this is for Patience. She turned to You-shi. Ive finished. Now you can eat. Thank you, said You-shi, but waited all the same until the old lady had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands and was walking up and down on Lady Wangs arm for her digestion before she begged to be seated. By this time Baoqin and Tan-chun had finished eating. They got up as You-shi sat down, excusing themselves from keeping her company while she ate. Oh, said You-shi, Im not used to eating at a big table like this all on my own. Faithful and Amber can eat with you for company, said Grandmother Jia. Good! said You-shi. I was about to suggest that. I like to see people eating together, said Grandmother Jia. She pointed to Butterfly. Now heres a good girl. Why shouldnt she eat with you as well? Go on, child! Go and eat with your mistress. As long as you are here with me, it doesnt matter if you break the rules for once. Come on! said You-shi to the maid encouragingly. Dont pretend to be bashful! Grandmother Jia stopped walking up and down and stood with her hands clasped behind her back to watch them eat. It suddenly struck her that the rice being served was the plain white rice normally eaten by the servants and that You-shi, too, was eating it. Why are you giving Mrs Zhen this stuff? she asked them. There isnt any of Your Old Ladyships rice left, said the maids. You had an extra young lady eating with you today, dont forget. Meals are made to measure nowadays, said Faithful. We cant afford to be extravagant the way we used to be. There have been so many floods and droughts during the past few years, said Lady Wang. Our farms havent been able to make up their quotas. These special kinds of rice are particularly hard to come by. We have had to start rationing them rather carefully.
Where will Bao-yu be sitting? asked Aunt Xue. Up here with me, said Grandmother Jia with a smile. -768 Li Gui told me to have my dinner before seeing Father, Bao-yu hastily informed her. So I asked for a quick meal when I got in from school. I had a dish of something and a bowl of rice steeped in tea. You all go ahead, please. In that case, said Grandmother Jia, Feng can come and sit with us. Your mother says it 5 one of her vegetarian days today, so she can eat alone. Thats right, said Lady Wang to Xi-feng. You eat with them. Dont wait for me. I shall be having my vegetables at home. Xi-feng politely took her seat and the maids put out the wine cups and chopsticks. Then Xi-feng went round with the wine kettle, and, when everyones cup was filled, returned to her seat. -768 After they had all had a drink of wine, Grandmother Jia asked Aunt Xue Didnt I hear you say Caltrop just then? Thats funny. One of my maids was talking only the other day about someone called Lily, and I couldnt for the life of me think who she meant. When I asked her, she told me it was Caltrops new name. Do tell me what she wants to go and change her name for? The colour rose in Aunt Xues cheeks and she sighed Please dont ever mention it again. Since the day Pan married that wretched wife we havent had a moments peace. The bickering, the nastiness, its been too awful. Ive tried talking to her several times, but she is quite impervious to reason. And I cant bear quarrelling with them all the time, so I just end up trying to turn a blind eye. Yes, she decided to change Caltrops name because she said she didnt like it. Oh well, said Grandmother Jia, whats in a name when alls said and done?" I shall die for shame! cried Aunt Xue. Im sure all of you know the real reason. It wasnt the name. It was the fact that Ba6-chai had thought of it in the first place. Thats what she really objected to. What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia. Aunt Xue had been dabbing at her eyes all the while with her handkerchief. She heaved another deep sigh before she was able to continue. Surely you must know? Every single thing my daughter-in-law does is aimed at provoking Bao-chai. She wont leave her alone. The other day, when you sent someone round to see me, we were in the middle of one of our scenes! That must have been the day I heard you had a little bit of a liver upset, said Grandmother Jia tactfully. I was going to send someone over to see how you were, but then I heard that you were feeling better so I thought no more about it. You should take my advice, dear, and stop worrying. Theyre a newly married couple and you must give them time to settle down. And youre so lucky to have Chai. She is such a gentle, unflappable girl. She may be young, but my word, she has the aplomb of someone twice her age! When my maid came back and told us what had happened that day and the way she coped with it, we were all singing her praises. Such a wonderful disposition! Shes a girl in a million. When she gets married, if you dont mind my saying so, her mother-in-law will take her to her bosom and the whole household will be devoted to her, I am certain of it. Earlier, Bao-yu had found the general tenor of the conversation rather distasteful, and was just saying something about having to leave when his grandmother embarked upon this eulogy of Bao-chai, and he found himself listening with rapt attention. Whats the use? said Aunt Xue. Whatever her qualities, she is still only a daughter. With a son as hopeless -as Pan, I can have no peace I never stop worrying in case he has gone off to one of his haunts, had too much to drink again and landed himself in another brawl. In fact the only time I ever feel at all reassured is when hes over here with his cousins Zhen and Lian. At this, Bao-yu chirped up Theres really nothing to fear, Auntie. I can vouch for Cousin Pans friends. They are all serious businessmen and far too respectable to get into trouble. In that case, said Aunt Xue with a smile, perhaps I shouldnt worry. Supper was over by now, and Bao-yu excused himself, saying he still had some preparation to do that evening.
Hes a strange boy. I dont really understand him. Ive certainly never known another one like him. His other kinds of naughtiness I can understand its this passion for spending all his time with maids that I find so hard to make out. It used at one time to worry me I thought it must be because he had reached puberty and was having experiences with them but after watching him very carefully, I came to the conclusion that it wasnt that at all. Its very, very strange. Perhaps he was a maid himself in some past life. Perhaps he ought to have been a girl. Lady Wang and the others laughed. Lady Wang then went on to tell Grandmother Jia how highly Jia Zheng had spoken of Bao-yu that morning and how he had taken Bao-yu and the other two boys with him on an outing. Grandmother Jia was delighted. Not long after this Ying-chun appeared, dressed in her going-out clothes, to take leave of Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang before going next-door to stay with Lady Xing. Xi-feng called in, too, for her morning duty call and stayed to wait on the old lady while she took her lunch and to joke with her for a while after it was finished. When the old lady had settled herself down for her after-lunch nap, Lady Wang called to Xi-feng to accompany her back to her own apartment. She asked her whether she had started taking the ginseng pills yet. No, not yet, Xi-feng told her, because she was still taking the infusions but her aunt was not to worry, because she was now feeling completely better. Observing that she certainly 557 seemed to have got her old cheerfulness back, her aunt was inclined to believe her. She told her about her dismissal of Skybright and the other girls. This led her to another topic. Why did your Cousin Chai go back home without telling anyone? Doesnt anyone know? When I was making my inspection yesterday, I decided to take a look at Wans servants as well. That new nurse she has got for little Lan is quite unsuitable in fact, I dont like the look of her at all. I said to Wan, I dont care how you do it, my dear, but you must get rid of that woman at once. Lan is old enough to do without a nurse now in any case. He certainly doesnt need a nurse like that one! I asked her if she knew about Bao-chai. She said yes, Bao-chai had told her that she was going, but it was only for two or three days, until her mother was better, and then she would be moving in again. Well I know for a fact that there is nothing much wrong with your aunt a bit of a cough and some back-ache, but then she always gets that at this time of year. I am sure there is some other reason for her leaving. Can anyone have offended her? She is such a serious child. I should hate to think of anyone offending her after our two families have been getting on so well together all these years. Who could possibly have offended her? said Xi-feng, smiling. I wondered if Bao-yu might have done, said Lady Wang. He is so careless about what he says, so tactless. When he gets excited he is capable of saying almost anything. I dont think you have much to worry about on that account, said Xi-feng. Bao-yu may behave foolishly in company, but when he is with our girls, or even the maids, he is always extremely considerate. His greatest anxiety is always how not to offend them. He is certainly the last person I should expect to hear any of our girls complain about. I should think Cousin Chais leaving has much more to do with that search we carried out in the Garden the other night. She would naturally infer from it that the people in the Garden are not trusted and since she knew we would never search her people because of her position here as our guest, she might well conclude that the only way in which she could dear them 558 of suspicion would be to move outside. Im sure thats why she went to avoid suspicion. To Lady Wang, too, this seemed the most likely explanation. She studied the floor thoughtfully for some moments then she had Bao-chai summoned, explained to her what had happened, and assured her that she must not think herself under the least suspicion. She must move back into the Garden at once and continue living there as before. Bao-chai smiled courteously but held her ground. I had been meaning to move out some time ago, Aunt, but did not like to mention it to you because I knew you were so much occupied with other matters. It was the coincidence of Mammas being poorly and her two most reliable maids both going sick at the same time which decided me to move out when I did.
Ive done enough of the talking. Lady Wang took over the story. Sir Zheng told us when he was here this morning. Apparently Bao-yus godmother, Mother Ma, is an evil old woman and a practising witch. As the result of certain scandalous revelations, shes been arrested by the secret police and sent to the Central Jail. I should imagine shes been sentenced to death by now. The whole thing started the other day, when a Mr Pan San-bao informed against her. He had been trying to sell a property to a pawnbroker across the street. His price had already risen by several hundred per cent, and when he asked for more the pawnbroker backed out. So in an attempt to salvage his sale, Mr Pan hired the services of our Mother Ma, whom he knew to be a regular visitor at the pawnshop and intimate with all the womenfolk there. She duly succeeded, by s6me evil means, in throwing the pawnbrokers wife into a convulsion, Then, waiting until the attack reached alarming proportions, she had the effrontery to arrive in person, claiming to possess a patent cure for the affliction. And sure enough, after a few burnt offerings of her paper charms, paper money and so forth, the wife recovered and the witch coolly demanded a dozen or so taels of silver for her services in exorcizing her own spell! But nothing escapes the watchful eye of the Good Lord Buddha, continued Lady Wang. Her detection and downfall were already close at hand. That same day, in her haste to leave the pawnbrokers premises, she inadvertently dropped a silk bundle. The pawnbroker picked it up, took a look inside, and noticed a number of paper figures and four unusually potent cakes of incense. He became suspicious, and when the old woman returned to recover her bundle he seized her and subjected her to a quick search. He discovered hidden on her person a casket containing two ivory statuettes, a male and a female, both completely naked you know those pocket-sized figures of the devil they use - and seven red embroidery needles. She was taken straight to the secret police, and when questioned revealed her intimate connections with the mistresses and young ladies of several eminent and wealthy families. The case was reported to the highest -1307 authorities, and her house was searched. They found quite a few clay figures of those horrible Spectral Furies and several boxes of narcotic incense also, hanging in a hidden compartment behind the kang, a Seven Star Lamp with all kinds of straw effigies spread below it, some with bands round their heads, others with nails through their chests or padlocks round their necks. She had a whole cupboard full of spare paper figures, and there were account slips all over the floor, listing families dealt with and amounts outstanding, together with records of goodness knows how much money received for oil and incense. Our attacks were definitely her doing! exclaimed Xi-feng. I remember now. It was after we recovered - when the old witch came to visit Aunt Zhao a couple of times to collect her "contributions" - something horrible seemed to come over her when she saw me she went pale, and there was a nasty look in her eyes. I wondered what it meant at the time, but I just couldnt see any reason for her to cause trouble. After what youve just said, though, it all makes sense. With my responsibilities I cant help making enemies, and some of them are bound to try and get their own back somehow or other. But who could bear a grudge against Bao-yu? That must be pure malice. Or jealousy, suggested Grandmother Jia, because she knows Im not as fond of Huan as I am of Bao-yu. Perhaps thats why she tried to harm you both. Anyway, said Lady Wang, as the old woman is already in prison, we wont be able to call on her to testify, and without her evidence we will never be able to make Aunt Zhao confess. Besides we simply cant have the family involved in a scandal of this sort. We must bide our time. She is certain to give herself away sooner or later. Youre quite right, Grandmother Jia complimented Lady Wang. In cases like this it is so hard to prove anything without conclusive evidence. We must just be thankful that the all-seeing Lord Buddha and his bodhisattvas have kept our two from harm. There! Its all over! And please, Feng, dont ever bring the subject up again. You can both stay and have dinner with me. She turned to Faithful and Amber. Tell them we are ready to be served. The old ladys parting shot did not go unnoticed by Xi-feng, who laughed and said So now Im the one that set you worrying, am I? Lady Wang laughed at them both.
Bao-yu had not understood. Whats that? he asked Tealeaf, puzzled. What did he say? Never mind what he said, said Tealeaf. Silly rubbish! Youd better tell me yourself what it is, Master Bao, said One Plaster Wang, unwilling to risk another guess. The thing I want to know about is jealousy, said Bao-yu. Could one of your plasters cure a woman of being jealous? One Plaster Wang clapped his hands and laughed. Now there you have me! Neither my plasters nor anyone elses could do that! 610 They are not such great shakes after all then, said Bao-yu, smiling. I said plasters couldnt, said One Plaster Wang. I know of an infusion that might. The only thing is, it would take rather a long time. Theres no lightning cure for jealousy. What is this infusion called? said Bao-yu. How do you make it? Its called Pirum saccharinum, said One Plaster Wang. You take one very good autumn pear, two drams of crystal sugar, one dram of bitter-peel and three cups of water and simmer them all together until the pear is soft. If the sufferer can be made to eat one such pear, together with its juices, first thing every morning, she will, eventually, be cured. I dont think much of that, said Bao-yu. I cant see that working. If it doesnt work the first time, perhaps it will by the tenth, said the old Taoist. If one years treatment is insufficient, she must persevere for a second. And so on. At all events, these are wholesome ingredients. A pear prepared in this way is soothing to the lungs and stomach, innocuous to the health, sweet to the palate, lenitive for a cough and in every way agreeable. Sooner or later the woman will die and as there is no jealousy that I know of after death, it could be said that by that time she had been cured. This set Bao-yu and Tealeaf off into fits of laughter. Oily-tongued old ox they called him. Well, whats the harm? said One Plaster Wang. Its only a bit of nonsense to stop you sleeping in the middle of the day. Making you laugh is worth much more than any medicine. Even my plasters are only tomfoolery. Do you think if I really had a magic formula Id be sitting here talking to you now? Id have taken it myself long ago and gone off to join the immortals. The hour of sacrifice had now arrived and Bao-yu was invited to offer his libation and set fire to his paper hecatomb. What remained of the more substantial part of the offering -the foodstuffs and the wine - was shared out among the Taoists and the others present. Having completed what he came out for, he drove back into the city. 611 By the time he got home Ying-chun had already been back an hour or more. The servants who brought her were being entertained to dinner before returning to the Sun household. Ying-chun meanwhile was in Lady Wangs room giving her and the cousins a tearful account of her matrimonial troubles. Sun Shao-zu is an out-and-out libertine. Gambling, drinking and chasing after women are the only things he cares about. He has corrupted practically every maid and young woman in the house. I have protested to him about it more than once, but he only swears at me. He calls me a jealous little bitch. He says that Father borrowed five thousand taels from him and spent it all, and that though he has been round time and again to ask for it, Father refuses to pay it back. Then he points his finger at me and shouts Dont put on the lady wife act with me, my girl! Youre no better than a bought slave - payment in kind for the five thousand taels your old man owes me - and if youre not very careful I shall give you a good beating and send you to sleep with the maids. He says it was Great-grandfather who took the Initiative in making the alliance between our families because theirs was so rich and influential, so that by rights he ought to be Fathers equal. He says he was a fool to marry me, because that makes Father his senior and besides, he says, it has given people the impression that he needed our help, whereas in fact quite the reverse is true. Ying-chun sobbed bittely while she told them this and the others wept as they listened. Lady Wang did her best to comfort her. Hes obviously an unreasonable man, she said but now that youre married to him, theres really nothing to be done.
I went to lie down on the kang, but then it felt as if I had tight bands round my head and the pain became so excruciating that I no longer knew what was happening. I remember how I got better. There was a ray of golden light from the hall outside my room, that shone right onto my bed. The devils just took to their heels and vanished. They seemed scared of the light. My headache went away and I felt quite myself again. You see! exclaimed Grandmother Jia, turning to Lady Wang. It ties in perfectly. As she was speaking, Xi-feng entered the room and greeted first Grandmother Jia, then Lady Wang. What did you want to ask me about, Grannie? she asked. Tell me, replied Grandmother Jia, can you recall that nasty attack you had last year? Xi-feng laughed. Not very clearly. The main thing I remember about it is that I was possessed. There was someone manipulating me, filling my head with the most bloodthirsty intentions. I had a terrible urge to grab hold of everything in sight and kill it. I was exhausted, but I couldnt stop. And then? asked Grandmother Jia. When you were cured? There was a voice, replied Xi-feng, that seemed to speak to me from nowhere. But what it said I honestly cant remember. That settles it! exclaimed the old lady. Thats exactly the sort of thing she got up to! So it was her doing, it must have been! Oh! How could the old woman sink so low - and Bao-yus own godmother too! Gracious Lord, to think that if those two holy men had not arrived in time, he might easily have died! And we still have not repaid them... But Grannie, asked Xi-feng, what made you think of all this in the first place? Ask your aunt, replied Grandmother Jia. Ive done enough of the talking. Lady Wang took over the story. Sir Zheng told us when he was here this morning. Apparently Bao-yus godmother, Mother Ma, is an evil old woman and a practising witch. As the result of certain scandalous revelations, shes been arrested by the secret police and sent to the Central Jail. I should imagine shes been sentenced to death by now. The whole thing started the other day, when a Mr Pan San-bao informed against her. He had been trying to sell a property to a pawnbroker across the street. His price had already risen by several hundred per cent, and when he asked for more the pawnbroker backed out. So in an attempt to salvage his sale, Mr Pan hired the services of our Mother Ma, whom he knew to be a regular visitor at the pawnshop and intimate with all the womenfolk there. She duly succeeded, by s6me evil means, in throwing the pawnbrokers wife into a convulsion, Then, waiting until the attack reached alarming proportions, she had the effrontery to arrive in person, claiming to possess a patent cure for the affliction. And sure enough, after a few burnt offerings of her paper charms, paper money and so forth, the wife recovered and the witch coolly demanded a dozen or so taels of silver for her services in exorcizing her own spell! But nothing escapes the watchful eye of the Good Lord Buddha, continued Lady Wang. Her detection and downfall were already close at hand. That same day, in her haste to leave the pawnbrokers premises, she inadvertently dropped a silk bundle. The pawnbroker picked it up, took a look inside, and noticed a number of paper figures and four unusually potent cakes of incense. He became suspicious, and when the old woman returned to recover her bundle he seized her and subjected her to a quick search. He discovered hidden on her person a casket containing two ivory statuettes, a male and a female, both completely naked you know those pocket-sized figures of the devil they use - and seven red embroidery needles. She was taken straight to the secret police, and when questioned revealed her intimate connections with the mistresses and young ladies of several eminent and wealthy families. The case was reported to the highest -1307 authorities, and her house was searched. They found quite a few clay figures of those horrible Spectral Furies and several boxes of narcotic incense also, hanging in a hidden compartment behind the kang, a Seven Star Lamp with all kinds of straw effigies spread below it, some with bands round their heads, others with nails through their chests or padlocks round their necks. She had a whole cupboard full of spare paper figures, and there were account slips all over the floor, listing families dealt with and amounts outstanding, together with records of goodness knows how much money received for oil and incense.
The Ning-guo servants, who grew fat on the pickings, were delighted with these new arrangements and, anxious that they should go on, if possible, for ever, took very good care that no one outside the mansion should get to hear about them. 493 Lady Xings brother, Xing De-quan, himself a keen gambler, had lately become a frequenter of this establishment so, inevitably, had Xue Pan, who was never so happy as when he was throwing away his money. Xing De-quan was very unlike his sister. Drinking, gambling and debauchery were his only interests consequently whenever any money came into his hands, he spent it like water. The singular obtuseness he showed in all his dealings had earned him the nickname of Uncle Dumbo. And since Xue Pan was already known to all and sundry as the Oaf King , the two of them when they were together were referred to by the young men as Uncle Dumbo and Cousin Oaf. The situation when You-shi peeped inside was as follows. Cousin Oaf and Uncle Dumbo, each with a partner, were playing six-dice Grabs on the kang in the outer room. Simultaneously another dicing game, Driving the Sheep, was being played by several players sitting round a large table on the floor below. The inner room, where a slightly more intellectual group were playing Tin Kau, was devoted to dominoes. The servants were all pages of fifteen or under. There was also a pair of male prostitutes, powdered, over-dressed youths of seventeen or eighteen, whose duty was to ply the guests with drink. It was this pair who first caught You-shis eye when she looked in. Xue Pan had been having the sulks earlier on because he was losing, but then his luck had changed he had not only recouped his losses but made a lot of extra money. He was therefore in a very good mood indeed. Cousin Zhen suggested that this might be a good point at which to stop and have dinner. They could go on playing afterwards if they wanted to. What about the two other lots? he inquired. It transpired that the Tin Kau players in the next room were in process of settling up after finishing the game and were in fact beginning to think about their dinner, but that the group at the big table playing Driving the Sheep had not yet reached a suitable point at which to break off. Cousin Zhen ordered dinner to be served for all those, himself 494 included, who were ready. Jia Rong was to wait and have dinner with the other players when they had finished. Xue Pan, elated by his success, sat with a cup of wine in one hand and his arm round the shoulders of one of the pretty pot-boys. With a victors expansive generosity he ordered the other boy to pour some wine with his compliments for Uncle Dumbo. But Uncle Dumbo was thoroughly out of temper at having lost the game, and the two cupfuls he drank now in rapid succession served merely to make him tipsily aggressive. He vented his anger on the two young ganymedes, who, he claimed, had treacherously withdrawn their favours from him and transferred them to the winner. Heartless brood of unnatural little whores gits! he grumbled. Youve had plenty of favours off me in the past -and off everyone else here. Now, just because Ive lost a few taels, Im not good enough for you. What makes you so certain you wont ever need my help again in the future? The other guests all knew that he was drunk. Those of them who were losers themselves smiled wryly and said nothing, but one or two of the winners magnanimously expressed their sympathy. Thats right, Uncle. Rotten little bastards! Thats just the way they do behave. Why dont you pour Uncle a drink and tell him youre sorry? said another of them. The two young ganymedes, practised professionals in every trick of the trade, were on their knees at Uncle Dumbos side in a moment, offering him wine, fondling his thigh, and gazing with simpering archness into his eyes. Dont be angry with us, dear old friend. We are only children. We have to do as we are told. Our teacher always tells us, It doesnt matter what they are like or what your own feelings are, the person who at any moment has the most money is the one you must be nice to. Just win a lot of money later on this evening, old friend, and youll see how nice we shall be to you! The disarming frankness of this made everyone laugh. Even Uncle Dumbo, though he tried hard not to, was forced to join in. 495 All right, I forgive you, he growled as he took the proffered winecup.
A faint scent drifted into the room. They all tried to guess what flower it could be coming from. Its very like cassia-blossom, suggested Dai-yu. Tan-chun laughed. Still a southerner at heart! Its the ninth month, long past cassia-time. Dai-yu smiled. Youre right. But then I didnt say it was, only very like... Anyway, Tan, Xiang-yun butted in, you cant talk. Dont you know the lines -1574 The lotus fragrance drifts for miles, The cassia blooms till autumns end? In the South, the late-flowering cassia is at its best now. Its just that youve never seen it. If you ever have a chance to go to the South, youll be able to see it for yourself. And what should I be doing in the South? retorted Tan-chun with a crushing smile. Anyway, I knew all that ages ago, thanks very much... The Li sisters grinned at each other. You never know, Tan, said Dai-yu. We are "fairy earthlings, fleet of foot", thats what the old proverb says. Here today, who knows where tomorrow. Take me, for example. I was born a southerner, but here I am living in the North. Xiang-yun clapped her hands. Well said! Dais got you there, Tan! And shes not the only one to have had such an experience. Look at the rest of us. Some of us are northerners, born and bred. Some were born in the South but grew up in the North. And some grew up in the South and then moved here later. And yet here we all are together. Its our fate, you see. People and places have an affinity. Their karma brings them together. They all nodded at Xiang-yuns little discourse, except for Tan-chun who just smiled. After chatting for a while longer, they got up to go. Dai-yu walked with them as far as the door, and would have gone out, but they dissuaded her Youve only just started to feel better. If you come out now, you might catch a chill. So she stood in the doorway, said a few parting words, and watched the four of them walk out of the courtyard gate. When they had gone, she went indoors again and sat down. The birds were returning to their nests the sun was setting. With Xiang-yuns words about the South still ringing in her ears, Dai-yu drifted into a daydream. If her parents were still alive.. . If she still lived in the South, that gentle land of spring flowers and autumn moonlight, of limpid waters and luminous hills... How she would love to be there again, to visit the Twenty Four Bridges in Yangchow and all the famous historical sites of Nanking! In the South she would have plenty of servants of her own to wait on her. She could do and speak as she pleased, sail in painted pleasure-boats and ride in perfumed carriages, watch the fields of red apricot-blossom go by, spot the inn-signs through the trees... She would be a young lady in her own right, not an outsider, dependent on others for everything. However much the Jias did for her, she always felt the need to be on her best behaviour. What wrong had she done in a previous incarnation to deserve this lonely existence? Those words written in captivity by the last emperor of Southern Tang -Here, all day long, I bathe my face in tears -how well they expressed her own feelings! Her soul seemed transported to some distant region. When Nightingale came in, a single glance sufficed to tell her the cause of Dai-yus absence. She had been in the room when Xiang-yun was talking, and knew how easily Dai-yu was upset by the slightest reference to the South. I thought you might feel tired again, Miss, she said, after all your visitors and such a lot of talking, so Ive just sent Snowgoose to the kitchen for a bowl of ham and cabbage broth, cooked with dried shrimps, dried seaweed and bamboo-shoots. Doesnt that sound good? I suppose so. And some congee? Dai-yu nodded. Id rather you and Snowgoose made the congee yourselves. Dont have it done in the kitchen. No Miss. You can never be sure how clean things are in the kitchen. Well cook the congee ourselves. I asked Snowgoose to tell Cook Liu in the kitchen to take special care with the soup. Cook Liu said we were not to worry, shed see to it personally and prepare it in her own room. Her daughter Fivey is going to keep an eye on it while it simmers.
As she spoke a big bubble popped on the water. Come On! cried Tan-chun. Theres no need to overdo it. Look, the fish are all over there by you, Qi. You have a go quickly! -384 Qi took the rod with a giggle of embarrassment. Sure enough, down went her float and she had a catch first time. Xiu-yan was the last of the girls to have her turn. She caught one and passed the rod back to Tan-chun, who handed it on to Bao-yu. I shall follow in the footsteps of old Sire Jiang, he declared. Straight was his hook, His bait a single grain Yet of their own accord The fish unto him came... -384 Walking solemnly down the jetty, he sat at the waters edge in the pose of the Fisherman Sage. Unfortunately, at the approach of this human shadow, the fish took refuge in the far end of the pond, and for all his exertions in the higher art of angling, a long time seemed to pass without the slightest sign of a bite. When once a fish did venture near and deigned to blow a few bubbles near the bank, he jerked the rod and scared it away. Oh dear! he sighed. Its no good. The trouble is that Im so confoundedly impatient, and the fish are so slow on the uptake. We must be incompatible. I shall never catch anything at this rate. Come on now, help me! Feel yourself being drawn, theres my brave little fish! There was a peal of laughter from the girls. Then, before anyone could say a word, the line was seen to move a fraction. A bite at last! The sage yanked in for all he was worth. The rod crashed into a protruding rock and broke clean in two. The line snapped, and the hook with whatever it may or may not have secured sank without trace. This final stroke of virtuosity had his audience in stitches. Tan-chun called out Ive never seen such a clumsy fool! As she was speaking, who should come rushing up but Musk, in a state of great excitement. Master Bao, Her Old Ladyship has woken up and wants to see you at once! The five of them exchanged startled glances. But what about? asked Tan-chun. I dont know, replied Musk. All I heard was something about a "scandalous revelation" they want to question Master Bao about. Theyve asked Mrs Lian to come and answer questions as well. Bao-yu stood for a moment in stunned silence. Eventually he said I wonder which poor maid is in for the high jump this time? Weve no idea what its about, said Tan-chun, so Bao, youd better go straight away and as soon as youve any news, send Musk over to let us know. The four girls went their way, and Bao-yu set off for Grandmother Jias apartment. He arrived to find her in the middle of a game of cards with Lady Wang, and realized to his relief that it could be nothing as serious as he had feared. Grandmother Jia saw him come in and asked him Bao darling, do you remember last year, when you were so seriously ill , and those two holy men - that mad-looking monk and that lame Taoist - came and cured you, in the nick of time - what did the illness feel like? Bao-yu reflected for a moment. I can remember how it started. I was standing in my room when suddenly someone seemed to come from behind and ram something hard, like a wooden bar, up against the back of my head. It hurt like anything, my eyes started throbbing and everything went pitch-black. All I could see in the room was a mob of green -faced devils with huge fangs, carrying swords and cudgels. I went to lie down on the kang, but then it felt as if I had tight bands round my head and the pain became so excruciating that I no longer knew what was happening. I remember how I got better. There was a ray of golden light from the hall outside my room, that shone right onto my bed. The devils just took to their heels and vanished. They seemed scared of the light. My headache went away and I felt quite myself again. You see! exclaimed Grandmother Jia, turning to Lady Wang. It ties in perfectly. As she was speaking, Xi-feng entered the room and greeted first Grandmother Jia, then Lady Wang. What did you want to ask me about, Grannie? she asked. Tell me, replied Grandmother Jia, can you recall that nasty attack you had last year? Xi-feng laughed. Not very clearly. The main thing I remember about it is that I was possessed.
Whatever the number is shall be our rhyme. Thats a very ingenious idea, said Xiang-yun. The two girls got up and walked along the railing to count. It turned out that there were exactly eight posts from one angle of the railing to the next. Hmn, said Xiang-yun. Eight. I wonder how far we shall get with that rhyme. The danger with this sort of thing always is that after a time the rhyming becomes forced - or else one simply cant go on at all. Well, you begin. Id like to have been able to see afterwards which of us had done better, said Dai-yu, but unfortunately we havent got anything to write with. Ill write it out tomorrow, said Xiang-yun. I may not be very clever, but Ive got a reasonably good memory. All right, said Dai-yu. Ill start with something very prosy and obvious. -1344 DAI-YU -534 Fifteenth night of the Eighth, Mid-Autumn moon - -384 Xiang-yun thought a bit before following. -1344 XIANG-YUN Whose joys the First Full Moons do emulate, -534 Under your crystal-constellation heaven - -1344 DAI-TU -534 The sounds of music everywhere pulsate. At many a hoard the reckless winecups fly - 517 Ha! I like the reckless winecups, said Xiang-yun. I must try to do them justice. Let me see. She thought for a bit. -1344 XIANG-YUN -384 Where friends are met your feast to celebrate. The air is crisp, the wind more bracing blows You finished the couplet very well, said Dai-yu, but that second line is a bit weak, isnt it? Weve got a long way to go and the rhyming will soon begin to get harder, said Xiang-yun. I want to save up any good ideas I may have until later. Mind you produce some good lines later then, said Dai-yu. Otherwise you are going to look pretty silly! She proceeded to finish the couplet. -1344 DAI-YU -534 In the clear sky the cold stars scintillate. -384 Grey hairs are mocked when they for cakes dispute - I dont like that line, said Xiang-yun. It sound like an allusion, but I think you have just made it up to confuse me. That shows you dont read much, said Dai-yu. Its a perfectly good allusion. Theres a story about quarrelling over cakes in the Official history of the Tang Dynasty. Ill show you it tomorrow. Well, anyway, Im not going to be confused, said Xiang yun. I can cap that line. -1344 XIANG-YUN Green girls divide the melons, eight and eight. New scents the jade-like cassia have enriched - Now that really is a bogus allusion, said Dai-yu. Well look both our allusions up tomorrow and the others can judge between us, said Xiang-yun. In the meanwhile, lets get on with this and stop wasting time. Thats all very well, said Dai-yu, but I dont like your other line either. We ought to be able to manage without cliches like lade-like cassia. I call that mere padding. 518 -1344 DAI-YU -347 Closed day4ilies the morrows gold gestate. A blaze of candles gilds the radiant feasters Gold gestate ! said Xiang-yun. Well, thats one way of getting a rhyme - a pretty cheap one if you ask me And your second line is quite as much padding as mine was. If you hadnt started with jade-like cassia, I shouldnt have brought in my gold-gestating day-lilies, said Dai-yu. And as regards my second line, I should have thought a few words on the brilliance of the feast were called for, in order to do justice to the occasion. Since Dai-yu was evidently not going to concede anything, Xiang-yun was obliged to finish off the couplet. -1344 XIANG-YUN -384 Whom frequent sconcings soon inebriate. Competing, they observe the games strict order Ah, thats a good line! said Dai-yu. She thought a bit before capping it. -1344 DAI-YU -384 And rules for I spy gravely promulgate. Some shake the pretty dice and make them roll I like gravely promulgate, said Xiang-yun, laughing. It lifts a vulgar subject up and gives it tone. But then your dice in the next line bring us back again to the banal.
Tan-chun cast her line, and in just a few seconds a little leaf-wriggler swallowed the hook and down went the float. She pulled in and landed her catch, alive and jumping. Scribe, after a lot of scrambling about, managed to get a grip on the thing, and carrying it over in both hands, placed it carefully in a little earthenware jar of fresh water. Tan-chun passed the rod on to Wen. She too felt a tug on the line almost immediately, and pulled in excitedly, only to find nothing on the hook. She cast out again, and this time stood there angling for ages. At last the line tautened and she pulled in again. Another false alarm. She picked up the hook to examine it, and discovered that it was buckled. No wonder I couldnt catch anything! She laughed and without more ado told Candida to straighten it out for her, put on some fresh bait and fasten on the reed-float securely. This time after only a few minutes, down went the float, in she pulled with great determination, and there it was - a little two-inch silver carp. Delighted, she turned to Bao-yu. You next. Qi and Xiu-yan must go first, replied Bao-yu. I insist. Xiu-yan was silent. You go first, Cousin Bao, protested Qi. As she spoke a big bubble popped on the water. Come On! cried Tan-chun. Theres no need to overdo it. Look, the fish are all over there by you, Qi. You have a go quickly! -384 Qi took the rod with a giggle of embarrassment. Sure enough, down went her float and she had a catch first time. Xiu-yan was the last of the girls to have her turn. She caught one and passed the rod back to Tan-chun, who handed it on to Bao-yu. I shall follow in the footsteps of old Sire Jiang, he declared. Straight was his hook, His bait a single grain Yet of their own accord The fish unto him came... -384 Walking solemnly down the jetty, he sat at the waters edge in the pose of the Fisherman Sage. Unfortunately, at the approach of this human shadow, the fish took refuge in the far end of the pond, and for all his exertions in the higher art of angling, a long time seemed to pass without the slightest sign of a bite.

Grandmother Jia saw him come in and asked him Bao darling, do you remember last year, when you were so seriously ill , and those two holy men - that mad-looking monk and that lame Taoist - came and cured you, in the nick of time - what did the illness feel like?
Suddenly he laughed When I first saw that tone of yours, I was so taken with it, you know, that on my return I gave my jade-workers a description of it and asked them to make me one like it. I am so glad you have come today. I can give it to you to take home. It might amuse you to keep it. One of the junior eunuchs was ordered to bring the jade in, and the Prince. himself handed it to Bao-yu, who received it humbly in both hands, gave thanks and then took his leave. The Prince told two more junior eunuchs to accompany him out, he rejoined the other members of the family, and they all returned home. On arrival, Jia She paid his respects to Grandmother Jia and left for his own apartment. J ia Zheng and the others also paid their respects and gave her a full account of the reception. Bao-yu communicated to his father the news he had received about Governor Wus sponsorial activities. Governor Wu, commented Jia Zheng drily is an old friend, and a man after my own heart. He is also, I might add, a statesman of the highest integrity. After a little more chat, Grandmother Jia gave permission for them all to disperse. J ia Zheng took his leave, an was followed by Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian and Bao-yu as far as the door. With a parting injunction to the three of them to stay and keep Grandmother Jia company a little longer, Jia Zheng returned to his apartment. He had not been there long when a maid came in to announce that Steward Lin was waiting outside with something to report. She also handed him a red visiting card with Governor Wus name on it. Jia Zheng told her to admit Lin, and went out to speak to him on the verandah. Excellency Governor Wu called to see you today, sir, reported Lin. I informed him that you were out. And another thing, sir I have heard that a Permanent Secretarys position has become vacant in the Ministry of Works. According to various people, including officials in the Ministry, you are to be given the post as confirmation of your preseht rank. Hm. . . said Jia Zheng. We shall see. Lin conferred with his master on one or two other matters and then left. After Jia Zhengs departure, Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian returned to their separate apartments, while Bao-yu went back to Grandmother Jias. He was now able to tell her all about 4 is day at the Palace. He described how kindly the Prince had treated him, and took out the jade he had been given, which was passed round and commented on with some amusement. Grandmother Jia told a maid to put it safely away. And dont whatever you do take your own off, she said to Bao-yu. You dont want to go getting them. mixed up. Bao-yu promptly untied his original from around his neck. But look, he said, theyre so different, how could I ever get them mixed up? That reminds me, Grannie, of something that happened the other night, as I was going to bed. I had just taken my jade off and hung it inside the bed-curtains, when I noticed a halo around it, and the whole inside of my bed was lit up with a rosy glow. You silly boy! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Theres red thread in your pelmet. That must have been the lamp-light showing through. But it couldnt have been. The lamps were all out and it was pitch-black in my room, and I still saw it glowing. Lady Xing and Lady Wang exchanged a meaningful smile. A certain rosy event had been much in the forefront of their minds recently. Xi-feng too could not restrain herself from remarking cryptically No doubt this heralds the Big Event... What big event? asked Bao-yu. Nothing you would understand, put in Grandmother Jia promptly. Now come along. Its been a hectic day for you, and you ought to go and rest, and not waste any more time here telling tall stories. Bao-yu stayed a minute or two longer and then returned to the Garden. When he was out of the room, Grandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang Well, have you been to see Mrs Xue, and put it to her yet? Yes Mother, we have, replied Lady Wang. Feng has been so busy with little Qiao-jie the last few days, and we just havent had a chance to go until today. Anyway, my sister seems very happy with the idea, but she says she will have to wait until Pan comes home before saying anything final.
Dont go to a lot of fuss. It would be nice to have some fruit in the room, for the scent. Which room would you prefer? asked Aroma. They are all rather cluttered, except Skybrights old room, which has been empty for quite a while. That might be a bit cold and lonely though. That doesnt matter, said Bao-yu. Have the charcoal brazier moved in there. Aroma gave instructions for this to be done, and as she was speaking a maid came in carrying a tray with a bowl and a pair of ivory chopsticks, which she handed to Musk, saying Heres the soup Miss Hua ordered from the kitchen. Musk took the tray and saw that the bowl contained Birds Nest Soup. Is this what you ordered? she asked Aroma. Yes, replied Aroma with a smile. I thought that as Master Bao had nothing to eat last night- and as he spent most of the night tossing in bed, hed feel rather empty this morning, so I sent the younger maids to order this specially from the kitchen. She told the maid to bring up a table, and Musk served Bao-yu with the soup. When he had drunk it and rinsed his mouth, Ripple came in The rooms ready, she said. Were waiting for the fire to get going properly and the air to clear, and then you can go in, Master Bao. He nodded, but was too lost in thought to reply. Shortly afterwards a maid came in to report that his writing things had been laid out. She received a perfunctory acknowledgement from Bao-yu and was immediately followed by another maid, who announced that breakfast was ready and asked where he wanted it served. Oh, just bring it in here, said Bao-yu. Theres no need to make all this fuss. The maid went out and returned with his breakfast. Bao-yu laughed and turning to Musk and Aroma said I feel so depressed. I honestly dont think I could manage this on my own. Why dont you two join me? That might make the food taste sweeter, and then perhaps I might be able to eat more of it... Musk smiled. Thats just a whim of yours, Master Bao. You know it wouldnt be right for us to eat with you. I dont agree, said Aroma. Weve often drunk wine together in the past. I think it can be allowed as an exception, to cheer him up. Though of course as a regular practice it would be quite out of the question. So the three of them sat down, Bao-yu at the head and the two maids at either side of the table. After breakfast, one of the junior maids brought in the rinsing tea, and Musk and Aroma supervised the clearing of the table. The tea was served and Bao-yu sat in gloomy silence again. Is the room ready yet? he asked eventually. Ripple came in earlier on to tell you, said Musk. What a silly question! After sitting there a moment longer, he made his way over to Skybrights old room. Having lit a stick of incense and arranged - the fruit on the table, he dismissed all the maids and closed the door. Aroma and the others stood outside with bated breath. He selected a length of pink paper with a gold-splash on it and flower patterns in the corners, said a short prayer, raised his brush and began to write FROM GREEN BOY TO SISTER SKYBRIGHT MAY THIS ODE OFFERED WITH LIBATION OF TEA AND -1411 BURNING OF PRECIOUS INCENSE FIND ACCEPTANCE IN YOUR SIGHT O Sweetest and most Inseparable friend! Alas! that in so cruel a storm Your life should end! Your voice is gone, its tender Music none can learn. Forever eastward flows the stream, Never to return. Though dreams may never show Your face to me again, I see the Peacock Cape and feel A haunting pain. When he had finished writing, Bao-yu took a burning joss-stick, held the paper to it and set the ode alight. He sat in silence until the bundle of incense-sticks had burned to the end, then opened the door and walked out. Why are you coming Out again so soon? inquired Aroma. Are you feeling low again? He feigned a laugh. I was rather depressed earlier on. I needed to be on my own for a bit in a quiet place. I feel better now. I think I shall take a stroll. He walked straight out into the Garden. When he reached the Naiads House, he called from the courtyard Is Cousin Lin at home? Whos that? replied Nightingale. She raised the door-curtain and saw him standing there.
Were here now! I want to go home! replied Adamantina. Wholl be my friend and take me home? But this is your home! While the others stayed talking to her, one of the nuns was sent to pray at the shrine of the Goddess of Mercy. She shook the bamboo-box of tallies kept by the altar, and on consulting the relevant passage in the divination-book read that the Yin spirit of the south-west corner had been offended. Of course! exclaimed one of the others, when she reported back. The south-west corner of the Garden was originally uninhabited, so it would be sure to contain a high concentration of Yin essence. Some busied themselves making soup, others brought water. One of the nuns, who had come with Adaniantina from the South and was for that reason closer and more devoted to her than the others, sat next to her on the couch and put her arms protectively round her. Adamantina turned her head Whos that? Its only me. Adamantina looked at her curiously for a minute. Oh it really is! she cried, and flung her arms round the nun, sobbing hysterically. Oh Mother, save me, or Im going to die! The nun called out to her in an attempt to bring her to her senses, and began to massage her gently. The old women brought in tea, and they sat up together till dawn when finally Adamantina dozed off. The nun sent for the doctor, and several doctors came and took her pulses. There were as many differing diagnoses as there were doctors. Excessive worry damaging the spleen phlogistic intrusion into the haematic system offence caused to an evil spirit a combination of internal and external chill. None of these seemed conclusive. Finally a doctor came whose first question after reading her pulses was -294 Did the young lady practise meditation? The women informed him that it was a regular thing with her. -294 And did this illness develop quite suddenly last night? Yes, it did. Indubitably a case of heat in the cardiac orb affording entrance to a vagrant evil spirit. Will she be all right? Luckily the meditation does not seem to have been too far advanced and the spirit was therefore not able to penetrate too deeply. She will most probably recover. He wrote out a prescription for the Dephlogistication of the Cardiac Orb, after one dose of which Adamantina began to show signs of improvement. News of her attack soon spread, and it became a sublect of gossip for the lads in town. All that chastity and religion was bound to be too much for a girl of her age. Especially such an attractive, lively thing... Sooner or later shell get soft on some lucky fellow and run away. A few days later Adamantina was slightly better. But her concentration seemed to have gone and she often found herself drifting off into a dreamlike state. The news did not reach Xi-chun for a few days. She was sitting in her room when Landscape came hurrying in. Miss, have you heard whats happened to Sister Adamantina? No - what is it? I heard Miss Xing and Mrs Zhu talking about it yesterday. Remember that day she was here playing Go? Apparently that very night she had a fit. She was talking about bandits trying to carry her away and all sorts of other strange things. She still hasnt quite recovered. Dont you think its peculiar? Xi-chun thought silently to herself So for all her fastidious purity, Addies worldly karma is still not complete. If only I had been born into a different family! If only I were free to become a nun! I would never be tempted by evil spirits. I know I would be able to subdue every unholy thought and achieve total detachment from the world and all its entanglements. With this thought she experienced a sudden sense of illumination, which she tried to express in the following gtha Since at first there was no space, Things can have no proper place. From Void all comes To Void must all return. She told a maid to light some incense, and meditated for a while. Then she took down her Go Handbook and began looking through it, studying the tactics 6f such famous Go Masters of old as Kong Rong and Wang Ji-xin. There was Crab Wrapped in Lotus Leaves, and Golden Oriole Strikes Hare but she found neither of these very impressive, and Corner Kill in Thirty Six Moves she found too hard to understand and harder still to remember. It was Dragon-chain of Ten Galloping Horses that really caught her fancy. She was still working it out, when she heard someone come into the courtyard and call out Landscape! But to know who this visitor was, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 88 Bao-yu gratifies his grandmother by praising a fatherless child Cousin Zhen rectifies family discipline by chastising two unruly servants Xi-chun was puzzling over her Go Handbook when she heard someone calling outside Landscape!
Ive decided to stay up till dawn. She called rebelliously for more wine, but did put the cape and hood on notwithstanding. The other ladies drank with her for company and did their best to be amusing. Then, silencing them once more, the sound of the flute concealed in the cassia-bushes below came stealing into their ears, this time 511 more plaintive even than before. Indeed, this time the combination of the flutes melancholy with the effects of nocturnal stillness and ghostly moonlight induced a feeling of such overpowering sadness in the listeners that they turned their backs on it and sought, with talk and somewhat forced laughter, to escape it. Fresh wine was called for and the flautist told to stop playing. Ill cheer you up, Lady Jia, said You-shi. Let me tell you a funny story. I learnt it specially for the occasion. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, that would be very nice, a joke. Do tell me, said Grandmother Jia with a jollity that seemed somewhat strained. There were once four brothers, You-shi began. The eldest had only one eye, the second had only one ear, the third had only one nostril, and the fourth, though he had all his parts in order, was dumb. She had got no farther with her story when she became aware that the old ladys head was nodding down upon her bosom and her eyelids drooping as though she was about to go to sleep. She broke off at once, and she and Lady Wang both called gently to her to wake up. Grandmother Jia opened her eyes wide and laughed. Im not sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Go on with your story. Im listening. Its very late, said Lady Wang. The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew. Wont you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth watching. What time is it? Grandmother Jia asked. Past two oclock, said Lady Wang. The children couldnt hold out any longer. They have all gone off to bed. Grandmother Jia looked round the table. Only Tan-chun was still sitting there in the semicircle of empty chairs. Well, said Grandmother Jia, they are not used to staying up late. Considering the amount of weakness and sickliness there is among them, I suppose it is just as well. But theres my little Tan, sitting there all on her own, poor child! You go to bed too, my dear. Well end the party now. 512 She got up herself as she said this, and after taking a sip or two of green tea, climbed into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the Garden by two women, the rest walking beside her or following close behind. But of her and them no more. One of the women who remained behind to clear the table and stack the crockery noticed that a single porcelain cup was missing. After looking everywhere for it unsuccessfully, she appealed to the other servants. I suppose one of you must have dropped it accidentally and thrown it away somewhere. Do please tell us, and let us have the broken pieces, so that when we report the loss we shant be accused of having stolen it. None of us has broken it, said the others. It might have been a maid of one of the young ladles that broke it. If you can think who it might have been, I should go and ask them. You are right, said the woman, suddenly recollecting. I remember Kingfisher coming to fetch a cup for her mistress. I must go and ask her for it. She had not far to look. A short way along the paved path at the bottom of the steps she came upon her and Nightingale walking along together. It was Kingfisher who spoke first. Oh, has Her Old Ladyship ended the party then? I suppose you dont know where my mistress has gone? Ive come to ask you what youve done with one of our teacups, said the woman, and you ask me about your mistress! Kingfisher laughed. I poured out a cup of tea some time ago and handed it to her, and the next thing I knew was shed disappeared - with the teacup. Her Ladyship said just now that the young ladies had all gone to bed, said the woman. I dont know where you two can have been larking about all this time not to know anything about it. Im sure our mistresses wouldnt have slipped off to bed without telling us, said Kingfisher. More likely they lust went off for a walk. Perhaps when Her Old Ladyship left they joined the others to see her back to her apartment.
Autumn took charge of this and detailed the other maids to proceed with service. Patience came in and said with a smile Theres something I forgot to mention earlier, maam. At midday, while you were over at Her Old Ladyships, one of the prioresss women from Water-moon Priory came to see you, to ask for a couple of jars of southern pickle and for an advance of a few months allowance. The prioress has been in poor health, she told me. I asked what the matter was, and she said it had all started four or five days ago. She had been having trouble with some of the Buddhist and Taoist novices at the Priory, who despite several warnings kept leaving their lights on at night. Then one night she noticed the lamps still burning at midnight, and called to them several times. Hearing n6 reply and thinking that they must have fallen asleep with their lights on, she went herself to put them out. When she came back to her room, the strangest thing happened she saw a man and a woman sitting together on the kang, and when she asked them who they were, had a noose slipped round her neck by way of reply. Her cries for help aroused the other sisters, who lit their lamps and came hurrying to the scene to find her prostrate on the floor and foaming at the mouth. Thank heavens they managed to bring her round. She still cannot eat proper meals, which is why she thought of asking for some pickles. Since you were not in I felt I could hardly give her any on my own authority, so I explained where you were, said that I would mention it to you later, and sent her back to the Priory. I should have forgotten all about it if I hadnt heard you asking for pickles just now yourself. Xi-feng stared thoughtfully for a moment. Theres no shortage of pickles, she said at last. Send her some by all means. You can see Mr Qin in a day or two about the money. As she was speaking, Crimson came in to report the arrival of a messenger from Jia Lian. Business had detained him out of town, and he would not be back that night. This had received a perfunctory acknowledgement from Xi-feng, when suddenly there was a burst of crying from the back of the house and one of the junior maids came running breathlessly into the courtyard. Patience was already there and now several of the other maids gathered round and began whispering among themselves. Whats going on out there.? asked Xi-feng. One of the maids has had a bit of a fright, replied Patience. She says shes seen a ghost or something... Which maid? asked Xi-feng sharply. The maid in question entered the room. Whats all this nonsense about ghosts? asked Xi-feng. I was out at the back just now, maam, replied the maid, asking one of the women for more charcoal to put on the braziers, when I heard this eerie noise coming from that small empty building. At first I thought it was just a cat chasing a mouse, but then I .heard it go whee like somebody sighing. I was very frightened and came running back. Stupid creature! snapped Xi-feng. I wont have people talking such superstitious nonsense in my presence! Ive never believed in such things. Go on - get out of my sight! The maid fled. Xi-feng sent for Sunshine and checked through the days remaining accounts. It was nearly nine o clock by the time they finished. She and the others sat for a while chatting, and then she sent the servants off duty for the night and went to bed herself. Just before eleven oclock she was lying in bed still half-asleep, when suddenly her flesh begin to creep and she awoke with. a start. She lay there trembling in ever-increasing terror until she could bear it no longer, and called Patience and Autumn to come over and keep her com p any. Neither of them could understand the strange state slie was in. Autumn had originally been rather hostile to Xi-feng, but she had fallen from favour with Jia Lian because of the part she played in the persecution of You Er-jie and had subsequently been drawn into Xi-fengs camp, though her loyalty remained a matter of convenience and did not compare with the devotion of Patience. On this occasion, seeing her mistress in such a troubled state, she stood dutifully by the bedside and served her with tea. Xi-feng took a sip and said Thank you. You can go back to sleep now. I shall be quite all right with Patience here. But Autumn was eager to please, and protested Surely maam, if you cant get to sleep, it would be best if we took it in turns to sit up with you?
It deserves to have a permanent place in literature alongside the Elegy for the Shamans Daughter by Han-dan Chun! Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly. Most elegies one sees are so stale and derivative, I thought Id try my hand at writing something a bit different. It was only for my own amusement I hadnt intended that anyone else should hear it. Perhaps now that you have heard it, you will let me know of any glaring errors you may have noticed and help me to correct them. Where is the original text? said Dai-yu. I should need to have a careful look at the text first before venturing on any criticism. It was such a long piece, I could barely make out what most of it was about. There were a couple of lines somewhere near the middle that caught my attention The young man in his crimson-curtained bed must seem most cruelly afflicted And the maiden beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated. The general sentiment is all right, but I thought crimson- 583 curtained bed a trifle shop-worn. I dont see why you used that image when there is a much better one to hand. Oh, whats that? said Bao-yu. Weve all got this rose-coloured haze diaphene in our windows, said Dai-yu. Instead of the young man in his crimson-curtained bed, why not say the young man at his rosy-misted casement? Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly. Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I havent got that sort of gauze in my windows so though rosy-misted casement is a great improvement, I dont think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would be a bit presumptuous. But why? said Dai-yu, smiling. My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to lend furs and horses and feel no resentment when they came back the worse for wear. And that was to mere acquaintances we two are members of the same family. I agree with you that one ought to share with ones friends, said Bao-yu, and not only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them. But for a mere male to arrogate to himself what properly belongs to you girls would be quite a different matter. It would be better to alter young man and maiden and let it be your elegy. After all, you were always very well-disposed towards Skybright. Id rather give the elegy to someone else than throw away your rosy-misted casement. Lets make it The mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted And the maid beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated. I should be very happy to alter it in that way, even though it would mean that the elegy would cease to have anything to do with me. 584 She wasnt my maid, said Dai-yu. It doesnt make sense. Besides, mistress and maid are such an unpoetical combination. I might want to use this version when Nightingale is dead, but that wont be for a long while yet, I imagine. Come now, its not very nice to talk about Nightingale dying, said Bao-yu, laughing. You started it, said Dai-yu. I know what, said Bao-yu. Ive got a still better solution. Why dont we just say I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated? Dai-yu momentarily changed colour yet though the words filled her with an almost unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded approvingly at his suggestion. Yes, thats a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. Im sure you must have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xings place first thing tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Yings betrothal has been decided on. I expect they want you there for the ceremony. Whats the hurry? said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. Ive not been feeling particularly well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow.
596 Im truly sorry, madam. It was a slip of the tongue. I hope you wont hold it against me. Jin-gui smiled magnanimously. Oh, that doesnt matter. You dont need to worry about that. About this name of yours, though I really dont think that Caltrop is very appropriate. I should like to change it, but I dont know whether you would be willing to let me. Oh, madam, what a thing to say! said Caltrop, smiling. I am your chattel, to do with exactly as you wish who am I to be willing or unwilling? If you wish to change my name, my name already is whatever you wish to change it to! Jin-gui smiled, somewhat unpleasantly. You may say that, but I fear your Miss Bao may be rather less happy about it. Ah no, madam. You see, when I was bought by the family, I used first to work for Mrs Xue thats how Miss Bao came to give me my name, not because I was Miss Baos own maid. Then after that I served the master. Miss Bao has nothing to do with me - especially now you are here. In any case, shes a very sensible young lady - not at all the sort of person to make a fuss about a little thing like this. Very well, said Jin-gui in that case, since a water-lily is a much more appropriate flower to name someone after than a caltrop, I think we ought to call you Lily. Very good, madam, let that be my name then, said Caltrop, smiling. Lily she became then from that moment. Bao-chai, when she heard about it, appeared totally unconcerned. Xue Pan was in some respects like the general of old in whom conquest did but breed appetite for further conquest, for when, after his marriage to Jin-gui, he discovered that she had an attractive, rather coquettish maid called Moonbeam, he was continually calling to her to bring him things -cups of tea and the like - so as to have an opportunity of flirting with her. Moonbeam perfectly well understood what he was up to but had to behave circumspectly from fear of Jin-gui, whom she studied carefully for some sign which would indicate how she wanted her to respond. 597 Jin-gui had indeed noticed Xue Pans interest in her maid and reasoned within herself as follows. Ive been wanting to deal with Caltrop, but so far havent found a way of getting at her. Since hes already taken a fancy to Moonbeam, I might just as well let him have Moonbeam, because hes sure to grow cooler towards Caltrop as a consequence and I shall be able to take advantage of that in order to get rid of Caltrop and with Caltrop out of the way, settling Moonbeams hash ought to be easy, because Moonbeam is my own servant. Having decided on a strategy, she had only to await a suitable opportunity of putting it into practice. Such an opportunity occurred one evening when Xue Pan, having drunk himself into a state of cheerful inebriation, called as was his wont to Moonbeam to bring him some tea. while Moonbeam was handing him the cup, he deliberately gave her fingers a squeeze Moonbeam, with a very unnatural affectation of modesty, drew back her hand and since neither of them had their minds on what they were doing, the cup crashed to the floor, splashing hot tea over Moonbeams skirt and everything else round about. Xue Pan tried to cover up his embarrassment by pretending that Moonbeam had not handed him the cup properly, while Moonbeam for her part said that the master had not taken a proper hold. Jin-gui hooted at them contemptuously. You two really are a comedy! You must think Im an idiot. Xue Pan hung his head and laughed sheepishly and Moonbeam fled blushing from the room when, not long after this, it was time to go to bed, Jin-gui tried to turn Xue Pan out of the bedroom and make him sleep elsewhere. She said she was tired of seeing him go around all the time looking as if he was wasting away with passion. Xue Pan smiled foolishly and said nothing. If you want to do something, why dont you tell me? she said. All this groping in corners will get you nowhere. Encouraged by her words and fortified by what he had drunk against any feeling of shame, he knelt down on the bed-covers beside her and seized her hand. 598 -15947 Listen, lover, he said if you will let me have your Moonbeam, Ill give you anything you ask for - anything at all. If its human brains you want, I shall see that you have them. what nonsense you talk!
You exaggerate, Sir Zheng... Well, we shall see... On this note of light-hearted banter, they continued their game. When it was finished and they counted up the pieces, Zhan was seven down. It all depended on that last ko, commented Feng. You gained the advantage, sir, because you were less vulnerable to a ko threat. Jia Zheng turned to Feng. Please forgive us. How are you keeping? It has been a long while since we last met, said Feng. My visit today is partly of a social nature, and partly occasioned by the presence in the capital of a deputy-prefect from Kwangsi province, who is here for an audience with His Majesty and has brought with him four curios, some of them imported, that would make excellent palace-offerings. The first is a folding screen of twenty-four panels, carved of pure blackwood. Though the stone used for the carved inlay - landscapes, figures, buildings, birds and flowers - is not jade, it is a high quality serpentine. Each panel has a palace scene, with fifty or sixty palace-ladies. It is called "Spring Morning in the Han Palace". The features, gestures and costumes are rendered with great clarity. The finish is quite exquisite, the detail and composition of the highest order. It would be perfect for the main hall of Prospect Garden, sir. The second item is a large wall-clock over three feet high. This is a most unusual item. It has a little figure of a boy on the face that indicates the hour with a pointer, and inside it has a little mechanical orchestra. Those two heavier articles I was not able to bring with me. I have however brought the other two, which I think you will find quite fascinating. Feng produced an embroidered casket wrapped in several layers of white damask-silk. Unwrapping it, he raised the lid, removed the protective pad of silk-wool beneath it and displayed its contents. In the top compartment of the casket lay a little glass container with a fitted lid. In this container, on a piece of crimson silk that lined its inner casing of gold, lay a magnificent lustrous pearl, as large as a longan. This, announced Feng, is known as a Mother Pearl. He asked for a tray and Zhang Guang handed him a teatray of black lacquer, asking Will this do? Perfectly, replied Feng, taking from the inner pocket of his gown a white silk bundle. This too contained pearls, of an ordinary size, which he tipped out onto the tray. He then placed the Mother Pearl in their midst and put the tray down on the table. Like so many perfect drops of water the smaller pearls rolled across the tray towards the large central pearl. And when Feng lifted the Mother, all the little ones clung to her. Not a single one was left on the tray. Amazing! exclaimed Zhan Guang. An interesting phenomenon, observed Jia Zheng. And most appropriately named. Where is the other casket? asked Feng turning to his page, who promptly came forward with a rosewood casket held aloft in both hands. The three men gathered round as it was opened. On its lining of tiger-brocade lay a length of blue gauze-like material, many times folded. And what is this? asked Zhan Guang. This, replied Feng, is called Byssus Net. He took it from the casket and laid it on the table. Folded as it was, it occupied a space no more than five inches long and less than half an inch thick. Feng began to unfold it. When he had done so a dozen times, it extended over the edge of the table. There are still two folds to come, he explained. To unfold it to its full extent we would need to hang it in a room with a high ceiling. This fabric is woven from the Byssus, the so-called Mermaids Tears. In extreme heat it would make a perfect fly and mosquito-net for use in a large reception hall. As you can see, it is extremely light and transparent. Please do not unfold it fully, said Jia Zheng. It might prove hard to fold again. Feng and Zhan Guang carefully folded the net and replaced it in its casket. The price being asked for these four curios is really very reasonable, said Feng. I think he would be willing to part with the four for twenty thousand taels. Ten thousand for the Mother Pearl, five thousand for the Byssus Net and two thousand five hundred each for the screen and striking clock. We. could not possibly buy them, Im afraid, said Jia Zheng. But with your connections in the palace, said Feng, surely they would make an ideal I dare say they would, replied Jia Zheng. I dare say all sorts of things would.
Grandmother Jia by no means shared his enthusiasm however, after reflecting that the couplings of young people are to a large extent fated and that, as Jia She was after all the girls father, it was not really for her to interfere, she made some neutral response such as I see or Oh, are you? and left it at that. Jia Zheng felt a much more positive antipathy to the match. He detested the Suns. Though the connection between the two families was a long-standing one, it had come about because Sun Shao-zus grandfather, who had been the worst possible sort of social climber, had wormed his way into the patronage of Jia Zhengs grandfather and great-uncle for the 586 sole purpose of concluding some dubious business that he could not have brought off on his own. In Jia Zhengs view they lacked both education and breeding. He spoke to Jia She on two separate occasions advising him very strongly against the match but as Jia She refused to take the slightest bit of notice, there was nothing much he could do. Bao-yu had never met Sun Shao-zu before. Obliged to do so at his uncles place next day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of, he was appalled, in the course of conversation, to discover just how soon the marriage was to be it seemed that Ying-chun would be going to her husbands house before the end of that year. When some time later Lady Ying came over to tell Grandmother Jia that she now wanted to move Ying-chun out of the Garden for good, he became even more depressed. That strange apathy they had observed in him on previous occasions again came over him. The news that Ying-chun would be taking four maids with her to the Sun household provoked some stamping and groans and the remark that five more decent people were now lost to the world but it was only a momentary outburst. He took to wandering about for hours on end in the neighbourhood of Amaryllis Eyot, now shuttered and forlorn and with only one or two women of the night-watch on duty in it. The very reeds and knotgrass along its banks and the caltrops and pondweed in the water seemed to have taken on a wilting, dejected look, as if they too were missing the presence of their former tenant. All the charm and colour which had once endeared the spot to him seemed now to have abandoned it. So strong was this feeling, that it eventually began forming itself into a poem, the words of which came almost unbidden to his lips. The pools pink -petalled lotus crowns have gone, By one nights nipping wind of autumn blown Like stricken mourners, knotgrass and caltrop-heads Under the weight of frost and dew bow down And the board whose Go-stones clicked the long day through With mud of sluttish swallows is blotched brown. Old poets for parted friends made such a din What grief must mine be then for closest kin? 587 Just as he had finished reciting this poem, Bao-yu heard a laugh behind him. What are you mooning about for this time? Bao-yu glanced back and saw that it was Caltrop. He turned to greet her. My dear Caltrop! What brings you here today? You are becoming quite a stranger in this Garden. Caltrop clapped her hands as if she found his question a great joke. I am always longing to come here, she said, but now that your Cousin Pan is home again, I am no longer a free agent. Just now Mrs Xue was trying to get hold of Mrs Lian and they told her that she was in the Garden. I asked for the job of going to look for her simply as an excuse for coming here. I have just seen Mrs Lians maid and she told me that her mistress is with Mrs Zhu in Sweet-rice Village. Im on my way there now. Tell me, how is Aroma these days? And how was it that Skybright died so suddenly? What was wrong with her? And Miss Ying - she moved out very suddenly, didnt she? Just look at this place, it already looks deserted! Bao-yu did his best to answer her. He also invited her to accompany him back to Green Delights and have some tea there. I cant at the moment, said Caltrop. Wait till Ive seen Mrs Lian and given her my message and Ill come and see you then. Whats this important message that you are in such a hurry to give her? said Bao-yu. It has to do with your Cousin Pan getting married. I see, said Bao-yu. Who did they finally settle on? They seemed to be wrangling about it for months.
Three days she spent in her old apartment in the Garden after that she had to go and stay with Lady Xing. Before doing so she called on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to say good-bye. Her leave-taking with the cousins which followed was extremely painful. It was all that Aunt Xue and Lady Wang could do to calm the young people in their grief. Ying-chun stayed two days with Lady Xing and it was to Lady Xings place that the Sun family servants came to collect her. Needless to say, she felt little inclined to go with them but fear of her husbands evil temper made her conceal her reluctance and hurry over her leave-taking. Lady Xing had 613 never been much interested in her daughters welfare -during the two days that Ying-chun was with her she never once inquired whether her relations with her husband were harmonious and the duties required of her in her new household not too onerous - and such expressions of maternal sentiment as she may have indulged in at her departure were of only the most perfunctory and superficial kind. As to what followed her departure to know that, dear reader, you will have to look into another volume. EXPLICIT TERTIA PARS LAPIDIS HISTORIAE CHAPTER 81 -1922 Four young ladies go fishing and divine the future Bao-yu receives a homily and is re-enrolled in the Family School -347 TO CONTINUE OUR STORY -1307 After Ying-chuns departure, Lady Xing continued as though nothing had happened. It was Lady Wang who had gone out of her way to be kind, and her sympathy was genuine and deeply felt. In the morning, when Baoyu came to her apartment to pay his respects, he found her a!one, sighing pensively to herself. He thought he could see traces of tears on her cheeks, and not wanting to intrude, stood to one side. When she told him to sit down, he sidled up onto the kang and settled down next to her. He lapsed at once into a silent stare, and she could tell that he had something on his mind. Well, and what are you looking so glum for? Nothing really... I just cant stop thinking about Cousin Ying. Its so awful. I havent mentioned it to Grannie, hut I havent been able to sleep properly for two nights now. How helpless and defenceless she must feel, especially after growing up in a family like ours! Shes so weak too, and never could stand up for herself properly. Why should she of all people have to fall into the hands of such a bully, someone wholl never be able to give her the sort of tenderness and understanding she needs? He was on the verge of tears. It is hard, I know, said Lady Wang. But as they say, marry a daughter, throw out the water". At this stage, what is there I could possibly do? -576 Ive thought of something, replied Bao-yu somewhat unexpectedly. It came to me last night. If we report the whole thing to Grannie, we can get her permission to fetch Ying and move her back to Amaryllis Eyot. Why not? Shell be able to lead her old carefree life, well all be together again, and that Mr Sun can go to hell and take his temper with him! If he dares to try and ask for her back, well simply refuse to let her go. He can come a hundred times, well never give in. Well just say that its Grannies orders, and he wont be able to do a thing. Dont you think its a brilliant plan? My dear child! exclaimed Lady Wang, her voice registering both amusement and motherly vexation at this effusion. There you go again carried away by yet another of your silly ideas! How can you be so hopelessly naive? Cant you see that sooner or later every girl has to leave home, and that once shes married her own family has no business to interfere? She must look to her own future. If fate has been kind to her, well and good. If not, she must learn to live with it all the same. You must know the old rhyme When rooster crows at break of day, All his hen-folk must obey. No choice for a dogs wife But to make the best of a dogs life. -587 Not all the girls can be called to court like your elder sister, you know. Besides, Ying is still an inexperienced wife, and her husband a young man. Their temperaments differ, and if at this early stage they dont get on very well together, thats only to be expected. Given time, when theyve both learned to understand one another better and have a family of their own, things will sort themselves out, Im sure they will.
Im sure you know them. Mama said that our Crimson used to be one of your maids, said Qiao-jie out of the blue . And she says she still hasnt found you anyone to replace her. Shes thinking of giving you Mrs Lius daughter, Fivey I think her name is, if youre happy about it... Bao-yu was delighted to hear this and said with a grin Your mother doesnt have to ask me about things like that. She makes all the decisions. -347 He turned with a smile to Grandmother Jia. My young niece shows every sign of growing up to be a second Cousin Feng. Only I think she may be even cleverer, and will have the added advantage of being able to read. Ive no objection to girls learning their letters, commented Grandmother Jia. But needlework must always come first. Nannie Liu teaches me embroidery, said Qiao-jie. I can do flowers and chain-patterns. Im not very good yet, but Im learning. In a family like ours, said Grandmother J ia, we never need to do our own sewing, I know. But its as well to know how. Then you will never be at the mercy of others. Yes, Great-grannie, Qiao-jie smilingly replied. She would have welcomed some more Paragons of Virtue, but thought Bao-yu looked a little preoccupied and did not venture to ask. What was preoccupying Bao-yu? The answer lies in Qiao-jies mention of Fivey. This attractive girl had been originally designated for Green Delights, but one obstacle after another had so far prevented her from entering service there. First it had been illness then they had been wary of choosing a good-looking maid for Bao-yu in the puritanical phase that followed on Lady Wangs expulsion of Skybright. A further opportunity of seeing her had presented itself when she and her mother had arrived with gifts during his secret visit to Skybright at her cousins house - and his earlier favourable impression of her had been confirmed. She really was extremely pretty. What marvellous luck that Xi-feng should have remembered her now, and was arranging for her to take Crimsons place! While Bao-yu was day-dreaming, Grandmother Jia was becoming more and more impatient at the lateness of her guests and sent word to hurry them along. A few minutes later the first contingent arrived Li Wan and her two cousins Wen and Qi, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, Shi Xiang-yun and Lin Dai-yu. They all paid their respects to Grandmother Jia and greeted one another. Aunt Xue had still not come, and Grandmother Jia sent for her. Finally she arrived, accompanied by Baoq in. Bao-yu paid his respects, and said hello to Bao-qm, wondering why it was that neither Bao-chai nor Xing Xiu-yan had come. When Dai-yu asked outright, Why couldnt Cousin Chai come today?, Aunt Xue pretended that she was not feeling well. Xiu-yan had stayed away because she knew that Aunt Xue her future mother-in-law would be there. Bao-chais absence caused a momentary depression in Bao-yus spirits, which was however soon dispelled by the presence of Dai-yu. Lady Xing and Lady Wang arrived shortly afterwards. Xi-feng, who heard that they were there before her and was embarrassed at the thought of being late, sent Patience ahead to apologize for her. Mrs Lian was meaning to come, but she has had a bit of a fever and wont be coming till later, said Patience. If shes not feeling well, she neednt bother to come at all, said Grandmother Jia. We ought to start our lunch now. The maids moved the charcoal brazier to the back of the room and placed two tables in front of Grandmother Jias couch, at which the party now arranged itself for lunch. After lunch they sat once more round the brazier chatting pleasantly, and there for the present we must leave them. -347 What was really detaining Xi-feng? It had at first been no more than her embarrassment at being later than Ladies Xing and Wang. But this had been further complicated by the arrival of Brighties wife, who informed her that one of Ying-chuns women-servants had come to pay her respects. The woman had come straight to Xi-fengs apartment and had not notified the main mansion of her presence. Xi-feng was puzzled, and summoned her into the room. Is your mistress well? she asked. Anything but well, replied the woman. But thats not what Ive come about, maam.
had no idea why they were being treated in this way and spent the night sitting up in suspense. Although the maids in the Gardens various residences knew by now of their arrival, they had only been given the official story and knew nothing of the real facts of the case. Early next day Jia Zheng, having completed his night duty, was about to leave the Board when another urgent file was passed down to him the City Wall Repairs Estimates and Accounts for two of the Provincial Capitals, for Immediate Audit. He foresaw a considerable delay, and sent a message home to Jia Lian, authorizing him to go ahead and question Lai Da when he returned from the Temple, and to deal with the case as he saw fit. Jia Lian received these instructions with relief, mainly on young Qins behalf, as he would now be spared the Masters wrath. On further reflection, however, it occurred to him that he might attract Jia Zhengs suspicion if he were to brush the entire affair under the carpet. It would be wiser to consult Lady Wang. Then if he incurred the Masters displeasure, at least he would not be solely responsible. Having decided on this course of action, Jia Lian went to see Lady Wang and told her what had happened, concluding Uncle Zheng was extremely angry about the anonymous poster and gave orders for Lai Da to bring young Qin and all the girls here for questioning. Today Uncle is too busy to deal with this sordid matter himself, and has asked me to consult you about it. What do you think we should do, Aunt? I never heard of such a disgraceful business! exclaimed Lady Wang in horror. If young Qin really has behaved in this degrading fashion, the family should have nothing more to do with him. Mind you, its a despicable way to carry on, to go putting posters up about people... Do you suppose there is any truth in it? Have you asked Qin about it yet? What has he to say for himself? Ive questioned him, replied Lian. Only a few moments ago, as a matter of fact. Of course he denied the whole thing. But consider, Aunt supposing he really had done it, do you think he would admit to it? Personally I dont think he did. He knows that the girls are liable to be called to Court at short notice, and would be too scared of a scandal. We could find out the truth easily enough. But what then? What do you suggest? Where are the girls now? asked Lady Wang. They are locked up in the Garden, replied Jia Lian. Do the others know that they are there? They probably all know by now. But so far as they are concerned the girls are on their way to the Palace. That is what everyone has been told. Good, said Lady Wang. We must get rid of these creatures immediately, once and for all. I never wanted to keep them on in the first place it was all your idea and Xi-fengs. Didnt I say it would end in trouble? Youd better tell Lai Da to go through them one by one and find out if theyve any relatives left at home. Find their contracts and authorize whatever money is necessary to hire a boat for them - twenty or thirty taels should be enough. Put someone dependable in charge and have them all taken home to wherever they came from in the first place. They can take their contracts with them, and that will be the end of that. Even if one or two of them have been up to some mischief, I dont think it would be fair to punish them indiscriminately, by making them all return to lay-life. And if we hand them over to the official broker who usually finds husbands for orphan girls, even though we dont want the body price, someone is sure to try and make money out of them, and no one will think of their welfare. Who knows what might happen to them? As for Qin, I want you to tell him in no uncertain manner exactly what we think of him. He is never to come here again except for a clan sacrifice or some other big celebration. He had better keep well out of Sir Zhengs way too, unless he wants a taste of real trouble. And dont forget to tell the accounts people to cancel the relevant entry. Send someone to the Temple, concluded Lady Wang, with strict instructions from Sir Zheng that none of the male members of the clan is to be allowed in there, except for the specific purpose of burning paper-money at the grave-site. And if there is any more nonsense, we will have all the Sisters removed too. Jia Lian took this all in and went to give Lai Da his orders. That is what Her Ladyship says you are to do, he said. Report to me when youve finished, and I shall report back to Her Ladyship.
What's his idea, I wonder? Does he want to drive me to my death?' Xue Pan, for whose ears this was, of course, intended, became apprehensive that the difficulties Caltrop was making might once more prevent him from enjoying Moonbeam, and he came rushing into Caltrop's room to rebuke her. 'Don't you realize, this is an honour your mistress is doing you? You do as you're told and sleep with her, or I'll give you a beating!' Caltrop had now no choice but to roll up her bedding and carry it into Jin-gui's room. Jin-gui told her to make her bed up on the floor. This order too she had to obey. As soon as she had settled down for the night, Jin-gui called to her for some tea. Caltrop brought her the tea and lay down again. A little after that Jin-gui called to her to come and massage her legs. And so it went on, seven or eight times in the course of the night, so that it was impossible for Caltrop to get right off to sleep or even to rest properly. Now that Xue Pan had got Moonbeam, he was like a man who has come into possession of a priceless jewel. He forsook all other interests for her. This secretly enraged Jin-gui, who could not forbear some jealous mutterings when she was on her own. 'Enjoy yourself while you can, my friend,' she would say. 'I shall get round to you in the end. And when I do, you had better not complain!' For the time being, however, she refrained from outbursts and set about laying a trap for Caltrop. About a fortnight after Caltrop moved into her room she suddenly pretended to be ill. She complained of agonizing pains in the heart and appeared unable to move her limbs. Nothing they did for her seemed to bring relief. The servants said it must have been brought on by something Caltrop had done to upset her. 601 A couple of days later, as one of the maids was shaking out Jin-gui's pillow, a cut-out paper mannikin fell out of it. It had the eight symbols of her nativity written on it and five needles sticking into it, one in the heart and one in each of the limbs. This item of news was thought sufficiently interesting to be reported to Aunt Xue, instantly throwing that poor lady into a highly inflammable state of nervous commotion. The effect the news had upon Xue Pan was even more violent. He was for having all the servants flogged immediately until one of them confessed to having planted the paper figure but Jin-gui prevented him. 'Why make the innocent suffer?' she said. 'I expect it's Moonbeam who did it, to get me out of the way.' 'That's most unfair,' said Xue Pan. 'When, during this past week or two, has Moonbeam had the time to go inside your room?' 'Who else could it have been then?' said Jin-gui. 'I suppose you don't think I'd do it to myself? Moonbeam is the only one who'd dare go in my room.' 'But Lily's been in here with you all the time,' said Xue Pan. 'She must know, if anyone does. She's the one to flog if we want to find out.' 'What's the good of flogging anyone?' said Jin-gui. 'They'll never confess anything. If you ask me, you'd much better pretend you haven't heard about it and let the matter drop. When all's said and done, it doesn't much matter if I die. You can always find yourself a better wife when you feel like it. If we're going to be honest, the fact of the matter is, you all three hate me, don't you ?' She began crying bitterly. Xue Pan was so enraged that he snatched up a door-bar and rushed off in search of Caltrop straight away. He began hitting her with it as soon as he found her, on the head, on the face, on the body, shouting accusations at her but giving her no chance to deny them. Aunt Xue came running out in answer to Caltrop's anguished cries and shouted to him to stop. 'How can you beat the girl like that without first making an attempt to find out what has happened? She's given us years of faithful service it's unthinkable that she'd do a 602 -1307 thing like that. Time enough to start laying about you after you've made a serious attempt to get to the bottom of it.' When Jin-gui heard her mother-in4aw saying this, she was afraid that Xue Pan might weaken. Her crying rose in pitch into a sort of plaintive yell. 'You have monopolized Moonbeam now for over a fortnight and refused to let anyone but Lily sleep with me.
It really wont do to allow them to stay together indefinitely. What do you all think? After a thoughtful silence Lady Wang replied, choosing her words with care Miss Lin reads such a lot into things. And Bao-yus childish manner is deceptive he can be extremely stupid and tactless. If we remove either one of them from the Garden, wont it be too obvious? It has always been said that every boy becomes a groom and every girl becomes a bride. Dont you think, Mother, that a better solution would be to go ahead as quickly as possible and get them both married? Grandmother Jia frowned. I know that Miss Lins peculiar temperament is in some ways attractive. But I dont think we could possibly have her as a wife for Bao-yu. Besides, Im- afraid that with such a delicate constitution she is unlikely to live to any age. Im sure Bao-chai is in every respect the more suitable choice. Of course we all agree with you there, Mother, said Lady Wang. But we must find a husband for Miss Lin too. If we do not, and if she has taken a fancy to Bao-yu -after all, it is only natural for a girl to have such feelings as she grows up - it might make things very -difficult if she were then to discover that he was already betrothed to Bao-chai. There can be no question, replied Grandmother Jia, of marrying an outsider before one of the family. The order must be first to marry Bao-yu, then to have Miss Lin betrothed. Besides Miss Lin is two years younger than Bao-yu anyway. If I understand you correctly, we shall have to conceal Bao-yus betrothal from her... Xi-feng turned at once to the various maids present Is that clear? Not a word of Master Baos betrothal to anyone! If I catch one of you talking about it I shall show no mercy. Feng dear, continued Grandmother Jia, I have noticed that since your illness you have taken less interest in what happens in the Garden. You really must give it more of your attention. Its not just the sort of thing we have been talking about. Any repetition of that disgraceful drinking and gambling that was discovered among the servants last year must be prevented at all costs. Be rather more particular, will you, and keep a watchful eye on what goes on. They need to be- disciplined, and you seem to be the one they respect most. Yes, Grannie, said Xi-feng. The ladies sat talking for a while longer, then left to go their separate ways. From now on Xi-feng began to inspect the Garden on a more regular basis. One day, in the course of one of her tours of inspection, she was walking along the bank by Amaryllis Eyot when she heard an old woman shouting outside the courtyard and went to investigate. As she drew near the old serving-woman caught sight of her, dropped her hands to her side and stood to attention, mumbling a confused Good morning, maam. Why are you making such a racket out here? asked Xi-feng. You and Mrs Zhu have given me a job to do here, maam, replied the woman, looking after the flowerbeds and fruit-trees. Id done nothing wrong, and Miss Xings maid accused us of stealing.. And why should she do that? asked Xi-feng. - Yesterday our Blackie came with me here to play, replied the woman. She didnt know any better and went inside Miss Xings apartment to have a look around. I sent her home straight away. Then early this morning I heard one of the maids say theyd lost something. When I asked what it was, she started questioning me all about it Thats no cause for you to lose your temper, retorted Xi-feng. what This Garden belongs to Mrs Zhus family not hers! protested the old woman. We work for Mrs Zhu and I wont be called a thief! Xi-feng spat straight in the old - womans face and said harshly Hold your tongue! Thats quite enough! Youre responsible for things here and if something is lost the maids are quite right to hold you accountable for it. How dare you talk such nonsense! Call Steward Lin and have her dismissed! The maids were carrying out her orders when Xing Xiu-yan came hurrying out. She greeted Xi-feng and said with an anxious smile You mustnt do that! It was nothing really. And its all over now. My dear girl, said Xi-feng, that is not the right attitude to take. Its the principle Im concerned with. The servants must learn to know their place. Xiu-yan saw that the woman was on her knees begging for mercy, and asked Xi-feng at once to go inside with her and sit down.
Meanwhile Jia She had joined the gathering. At noon, the four of them were still waiting for Jia Lians messenger to return with news from the College, when one of the janitors came in to report the arrival of two Palace Eunuchs, with an Imperial Communication for Sir She and Sir Zheng. Show them in, ordered Jia She, and he and his brother went out to greet them at the inner gate. They knelt Manchu-style and did homage as Her Graces most Humble Servants, before ushering the Imperial delegation through the gateway and across the courtyard to the main reception-hall, where they begged them both to be seated. One of the eunuchs rose to his feet and said Your daughter, Her Grace the Imperial Concubine, having been somewhat indisposed of late, it is His Majestys Pleasure that four ladies of her family should visit the Imperial Bedchamber tomorrow. Each lady is to be permitted a single maidservant in attendance. Male relatives are to proceed as far as the Inner Gate and present their cards. They may not proceed any further but are to do homage an4 await any further instructions outside the gate. Appointed time of arrival is nine a. m., departure to be completed by five p.m. Jia Zheng and Jia She and all the others present received this edict standing. When it was concluded, they sat down once more and offered the eunuchs tea, after which the Imperial party took its leave. The two senior brothers saw them out as far as the main gate, and then went in to report to Grandmother Jia. Four? queried the old lady. Your two ladies and myself makes three. Who can the fourth place be for? There was a momentary pause. No one dared make a suggestion, and after a moments reflection Grandmother J ia continued It must be meant for Feng. She knows how to cope with any situation. Well, you menfolk go off and make your arrangements. Leaving promptly, Jia She and Jia Zheng gave instructions that apart from Lian and Rong whose job it would be to stay and look after the two mansions, a full turn-out of junior and senior clan-members was expected. Next the servants were told to fit out four of the familys best green court-sedans, and a dozen carriages with blue canopies, and have them lined up before first light in the morning. The servants hurried about their business, while the two Masters returned for a final consultation with Lady Jia. We have to be there at nine oclock, and leave at five, Mother. It seems advisable to retire rather earlier than usual tonight if we are to make a prompt start in the morning. We need to allow ourselves ample time to prepare for court. Very well, replied Grandmother Jia. You can go now. The brothers withdrew, leaving Grandmother Jia with her two daughters-in-law and Xi-feng. TheY talked for a while about Yuan-chuns illness, and then after a little more desultory chat, retired for the night. Next morning, before dawn, maids lit the lamps in every apartment, and the ladies sat down to their toilet. At five oclock, when the ladies were ready and the gentlemen had put the finishing touches to their ceremonial outfits, Steward Lin and Lai Da came to the Inner Gate to report that the chairs and carriages were all ready as ordered and had been drawn up outside. Jia She and Lady Xing arrived, and the party was complete. After breakfast, which they all took together, Lady Jia led them out, leaning on Xi-fengs arm, and the household gathered round as the four ladies, each accompanied by a single maid, walked slowly out. An advance party, consisting of Li Gui and one other senior boy, went on horseback to make preliminary arrangements at the Outer Gate of the Palace. Three generations of Jias stepped into their carriages or mounted their horses. The procession fell into line and, with retainers swelling the train, set off through the streets. Jia Lian and Jia Rong remained behind to look after the two mansions. The procession came to a halt under Westwall Gate, one of the outer gates of the Forbidden City, and shortly afterwards two eunuchs emerged to announce By Imperial Dispensation! The ladies of the Jia family will now enter the Palace for their Personal Visitation. The gentlemen may also proceed but may not enter the Palace precincts. They will halt at the Inner Gate and do their homage from there. There was a cry of Forward! from the men on the gate, and a junior eunuch guided the four ladies chairs onward, while the gentlemen followed on foot at a stately pace, leaving their servants at the Outer Gate. As they approached the Inner Gate, they could see several elderly eunuchs sitting there, who rose to their feet as the procession arrived and announced Gentlemen of the Jia family!
You and Snowgoose have some of the soup and con-gee. Theyre good and wholesome. Ill see to the incense. The maids went into the outer room to eat. Dai-yu put some more incense on the brazier and sat down again. She was about to pick up a book to read when her attention was caught by the melancholy soughing of the wind through the trees outside. A long sigh swept from one end of the Garden to the other. The metal wind-chimes started jangling under the eaves. Snowgoose was the first to finish her soup, and came in to see if there was anything Dai-yu needed Its turning colder, said Dai-yu. Have those fur clothes had a proper airing yet - the ones I asked you to take out the other day? Yes, Miss. Bring them here, will you? Id like something warm to put over my shoulders. Snowgoose went out and returned with a bundle of fur-lined clothes, wrapped in a piece of felt. She undid the wrapper and held the clothes out for Dai-yu to choose from. Da.i-yu noticed among the clothes another smaller bundle wrapped in silk. She reached out a hand to pick it up, and untied the wrapper. Inside she found a pair of silk handkerchiefs. She recognized them at once as the ones Bao-yu had secretly sent her during his convalescence! There were the verses she had written on them! Even the tear-stains could still be seen! And next to them in the little bundle were the perfumed sachet she had embroidered for him and half-demolished in a fit of pique, the torn fan-case, and the snipped remains of the silken cord she had made for his Magic Jade. Nightingale, in sorting out the clothes for airing, must have come across these mementos in one of the chests, and slipped them into this bundle for safety. Dai-yu seemed to have forgotten Snowgoose and the clothes entirely. She stood with the handkerchiefs in her hands and stared at them as though entranced. As she read the verses tears began to stream down her cheeks. Nightingale came in, to find Snowgoose standing there dumbly, with the felt-wrapped bundle of clothes still held out in front of her, while spread on the little table at Daiyus side were the sachet, fan-case and cord . Dai-yu was holding two faded handkerchiefs with some writing on them, and was gazing at them in tears. As the poet says -2496 Tokens of past estrangement Catch the lovers eye Fresh tears fall On tears of days gone by. Nightingale knew only too well the tender memories attached to each one of those objects. She thought that sympathy would have little chance of success as a remedy, and decided instead to administer a cheerful rebuke. Come along now, Miss, whats the sense in looking at things like that? They belong to the past. You and Master Bao were children then. Goodness knows how many silly tiffs you had! All smiles one minute, crying your hearts out the next. Thank goodness youre both older and have learned to take life a bit more seriously. You wouldnt dream of spoiling pretty things like these now would you? She had meant well. But her words only reminded Daiyu of the old days with Bao-yu, and released a fresh flood of tears. Nightingale tried again to cheer her up Come on now, Miss. Snowgoose is waiting. Please choose something to wear. Dai-yu let the handkerchiefs drop. Nightingale swiftly retrieved them, wrapped them up again with the sachet and the other things, and put them away. Finally Dai-yu draped one of the fur-lined jackets over her shoulders and walked listlessly to the outer-room. She sat down, and looking round saw Bao-chais poem and letter still lying on the table. She picked them up and reread them a couple of times. The feelings the same, she said to herself with a sigh, even if our circumstances are different. I should write something in reply. Ill write four stanzas and set them to an air for the Qin. Then tomorrow I can make a copy and send it to Chai. She told Snowgoose to bring in her brush and inkstone, which were on the table outside, and moistening the ink, began to write. When she had completed four stanzas, she took a Qin Handbook from her shelf and looked through it. She decided to make a suite out of the two old melodies, Lonely Orchid Pavan and faintly Virtue. Having done the pointing, she wrote out a copy of the words there and then to send to Bao-chai, and asked Snowgoose to fetch the three-quarter size Qin she had brought from home, which was stored in a trunk.
There is something I want to say to you all, said Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu and Miss Lin have been together ever since they were little, and this has never troubled me, as I have always thought of them as children. But of late I have noticed how frequent these illnesses of hers are becoming - how suddenly they come, and how suddenly they go - a sure sign that she is growing up. It really wont do to allow them to stay together indefinitely. What do you all think? After a thoughtful silence Lady Wang replied, choosing her words with care Miss Lin reads such a lot into things. And Bao-yus childish manner is deceptive he can be extremely stupid and tactless. If we remove either one of them from the Garden, wont it be too obvious? It has always been said that every boy becomes a groom and every girl becomes a bride.

They are organically related t6 a deficiency of Yin in the liver, with a concomitant diminution of cardiac vitality. Does my diagnosis accord with what you have observed? Nightingale nodded, and turning to Jia Lian said That is exactly how Miss Lin has been, sir. Good, said Doctor Wang, rising from his chair. We may proceed. Jia Lian escorted him out of the Garden and across to his study, where his pages had already laid out the requisite pink prescription form in readiness. Tea was served, then Doctor Wang took up the brush and wrote DIAGNOSIS The six pulses are slow and taut. Prolonged morbid obstruction of the humoral flow. Left distal pulse weak. Diminution of cardiac vitality. Left median pulse strong and irregular. Hyperactivity of the liver Wood. The hepatic humour, unable to disperse naturally, has encroached upwards on the spleen Earth, with consequent loss of appetite. The extreme distemper has also caused a reversal of the elemental sequence, and the lungs Metal have certainly been damaged. Since humour cannot circulate, it has congealed into phlegm. Upsurge and expectoration of blood. TREATMENT -384 1. Sedation of liver. 2. Restoration of lungs. 3. Fortification of both heart and spleen. The usual tonics are too violent in their action. For the present, I suggest my own Black Ethereal Essence, to be taken with Elixir Pneumoferriferum. Prescriptions for both humbly appended for esteemed approval. The doctor wrote out a prescription of seven items and an adjuvant to go with it. Jia Lian took the paper and glanced down the list. I see you include Hares Ear in your prescription, he said. Forgive me if I am wrong, but I thought that was ruled out in haematic eruptions? You must be thinking, replied Doctor Wang with a knowledgeable smile, of its emetic properties, which, as is well known, contra-indicate this particular herb in cases of haemoptysis or epistaxis. But allow me to inform you that in preparation with Turtles Blood as in my prescription, Hares Ear constitutes the only effective remedy we have for draining the humour of the Lesser Yang periphery of the gall-bladder. You see, the judicious admixture of Turtles Blood has the remarkable effect of inhibiting the emetic properties of Hares Ear, while enabling it to restore the hepatic Yin and check the phlogistic disturbance. In the words of the Ars Medicandi "ObstruFta obstruit, aperitque aperta." And the - at first sight - paradoxical inclusion of Hares Ear is none other than the classic stratagem of the loyal counsellor befriending the usurper... I see, said Jia Lian, nodding appreciatively. Thank you for enlightening me, Doctor Wang. The doctor continued I should like the young lady to take two doses of the decoction, and then we shall see whether to alter the prescription, or perhaps try a new one altogether. I have another appointment, so I hope youll excuse me. I shall call again another day. As Jia Lian saw him out, he asked And what have you prescribed for my cousin? Oh theres very little the matter with him. Another dose of the dispersant I have prescribed should put him right. With these words Doctor Wang stepped into his carriage. Jia Lian dispatched a servant to purchase the various drugs needed and went in to inform Xi-feng of Dai-yus diagnosis. They had not been talking long when Zhou Ruis wife arrived to consult Xi-feng about a few trivial details of domestic management. After listening for a while, Jia Lian rose to leave. Carry on, Mrs Zhou, I must be going. With Jia Lian out of the room, and all remaining household business soon disposed of, Zhou Ruis wife was able to come to the real purpose of her visit. Ive just come from Miss Lins, maam. I dont like the look of it at all! Theres not a spot of colour left in her cheeks, and to touch her shes nothing but skin and bones. I tried asking her what the matter was, but she wouldnt speak, just sat there crying. Before I left, Nightingale asked if you could advance them a couple of months allowance. She said that with Miss Lin so ill, and her so proud anyway about not being beholden to a soul for anything, shed made bold to ask about it herself. The medicine Miss Lin is taking goes on the general account of course, but she said they might be needing some extra money for incidental expenses. I said Id mention it to you, maam. Xi-feng lowered her head for a moment, then replied Oh very well, Ill sen4 her a few taels to be going on with.
Bao-yu looked and sure enough there were his half-brother and young nephew coming towards him with their contingent of pages, chatting away and giggling, though he could not catch what it was they were saying. When they saw him, they halted and stood with their arms respectfully at their sides. Why have you come back from school so soon? Bao-yu asked them. The Preceptor is busy today, replied Huan, and says we can all have the day off. Were to attend as usual tomorrow. Hearing this, Bao-yu turned about and, having reported the news to Grandmother Jia and his father, returned to Green Delights. Why are you back? asked Aroma. He told her what had happened, and after sitting with her for a minute or two made a move to go out again. Where are you off to in such a hurry? she asked. If youve been given the day off school, that doesnt mean you have to go charging about. You ought to make it a day of rest. Bao-yu stopped in his tracks and hung his head. I know youre right. But when will I next have a chance to get out and have some fun? Be a sport... He said this in such an appealing tone of voice that Aroma relented. All right, she said with a smile. Meanwhile lunch had been brought in, and he had to stay and eat it. He bolted it down, rinsed his mouth and was off. Fast as a puff of smoke he sped to the Naiads House. He found Nightingale in the courtyard hanging handkerchiefs out to dry. Has Miss Lin had her lunch yet? he asked. She had half a bowl of congee earlier on, replied Nightingale, but wasnt feeling very hungry. Shes sleeping at the moment. Youd better go somewhere else just now, Master Bao, and come back a bit later. He left reluctantly, not knowing quite where to go. Suddenly it occurred to him that he had not seen Xi-chun for several days, and he began strolling in the direction of Smartweed Loggia. When he reached the courtyard and stood by one of the windows, it all seemed very quiet and deserted. She too, he concluded, was having her nap and not to be disturbed. He was about to leave when he heard a faint sound coming from inside, too faint to identify. He stood still and listened again, in the hope of hearing it more clearly. There it was! A distinct little tap! He was still trying to think what it could be, when a voice said Why have you made that move, and not countered there? It was a game of Go! But Bao-yu did not have time to recognize the voice of the speaker. He heard Xi-chun reply Why should I bother? If you take me there, I shall simply counter here, and if you take me again I shall take you again. I shall still be one move ahead, and in the end I shall be able to connect. And what if I take you here? Aiyo! exclaimed Xi-chun. You had an inside counterattack up your sleeve. Im defenceless. That other girls voice was so familiar! But he still couldnt quite place it. It wasnt one of his cousins, he was sure of that. And yet Xi-chun was unlikely to be entertaining an outsider. Lifting the door-curtain very gently aside, he peeped in. The Go-partner was none other than the nun from Green Bower Hermitage, the Dweller Beyond The Threshold, Adamantina. He dared not intrude any further. The girls were totally absorbed in their game, and had neither of them noticed that they were being spied upon. Bao-yu continued to stand there and watch. Adamantina leant low over the board and said to Xi-chun Do you want to lose that whole corner? Of course not! Its perfectly safe. All those pieces of yours are "dead"., arent they? Are you sure? Go ahead and try. All right. Theres my move. Now lets see what you can do. A smile crossed Adamantinas face. She placed her next piece to link up with one she already had on the edge of the board, and then pounced on one of Xi-chuns pieces and annihilated her entire corner. She laughed Thats called "Pulling Your Boots Off Upside Down"! Before Xi-chun had time to reply, their unobserved observer, unable to contain himself any longer, burst out laughing. The two girls were startled out of their wits. What do you mean by sneaking in here without saying a word? exclaimed Xi-chun. What an ill-mannered way to behave, honestly!
Very well, let him do it then, said Grandmother Jia. Fetch him a brush and. paper somebody. 504 No padding, now! Jia Zheng told Bao-yu. No crystal, ice, jade, silver, light, bright, white - anything of that sort. I want something original that will give me some idea of what you have been doing with your mind during this past year or two. Bao-yu found these injunctions by no means uncongenial, and having succeeded, in quite a short time, in thinking of a quatrain, he wrote it out and handed it to his father. Jia Zheng said nothing, but was observed to nod after he had finished reading it which Grandmother Jia interpreted to mean that he could not have found the poem too bad. Well? she asked him. Jia Zheng wanted to make her happy. Not at all bad, he said. Its a pity he wont study, but his verses are really quite elegant. Well, thats all right then, said Grandmother Jia. You ought to encourage the boy, so that next time he tries even harder. You are quite right, said Jia Zheng. He turned to one of the old women in attendance. Tell my boys to get out two of the fans I brought back with me from the South, will you, and give them to Bao-yu for me. Bao-yu came forward and kotowed. After he had gone back to his seat, the game continued. This time the branch stopped in Jia Shes hand. He drank his wine and then told the following story. This one is about a dutiful son whose mother was ill. He tried everywhere to get a doctor for her, but couldnt find one, so in the end he was reduced to calling in an old woman who practised acupuncture. Now this old dame knew nothing of physiology, nevertheless she assured the son that it was inflammation of the heart that his mother was suffering from and that she could cure it instantly with her needle. The son became very alarmed. If metal in any form comes into contact with the heart, he said, it means death. Surely youre not going to put a needle in her heart? No, no, I shant put it in the heart, said the old woman. I mean to put it in here, over the ribs. 505 But thats too far from the heart, said the son. Surely if you put it in there, it wont do any good? Oh yes it will, said the old woman. A mothers heart always inclines towards one side. The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly, Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dames acupuncture myself. Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued. This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan. Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly peculiar. When Bao-yus poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his fathers presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal themselves in his choice of words. It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers, said Jia Zheng. Whether in your ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound classical models. The Two Incomparables we should call you, not because you are incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are incomparably hard to knock any sense into though whereas Bao-yu seems to think that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang. 506 This not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny provoked general laughter. Let me see that poem, said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost immediately began praising it.
Very well. Now all I am going to think about is getting better. And when I am better, I am going to turn myself into a Mr Yes-yes. No matter what frightful things the others get up to, I shall just say Yes, yes when I hear about them. Yes, yes, I shall say, and not give them a single other thought! If only you would be like that, said Patience smiling, what a blessing it would be for us all! At that moment Jia Lian came in, sighing and striking his hands together with vexation. More trouble I When I borrowed that stuff from Faithful the other day to pawn, how could Mother have got to hear about it? She had me over there just now and asked me to borrow two hundred taels for her. She said she wanted it for the Mid-Autumn festival. I said I didnt know who I could borrow two hundred taels from at the moment. If you cant borrow the money, you can easily find something to raise it on, she said. Dont always make excuses. Dont know who to borrow it from, indeed! You could spirit all those things out of Lady Jias room when you chose to, yet now you make difficulties about raising a paltry two hundred taels for me! Youre lucky I havent told anyone what youve been up to. Im certain Mother isnt really short of money. This is sheer, gratuitous trouble-making on her part. There were no outsiders here on that occasion, said Xi-feng. I wonder how the news could have leaked out. Patience, who had been listening to their conversation, tried hard to remember who had been present. After some moments it came back to her. I know. There was no one else here that day while you were talking to Faithful, but in the evening, when she sent the stuff round, that mother of Simples who works for Her Old Ladyship called in with some laundry and afterwards sat quite a long while talking in the kitchen. If she saw that great trunk there, it would have been only natural to ask what was inside it, and the maids might well have told her, without realizing that they were not supposed to. I wouldnt be at all surprised if thats how it got about. She called some of the junior maids in to question them. 457 Which of you told Simples mother the other day what was in that trunk? The maids knelt down in terror and swore by the most sacred oaths that they had said nothing. Were always most careful not to say too much to anyone. When people ask us anything, we always say that we dont know. Wed certainly never have told her about that! Xi-feng considered the probabilities. Somehow I dont think they would have told her. At all events, there is no point in harrving them about it now. We shall just have to put that question behind us. The important thing now is to make sure that Mother gets what she wants. Id rather we went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble. She turned to Patience. Take some of my gold things again and get us another two hundred taels. -As soon as she has the money ready, you can take it to Mother immediately, and that should be the end of the matter, she told Jia Lian. Might as well raise four hundred taels while you are about it, said Jia Lian. We could do with another two hundred ourselves. I dont see that at all, said Xi-feng. We dont really need two hundred taels ourselves. And in any case, if we raise so much now, where is the money corning from later for getting the things out of pawn? Patience fetched the now familiar gold necklaces and told Brighties wife to take them to the pawnshop. Soon afterwards Brighties wife was back again with the cash and Jia Lian went in person to hand it over to his mother. While Jia Lian was taking the money to Lady Xing, Xi-feng and Patience continued to ask themselves who could have leaked the information about the surreptitious removal of Grandmother Jias valuables. Its too bad! said Xi-feng. Poor Faithful will be in trouble over this, and all because of us. While they were still wondering who it could have been, Lady Wang was announced. This was a surprise, for Xi-feng could think of no reason why she should be visiting them. She and Patience hurried out to greet her. Lady Wang had only one maid, a trusted junior, in attend- 458 ance. There was an angry expression on her face and she walked swiftly through the house into the inner room and sat down grimly on the kang, all without uttering a word.
The sight of the hibiscus by the lake reminded him of what the little maid had told him about her. As he stood gazing sorrowfully at the bushes, an idea suddenly came to him. Since I wasnt able to see her in her coffin, why dont I pay my last respects to her here, in the presence of her flowers? 575 -5947 He was on the point of kneeling down in front of them when another thought occurred to him. Thats all very well, but I cant do it just anyhow. In order to show proper respect I must first make sure that I am dressed correctly. And I must prepare a little ceremony and make her some sort of offering. This led to further cogitation. It says somewhere in the classics, Where there is faith enough and goodwill, duckweed boiled in puddle-water is an offering acceptable to the gods and a dish fit to be set before princes. Proper respect evidently has nothing to do with the value of the offering. And I could always write something to read out before I made it. He began to plan what he would write. An elegy it would be called. It would be a bit like one of those long Chu poems - Li sao or The Summons of the Soul- but with elements of other things as well. And of course a lot of it would be original. He sat down and began writing it as soon as he got back to his apartment. As it was to please himself, he could be as wild and extravagant as he liked and compose as quickly as his imagination would let him. Soon the draft was finished, and he took a piece of white material of the kind they call mermaid silk, which he knew Skybright had been fond of, and after first writing the title on it in large characters -1174 THE SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS AN ELEGY AND INVOCATION he copied out the text in a neat kai-shu hand and carried it with him into the Garden. The little maid who had told him about Skybrights transformation had to follow him with some things for the offering on a tray a cup of tea, some autumn flowers in a vase of water, and some charcoal in a little burner for starting a fire with. When his solemn bowings and kneelings were over, he hung the silk up on the branches of a hibiscus and began tearfully to read out the words -768 The year being one in the era of Immutable Peace, the month that in which the Sweet odours of hibiscus and cassia compete, the day, a heavy and doleful day, I, most wretched and disconsolate JADE of the House of Green Delights, -107 576 having with due reverence prepared and got together buds of flowers, silk of mermaids, water of the Drenched Blossoms stream and Fung Loo tea all things of little value in themselves, yet sufficient to attest the devotion of a true believer do here offer them up in sacrifice to her that has now, m the Palace of the White God become SPIRIT OF THE HIBISCUS, having power and dominion over the flowers of autumn. It is now Sixteen years since the BLEST SPIRIT descended into the world of men. As to her native place and the lineage in which she was born, they were long since forgotten but for five years and eight months of that time she was, in my rising up and lying down, in my washings and combings, in my rest and play, my constant dose companion and helpmate. It is to be recorded of her that in estimation she was more precious than gold or jade, in nature more pure than ice or snow, in wit more brilliant than the sun or stars, in complexion more beautiful than the moon or than flowers. Who of the maidens did not admire her accomplishments? Who among the matrons did not marvel at her sagacity? But if baleful scritch-owls that hate the heights can cause the kingly eagle to be taken in a net, and rank and stinking weeds, envious of anothers fragrance, can cause the sweet herb of grace to be uprooted, it is not to be thought that a shrinking flower could withstand the whirlwinds blast, or a tender willow-tree be proof against the buffetings of the tempest. When the envenomed tongue of slander was wagged against her, she pined inwardly with a wasting sickness the red of her cherry lips faded and only sad and plaintive sounds issued out of them the bloom of her apricot cheeks withered and none but lean and haggard looks were to be seen upon them. Slanders and slights crept from behind every curtain thorns and thistles choked up the doors and windows of her chamber. Yet truly she had done no infamous thing.
After ordering all the 467 side gates to be closed, she set about searching immediately, beginning with the room just inside the Garden gate which was used by the women of the night watch as a rendez-vous. Nothing of interest was discovered there except for a few candle-ends and a little leftover lamp-oil which someone had evidently put by to take home. However, Wang Shan-baos wife solemnly pronounced them to be stolen property no one was to touch these things, she said, until Lady Wang had been informed and the appropriate steps had been taken. They proceeded to Green Delights, barring the courtyard gates after them as soon as they were inside. Bao-yu was still worrying about Skybright when this party of women came bursting into his courtyard and, without a word of explanation, walked straight into the part of the house occupied by the maids. On going out to investigate he ran into Xi-feng and asked her what was happening. Xi-feng went indoors tosit down with him and accepted a cup of tea. Something important is missing that no one will own up to having taken, she said. Its thought that one of the maids in the Garden might have stolen it, so they are searching everyone in order to clear the innocent ones of suspicion. While Xi-feng was explaining this to Bao-yu, Wang Shan-baos wife was proceeding with her search. Whose are these trunks? she asked, and demanded that the owners should come forward and open them. Aroma had suspected that some sort of trouble lay ahead when she saw the state that Skybright was in when she returned from her interview. The raid confirmed her premonition. Resignedly she set the other maids an example by opening her own trunks and boxes first. Nothing of interest was found in them. The searchers passed on. Each girl stood by her own things and opened them up as the searchers came to them. Finally only Skybrights trunk remained. Which girls is this? said Wang Shan-baos wife. Why doesnt she come forward and open it? Aroma was on the point of opening it herself when Skybright, who, to judge from the state her hair was in, had only just got out of bed, came rushing into the room, flung the lid open with a bang, picked the trunk up by its bottom, and 468 emptied its contents on the floor. Wang Shan-baos wife blushed scarlet with embarrassment. Theres no cause to be angry with me, miss, she said. Im not carrying this search out to please myself, Im here on Her Ladyships orders. If you dont want your things to be searched, you have only to say so and I shall tell Her Ladyship. Theres no need to carry on like this about it. At this Skybrights wrath blazed up in fury. She pointed at the old womans face. You say you are here on Her Ladyships orders. Well Im here on Her Old Ladyships orders. Anyway, I thought I knew all the women who worked at Her Ladyships place and Im sure I never saw a self-important, meddlesome old busybody like you there before! Xi-feng, who had now rejoined them, was secretly delighted to see Wang Shan-baos wife getting the rough side of Skybrights tongue, but because the woman was her mother-in-laws favourite, she had to pretend that she was shocked, and shouted at Skybright to be silent. Wang Shan-baos wife looked angry and flustered and seemed on the point of retorting but Xi-feng restrained her. All right, Mrs Wang, that will do. You dont have to put yourself on the same level by arguing with the girl. You get on with your searching. Weve got all the other places to go to yet, and if we delay too long, word will get round that we are coming and they will be prepared for us. If that happens and you dont succeed in finding anything, I shant consider myself responsible. Though inwardly fuming, Wang Shan-baos wife was obliged to contain herself and spent the next minute or two rummaging tight-lipped among Skybrights possessions. Having found nothing of importance, she then asked Xi-feng if they might go elsewhere. Now have you looked really thoroughly? said Xi-feng. Youre going to look pretty silly if you have to report back to Lady Wang tomorrow that you couldnt find anything. Weve been through everything, said one of the women. Theres nothing here that there shouldnt be. We did 469 find one or two boys things, but they were the sort of things a quite small boy would use. Probably they belonged to Bao-yu when he was little. Anyway, theyre of no consequence.
She found Bao-yu already lying down, but engaged in bantering conversation with Skybright and a couple of other maids who were sitting on the edge of his bed. Whats the matter? they asked when they saw who their visitor was. What brings you out at this hour? Ive come to warn you, said Magpie, addressing herself in an urgent whisper to Bao-yu. I heard my mistress just now jabbering to Sir Zheng about something, and though I couldnt make out what they were talking about, I heard him say Bao-yu a couple of times. I thought Id better put you on your guard in case he asks to see you tomorrow about anything. 436 She turned and hurried out again as soon as she had finished speaking. Aroma told someone to run after her and ask her to stay for a cup of tea, but she was afraid of being shut inside the Garden when they closed the gate, and insisted on going back immediately. Bao-yu knew that in Aunt Zhaos twisted imagination he was regarded as an enemy, and though he did not know what she had said, the mere fact that she had been talking about him was enough to make him feel uncomfortable all over, much as Monkey did when he heard Tripitaka reciting the spell for tightening the iron band round his head. After giving the matter some thought, he concluded that the only practical way in which he could prepare himself for the morrow would be by revising his texts. Should his father take it into his head to test him, he reasoned, then if only he could be word-perfect in his texts, it would not be so difficult to bluff his way through whatever else he might ask him. Having made the decision, he hurriedly threw a gown over his shoulders and prepared to begin some revision, bitterly regretting that Jia Zhengs silence on the subject of lessons since his last return from duty had lulled him into a false sense of security. I ought to have had more sense, he told himself. One really ought to do a little bit every day, to keep in practice. He began to reckon up how much he could still recite from memory. He found that there was little more than The Great Learning, The Doctrine of the Mean and the two halves of the Analects that he could be absolutely sure of. The first half of Mencius he knew reasonably well, but certainly not well enough to be able to carry on from any sentence given him at random. The second half was virtually terra incognita. Of the Five Classics he was fairly familiar with the Poetry Classic because he was frequently having to read bits of it in connection with his own versifying. Though far from word-perfect, he probably knew it well enough to scrape through a test. He could not remember any of the other classics at all but fortunately his father had so far never asked him to study them, so probably it would not matter. When it came to Old Style Prose, the case was rather different. Over the past few years he had read extracts from the Zuo, Gong-yang and Gu-liang 437 commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals and various Han and Tang pieces, but he had only dipped into them as the fancy took him he had not done any serious work on them. There was certainly no question of his being able to remember them. There was even less likelihood of his being able to pass muster on the Examination Essay. He had always detested this style of writing in any case. The Sage himself didnt write that way, he argued, so how could one hope to expound the inner meaning of his teachings through such a medium? It was no more than a device used by vulgar fortune-seekers for starting themselves off on the golden road to success. Before he left, Jia Zheng had selected a hundred of these essays for him to read but Bao-yu had only glanced at them occasionally, reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there as some particularly felicitous expression or the extravagance, humour or melancholy of the writer happened to catch his attention. He had never settled down to the serious analytical examination of even a single essay. He began to revise but the trouble was that whatever he revised now, he was sure to be asked about something else next day, and the whole night would not be long enough to revise everything. It soon became apparent that all he was succeeding in doing was getting himself into an even worse state of nerves than he had been in to begin with and, while studying to no purpose himself, preventing a whole roomful of girls from sleeping as well. Aroma and the other senior maids could at least occupy themselves by trimming his lamp, pouring him cups of tea and so forth but the younger ones could neither go to bed nor find any employment to keep themselves awake, and sat about the place, drooping and nodding in various attitudes of fatigue.
exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Its really not that important. I take your word for it. At this moment Bao Er came into the room and kotowed to Cousin Zhen. This Bao Er, it may be remembered, was the servant who had in the past been useful to both Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. On this occasion he had come over for the day to assist Cousin Zhen. I beg to be released, sir, he said, and put back on external duties. What is the meaning of this? asked Cousin Zhen, addressing Bao Er and Zhou Rui simultaneously. Whats the point of my being here if no one listens to my opinion? replied Bao Er. Who asked for your opinion? said Cousin Zhen brusquely. Im tired of spying for other people! muttered Bao Er to himself. Sir, put in Zhou Rui promptly, I have been in charge of farm rents and income here for years, and on average I should say around four hundred thousand taels worth passes through my hands each year, and I have never had a word of complaint from the Master or their Ladyships or the young mistresses about anything, let alone such a small matter as this. According to him, we are supposed to have made off with the familys entire property and estates! It looks as if Bao Er has started some sort of quarrel, thought Cousin Zhen to himself. Better get rid of him. Out of my sight! he barked. Then turning from Bao Er to Zhou Rui That is all. Carry on with your work. The two servants left. Not long afterwards Cousin Zhen was resting in the study when he heard the most terrific din break out in the direction of the main gate. He sent a servant to inquire, who came back to report that a fight had started between Bao Er and an adopted son of Zhou Ruis. Who is this adopted son? asked Cousin Zhen. He San is his name, sir, replied the servant. A worthless fellow who spends most of his time drinking and causing trouble. He sometimes comes round here and hangs about in the porters lodge. Apparently he got involved in the argument between Bao Er and Zhou Rui. This is the limit! exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Have Bao Er and this He San character bound immediately! What about Zhou Rui? He disappeared when the fighting started, sir. Find him at once! This is preposterous! Yes, sir! In the midst of this commotion, Jia Lian returned and Cousin Zhen told him what had happened in his absence. What next! cried Lian. He sent an extra servant to help apprehend Zhou Rui, who soon realized that escape was impossible, gave himself up and was led before the masters. Tie him up as well! ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself principally to Zhou Rui Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start fighting all over again? And as if that wasnt bad enough, you have to drag in this brat of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you disappear and leave them to it! He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks. Its no good punishing only him, said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia Lian sat down to discuss family business. In the servants quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhens part to cover up for incompetence others said he was just inept at handling people while others saw it as yet another instance of his unpleasant character. Wasnt it he who recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? Whats probably happened is that Bao Ers wife wont oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so now hes taken it out on the husband... There were many differing interpretations. Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zhengs promotion at the Ministry of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out, but went around promising work to contractors and negotiating percentages for himself, and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to the apartment of his erstwhile patroness. Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in a temper and beating the servants, was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story from him.
Aunt Zhao was reduced to silence. It was left to Li Wan and Tan-chun to give the true story, which brought tears to Lady Wangs eyes. In her agitation she was for telling Grandmother Jia and going over to Lady Xings apartment to question the members of her household who had been to Green Delights earlier in the day. The news had meanwhile reached Xi-feng on her sickbed. When she heard that Lady Wang had arrived at Green Delights she felt obliged to put in an appearance and, leaning on Felicitys arm, made her way towards the Garden. She arrived just as Lady Wang was about to leave. Good evening, Aunt. Xi-fengs voice trembled slightly as she spoke. Bao-yu and the others came up to greet her. So youve heard the news too! said Lady Wang to Xifeng. Most extraordinary! It vanished just like that, and cant be found anywhere. Think for a moment of all the maids, including all of Lady Jias and even your own Patience, which would you say showed thieving tendencies, or had a malicious disposition? I intend to tell Lady J ia, and to order a thorough search. Until we find it, Baoyus life hangs in the balance! Ours is such a large household, said Xi-feng, and, as the saying goes, you can know a mans face, but never his heart. With all the commotion of a search, everyone is bound to hear, and the thief will be so scared of the consequences that rather than be caught, he could well panic and destroy the evidence - the jade itself - and then where would we be? No, my advice, for what it is worth, is that we should let it be known that Bao-yu threw it away in disgust and that it really doesnt matter. Everyone must be very discreet so as to keep Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng from knowing. Meanwhile we can search everywhere in secret, and if were clever we should end up with both the jade and the thief. Does that make sense to you, Aunt? After a long pause Lady Wang replied Its all very well, but will we ever succeed in keeping this from Sir Zheng? She called Jia Huan to her. It was very silly of you to go shouting your head off about Bao-yus jade, just because they asked you about it. If the thief has heard and destroys the jade, you will pay for it with your life! I promise never to mention it again! wailed Jia Huan in terror. This time Aunt Zhao held her tongue. There must be some places left where you havent looked, Lady Wang continued, addressing the assembled maids. It must be somewhere here. Its hardly going to fly away, is it? But when you look, be as quiet as possible. Aroma, I give you three days to find it. If we still havent found it by then, we shant be able to keep it from Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng any longer. And everyone knows what that will mean! Bidding Xi-feng accompany her, Lady Wang set off for Lady Xings apartment, for further consultations on how to apprehend the thief. Li Wan and the others continued to debate what to do. They sent for the various domestics in charge of the Garden and gave orders for the gates to be securely locked. Steward Lins wife was also summoned and given confidential instructions. Tell the servants on both gates that absolutely no one is to be allowed out of the Garden for the next three days. We can allow freedom of movement within the Garden, but no one must leave. Say that something has been lost and that no one can go out until its found. Yes, Mrs Zhu, said Lins wife. Excuse me, maam, she went on, but we lost something at home the other day - nothing of any value of course, but my husband was determined to find it, and he went and consulted one of those word-diviners that set themselves up at street corners. Iron Mouth Liu I think this ones name was. His reading was very clear. My husband followed his instructions, and found the missing item straight away. When Aroma heard this she begged her to help them. Oh, Mrs Lin! Please go and ask your husband to consult this man for us! Indeed I will. Straight away. Lins wife bustled off. Xing Xiu-yan now had a suggestion to make. If you ask me, those word-diviners and fortune-tellers you find on street corners are all charlatans. But when I knew Adamantina, in the South, before she came to live here, I heard of her gift for the planchette. Why dont we ask her to hold a sance for us?
In that same instant she thought to herself Grannies the only one that can save me now! and fell at the old ladys feet, hugging her by the knees. Save me Grannie, please! Id rather die than go away with them! That stepmothers not my real mother anyway. I just want to stay here with you! Grandmother Jias face only registered a cold smile. This has nothing to do with me. But whats to become of me, Grannie? she sobbed. Being a mans second wife has its advantages, Grandmother Jia replied. Think of the double dowry youll have. If I stay, I w 6 nt cause you any extra expense, I promise I wont. Oh please save me! Its no use, said Grandmother Jia. All girls marry and leave home. Youre a child and dont understand these things. You cant live here for ever, you know. Ill do anything to stay - Ill work for my keep, be a slave, anything! Only please dont let them take me away! This time Grandmother Jia made no reply. Dai-yu hugged her again and sobbed Oh Grannie! Youve always been so good to me, fussed over me so - how can you treat me like this in my hour of need? Dont you care about me any more? I may not be one of your real grandchildren, a true Jia like the others, but my mother was your own daughter, your own flesh and blood! For her sake have pity on me! Dont let me be taken away! With these last words she flung herself frantically upon Lady Jia, burying her head in her lap and sobbing violently. Faithful, the old lady commanded, take Miss Dai-yu to her room to rest. She is wearing me out. There was no mistaking the finality in Grandmother Jias voice. To Dai-yu, suicide now seemed the only course. She rose, and as she walked from the room her heart yearned for a mother of her own to turn to. All the affection shown her by grandmother, aunts and cousins alike, had now been exposed for what it was and had been all along - a sham. Suddenly she thought Why havent I seen Bao-yu today? He might still know of a way out. And as the thought entered her mind, she looked up and sure enough, there, standing right in front of her, all laughter and smiles, was Bao-yu himself. My warmest congratulations, coz! This was too much for Dai-yu. Her last vestige of maidenly reserve vanished. She clutched hold of him and cried out Now I know how heartless and cruel you really are, Bao-yu! No, you are wrong, he replied. But if you have a husband to go to, then we must go our separate ways. Dai-yu listened in despair as this, her very last hope, was taken from her. Clinging to him helplessly, she gave a feverish cry Oh Bao! Ive no separate way to go! How could you say such a thing! If you dont want to go, then stay here, he replied calmly. You were originally engaged to me. Thats why you came to live here. Has it never occurred to you how specially Ive always treated you? Havent you noticed? Suddenly it all seemed clear. She really was engaged to Bao-yu after all. Of course she was! In an instant her despair changed to joy. My mind is made up once and for ever! But you must give me the word. Am I to go? Or am I to stay? Ive told you, stay here with me. If you still dont trust me, look at my heart. With these words he took out a small knife and brought it down across his chest. Blood came spurting out. Terrified out of her wits, Dai-yu tried to staunch the flow with her hand, crying out How could you? You should have killed me first! Dont worry, said Bao-yu. Im going to show you my heart. He fumbled about inside the gaping flesh, while Dai-yu, shaking convulsively, afraid someone might burst in on them at any moment, pressed him to her tightly and wept bitterly. Oh no! said Bao-yu. Its not there any more! My time has come! His eyes flickered and he fell with a dull thud to the floor. Dai-yu let out a piercing scream. She heard Nightingale calling her Miss Lin! Miss Lin! Youre having a nightmare! Wake up! Come along now, you must get undressed and go to sleep properly. Dai-yu turned over in her bed. So it had all been a nightmare.
Thats all I said. What was there in that to hurt sister Pearl? Can you see, Miss Lin? She came across and hit me straight in the face and said I was talking rubbish and disobeying orders, and would be dismissed from service! How was I to know their Ladyships didnt want us to mention it? Nobody told me, and she just hit me! She started sobbing again. Dai-yus heart felt as though oil, soy-sauce, sugar and vinegar had all been poured into it at once. She could not tell which flavour predominated, the sweet, the sour, the bitter or the salty. After a few moments silence, she said in a trembling voice Dont talk such rubbish. Any more of that, and youll be beaten again. Off you go! She herself turned back in the direction of the Naiads House. Her body felt as though it weighed a hundred tons, her feet were as wobbly as if she were walking on cotton-floss. She could only manage one step at a time. After an age, she still had not reached the bank by Drenched Blossoms Bridge. She was going so slowly, with her feet about to collapse beneath her, and in her giddiness and confusion had wandered off course and increased the distance by about a hundred yards. She reached Drenched Blossoms Bridge only to start drifting back again along the bank in the direction she ha4 just come from, quite unaware of what she was doing. Nightingale had by now returned with the handkerchief, but could not find Dai-yu anywhere. She finally saw her, pale as snow, tottering along, her eyes staring straight in front of her, meandering in circles. Nightingale also caught sight of a maid disappearing in the distance beyond Dai-yu, but could not make out who it was. She was most bewildered, and quickened her step. Why are you turning back again, Miss? she asked softly. Where are you heading for? Dai-yu only heard the blurred outline of this question. She replied I want to ask Bao-yu something. Nightingale could not fathom what was going on, and could only try to guide her on her way to Grandmother Jias apartment. When they came to the entrance, Dai-yu seemed to feel clearer in mind. She turned, saw Nightingale supporting her, stopped for a moment, and asked What are you doing here? I went to fetch your handkerchief, replied Nightingale, smiling anxiously. I saw you over by the bridge and hurried across. I asked you where you were going, but you took no notice. Oh! said Dai-yu with a smile. I thought you had come to see Bao-yu. What else did we come here for? Nightingale could see that her mind was utterly confused. She guessed that it was something that the maid had said in the garden, and only nodded with a faint smile in reply to Dai-yus question. But to herself she was trying to imagine what sort of an encounter this was going to be, between the young master who had already lost his wits, and her young mistress who was now herself a little touched. Despite her apprehensions, she dared not prevent the meeting, and helped Dai-yu into the room. The funny thing was that Dai-yu now seemed to have recovered her strength. She did not wait for Nightingale but raised the portiere herself, and walked into the room. It was very quiet inside. Grandmother Jia had retired for her afternoon nap. Some of the maids had sneaked off to play, some were having forty winks themselves and others had gone to wait on Grandmother Jia in her bedroom. It was Aroma who came out to see who was there, when she heard the swish of the portiere. Seeing that it was Dai-yu, she greeted her politely Please come in and sit down, Miss. Is Master Bao at home? asked Dai-yu with a smile. Aroma did not know that anything was amiss, and was about to answer, when she saw Nightingale make an urgent movement with her lip from behind Dai-yus back, pointing to her mistress and making a warning gesture with her hand. Aroma had no idea what she meant and dared not ask. Undeterred, Dai-yu walked on into Baoyus room. He was sitting up in bed, and when she came in made no move to get up or welcome her, but remained where he was, staring at her and giving a series of silly laughs. Dai-yu sat down uninvited, and she too began to smile and stare back at Bao-yu. There were no greetings exchanged, no courtesies, in fact no words of any kind.
Sacrifice him if you think it will do you any good! Kill him! Hack him to pieces! Do what you like with him! She propelled Jia Huan into the room, crying Thief! Hurry up and confess your crime! This brought loud and angry protestations from Huan. Li Wan was just bracing herself to intervene and make the peace when a maid came rushing in and announced Her Ladyship is here! Aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was now inevitable. Bao-yu and the girls went out at once to receive Lady Wang. Aunt Zhaos wrath subsided for a moment and she followed them out. From the startled look on their faces Lady Wang could see that what she had heard must be true. Is it really lost? she cried. No one dared reply. Lady Wang walked in, sat down and called Aroma forward. Aroma fell trembling to her knees. In a choked voice she murmured Yes. Well, get up! said Lady Wang. We must have a thorough search made. Come on, this helpless attitude will never do. Aroma was sobbing and could not say a word. Bao-yu finally spoke up, fearful that she might blurt out the truth. Mother, this has nothing to do with Aroma. I lost it the other day on my way back from seeing the plays at the Earl of Lin-an 5. Then why didnt you look for it at the time? I didnt want anyone to know. I just told Tealeaf to look for it everywhere along the street. Nonsense! You know perfectly well that Aroma or one of your other maids would have noticed. Thats their job. They are always with you when you change. Whenever you come in from a party or any kind of excursion, if one of your handkerchiefs is missing, or a little purse, theyre bound to ask you where its gone do you really think that they would allow something as irreplaceable as your jade to disappear, and not say a word? Bao-yu was stumped for an answer. Aunt Zhao, who was gloating over his discomfiture, hastened to put in If youre so sure you lost it outside, why try to pin the blame on Huan? Thats enough from you! said Lady Wang sharply. You keep out of this! Aunt Zhao was reduced to silence. It was left to Li Wan and Tan-chun to give the true story, which brought tears to Lady Wangs eyes. In her agitation she was for telling Grandmother Jia and going over to Lady Xings apartment to question the members of her household who had been to Green Delights earlier in the day. The news had meanwhile reached Xi-feng on her sickbed. When she heard that Lady Wang had arrived at Green Delights she felt obliged to put in an appearance and, leaning on Felicitys arm, made her way towards the Garden. She arrived just as Lady Wang was about to leave. Good evening, Aunt. Xi-fengs voice trembled slightly as she spoke. Bao-yu and the others came up to greet her. So youve heard the news too! said Lady Wang to Xifeng. Most extraordinary! It vanished just like that, and cant be found anywhere. Think for a moment of all the maids, including all of Lady Jias and even your own Patience, which would you say showed thieving tendencies, or had a malicious disposition? I intend to tell Lady J ia, and to order a thorough search. Until we find it, Baoyus life hangs in the balance! Ours is such a large household, said Xi-feng, and, as the saying goes, you can know a mans face, but never his heart. With all the commotion of a search, everyone is bound to hear, and the thief will be so scared of the consequences that rather than be caught, he could well panic and destroy the evidence - the jade itself - and then where would we be? No, my advice, for what it is worth, is that we should let it be known that Bao-yu threw it away in disgust and that it really doesnt matter. Everyone must be very discreet so as to keep Her Old Ladyship and Sir Zheng from knowing. Meanwhile we can search everywhere in secret, and if were clever we should end up with both the jade and the thief. Does that make sense to you, Aunt? After a long pause Lady Wang replied Its all very well, but will we ever succeed in keeping this from Sir Zheng? She called Jia Huan to her. It was very silly of you to go shouting your head off about Bao-yus jade, just because they asked you about it. If the thief has heard and destroys the jade, you will pay for it with your life!
person they were dealing with, they stood to attention and let her pass. Aunt Xue went on through the reception hall and could already hear the sound of heavy wailing coming from her daughter-in-laws apartment. She quickened her step. Bao-chai came out to meet her, her face wet with tears. Have you heard, Mama? Please dont panic! We must try to do something! They went inside together. Aunt Xue had already been told the main facts by one of the servants on her way in, and was still sobbing and trembling from the shock. But who? Who was it? she asked agitatedly. Madam, said one of the servants, details like that are not going to make much difference at present. The law says "a life for a life". So we must think what to do. Think! cried Aunt Xue hysterically. Whats the earthly good of thinking at a time like this? The best thing as we see it, continued the servant, is this. First, send young Master Ke with some money tonight to visit Mr Pan in prison. Then, first thing tomorrow, Master Ke must get himself a good scrivener, someone well-versed in legal terminology. He must offer him a good fee to make sure this death-sentence is quashed.. Then, when thats been done, we must ask one of the Jia gentlemen here to pull a few strings. But first of all, we must tip the yamen runners outside a few taels. Then we can get on with the rest of the plan. Aunt Xue was not convinced. Just find the mans family, she said. Give them whatever they want for funeral expenses and compensation. If they dont press the charge, surely hell be let off lightly? Bao-chais voice could be heard through the door-curtain No, Mama, that will never do. The m6re money we hand out the more trouble well cause in the long run. We should do as the boy says. What have I left to live for? sobbed Aunt Xue. Let me go there and see him once! Then the two of us can die together! Bao-chai begged her to take heart, and at the same time called out for the boy to set off with Xue Ke at once. The maids helped Aunt Xue indoors again. Xue Ke came by on his way out. Send someone home with letter as soon as you have any news, Bao-chai instructed him. You must stay there. Were counting on you. Xue Ke promised to do his utmost and left. While Bao-chai applied herself once more to the task of soothing her agitated mother, Xia Jin-gui took the opportunity of launching an undisturbed attack on Caltrop So a murder was nothing to this family, was it? she screamed at her. You all came straight up to town afterwards as if nothing had happened, did you? Well it looks as if you spoke once too often, Miss Swanky Panky! Because this time its the real thing, and look at you! Wheres all your money and all your fine friends and posh relatives now? Youre all so scared you dont know if youre coming or going! And in a few days, when they put Pan away, then I suppose youll bugger off and leave me here to carry the can single-handed! She broke into one of her dramatic wails. Aunt Xue heard every word and was so furious that she fainted. Bao-chai was at her wits end. And in the midst of this pandemonium one of Lady Wangs senior maids arrived, to ask if there was any news. This presented Bao-chai with an additional problem. She was fully aware of her delicate position since the official betrothal visit a few days previously, and knew that strictly speaking she should shun all contact with her future bridegrooms family including the domestic staff. However, the fact that the betrothal was still not finally settled, and the nature of the present emergency, seemed to justify a temporary waiving of the rules. We dont know the full story yet, she said to the maid. All weve heard is that my brother has killed someone and that he has been arrested by the local magistrate. We dont know exactly what kind of homicide he has been found guilty of, but Master Ke has gone to find Out. We should have more definite news in a day or two and will let Her Ladyship know straight away. Please thank her for her kind inquiry and say that at a later stage well be sure to need all the support Sir She and Sir Zheng can give us. The maid returned with this message. The next two days were spent by Aunt Xue and Baochai waiting in unbearable suspense. At last on the third day a boy came back with a letter from Xue Ke, which he gave to a maid to hand to the ladies.
If, from your wealth of experience, you have thought of a way to help him, Mother, then how could I possibly raise any objection? We should do whatever you think is best. But has Mrs Xue been informed? My sister has already expressed her agreement, replied Lady Wang. We have only been biding our time because Pans court-case has still not been settled. Yes, that is certainly the first obstacle, commented Jia Zheng. How can a girl be given in marriage while her elder brother is in jail? And besides there is Her Graces death. Although that does not strictly entail any such prohibition, Bao-yu should at least abide by the set term of mourning for a deceased elder sister, which would mean a period 6f nine months during which marriage would be highly irregular. And then, my own date of departure has already been reported to the throne, and I cannot postpone it now. That only leaves us a few days. There is not enough time. Grandmother Jia pondered her sons words. What he says is true, she thought to herself. If we wait for all of these conditions to be fulfilled, his father will have left, and who knows to what state the boys health may deteriorate. And then it may be too late. We shall have to put aside the rules for once. There is no other way. Having reached this conclusion in her own mind, she spoke to Jia Zheng again. If you will agree to this for him, I shall take care of any problems that may arise. There is nothing that cannot be ironed out, of that I am confident. His mother and I shall go over and put the matter personally to Mrs Xue. As for Pan, I shall ask young Ke to go to him and explain that we are doing this to save Bao-yus life. When he knows the reason, I am sure he will agree. As for marrying during a period of mourning, strictly speaking one shouldnt, I know. And besides, it is not right for him to marry while lie is so ill. But its a question of turning his luck. Both families are willing, and as the children have the bond of gold and jade to justify their union, we can dispense with the usual reading of horoscopes. We just need to choose an auspicious day to exchange presents in proper style, and then set a date for the wedding itself, possible afterwards. No music during the wedding itself, but otherwise we can follow court practice twelve pairs of long-handled lanterns and an eight-man palanquin for the bride. We shall have the ceremony in our southern form, and keep our old customs of throwing dried fruit onto the bridal bed and so forth. That will be enough to make it quite a proper wedding. Bao-chai is a sensible girl. We need not worry on her account. And Aroma is a very reliable person. We can count on her to have a calming influence on Bao-yu. She gets on well with Bao-chai too. One other thing. Mrs Xue once told us that a monk said Bao-chai should only marry someone with a jade to match her golden locket. Perhaps when she comes to live as Bao-yus wife, her locket will draw the jade back. Once they are married, things will look up and the whole family will benefit. So, we must prepare a courtyard and decorate it nicely - I should like you to choose it. We shant be inviting any friends or relations to the wedding, and we can have the party later, when Bao-yu is better and the mourning period is over. This way, everything will be done in time, and you will be able to see the young people married and set off with an easy mind. Jia Zheng had grave doubts about the proposal. But as it was Grandmother Jias, he knew he could not go against it. He smiled dutifully, and hastened to reply You have thought it all out very well, Mother, and have taken everything into account. We must tell the servants not to go talking about this to everyone they meet. It would hardly redound to our credit if people knew. And personally I doubt if Mrs Xue will agree to the idea. But if she does, then I suppose we should do as you suggest. You need not worry about Mrs Xue, said the old lady. I can explain things to her. Off you go then. Jia Zheng took his leave. He felt extremely uneasy about the whole idea. Official business soon engulfed him, however - acceptance of his new papers of appointment.. recommendations of staff from friends and relatives, an endless round of social gatherings of one sort or another and he delegated all responsibility for the marriage plans to Grandmother J ia, who in turn left the arrangements to Lady Wang and Xi-feng.
And take your time. You and Her Old Ladyship have made an excellent decision, in choosing Miss Bao-chai as Bao-yus future bride ... began Aroma. But, I wonder, maam, if you have noticed which of the two young ladies Bao-yu is more closely attached to, Miss Chai, or Miss Lin? As they have lived together since they were children, replied Lady Wang, I suppose he would be a little closer to Miss Lin. More than a little! protested Aroma, and went on to give Lady Wang a detailed history of how things had always stood between Bao-yu and Dai-yu, and of the various incidents that had occurred between them. These are all things that you would have seen for yourself, maam, she added, with the exception of his outburst during the summer, which I have not mentioned to a soul until now. Lady Wang drew Aroma towards her. Yes, most of what you have told me I have been able to deduce for myself. What you have said simply bears out my own observations. But you must all have heard the Masters words. Tell me, how did Bao-yu react? As things are at present, maam, Bao-yu smiles if someone talks to him, but otherwise he just sleeps. He heard nothing. In that case, what are we to do? It is not my place to say, replied Aroma. Your Ladyship should inform Her Old Ladyship of what I have said, and think of a suitable way of solving the problem. Then you had better go, said Lady Wang, and leave it to me. Now would not be a good moment to bring it up there are too many people in the room. I shall wait for an opportunity to tell Her Old Ladyship, and we will discuss what to do. Lady Wang returned to Grandmother Jias apartment. The old lady was talking to Xi-feng, and when she saw Lady Wang come in, asked What did Aroma want? What was all that mysterious whispering about? Lady Wang answered her directly, and told the whole story of Bao-yus love for Dai-yu, as Aroma had told it her. When she had finished, Grandmother Jia was silent for a long while. Neither Lady Wang nor Xi-feng dared say a word. At last, Grandmother Jia sighed and said Everything else seemed somehow soluble. It does not matter so much about Dai-yu. But if Bao-yu really feels this way about her, it seems we have run into an insoluble problem. Xi-feng looked very thoughtful for a minute, then said Not insoluble. I think I can see a solution. But I am not sure if you would agree to it or not, Aunt. Whatever your idea is, said Lady Wang, speak up and let Mother know. Then we can all discuss it together. There is only one solution that I can think of, said Xifeng. It involves two things a white lie, and a piece of discreet substitution. Substitution? What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia. First of all, replied Xi-feng, whether Bao-yu knows anything yet or not, we let it be known that Sir Zheng proposes to betroth him to Miss Lin. We must watch for his reaction. If he is quite unaffected, then there is no need to bother with my plan. But if he does seem at all pleased at the news, it will make things rather more complicated. Supposing he is pleased? asked Lady Wang. What then? Xi-feng went over and whispered at some length in Lady Wangs ear. Lady Wang nodded, smiled and said Well, well... An ingenious idea, I must say! Come on, you two! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Let me in on the secret what are you whispering about? Xi-feng was afraid that Grandmother J ia might not grasp her idea at once, and might inadvertently give the game away. She leant across and whispered in the old ladys ear. Grandmother Jia did seem rather puzzled at first. Xi-feng smiled, and added a few more words of explanation. Grandmother Jia finally said with a smile Why not? But isnt it rather hard on Bao-chai? And what about Miss Lin? What if she gets to hear of it? We shall only tell Bao-yu replied Xi-feng. No one else will be allowed to mention it. That way no one need know. A maid came in and informed them that Mr Lian had returned. Lady Wang was worried that Grandmother Jia might inquire into the distressing news that had occasioned his journey, and cast a meaningful glance in Xifengs direction. Xi-feng went out to intercept him, and signalled to him with her lips to accompany her to Lady Wangs apartment and wait there.
The roots were of various sizes, but mostly about the thickness of a finger. Faithful weighed out two ounces and gave them to Lady Wang, who carried them back to her own apartment and there handed them over to Zhou Ruis wife, together with the packets of unidentified herbs, instructing her to get one of the pages to carry them to the doctor. While he was about it, she said, he could determine what the herbs were and write their names on the packets. When Zhou Ruis wife reappeared some time later, she was carrying not only the packets of herbs but also the ginseng. Hes written the names on the packets, she said. But this ginseng - he says its very high quality ginseng, but its too old. He says ginseng isnt like other medicines no matter how good it is, after a hundred years or so it turns into dust. This ginseng here hasnt turned into dust yet, but he says its already dried-up, like rotten wood. Its got no goodness in it. He told me to bring it back. He said tell Her Ladyship to try and get hold of some a bit fresher than this. It doesnt matter about the roots being a bit on the thin side as long as its fresh. 529 Lady Wang bowed her head and thought for some moments in silence. I suppose theres nothing else for it. We shall just have to buy two ounces. - Take this stuff away I she said, feeling no inclination to examine the packets. One of the maids removed them while she continued with her instructions to Zhou Ruis wife. Tell our buyer to pick out ginseng of the very best quality. He is to get it as cheaply as he can, of course, but it must be high quality ginseng. Oh, and if Lady Jia should ask any of you about this, tell her that we used the ginseng she gave us. Dont go prattling to her about what the doctor said. Zhou Ruis wife was about to go off on her errand when Bao-chai, who happened to be sitting in the room, smilingly intervened. Just a minute, Aunt. There is really no good ginseng to be had in the shops nowadays. If the dealers ever get hold of a whole root, they cut it into two or three sections which they carve into shape and graft crowns and rootlets onto so that they can make more money by passing off each section as a whole root. Our firm has quite a lot to do with the ginseng suppliers. If I had a word with Mamma about this, I am sure Pan could arrange for one of our people to get two ounces of whole, uncut root from the suppliers. It might cost rather a lot, but at least you could be sure that you were getting ginseng of the very highest quality. You are so knowledgeable! said Lady Wang gratefully. Would you do that then? I am sure it would be better for the request to come from you. Bao-chai left immediately and was gone for a long time. Hes sent someone to see about it, she said when she got back. We shall have a reply by this evening. That means that we ought to be able to get the stuff first thing tomorrow. That isnt too long to wait, is it? Lady Wang was delighted, though her comment was a somewhat rueful one. We have always kept a supply of ginseng in the past, and we have given I dont know how much away to other people but now that we want some ourselves, we have to run around looking for it elsewhere. 530 She sighed. Although ginseng is so costly, it is only a medicine, said Bao-chai consolingly. As such it ought to be given away to others, so that its benefit may be spread as widely as possible. People in our position cannot behave like ill-bred parvenus who hoard their ginseng like an heirloom and can only under the most exceptional circumstances be induced to part with any. Lady Wang nodded. Yes, I suppose you are right. A little later, after Bao-chai had gone and there was no one else with her in the room, Lady Wang called Zhou Ruis wife over to ask about another matter. When you made that search in the Garden the other day, did you find what you were looking for? Zhou Ruis wife had already consulted Xi-feng about what Lady Wang should be told and Xi-feng had insisted that there should be no concealment she therefore told her everything. Lady Wang was deeply shocked. When she had somewhat recovered from her surprise and begun thinking what to do, it occurred to her that, as Chess was Ying-chuns maid and therefore really a member of Lady Xings establishment, it would first be necessary to acquaint Lady Xing with the facts before proceeding any further.
A mothers heart always inclines towards one side. The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly, Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dames acupuncture myself. Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued. This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan. Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly peculiar. When Bao-yus poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his fathers presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal themselves in his choice of words. It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers, said Jia Zheng. Whether in your ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound classical models. The Two Incomparables we should call you, not because you are incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are incomparably hard to knock any sense into though whereas Bao-yu seems to think that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang. 506 This not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny provoked general laughter. Let me see that poem, said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost immediately began praising it. I like this poem, its got guts in it. Boys from families like ours dont need to read themselves half blind in order to get started on a career. Provided theyve read enough to show that they are better educated than the rabble and are capable of holding down a job, they can hardly fail to get on. Why waste a lot of time and energy on turning the boy into a book-worm? What I like about this poem is that it is just the sort of good amateur, not-too-brainy poem youd expect a young chap of our class to write. He sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to Jia Huan as a reward and smilingly patted him on the head. You go on writing poems like this, young fellow! Well have no trouble getting you a posting when the time comes, dont you worry! Jia Zheng protested. Whatever you think of the poem, it hardly justifies talking in this way about the boys future. Meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could continue but Grandmother Jia intervened. Why dont you two go now? Im sure your gentlemen must be waiting for you, and it would be discourteous to neglect them. Besides, it must be all often oclock and if you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy themselves unconstrainedly for a while before they go to bed. The two brothers at once got up to go, and after a parting cup offered to them on behalf of all the rest, they went off, taking Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian with them, but leaving Baoyu and the two younger boys with the womenfolk. What happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter. CHAPTER 76 Flute-playing at Convex Pavilion provokes too much melancholy And linked verses at Concave Pavilion betray a morbid sensitivity After Jia She and Jia Zheng had left, taking the two younger men with them, Grandmother Jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both tables should combine to make a single party. The serving-women cleared and wiped the table, replenished and replaced the plates of foodstuff, and set out clean winecups and chopsticks. While they were doing this, Grandmother Jia and the other members of the family were putting on more clothing, washing their hands rinsing their mouths out, and drinking tea. When all was ready they arranged themselves round the one table. As they did so, Grandmother Jia noticed, for the first time that evening, that Bao-chai and Bao-qin were not there.
We must all of us try to make one up about her. One of their number took a writing-brush and inkstone and wrote down the story almost exactly as Jia Zheng had told it, slightly modifying it here and there in the interest of style, to serve as a short preface for their poem. When he had finished it, he handed it to Jia Zheng for his approval. Yes, that seems to me exactly as it should be, said Jia Zheng after glancing briefly through it. It was a preface rather like this one that started off the discussion at our gathering. An Imperial directive was received at the Department yesterday asking for a search to be made in the records of this and the preceding dynasty for hitherto neglected instances of outstanding merit deserving some posthumous recognition. No class of persons was to be excluded monks, nuns, beggars, women and girls - all were eligible. Wherever exceptional merit could be established, a brief account of it was to be forwarded to the Board of Rites for inclusion in the list of recommendations. The preface they were discussing at our gathering was a copy of the account sent in by our Department to the Board. It was reading that preface that gave those present the idea that they should write a Winsome Colonel poem in commemoration of Fourth Sister Lins heroic loyalty. And very right that they should I said the literary gentlemen smilingly. But what is most admirable of all about this story is the tireless benevolence of the present Court which led to the unearthing of this forgotten heroism. Surely this is a thing unparalleled in any former age? The Tang poets line 568 This holy age, when nothing goods omitted, might almost have been written in anticipation of the present reign. -5947 Indeed! Jia Zheng nodded gravely. By this time Jia Huan and Jia Lan had also arrived. Jia Zheng allowed the three boys to look at the preface and then told them that he wanted a poem from each one of them. He would award a prize to whoever completed one first and another prize for the best poem. Jia Huan and Jia Lan had several times recently been called upon to compose in company and so were not unduly nervous on this occasion. After reading the preface, all three boys went off into separate corners to think. Jia Lan was the first to finish a poem and Jia Huan, fearful of being outstripped by his young nephew, made haste to follow. The two of them had already written their poems out while Bao-yu was still thinking. Jia Zheng and the literary gentlemen decided to look first at what the two younger boys had written. Jia Lans contribution was in the form of a quatrain. -1094 Fourth Sister Lin was the Winsome Colonels name She was beautiful and gentle, yet her valour none could tame. In Qing-zhou where, her Prince to avenge, she threw her life away, The very ground on which she fell is fragrant to this day. -5947 The literary gentlemen praised the little poem enthusiastically. For a young boy of his years to produce such a poem is proof of a highly cultured upbringing, they said. Childish prattle! Childish prattle! Jia Zheng laughed deprecatingly. Still, for one of his tender years it is quite a creditable effort. Next they read Jia Huans contribution. It was a Regulated Verse poem in pentameters. -774 The lovely lady would not sit and grieve For sterner thoughts her warlike breast did fill. She dried her womans tears and fearless rode -774 Through Qing-zhous gates to be killed and to kill. However great the odds, she said, I can My debt repay, if not avenge this ill. 569 The inscription graved upon her tomb shall be Here buried lies the worlds fidelity. -5947 Ah yes! said the literary gentlemen. What a difference those few years between them make! This is quite a different approach. I suppose its not too bad, said Jia Zheng, but it doesnt really do justice to the subject. Oh well, as to that -! said the literary gentlemen. After all, our young friend is not so very much older than his nephew. Old heads are not to be expected on young shoulders! Give them a few more years and I dont doubt we shall have a pair of poets in our midst to rival Ruan Ji and his nephew Ruan Xian! Come, come, they are not as good as that! said Jia Zheng, smiling. They dont study hard enough, thats their trouble. -5947 He asked Bao-yu how he was getting on. After all this careful chiselling, Mr Baos poem is sure to be something of quite a different order from these two we have just heard, said the literary gentlemen - one, no doubt, in which the romantic and tragic aspects of the theme will both be fully exploited.
The girls were thrilled and immediately started putting out the tables. They even invited the nuns from Water-moon Priory to join them. Parfumee was the only one to abstain. After a few bowls of wine, Jia Qin suggested a drinking game. Thurible and her friends replied None of us can play those games. Why dont we play guess-fingers instead? Loser to drink a bowl - that would be great fun! Its only just past midday! objected one of the Sisters. It will never do to start rioting about at this hour. I suggest we take a little drink or two now and then those who wish to may leave. Those of you who want to keep Mr Qin company can drink to your hearts content this evening. I shall turn a blind eye. Just at that moment, however, one of the lay-sisters came bursting into the room. Quickly everyone! Break it up! Steward Lais here, from Rong-guo House! The girls rushed around tidying up, and told Jia Qin to hide. He was by now well in his cups, and bragged Why should I hide? Im here to deliver the months allowance... Lai Da was in at the door before he had finished speaking. Signs of the incipient orgy were all too visible, and Lai Das loyal breast filled with rage. He was under the Masters instructions to keep the whole operation quiet, however, and inquired with a nonchalant smile Would Mr Qin be here by any chance? Qin lurched to his feet. Why Mr Lai! What brings you here? Pleased to find you here, sir, said Lai Da. We must get the young ladies ready as quickly as possible, and take them back to town. Theyre wanted at the Palace. Jia Qin and the girls wanted to know more, but Lai Da merely said Come along now. Its getting late. We must hurry or we shall miss the gates. So they all bundled into the carts that were waiting for them, and Lai Da mounted his sturdy mule and led the convoy into town. We must return to Jia Zheng. Usually so punctilious in his attendance at the Board, the Master was sitting alone in his study, breathing heavily and brooding over the anonymous posters. Jia Lian hovered within earshot, not daring to leave the house. At last there came the sound of someone at the gate and a messenger came in to report Excellency Zhang is indisposed, and will Sir Zheng please replace him this evening at the Board? Jia Zheng had been expecting Lai Da at any nioment. It was most annoying to be called away like this. Jia Lian came in. Lai Da didnt leave until after lunch, Uncle, and the Temple is over eight miles from town. He wont be back till eleven oclock at the earliest. As you are on call for this evening I think you should go. When Lai Da gets back, I shall tell him to keep the nuns locked up and not to say anything until you have had an opportunity of settling the affair yourself tomorrow. If Qin comes, I shall say nothing. We shall see how he reacts when you speak to him tomorrow. It seemed reasonable enough, and Jia Zheng left with some reluctance for the Board. As soon as he had gone Jia Lian set off back to his own apartment, brooding as he went on what he was going to say to Xi-feng. He held her to blame for having given Qin this job in the first place. But then he remembered that she was ill and relented. He had better not be too hard on her. He slackened his pace. Meanwhile the news had spread among the servants. It soon reached the ears of Patience, who immediately went to tell her mistress. Xi-feng had had a bad night anyway and was feeling very low. Her feeble state intensified her ever-present anxiety about the various misdeeds that lay on her conscience, in particular her unscrupulous dealings at Water-moon Priory. When she learnt of the anonymous poster, she sat up with a jolt and asked Patience What did it say? Patience thoughtlessly replied Oh, nothing much. Something to do with the nuns at Water-moon Priory... This nearly put paid to Xi-feng. Her guilty conscience spelled out for her the rest of the story. She was undone! A spasm of terror quite deprived her of the power of speech. She felt the heat surging within her, her eyes began to swim. She started coughing and collapsed on her bed, her eyes staring rigidly in front of her. Patience called out in great agitation I meant the nuns at the Temple of the Iron Threshold! Something to do with the novices. Theres no cause for you to take on so, ma am.
Surely if you put it in there, it wont do any good? Oh yes it will, said the old woman. A mothers heart always inclines towards one side. The others all laughed, and Grandmother Jia was persuaded to drink another half cup of wine. After a long pause she said somewhat wryly, Perhaps I could do with a bit of the old dames acupuncture myself. Jia She realized, too late, that his somewhat tactless choice of story could be interpreted as a criticism of his own mother. Hurriedly rising to his feet, he held up his cup to toast her with and did what he could to change the subject. Fortunately the old lady made no further reference to his gaffe and the game soon continued. This time the branch stopped with Jia Huan. Jia Huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies. He was even beginning to show a certain interest in verse, though his tastes in it were decidedly peculiar. When Bao-yus poem was praised earlier on, he had been dying to demonstrate his own talent, but had not dared risk the charge of showing off in his fathers presence. Now that the luck of the game had given him free licence, he called for paper and writing-brush and, in a matter of moments, wrote out a quatrain which he handed to his father. Jia Zheng was not impressed. It was a somewhat weird little poem, and whatever advances Jia Huan might lately have made in his schoolwork, they certainly did not reveal themselves in his choice of words. It is easy to see that you and Bao-yu are brothers, said Jia Zheng. Whether in your ideas or the language you express them in, you show the same distaste for sound classical models. The Two Incomparables we should call you, not because you are incomparable in virtue like Chen Yuan-fang and his brother, but because you are incomparably hard to knock any sense into though whereas Bao-yu seems to think that he has inherited the mantle of the Airy Fairy school and fancies himself as a second Wen Ting-yun, you apparently prefer the Spooks and Spectres style of poetry and see yourself as a latter-day Cao Tang. 506 This not because anyone understood it, but because it sounded funny provoked general laughter. Let me see that poem, said Jia She. He took it from Jia Zheng and almost immediately began praising it. I like this poem, its got guts in it. Boys from families like ours dont need to read themselves half blind in order to get started on a career. Provided theyve read enough to show that they are better educated than the rabble and are capable of holding down a job, they can hardly fail to get on. Why waste a lot of time and energy on turning the boy into a book-worm? What I like about this poem is that it is just the sort of good amateur, not-too-brainy poem youd expect a young chap of our class to write. He sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to Jia Huan as a reward and smilingly patted him on the head. You go on writing poems like this, young fellow! Well have no trouble getting you a posting when the time comes, dont you worry! Jia Zheng protested. Whatever you think of the poem, it hardly justifies talking in this way about the boys future. Meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could continue but Grandmother Jia intervened. Why dont you two go now? Im sure your gentlemen must be waiting for you, and it would be discourteous to neglect them. Besides, it must be all often oclock and if you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy themselves unconstrainedly for a while before they go to bed. The two brothers at once got up to go, and after a parting cup offered to them on behalf of all the rest, they went off, taking Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian with them, but leaving Baoyu and the two younger boys with the womenfolk. What happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter. CHAPTER 76 Flute-playing at Convex Pavilion provokes too much melancholy And linked verses at Concave Pavilion betray a morbid sensitivity After Jia She and Jia Zheng had left, taking the two younger men with them, Grandmother Jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both tables should combine to make a single party. The serving-women cleared and wiped the table, replenished and replaced the plates of foodstuff, and set out clean winecups and chopsticks. While they were doing this, Grandmother Jia and the other members of the family were putting on more clothing, washing their hands rinsing their mouths out, and drinking tea.
Tan-chun smiled. Well, Ying, if it wasnt you the woman I heard was talking about, perhaps it was me? Youd better call her inside again and let me ask her. Now youre being ridiculous, said Ying-chun, laughing. Why be like this? It has absolutely nothing to do with you. There you are wrong, said Tan-chun. You and I are in 450 the same boat. Our circumstances are very similar. What she says affects me as much as it does you. It would be just the same if you were to hear someone at my place complaining about me. You would feel almost as though you were being criticized yourself. As mistresses, you and I are above talking to servants about the petty cash. We may ask them for things sometimes, as and when we require them, but that is another matter. Tell me, though how did a pearl-and-gold phoenix come to be mixed up in this discussion? Zhu-ers wife, terrified lest Tangerine should seize this opportunity to denounce her, came rushing in at this point and tried to put Tan-chun off the scent with her own extremely garbled account of what had happened. But Tan-chun showed that she had a better understanding of the case than the woman supposed. I think you are being very stupid, she said smilingly. What you ought to do, now that your mother-in-law has already got herself into trouble, is to go to Mrs Lian before the money confiscated has been divided up and ask if you can have some of it back to redeem this jewellery with. Ideally, of course, it would have been better if you could have redeemed it before all this trouble broke out and saved yourselves a bit of face. But now that you have no face left to save, youd much better make a clean breast of it and get the money. After all, your mother-in-law has already been found guilty. However many crimes shes committed, they can only cut her head off once. You take my advice. Go round to Mrs Lians place as soon as possible and make a clean breast of it. Standing around here shouting is not going to get you anywhere! The woman was forced to admit that Tan-chuns reading of the situation was correct. But she was too scared to go to Xi-feng and confess. If I hadnt heard you talking about this, it would have been none of my business, said Tan-chun. But now that I have heard, I think you had better let me take over and do the explaining for you. Unknown to the others, Tan-chun had tipped Scribe the wink a minute or two previously and Scribe had slipped out- 451 -347 side to summon help. It was no surprise to Tan-chun, therefore, that Patience should have walked in just as she was saying this but to the others her appearance at that moment was little short of miraculous. Bao-qin clapped her hands delightedly. I always knew Cousin Tan was a witch. Now here comes her familiar spirit! Its not witchcraft, its generalship, said Dai-yu. Dont you remember what it says in The Art of War? A shy maiden in defence, but swift as a hare in the attack. -347 In good generalship surprise is of the essence. A look from Bao-chai caused the two girls to drop their bantering and talk of something else while Tan-chun addressed herself to the new arrival. Is your mistress any better yet? she asked Patience. She seems to have completely lost her grip on things since she had this illness. Its very unfortunate for people like me who have to put up with the consequences. Oh? said Patience in some surprise. Has someone been giving you trouble, miss? If you will let me know what I can do, I am at your disposal. Zhu-ers wife was now in a panic. She bounded up to Patience and was all over her before Tan-chun could get a word in. Sit down while I tell you, Miss Patience. I can explain it all. Patience gave her a long, hard look. Miss Tan and I are talking. What right have you to come butting in like this? If you had any manners at all, you wouldnt even be in this room, youd be waiting respectfully outside. Whoever heard of an outside servant going into one of the young mistresses apartments without being asked? Manners? said Tangerine. You wont find many around here. People barge in and out of this apartment as they please. Its your fault then if they do, said Patience sharply. If Miss Ying is too gentle to do so, you ought to throw them out yourselves and then go and report them to Her Ladyship.
Grandmother Jia went in with Lady Wang and Lady Xing and found Qiao-jie in the arms of her nurse, wrapped in a little padded quilt of pink damask-silk, her face deathly white, her eyebrows and nostrils quivering slightly.After a brief inspection, they withdrew to the outer room, and sat down to talk. Presently a junior maid from Lady Wangs apartment came in with a message for Xi-feng -768 The Master has sent to inquire how Qiao-jie is, Mrs Lian. Tell him we have sent for the doctor, replied Xi-feng, and that I will report as soon as he has made out his prescription. The maids arrival reminded Grandmother Jia of the recently aired marriage proposal. She turned to Lady Wang You ought to go and tell Zheng straight away about that business, dear. If we put a stop to it now, before someone talks to the Zhang family, we will save ourselves the trouble of having to say no to them later. She turned to Lady Xing. Why is it you havent seen much of the Zhangs lately, anyway? As a matter of fact, replied Lady Xing, theyre very mean and not the right sort of family for us at all. It would have been a needless humiliation for Bao-yu. That must be Bao-yus betrothal you are talking about, Mother? said Xi-feng, who had already formed a shrewd idea of what was going on. Why yes, we are actually, said Lady Xing. Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng about the Zhang proposal. Xi-feng laughed I hope youll excuse me, Grannie, Mother, Auntie Wang, for speaking out of turn, but what need is there to go looking for a wife for Bao-yu, when we have a "predestined affinity" here before our very eyes? What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia, intrigued. Surely, Grannie, you cant have forgotten Baos Magic Jade and Chais Golden Locket? Grandmother Jia laughed. Of course! But why on earth didnt you mention it while Aunt Xue was here yesterday? It would hardly have been right for me to speak up in the presence of my elders and betters, replied Xi-feng. Besides, Aunt Xue had come on a social call and it would have been out of place. If we are to do the thing properly, Mother and Aunt Wang must go over and ask Aunt Xue formally for Bao-chais hand. They all laughed at her. Bless you, Fengie, said Grandmother Jia. I really must be going gaga. 113 Meanwhile the doctor was announced and Grandmother Jia took a seat in the outer room, while the two ladies discreetly withdrew. The doctor entered with Jia Lian and paid his respects to Grandmother Jia before proceeding into Qiao-jies room. When he returned, he bowed to Grandmother Jia and pronounced his diagnosis. The little girl is suffering from a convulsive attack complicated by an internal fever. She must first take a single dose of a combined anti-spasmodic and expectorant, and then I want you to give her a course of Four Prodigies Powders. It is quite a serious attack. You will notice Cows Bezoar-stone in my prescription. I should mention that a lot of the Bezoars sold by the apothecaries nowadays are not genuine. It is important that you procure the real thing. Grandmother Jia thanked him for coming, and the doctor went out with Jia Lian, wrote out his prescription and left. Theres always Ginseng in the house, said Xi-feng, but I dont think weve any Bezoar. Well have to buy some and make sure it 5 genuine. Wait until Ive sent someone round to my sisters, said Lady Wang. I know Pan has often done business with merchants from overseas. They might easily have some real Bezoar. As she was speaking, several of the girls arrived to see Qiao-jie. They stayed for a short while, and then left with Grandmother Jia and the others. Qiao-jies expectorant was now prepared and poured down her throat. There was a retching sound and up it came, medicine, phlegm and all, much to Xi-fengs relief. One of Lady Wangs junior maids arrived with a little red paper packet. We found some Bezoar, maam. Her Ladyship says youre to weigh Out the correct amount and take as much as you need. Xi-feng asked the maid to convey her thanks to Lady Wang, took the package and told Patience to mix Pulverized Pearl, Baros Camphor and Cinnabar in the prescribed proportions and bring them to the boil.
Do come in and sit down, she said to Bao-yu. Nightingale fetched another jacket and helped her into it. She sat down and asked him Did you see Mrs Xue at Grandmothers? Yes, I did, replied Bao-yu. Did she mention me at all? No. And she didnt seem as friendly as usual towards me either. When I asked after Cousin Chai she just smiled and hardly said anything. I hope I havent offended her by not going over to visit Chai this last couple of days. Dai-yu gave a short laugh. Have you been to see her? I didnt know she was ill at first, protested Bao-yu, I only heard a day or two ago, and I still havent been... Well thats certain to be the reason... The truth is that neither Grandmother, Mother nor Father would let me go, and how could I without their permission? I used to be able to drop round and see her ten times a day if I felt like it but now theyve closed the little side-gate and I have to go round by the front, which is such a performance. But hows she supposed to know all that? You know Chai shes sure to make allowances for me. You shouldnt take it for granted, retorted Dai-yu.Perhaps she wont. Its not as if its her mother whos been ill its Chai herself. Think of all the poetry contests, all the pleasures youve shared with her in the past - the flowers, the wine, the parties. Now shes separated from us, and you know the troubles her family are having, yet when she falls seriously ill you behave with complete indifference. Shes bound to be offended. Bao-yu Surely you dont mean she doesnt like me any more? Dai-yu I have no idea. I can only surmise how she might reasonably be expected to feel. Bao-yu stared in silence. Dai-yu ignored him, told one of her maids to put some more incense on the brazier, took out a book and began reading it. After a minute or two Bao-yu frowned and stamped his foot fretfully. Whats the point in my being alive? The world would be an altogether better place without this thing called me Cant you see? said Dai-yu. Its the illusion of "me" that creates the illusion of "others", and a life lived under these twin illusions is bound to be beset with frustrations, fears, confusion, foolish dreams and a host of other obstacles and entanglements. I wasnt speaking in earnest earlier on. Mrs Xue was just in low spirits when you saw her. There was no need for you to bring Cousin Chai into it. Mrs Xue came over because of Cousin Pans court-case. She was worried, and its hardly surprising she wasnt in the mood to entertain you. You just allowed your imagination to run away with you and lead you astray. Her words brought Bao-yu a sudden sense of enlightenment. Of course! he exclaimed with a laugh. Thats exactly it! Youre so much more perceptive than I am! No wonder you defeated me with that koan last year, when I was so wrought up. For all my pretensions, I need you to guide me to the truth. This bumptious Buddha bows to your Single Flower! In that case, said Dai-yu, seeing her opportunity, prepare yourself for another inquisition. Bao-yu crossed his legs, brought the palms of his hands together, closed his eyes, pursed his lips and said Pray begin. Dai-yu Now, let the First of my Propositions be that Cousin Chai likes you. Proposition the Second she likes you not. The Third she liked you a few days ago, but does no more. The Fourth she does today, but will not do tomorrow. The Fifth you like her, but she likes you not. The Sixth and last she likes you, btit you like her not. Consider these Six Propositions well. For several minutes Bao-yu was completely silent. Then suddenly he burst out laughing and cried If all the Seas of Paradise were mine, with my simple gourd Id be content. Dai-yu What if your gourd is carried away by the stream? Bao-yu Never! Wherever the stream flows, the gourd will always hold its own course. Dai-yu What if the flow comes to an end and your Pearl sinks? Bao-yu "Like a catkin held fast in a puddle, -1387 This Zen Mind Not a partridge, gaily cavorting In the spring wind." Dai-yu The first rule of Zen is not to tell lies. Bao-yu But its the truth, so help me Buddha, the Dharma and the Holy Brotherhood.
You are now ready, in body and mind, to begin. You must while playing observe carefully the dynamic markings - piano, forte , allegro, adagio - and maintain a relaxed but serious manner at all times. Goodness me! cried Bao-yu. I was thinking we could do it for fun! If its as complicated as that, Im not sure Id be up to it! While they were talking Nightingale came in, and on seeing Bao-yu in the room, inquired with a smile To what are we to attribute this joyful event, Master Bao? Cousin Dai has just been teaching me about the Qin. Its as though scales had fallen from my eyes! I could go on listening for ever! I didnt mean that, said Nightingale. What I meant was, its so rarely that we see you at all nowadays, I wondered if something out of the ordinary had happened to bring you here today? I suppose it must seem like that, replied Bao-yu. But the only reason Ive not been round more often is that I know Cousin Dai has not been well, and thought it best not to trouble her. And then Ive been having to go to school... Well, interrupted Nightingale, Miss Lin has only just started to feel better, so dont you think you should let her rest now, and not wear her out giving you lessons? Why yes! How thoughtless of me! he exclaimed with a laugh. I was so absorbed in what she was Saying, that it never entered my head she might be tiring herself. I wasnt, said Dai-yu, smiling. Talking about music doesnt tire one, on the contrary, it raises ones spirits. I only wonder if what I was saying wasnt beyond you... It doesnt matter, said Bao-yu. Im sure if we take it slowly Ill be able to understand. He stood up. But seriously, I think I should leave you in peace now. Tomorrow Ill ask Tan and Xi if theyll come over with me. You three can learn together. I think Ill just sit in. .. Why, you lazy thing! laughed Dai-yu. Imagine if we three did learn to play, and you were as ignorant as ever wouldnt we then be casting our She felt she was allowing herself to become too intimate, and suddenly stopped short. Bao-yu only laughed Id be happy just to hear you play. Id do anything for that - even be your swine! Dai-yu blushed, but laughed nonetheless. Nightingale and Snowgoose laughed too. Bao-yu took his leave, and had reached the door, when Ripple appeared, followed by a junior maid bearing a small pot of orchid-plants. Her Ladyship has been given four pots of these orchids, said Ripple, and she thought that, as she was so busy at the palace and wouldnt have time to appreciate them, she would give one to you, Master Bao, and one to you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu looked at the orchids. Among them were some of the double-headed kind, and looking at these, she had a strange sensation that they meant something. Whether it was joy or sorrow that they portended, she could not tell. But it was something of importance. She stood staring at them, lost in thought. Bao-yus mind, by contrast, was still full of vibratos and glissandos, and as he left he said gaily Now that you have these orchids, coz, youll be able to compose your own Lonely Qrchid Pavan. And Im sure it will be just as good as the one Confucius wrote! Dai-yus heart was too troubled to respond to this parting jest. She walked indoors, and staring once more at her orchids, thought to herself Flowers have their spring-time, a time for fresh blossoms and young leaves. I am young, but frail as the willow that dreads the first breath of autumn... If all turns out for the best, I may grow stronger yet. But if not, my fate will be like that of the fallen petals at springs end, driven by the rain and tossed in the wind These sombre reflections brought tears to her eyes. Nightingale was puzzled to see her cry. Just now, she thought to herself, when Master Bao was here, they were both in such high spirits and now look at her! And all shes done is look at those flowers! She was still trying in vain to think of some consolation to offer, when one of Bao-chais serving-women came into the room. But if you wish to know the purpose of her visit, you must read the next chapter. -12214 -16107 59 CHAPTER 87 Autumnal sounds combine with sad remembrances to inspire a composition on the Qin And a flood of passion allows evil spirits to disturb the serenity of Zen The serving-woman was shown into the Naiads House.
I know. The more I wanted to sleep, the wider awake I became. Youre not well, Miss. I think all this worrying is ruining your health. And good health is like the hill in the proverb -1227 Keep the hill green, keep the hill green, And youll never lack fuel for winter again. Besides, everyone here cares for you so. Her Old Ladyship does, Her Ladyship does, everyone does! How could Nightingale know that the mere mention of these homely names, intended to reassure and comfort, was enough to conjure up again the horror of the nightmare? Dai-yu felt her heart thumping, everything went black before her eyes, and she seemed on the point of fainting altogether. Nightingale quickly held out the spittoon while Snowgoose patted her lightly on the back. After a long while she coughed up another mouthful of phlegm. In it was a thick wriggling strand of dark red blood. The two maids were pale with fright. They stood supporting her, one on each side, until finally she slumped back, scarcely conscious. Nightingale, aware of the critical nature of her condition, looked at Snowgoose and made an urgent movement with her lips that clearly meant Go and fetch someone - quickly! Snowgoose was no sooner out of the door than she saw Kingfisher and Ebony coming towards the Naiads House, smiling as they walked along. Isnt Miss Lin up yet? inquired Kingfisher cheerfully. My mistress and Miss Tan-chun are both round at Miss Xi-chuns discussing her painting of the garden. Snowgoose hushed them both with a quick gesture. Whats the matter? they asked in alarm. Snowgoose told them all that had happened, and they shot out their tongues in horror. But thats serious! Why havent you been to tell Her Old Ladyship? What a terrible thing! How could you be so silly! I was on my way when you two arrived, replied Snowgoose. Whos that talking outside? called Nightingale from the bedroom. Miss Lin wants to know. The three of them went in together, to find Dai-yu lying wrapped up in bed. Whats all the excitement about? she asked them. Whos been telling you tales? It was Ebony who replied Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun have just gone over to Miss Xi-chuns to discuss her landscape of the garden, and they sent us here to ask you to join them, Miss Lin. Were sorry to hear that youre not well. Its nothing serious, said Dai-yu. Im just feeling a bit weak, thats all. Ill be up when Ive had a little rest. Will you tell Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun that I should like them to come here after lunch, if theyre not too busy? I dont suppose Master Baos been over there, has he? No, Miss, came the reply. Master Bao has been going to school the last few days, continued Ebony, and the Master tests him every day, so he doesnt get a chance to romp around as he used to. Dai-yu was silent and thoughtful. The two maids stood around for a minute or two longer and then discreetly withdrew. At the Lotus Pavilion, Xi-chuns painting of Prospect Garden was being subjected to an aesthetic appraisal by Tan-chun and Xiang-yun. Too much here, not enough there, a little too thin in one place, too crowded in another. They were thinking of adding a poetry inscription, and had sent to ask for Dai-yus advice. They were busily talking when Kingfisher and Ebony came back, looking very flustered. Xiang-yun was the first to question them Why hasnt Miss Lin come with you? She had a bad relapse last night, Miss, replied King-fisher, and was up coughing most of the night. According to Snowgoose the phlegm it her spittoon was flecked with blood. Are you sure? asked Tan-chun, aghast. Quite sure, replied Kingfisher. Weve just been in to see her, Miss, said Ebony. She looks dreadful, and hardly has the strength to speak. If shes as sick as that, shes hardly likely to be able to speak, said Xiang-yun bluntly. What nonsense, Yun! Why if she couldnt speak that would mean she was ....... Tan-chun broke off in mid-sentence. Dai is a clever soul, said Xi-chun. But she does have a tendency to take everything too seriously. If only she could see beyond it all. We must go and see how she is, anyway, said Tanchun.
Bao-yu I heard you playing when I was walking back from Smartweed Loggia a few days ago. The music was so lovely and I didnt want to interrupt you, so I just listened quietly for a while and then went on my way. There is one thing Ive been meaning to ask you. I noticed that in the first part you use a level-tone rhyme, but suddenly change to an oblique tone at the end. Why is that? Dai-yu That is free composition. One doesnt have to abide by any rules. One just goes wherever the inspiration takes one. Bao-yu I see! Im afraid such subtleties were lost on my untrained ears. Dai-yu True lovers of music have always been few. Bao-yu realized that without meaning to he had said the wrong thing, and was afraid that he had alienated Dai-yu. He sat there for a while. There was so much he wanted to say, but he was now too nervous to open his mouth again. Dai-yu had also spoken without thinking, and on reflection she wished that she had not been so scathing, and withdrew silently into her shell. Her silence only increased Bao-yus own misgivings, and finally in some embarrassment he stood up and said I must be on my way to see Tan. Please dont get up. Give her my regards when you see her, will you? said Dai-yu. I will, he replied, and departed. Dai-yu saw him to the door, then returned to her chair and sat brooding to herself. Bao-yus been so odd recently. He doesnt seem to say what hes thinking. Hes friendly one minute and distant the next. I wonder what it means? Nightingale came in. Have you finished copying for today, Miss? Shall I put your writing things away now? I shant be doing any more, replied Dai-yu. You can clear them away. Dai-yu went into the inner room and lay down on her bed, slowly turning all these things over in her mind. Nightingale came in to ask if she would like some tea. No, thank you. I just want to be alone and lie down for a bit. Very well, Miss. Nightingale went out, to find Snowgoose standing in the doorway, staring oddly in front of her. She went up to her and said Whats the matter with you? Snowgoose was lost in thought, and the question gave her quite a turn. Sh! Dont say a word! Ive heard something very strange. If I tell you, you must promise not to breathe a word to anyone. As she said this Snowgoose shot her lips out in the direction of Dai-yus bedroom, then began walking away, nodding to Nightingale to follow her. They reached the foot of the terrace and she began again in a whisper Have you heard that Bao-yus engaged to be married? Nightingale gave a start. I dont believe you! It cant be true! It is! Nearly everyone knows except us. Who told you? Scribe. His fiance is a prefects daughter. Shes very good-looking and comes from a wealthy family. As Snowgoose was speaking, Nightingale heard Dai-yu cough and thought she could hear her getting up again. Worried that she might come out and overhear them, she took Snowgoose by the hand and motioned to her to be silent. She looked inside, but all seemed quiet. She asked Snowgoose in a low whisper What exactly did Scribe say? Do you remember, replied Snowgoose, a day or two ago you sent me to Miss Tans to thank her for something? Well, she wasnt home, but Scribe was. We started chatting, and one of us happened to mention Master Bao and his naughty ways. Scribe said "When will Master Bao ever grow up? He doesnt take anything seriously. And to think that hes engaged to be married now - and still as silly as ever!" I asked her if the engagement had been settled, and she said that it had and that the go-between was a Mr Wang, a close relation on the Ning-guo side, so the whole thing was a foregone conclusion. Nightingale put her head thoughtfully to one side. How very strange! she thought to herself. Why has no one in the family mentioned it? she asked Snowgoose. Thats Her Old Ladyships idea - so Scribe said. Its in case Bao-yu finds out and is distracted from his studies. She made me promise not to tell a soul, and said she would blame me if word got around. Snowgoose pointed towards the house. Thats why I havent mentioned it in front of her.
So saying, Jia Zheng went out to give the staff their instructions. Lady Wang dried her eyes and went in to Grandmother Jias apartment. She said simply that Yuanchun was ill, and that they must go to the Palace to present their respects. Merciful Buddha! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. How can she have fallen ill again? Last time if you remember I had such a fright, and then we found out that I had been imagining it all. If Only I were imagining it now! Lady Wang talked to the old lady, and at the same time urged Faithful and the other maids to look out her court robes and begin attiring her. She then went in haste to her own apartment, dressed and returned to wait on Grandmother J ia. In a short while they were ready, and walked out from the main hall to the sedan-chairs that were waiting to carry them to the palace. Yuan-chun, since her elevation to the Imperial Bed-chamber, had been the cherished object of the emperors favours, and had become as a result somewhat plump. From the constant pressure and daily exhaustion of life at court, she had also developed a chronic bronchial condition. A few days previously, when returning late from attendance at a banquet, she had cught a chill,. which soon brought on her old complaint. This time, however, it was a severe attack. Phlegm completely obstructed her passages, causing a coldness and faintness in her limbs. The emperor was informed, and a court physician summoned at once. But she could swallow none of the medicines that he prescribed, and even the decongestant salts they tried to administer had no beneficial effect. Concerned at her critical condition, her attendant eunuchs reported again to His Majesty, requesting that the necessary precautions be taken. And so her immediate family were summoned to the Palace. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang presented themselves at the palace, and entered the Imperial Concubines Bed-chamber, to find her choked with phlegm, with saliva dribbling from her mouth, no longer capable of speech. When she saw her grandmother coming towards her, her face took on the most pitiful expression, as if she wanted to weep but no longer had the strength to do so. Grandmother Jia came forward to do homage, and offered a few words of comfort. A little later, the official cards of Jia Zheng and company were brought in, and a lady-in-waiting presented them for Her Graces inspection. She no longer had the strength to look at them, however, and her face was growing paler minute by minute. The eunuchs were about to report to the emperor again, and foreseeing that the other concubines would soon arrive to pay their last respects, asked the Jia relatives if they would kindly step outside and wait in one of the ante-chambers of the Palace. Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang had no choice but to conform to court regulations, and wrench themselves away. Holding back their tears, they left the chamber with sorrowful hearts. They could see messages being passed within the Palace, and shortly afterwards a eunuch came out and sent for an official from the Imperial Board of Astronomy. Grandmother Jia knew Only too well what this meant. He was requesting an auspicious date for the funeral. It was all over. But still she dared not make a move. It was not long before a junior eunuch came out to make the official announcement Her Grace the Jia Concubine has passed away. It was the nineteenth of the twelfth month. Spring Commencement fell on the eighteenth of the twelfth month of that year, being the year Jia Yin the nineteenth of the month was therefore also, astrologically speaking, within the month Yin of the following Mao year. Her Grace was forty-three years old. Grandmother Jia rose, and doing her best to remain composed, left the Palace, climbed into her sedan and was carried home. Jia Zheng and company had also been informed, and they too made the sad journey home. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Bao-yu and other members of the family were lined up on both sides of the courtyard before the main hall of Rong-guo House to greet first Grandmother Jia, then Jia Zheng and Lady Wang as they returned. Our narrative passes over the tearful family scene. Early next day, all members of the family with official rank went to the Palace to pay their last respects, and to mourn as the rites prescribed. The details of Yuan-chuns tomb were the responsibility of the Minister of Works, and Jia Zheng found himself being frequently entertained by his President, and consulted by his colleagues. It was a very busy time - not at all like the period of the previous court funerals for the Dowager Empress and the Zhou Concubine.
In the first Segment, Sunt Verendi, the Sage is Spurring Youth on to Moral Endeavour in the Present, while the last Segment, Non Sunt Digni Quos Verearis, contains his Caution for the Future. He looked up again at Dai-ru. -294 That will do. Interpretatio Partium. Bao-yu began again Confucius saith "For the Duration of Youth, each Spiritual and Mental Talent must be held in Due Esteem. For how can we ever Predict with Certainty anothers Ultimate Station in Life? But if a man, by Drifting and Wasting his Days, should reach the Age of Forty or Fifty and still be Unsuccessful and Obscure, then it can fairly be said that his Youthful Promise was an Empty One. 14e will have Forfeited For Ever the Esteem of his Fellow Men." Your Arnplificatio Totius was passably clear, commented Dai-ru with a dry smile. But I am afraid your In terpretatio Partium showed a good deal of immaturity. In the phrase sine Nomine, Nomen refers not to Success in the Worldly Sense but rather to an Individuals Achievement in the Moral and Intellectual Spheres. In this sense it by no means implies Official Rank. On the contrary, many of the Great Sages of Antiquity were Obscure Failures who Withdrew from the World and yet we hold them in the Highest Esteem, do we not? Nonne sunt Digni quos Vereamur? You construe the last sentence incorrectly, he droned on. Here it is not the element of Esteem but the Irreconcilable Nature of the Judgement of his Fellow Men that is being contrasted with their Tentative Appraisal of him as a Youth see second sentence of your text. This emphasis is central to a Correct Elucidation of the passage. Do you follow me? Yes, sir. Good. Here is another. Dai-ru turned back a few pages and pointed out a passage to Bao-yu. It was Analects again, this time chapter IX, verse XVIII Ego nondum vidi qui amet Virtutem sicut amat Pulchram Spedem - THE RARITY OF A SINCERE LOVE OF VIRTUE. Bao-yu scented danger ahead and said with his most ingenuous smile Im afraid I cant think of anything to say, sir. Nonsense, my boy! Is that what you would write if it turned up as a Thema in your paper Reluctantly Bao-yu set the wheels in motion. Confucius saith Men will not love Virtue, and yet they Fall Down and Worship Sensual Beauty at First Sight. The Reason for this Disaffection is that they are Blind to the Intrinsicality of Virtue. Beauty is an Intrinsic Quality too, and as such Loved by All, but it belongs to the Realm of Human Desire, whereas Virtue is a Natural Principle. How can Principle hope to Compete with Desire for the Affections of men? Confucius is both Lamenting the State of the World and Hoping for a Change of Heart. The Love of Virtue he has observed has been for the most part a Shallow and Short-lived Affair. How Fine it would be if only men would feel for Virtue the Devotion they feel towards Beauty... Thank you, that will do, said Dai-ru. I have but one question to put to you. If you understand the words of Confucius so well, why is it that you transgress these very two Precepts? I am only an outsider, but without need of explanation from your Father I can identify your Moral Shortcomings. One cannot hope to become a Man except by dint of Constant Self-Improvement. You are at present a Youth of Promise, or as our text has it Puer Verendus. Whether or not you Fulfil this Promise depends entirely on your own efforts. Are you to be a Man of Merit, Vir Nominis, or are you to be a Man No Longer Esteemed by his Fellow-Men, Vir Non lam Verendus? I shall allow you an initial period of one month in which to revise your old texts thoroughly, and a further month in which to study models of Octopartite Composition. At the end of the second month I intend to set you your Maiden Theme. If I detect any sign of slackness on your part, y6u need not expect me to be lenient. As the saying goes -1414 Perfection comes through ceaseless effort Effortless ease brings but perditidn. Be sure to bear in mind all that I have said.
Overjoyed to see such a gathering, Bao-yu offered his congratulations first to Grandmother Jia, then to his mother and Lady Xing, and then greeted the rest of the family. He turned to Dai-yu with- a smile and said Are you quite recovered now, coz? Yes, thank you, replied Dai-yu, with a hint of a smile. And you? I heard that you were not very well yourself. Yes, I had a sudden pain in my heart that night. Its been better for quite a while, but Ive been having to go to school every day, so I havent been able to come over and see you. Before he had even finished speaking, Dai-yu turned away to talk to Tan-chun. Xi-feng was standing near them and observed sarcastically I thought you two were meant to be inseparable? The way you talk anyone would think you were strangers. Still, I suppose His to honour, Hers to obey... Everyone laughed. The colour flew into Dai-yus face and at first she was quite speechless with embarrassment. But thinking that some sort of reply was expected of her, she finally came out with Whod expect you to understand... which seemed to amuse everyone even more. After a moments reflection Xi-feng realized that her joke had been in rather poor taste, and she was about to introduce a fresh topic of conversation, in an attempt to clear the air a little, when Bao-yu suddenly turned to Daiyu and said Coz, do you know what that tactless, blundering fool Yun tried to... But whatever it was he had been going to say, he thought better of it. There was a puzzled laugh from the others. Someone said What are you talking about? Dai-yu was as much in the dark as they were and smiled awkwardly. Bao-yu extricated himself by launching off at another tangent I heard just now that someone is planning to send over some players. When are they coming, does anyone know? They all stared at him in amazement and laughed. It was Xi-feng who replied Youre the one whos heard. Why ask us? Id better go and check, he said promptly. Now dont go getting into mischief out there, warned his grandmother. You dont want the crowd to make fun of you, do you? And remember, this is a very special day for your father, and if he comes home and finds you gadding about, theres sure to be trouble. Yes, Grannie, replied Bao-yu, and effected his escape. When he had gone, Grandmother Jia asked Xi-feng Whats all this about sending players? Uncle Wang Zi-shengs family, replied Xi-feng, want to do something to congratulate you and Uncle Zheng and Auntie. Theyve hired a new troupe of young actors specially, and they say that the day after tomorrow is a lucky one. Xi-feng laughed And it is too, in more ways than one. She looked at Dai-yu and smiled. Dai-yu smiled shyly back. Of course! exclaimed Lady Wang. Its our niece 5 birthday! When Grandmother Jia had taken in what they were saying she laughed out loud It just goes to show how absent-minded Im getting in my old age! Its a good thing Ive Secretary Feng here to keep me organized. Well, what could be better. they can celebrate your Uncle Zhengs promotion, and we can celebrate your birthday at the same time! This had everyone laughing, and it was proposed and carried unanimously that with such an apt way of putting things, the old lady positively had a right to enjoy such prodigious good fortune. Bao-yu had returned in time to hear about the party and was beside himself with joy. They all sat down to lunch in an atmosphere of great excitement. After lunch, Jia Zheng returned from giving thanks at court, and having performed his ceremonial prostrations in the family shrine, came in to kotow before Grandmother Jia. He rose to his feet and said a few words before leaving to pay various official calls. Over the next day or two there was constant bustle and confusion, as a stream of relatives besieged Rong-guo House. Horses and carriages thronged the main entrance, and in every corner important-looking gentlemen in starched official hats trimmed with sable sat waiting their turn. Truly Where flowers bloom, Bees and butterflies abound Skies and oceans swell When the moon is round. Two days later, the players, on the instructions of Wang Zi-sheng and other relations, arrived early in the morning to set up their mobile stage in Grandmother Jias courtyard, facing the main hall. The Jia menfolk, in full dress, entertained their relatives in the open courtyard, where more than ten tables had been laid.
She said that there was so much she wanted to talk to you about, but that she would not be able to come to the capital at present. My brother-in-law Wang Ren is coming here, so I heard, and if they meet him on the way, they will tell him to come and give us the latest news. Lady Wang responded to all of this with a grief that the reader can surely imagine. Why dont you lie down for a while, Aunt? said Xi-feng. In the evening, we can talk further about Bao-yus affairs. Having uttered these comforting words, Xi-feng returned with Jia Lian to her own apartment, where she informed him of all that had been decided and told him to give instructions for the cleaning and refurbishing of the courtyard that was to be the couples new home. But of this no more for the present. A day or two after these events, Dai-yu, having eaten her breakfast, decided to take Nightingale with her to visit Grandmother Jia. She wanted to pay her respects, and also thought the visit might provide some sort of distraction for herself. She had hardly left the Naiads House, when she remembered that she had left her handkerchief at home, and sent Nightingale back to fetch it, saying that she would walk ahead slowly and wait for her to catch up. She had just reached the corner behind the rockery at Drenched Blossoms Bridge - the very spot where she had once buried the flowers with Bao-yu - when all of a sudden she heard the sound of sobbing. She stopped at once and listened. She could not tell whose voice it was, nor could she distinguish what it was that the voice was complaining of, so tearfully and at such length. It really was most puzzling. She moved forward again cautiously and as she turned the corner, saw before her the source of the sobbing, a maid with large eyes and thick-set eyebrows. Before setting eyes on this girl, Dai-yu had guessed that one of the many maids in the Jia household must have had an unhappy. love-affair, and had come here to cry her heart out in secret. But now she laughed at the very idea. How could such an ungainly creature as this know the meaning of love? she thought to herself. This must be one of the odd-job girls, who has probably been scolded by one of the senior maids. She looked more closely, but still could not place the girl. Seeing Dai-yu, the maid ceased her weeping, wiped her cheeks, and rose to her feet. Come now, what are you so upset about? inquired Dai-yu. Oh Miss Lin! replied the maid, amid fresh tears. Tell me if you think it fair. They were talking about it, and how was I to know better? Just because I say one thing wrong, is that a reason for sister to start hitting me? Dai-yu did not know what she was talking about. She smiled, and asked again Who is your sister? Pearl, answered the maid. From this, Dai-yu concluded that she must work in Grandmother Jias apartment. And what is your name? Simple. Dai-yu laughed. Then Why did she hit you? What did you say that was so wrong? Thats what Id like to know! It was only to do with Master Bao marrying Miss Chai! The words struck Dai-yus ears like a clap of thunder. Her heart started thumping fiercely. She tried to calm herself for a moment, and told the maid to come with her. The maid followed her to the secluded corner of the garden, where the Flower Burial Mound was situated. Here Dai-yu asked her Why should she hit you for mentioning Master Baos marriage to Miss Chai? Her Old Ladyship, Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian, replied Simple, have decided that as the Master is leaving soon, they are going to arrange with Mrs Xue to marry Master Bao and Miss Chai as uickly as possible. They want the wedding to turn his luck, and then... Her voice tailed off. She stared at Dai-yu, laughed and continued Then, as soon as those two are married, they are going to find a husband for you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu was speechless with horror. The maid went on regardless But how was I to know that theyd decided to keep it quiet, for fear of embarrassing Miss Chai? All I did was say to Aroma, that serves in Master Baos room "Wont it be a fine to-do here soon, when Miss Chai comes over, or Mrs Bao... what will we have to call her? Thats all I said. What was there in that to hurt sister Pearl?
Meanwhile the company had been over to the other side of the terrace to admire the cassia. They now took their places at table once more and were served with freshly heated wine. In the midst of their chattering and laughter, suddenly startling them into silence, the undulant, lamenting sound of a flute came floating up to them from the cassia-trees below. Beautiful at any time, such music heard in the stillness of the night under the great vault of the sky with a bright moon above and only the cold, invisible night wind stirring in the earth below steals like a balm over the soul, soothing and dissolving all earthly griefs and cares. They listened, rapt and silent, with upturned, attentive faces. The music continued 510 for about the space in which one could comfortably have drunk two cups of tea and then stopped. The momentary silence which followed it was broken by cries of admiration from all present. The winecups were replenished with warm wine. You see, said Grandmother Jia. It is good, isnt it? It truly is, they agreed. Who could have imagined anything so beautiful? If it werent for you, Grandma, we might never have had this experience. It could have been much better, said Grandmother Jia. To get the full benefit you need to hear something really slow. She had a large cup of wine poured and ordered one of her women to take it to the flautist. Tell her to take her time with this, and say that when shes finished drinking it, Id like her to play us another piece, only more softly this time. While this woman went off with the message and the wine, the two women she had sent off earlier to inquire after Jia Shes ankle returned. Weve had a look at Sir She, Your Ladyship. His right ankle is rather swollen, but hes taken some medicine and the pain is not so bad now. It doesnt look very serious. Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed. You see? The truth is, I worry too much. He was trying to make out that I dont care about him at all! While she was saying this, Faithful appeared carrying a large cape and hood. Here, put these on, she said. Its getting very late. You dont want to be outside when the dew falls. Arent you afraid of catching cold? I think when youve sat a little longer, you ought to come back home to bed. Just when Im enjoying myself you have to start nagging me to go to bed, said Grandmother Jia. I hope you dont think Im drunk. Ive decided to stay up till dawn. She called rebelliously for more wine, but did put the cape and hood on notwithstanding. The other ladies drank with her for company and did their best to be amusing. Then, silencing them once more, the sound of the flute concealed in the cassia-bushes below came stealing into their ears, this time 511 more plaintive even than before. Indeed, this time the combination of the flutes melancholy with the effects of nocturnal stillness and ghostly moonlight induced a feeling of such overpowering sadness in the listeners that they turned their backs on it and sought, with talk and somewhat forced laughter, to escape it. Fresh wine was called for and the flautist told to stop playing. Ill cheer you up, Lady Jia, said You-shi. Let me tell you a funny story. I learnt it specially for the occasion. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, that would be very nice, a joke. Do tell me, said Grandmother Jia with a jollity that seemed somewhat strained. There were once four brothers, You-shi began. The eldest had only one eye, the second had only one ear, the third had only one nostril, and the fourth, though he had all his parts in order, was dumb. She had got no farther with her story when she became aware that the old ladys head was nodding down upon her bosom and her eyelids drooping as though she was about to go to sleep. She broke off at once, and she and Lady Wang both called gently to her to wake up. Grandmother Jia opened her eyes wide and laughed. Im not sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Go on with your story. Im listening. Its very late, said Lady Wang. The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew. Wont you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth watching. What time is it? Grandmother Jia asked. Past two oclock, said Lady Wang. The children couldnt hold out any longer. They have all gone off to bed.
You are not to say anything to her on the way here. Yes, my lady, said the maid, and hurried off to Green Delights. When she arrived Skybright, who had recently been feeling far from well, was just getting up from a nap and was only half awake but as the order said Come at once, she had to go with the maid as she was, with no time to make herself presentable. However, this did not unduly concern her. Knowing Lady Wangs aversion to people of her type, she would normally have felt some nervousness about having to appear before her. On this occasion she took comfort from the fact that her indisposition over the last few days had caused her to neglect her appearance. Dowdiness would count in her favour. Alas! When she arrived in Xi-fengs room, Lady Wang took one look at this languid vision with its tousled hair, crooked hairpins and rumpled dress and felt all the anger she had just conquered rising up again inside her - particularly when she recognized this as being almost certainly the same girl as the one who had aroused her ire on that previous occasion a month before in the Garden. Good gracious me I she exclaimed sarcastically. What swooning Xi-shi have we here? For whose benefit do you go around in this extraordinary get-up? Dont imagine I dont know what your little game is, young lady! I may not have done anything about you yet, but Ill have the skin off you one of these days! - Is Bao-yu any better? Though shaken by the unexpectedness of this onslaught, Skybright realized at once that someone must have been saying things about her. And although understandably angry, she managed to keep her head. She was too intelligent not to realize that the question about Bao-yu was a trap. She knelt to answer it. I dont often go into Bao-yus room, madam, or see much of him, so I am afraid I am not able to tell you. Its 465 Aroma and Musk who mostly wait on him. They would be able to give Your Ladyship an answer. Little liar! said Lady Wang. Youve got eyes in your head, havent you? Whats the good of employing you if you cant even tell me whether hes well or not? I used to be Her Old Ladyships maid, said Skybright. She selected me for night duty in the outer room at Green Delights because she thought that, going to live in the big, empty Garden he might get frightened at night. I told Her Old Ladyship that I was too stupid to work for Bao-yu, but that only made her angry. She said, Im not asking you to wait on him personally. You dont need to be clever for the job Im asking you to do. So after that I had to go. I dont see him very often. He might call me in once or twice every ten days or so to ask me about something and I just answer him and go back to my work. His meals and all the personal service are looked after either by the older servants and nannies or by Aroma and Musk and Ripple. Whenever Ive got time for it, I still have a lot of Her Old Ladyships sewing to do. Im afraid I dont pay much attention to what Bao-yu is doing. I will do so in future, if Your Ladyship wishes me to. Lady Wang was completely taken in. Please dont trouble yourself, she said hastily. Holy name! Im only too happy to learn that you dont see much of him. So you were given to him by Her Old Ladyship. I suppose in that case I shall have to see her first before I can dismiss you. She turned to Wang Shan-haos wife. When you and the others go into the Garden, I want you to take particular care that this girl is kept well away from Bao-yu. Make sure that she doesnt sleep in the same room. I shall be dealing with her in a few days time, when I have had a chance of speaking about her to Her Old Ladyship. As she turned again momentarily towards Skybright, her voice rose almost into a shout. Get out of here! The sight of you standing there like a young trollop offends my eyes! Who gave you permission anyway to dress yourself up in that garish fashion? Skybright left the room, utterly crushed. She buried her 466 face in her handkerchief as soon as she was outside the door and wept into it every step of the way back to Green Delights. Meanwhile Lady Wang was telling Xi-feng how much she regretted her remissness in having allowed creatures like Skybright to inhabit the Garden for so long undisturbed. I wish I had had the energy to keep a closer watch on things, she said.
Its too early to tell. The fits have still not passed. Jia Zheng sighed but said no more, and they retired for the night. -827 Next day, when Lady Xing came to pay her morning respects to Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang mentioned the marriage proposal and took the opportunity of asking Lady Xing about the Zhang family. Yes, they are relations of ours, divulged Lady Xing. But weve had no contact with them for years now, so Ive no notion what this Miss Zhang is like. Now that you mention it, Yings mother-in-law, Mrs Sun, sent one of her women to call on me a day or two ago, and she men-tioned the Zhangs. She told me they had a daighter and had asked the Suns to look out for a suitable husband for her. Apparently she is an only child and rather delicate. She has had a little education and sounds a quiet, shy sort of girl, used to staying at home. As she is an only child, her father wont contemplate her leaving home. He is afraid the severity of a mother-in-law might be too much of a strain for her and insists on her husband coming to live with them and taking on his share of their family responsibilities. Out of the question! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Bao-yu is difficult enough for us to look after as it is. Can you imagine sending him out to be the head of some strange family? You are absolutely right of course, said Lady Xing. Grandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang. Be sure to tell Zheng when you go home that I say this match is definitely off. Yes Mother. Tell me, the old lady continued, how was Qiao-jie when you went to see her yesterday? Patience gave me the impression earlier on that it was something serious. I should like to go and see her myself. The two ladies thanked Grandmother Jia for the kind thought, but begged her not to trouble herself for Qiao-jies sake . Its not only for her sake. Its the exercise. Id like to stretch my legs a bit, said the old lady. You two have your lunch and then we can all go over together. Lady Wang and Lady Xing went home for lunch. Afterwards they collected Grandmother Jia and escorted her to Xi-fengs apartment. Xi-feng greeted them at the door and conducted them inside. How is she? asked Grandmother Jia. It seems to be an attack of convulsions, Xi-feng informed her. Hadnt you better call the doctor straight away? We already have, Grannie dear. Grandmother Jia went in with Lady Wang and Lady Xing and found Qiao-jie in the arms of her nurse, wrapped in a little padded quilt of pink damask-silk, her face deathly white, her eyebrows and nostrils quivering slightly.After a brief inspection, they withdrew to the outer room, and sat down to talk. Presently a junior maid from Lady Wangs apartment came in with a message for Xi-feng -768 The Master has sent to inquire how Qiao-jie is, Mrs Lian. Tell him we have sent for the doctor, replied Xi-feng, and that I will report as soon as he has made out his prescription. The maids arrival reminded Grandmother Jia of the recently aired marriage proposal. She turned to Lady Wang You ought to go and tell Zheng straight away about that business, dear. If we put a stop to it now, before someone talks to the Zhang family, we will save ourselves the trouble of having to say no to them later. She turned to Lady Xing. Why is it you havent seen much of the Zhangs lately, anyway? As a matter of fact, replied Lady Xing, theyre very mean and not the right sort of family for us at all. It would have been a needless humiliation for Bao-yu. That must be Bao-yus betrothal you are talking about, Mother? said Xi-feng, who had already formed a shrewd idea of what was going on. Why yes, we are actually, said Lady Xing. Grandmother Jia told Xi-feng about the Zhang proposal. Xi-feng laughed I hope youll excuse me, Grannie, Mother, Auntie Wang, for speaking out of turn, but what need is there to go looking for a wife for Bao-yu, when we have a "predestined affinity" here before our very eyes? What do you mean? asked Grandmother Jia, intrigued. Surely, Grannie, you cant have forgotten Baos Magic Jade and Chais Golden Locket? Grandmother Jia laughed. Of course! But why on earth didnt you mention it while Aunt Xue was here yesterday?
Xi-chun nodded. Sutra-copying is one thing I can do with conviction. Leave it there, will you? Would you like some tea? Faithful deposited the little package on the table, and sat down with Xi-chun, while Landscape poured her a cup of tea. Will you be doing some copying too? asked Xi-chun with a smile. Dont tease, Miss! answered Faithful. Three or four years ago I might have, perhaps. But Im so out of practice now. When did you last see me with a brush in my hand? But think of the merit youd acquire. Ive already seen to that, replied Faithful. Every day, after settling Her Old Ladyship down to sleep, Ive been saying Lord Buddhas name and counting my "Buddha Rice". Ive been collecting the rice-grains for more than three years and putting them by for just such an occasion as this, to dedicate them to Buddha and add my contribution, my little act of charity and devotion, to Her Old Ladyships. It sounds as if when Lady Jia becomes Our Lady of Mercy, said Xi-chun, youll have to be her inseparable companion, the Dragon Kings daughter! Oh no, Miss! protested Faithful. Thats too grand for me. It is true though, I could never serve anyone but Her Old Ladyship. I must be bound to her by some karma from a past life. With these words Faithful rose to leave, bidding the younger maid untie the little parcel, and exhibiting its contents to Xi-chun. This roll of plain paper is to be used for the sutra. And while you write, she went on, handing her a bundle of Tibetan incense-sticks, you are to light one of these. Xi-chun nodded, and Faithful returned with the other maid to Grandmother Jias apartment, where she reported on her errand and stood watching the game of backgammon that was in progress between the old lady and Li Wan. Li Wan with her next throw removed several of Grandmother Jias pins to the bar, and Faithful had difficulty in keeping. a straight face. They were presently distracted from their game by the arrival of Bao-yu, carrying in each hand a little bamboo-splint cage containing crickets. I heard you werent sleeping very well, Grannie, he said, so I brought you these to help you relax. Grandmother Jia laughed. You naughty boy! Just because your fathers not at home... When he protested his innocence, Grandmother J ia asked Why arent you at school then? What are you up to with those things anyway? They werent my idea, Grannie, explained Bao-yu. What happened was that a day or two ago Huan and Lan each had a couplet to complete in class, and as Huan got stuck, I whispered something to help him out. When he recited it, the Preceptor was impressed and praised him highly for it. Huan bought me the crickets as a thank-you present. I should like to give them to you. Hasnt that boy been doing any work, for heavens sake! exclaimed Grandmother Jia. Surely he can manage a couplet on his own? If not, then he deserves a good spanking from the Preceptor. It might teach him a thing or two. As for you, have you forgotten the state you got into when your father was at home and asked you for a few lines of verse? Dont you go getting too full of yourself now. What a little rascal that Huan is! To go begging for help, and then look around for a nice present to butter you up with! He certainly seems precocious enough when it comes to cheating - he should be ashamed of himself! Heaven alone knows how hell turn out when he grows up... A ripple of laughter spread through the room. But tell me about young Lan, went on Grandmother Jia. How did he manage? As the youngest, strictly speaking he should have been helped by...... Bao-yu detected the note of sarcasm in her voice and laughed. Oh no! He didnt need any help. He could manage on his own. I dont believe you! said Grandmother Jia. It was you at your tricks again, Ill be bound. Hark at you! A camel among sheep! Just because you re so grown-up now, and so good at your compositions... Bao-yu smiled. No, seriously, Lan managed perfectly well on his own. The Preceptor was very pleased and said he had a brilliant future ahead of him. If you dont believe me, Grannie, send for him and test him yourself. If that is the truth, said Grandmother Jia, then I am overjoyed to hear it..
Her silence only increased Bao-yus own misgivings, and finally in some embarrassment he stood up and said I must be on my way to see Tan. Please dont get up. Give her my regards when you see her, will you? said Dai-yu. I will, he replied, and departed. Dai-yu saw him to the door, then returned to her chair and sat brooding to herself. Bao-yus been so odd recently. He doesnt seem to say what hes thinking. Hes friendly one minute and distant the next. I wonder what it means? Nightingale came in. Have you finished copying for today, Miss? Shall I put your writing things away now? I shant be doing any more, replied Dai-yu. You can clear them away. Dai-yu went into the inner room and lay down on her bed, slowly turning all these things over in her mind. Nightingale came in to ask if she would like some tea. No, thank you. I just want to be alone and lie down for a bit. Very well, Miss. Nightingale went out, to find Snowgoose standing in the doorway, staring oddly in front of her. She went up to her and said Whats the matter with you? Snowgoose was lost in thought, and the question gave her quite a turn. Sh! Dont say a word! Ive heard something very strange. If I tell you, you must promise not to breathe a word to anyone. As she said this Snowgoose shot her lips out in the direction of Dai-yus bedroom, then began walking away, nodding to Nightingale to follow her. They reached the foot of the terrace and she began again in a whisper Have you heard that Bao-yus engaged to be married? Nightingale gave a start. I dont believe you! It cant be true! It is! Nearly everyone knows except us. Who told you? Scribe. His fiance is a prefects daughter. Shes very good-looking and comes from a wealthy family. As Snowgoose was speaking, Nightingale heard Dai-yu cough and thought she could hear her getting up again. Worried that she might come out and overhear them, she took Snowgoose by the hand and motioned to her to be silent. She looked inside, but all seemed quiet. She asked Snowgoose in a low whisper What exactly did Scribe say? Do you remember, replied Snowgoose, a day or two ago you sent me to Miss Tans to thank her for something? Well, she wasnt home, but Scribe was. We started chatting, and one of us happened to mention Master Bao and his naughty ways. Scribe said "When will Master Bao ever grow up? He doesnt take anything seriously. And to think that hes engaged to be married now - and still as silly as ever!" I asked her if the engagement had been settled, and she said that it had and that the go-between was a Mr Wang, a close relation on the Ning-guo side, so the whole thing was a foregone conclusion. Nightingale put her head thoughtfully to one side. How very strange! she thought to herself. Why has no one in the family mentioned it? she asked Snowgoose. Thats Her Old Ladyships idea - so Scribe said. Its in case Bao-yu finds out and is distracted from his studies. She made me promise not to tell a soul, and said she would blame me if word got around. Snowgoose pointed towards the house. Thats why I havent mentioned it in front of her. But today when you asked, I thought I could tell you the truth. As she was speaking there was a loud squawk from the parrot Miss Lins back! Put the kettle on! The two maids had the fright of their lives and turned round expecting to see Dai-yu. But seeing no one, and realizing their mistake, they scolded the bird and went inside. They found Dai-yu at her chair. She was out of breath and had clearly only just sat down. Nightingale asked rather awkwardly if she wanted any tea or water. Where have you two been all this time? asked Dai-yu. No one came when I called. She walked back to the kang and lay down once more facing the wall, telling them to let down the bed-curtains. They did so and left the room, each secretly thinking to herself that she had overheard them, but neither daring to say so. Dai-yu, brooding on her bed, had heard them whispering outside and had crept to the door to eavesdrop. Details of their conversation eluded her but the main substance was clear. She felt as though plunged into a great ocean.
You dont take any notice of what she says, do you? said Nightingale with a smile. All I meant was that with Master Bao away at school all day, and Miss Chai and Caltrop both living out, things must be dull for you. -384 Aroma seized her opportunity Caltrop, did I hear you say? Oh, that poor girl! I feel so sorry for her! This new wife of Mr Pans is a Total Eclipse if ever there was one! Shes even worse than a certain person... Here Aroma held up two fingers, indicating the Second Young Lady of the household - Xi-feng. This Mrs Pan doesnt seem to care a bit what people think. That certain person was bad enough, said Dai-yu. To think that You Er-jie is dead! I know, said Aroma. They were both human beingsafter all. It was only their positions that were different. Why did she have to be so malicious? It hasnt done the family name any good. This was the first time Dai-yu had heard Aroma gossip like this, and she began to suspect what was at the back of it. Its hard to tell, she said. In every family affair, one side or the other has to win. If its not the East Wind its the West. A concubine should know her place, said Aroma. She should be too scared to take advantage of the wife. At this point in the conversation an old womans voice was heard in the outer courtyard. Is this where Miss Lin lives? Which maid is in charge here? Snowgoose went out to see who it was, and vaguely recognized her as one of Aunt Xues serving-women. What do you want? she asked. Im here on an errand for Miss Bao-chai, replied the woman. Something for Miss Lin. Wait here a minute. Snowgoose went in to consult with Dai-yu, who told her to show the old woman in. Once inside the room, she curtseyed to Dai-yu, then screwed up her eyes and peered at her curiously. Not a word of her errand. Dai-yu began to feel rather embarrassed, and asked what it was that Bao-chai had sent over. A pot of honeyed lychees is what Ive been instructed by Miss Bao-chai to bring to you, Miss Lin, replied the old woman, her features relaxing into a smile. Then she spotted Aroma in the room. Why, if it isnt Master Baos maid, Miss Hua! Thats right, nanny dear, replied Aroma. And how did you come to know who I was? Well, looking after Madams room as we do, we hardly ever go out visiting with Madam and Miss Bao-chai, so you wouldnt recognize us. But we remember just about all the young ladies that come round our way. She handed the pot to Snowgoose, took another look at Dai-yu, then turned back to Aroma and said with a confidential smile No wonder our Madam says that Miss Lin and your Master Bao were made for one another! She really does look just like a fairy! Aroma made a valiant attempt to avert any further blunders. Come along, nanny, you must be tired. Why dont you sit down and have a cup of tea? Oh no - were much too busy at home today, the old girl cackled on regardless. Weve everything to prepare for Miss Bao-qins Giving-away. And Ive still two pots of lychees to deliver to Master Bao-yu from Miss Bao-chai. She took her leave and went waddling busily out of the room. Dai-yu, who for Bao-chais sake had tried to disguise her annoyance at the way the old woman had come barging in, called out after her Please thank Miss Bao-chai for her kind present. La-di-da-di-da! the old. girl could still be heard burbling away to herself. Only Bao-yu would have the style to match such a fine lady... Dai-yu pretended not to hear. Really, said Aroma, trying to laugh the whole thing off, when people reach her age they just talk utter nonsense. You dont know whether to scold or laugh. -294 Snowgoose passed the lychees to Dai-yu. I couldnt put them away, would you? They chatted a little longer and. then Aroma left. That evening, when Dai-yu went into her side-room to undress for the night, she caught sight of the lychees again. They reminded her of the old womans visit, and revived the pain she had felt at her tactless gossiping.
His right ankle is rather swollen, but hes taken some medicine and the pain is not so bad now. It doesnt look very serious. Grandmother Jia nodded and sighed. You see? The truth is, I worry too much. He was trying to make out that I dont care about him at all! While she was saying this, Faithful appeared carrying a large cape and hood. Here, put these on, she said. Its getting very late. You dont want to be outside when the dew falls. Arent you afraid of catching cold? I think when youve sat a little longer, you ought to come back home to bed. Just when Im enjoying myself you have to start nagging me to go to bed, said Grandmother Jia. I hope you dont think Im drunk. Ive decided to stay up till dawn. She called rebelliously for more wine, but did put the cape and hood on notwithstanding. The other ladies drank with her for company and did their best to be amusing. Then, silencing them once more, the sound of the flute concealed in the cassia-bushes below came stealing into their ears, this time 511 more plaintive even than before. Indeed, this time the combination of the flutes melancholy with the effects of nocturnal stillness and ghostly moonlight induced a feeling of such overpowering sadness in the listeners that they turned their backs on it and sought, with talk and somewhat forced laughter, to escape it. Fresh wine was called for and the flautist told to stop playing. Ill cheer you up, Lady Jia, said You-shi. Let me tell you a funny story. I learnt it specially for the occasion. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, that would be very nice, a joke. Do tell me, said Grandmother Jia with a jollity that seemed somewhat strained. There were once four brothers, You-shi began. The eldest had only one eye, the second had only one ear, the third had only one nostril, and the fourth, though he had all his parts in order, was dumb. She had got no farther with her story when she became aware that the old ladys head was nodding down upon her bosom and her eyelids drooping as though she was about to go to sleep. She broke off at once, and she and Lady Wang both called gently to her to wake up. Grandmother Jia opened her eyes wide and laughed. Im not sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Go on with your story. Im listening. Its very late, said Lady Wang. The air is cold tonight and there is a lot of dew. Wont you go home and rest now, Mother? We can have another moon-party tomorrow night, if you feel like it. The moon on the sixteenth is still well worth watching. What time is it? Grandmother Jia asked. Past two oclock, said Lady Wang. The children couldnt hold out any longer. They have all gone off to bed. Grandmother Jia looked round the table. Only Tan-chun was still sitting there in the semicircle of empty chairs. Well, said Grandmother Jia, they are not used to staying up late. Considering the amount of weakness and sickliness there is among them, I suppose it is just as well. But theres my little Tan, sitting there all on her own, poor child! You go to bed too, my dear. Well end the party now. 512 She got up herself as she said this, and after taking a sip or two of green tea, climbed into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the Garden by two women, the rest walking beside her or following close behind. But of her and them no more. One of the women who remained behind to clear the table and stack the crockery noticed that a single porcelain cup was missing. After looking everywhere for it unsuccessfully, she appealed to the other servants. I suppose one of you must have dropped it accidentally and thrown it away somewhere. Do please tell us, and let us have the broken pieces, so that when we report the loss we shant be accused of having stolen it. None of us has broken it, said the others. It might have been a maid of one of the young ladles that broke it. If you can think who it might have been, I should go and ask them. You are right, said the woman, suddenly recollecting. I remember Kingfisher coming to fetch a cup for her mistress. I must go and ask her for it. She had not far to look. A short way along the paved path at the bottom of the steps she came upon her and Nightingale walking along together. It was Kingfisher who spoke first. Oh, has Her Old Ladyship ended the party then? I suppose you dont know where my mistress has gone?
Nightingale chimed in, before Ripple could get a word in. Cant you see how theyve been pining for you all day... Pscht! You mean little fibber! cried Ripple, rising perfectly to the bait. Everyone laughed. Bao-yu finally stood up to say goodbye, and Dai-yu saw him to the door. Nightingale stood at the foot of the steps till he was on his way, and then she too went back indoors. When Bao-yu arrived at Green Delights, Aroma emerged from the inner room to greet him. Finished scho6l then? she asked. Oh, Master Baos been back for ages, Ripple answered for him. Hes been at Miss Lins. Did anything happen while I was away? asked Bao-yu. Oh, nothing much, replied Aroma pointedly. Just a lecture from Faithful. Her Ladyship sent her to let us know that this time the Master is in deadly earnest about your studies, and if any of us dares to play the fool with you again, well be dealt with like Skybright and Chess. She sighed. We do our very best to serve you, and thats all the thanks we get. Its all so pointless. Her evident distress brought a swift reply from Bao-yu. My poor Aroma! Youve no need to worry. So long as I work hard, none of you need ever hear another word from Mother. Im going to do some work this evening, as the Preceptor wants me to do some exposition tomorrow. If theres anything I need, Musk and Ripple can get it for me, so you go and have a rest. If only you would work hard, said Aroma, it would be a joy to serve you. Inspired by her words, Bao-yu bolted his supper, had his reading-lamp lit and sat down straight away to revise his basic texts, the Four Books of Confucian Scripture. One glance at the first page, however, with its columns of heavily annotated text, and he began to experience a familiar sinking feeling. He tried flicking through one volume, and the general drift seemed clear enough but the moment he went into it in any detail, it seemed to slip from his grasp. He turned for help to the marginal commentaries, he read the expository essays, keeping up the struggle till late in the evening. Poems are easy, he thought to himself. But I cant make head or tail of this stuff. He sat back, gazed at the ceiling and was soon lost in a daydream. Bedtime, said Aroma firmly. Youve done quite enough work for this evening. Bao-yu gave an inaudible reply. Musk and Aroma helped him into bed, and then went to sleep themselves. During the night, they woke to hear him tossing and turning on the kang. Are you still awake? said Aroma. You must stop fretting and have a good nights sleep. You can work hard again tomorrow. I know, replied Bao-yu. But I just cant get to sleep. Come and take off one of my covers. Its a cold night. Youd better keep it on. I feel so restless! He threw back the top cover himself. Aroma immediately clambered over to tuck it in again, and put her hand to his brow. It felt slightly feverish. Lie still! she said. Youve a fever. I know. Whats the matter? Its nothing. Im just nervous, thats all. Please dont make a thing of it. If Father finds out, hes bound to say Im cooking up an excuse to miss school. It would seem too much of a coincidence. Ill feel better in the morning, and once Im at school itll go away. Aroma gave in. Ill sleep here by your side, she said. She massaged his back a little and in no time they were both fast asleep. When they woke next morning the sun was already high in the sky. Help! cried Bao-yu. Im late! He quickly washed and combed his hair, completed his round of m6rhing duties and set off for school. The Preceptors severe expression as he walked into the schoolroom did not bode well. Tardy, boy, tardy! What is the meaning of this? Small wonder that you have incurred your fathers displeasure and caused him to call you his prodigal son, if this is the way you think you can behave on your second day. Bao-yu told him of his fever the night before, then crossed over to his desk and sat down to his work. It was late in the afternoon when he was called forward. Bao-yu, step up here. Oral Exposition of this text. -640 Bao-yu walked up.
For a little moment it seemed that the invisible would become visible but murky vapours rose up suddenly between us and we were cut off. Clouds and mists drifted and drew together, Rain and fog veiled the heavens light Then rolling back, revealed the high stars -587 And earth all radiant in the noon of night. -880 My mind is in a turmoil, uncertain whether I wake or dream. I gaze at the sky with sighs of disappointmnent I wait in 581 uncertainty with weeping eyes. My speech grows silent only the music of the wind in the grove of bamboos is to be beard, and the wing-beats of birds as they fly off startled, and the plopping sounds of fish as they nibble at the surface of the water. -1536 Blest Spirit, may my lament go up to thee may my rite be acceptable to thee. -1536 Wuhu aizai! Receive this offering! -5947 When he had finished reading, he made a little flame with the burner and set fire to the silk. Then he poured the tea out on the ground as a libation, scattered the flowers, and emptied the water out of the vase. He continued to linger there after he had finished, as though unable to tear himself away, and the little maid had to remind him several times that they ought to be getting back. He had just started to go when a laughing voice called out Stop a minute! and the maid, turning to look behind her, saw with terror that a female form was stepping out of the bushes. Help! she cried. Its a ghost! Skybrights spirit really has come back! Bao-yu looked back too. But whether or not it was a ghost he saw will be revealed in the following chapter. CHAPTER 79 Xue Pan finds to his sorrow that he is married to a termagant And Ying-chuns parents betroth her to a Zhong-shan wolf At the end of the last chapter our story had reached a point at which, just as Bao-yu and the little maid were beginning to walk away after completing the sacrifice to Skybright, they were startled by the sound of a human voice coming from the direction of the flowering hibiscus bushes. When Bao-yu looked, he saw that the person who had called out was Dai-yu. She advanced towards him smiling. A highly original elegy! It deserves to have a permanent place in literature alongside the Elegy for the Shamans Daughter by Han-dan Chun! Bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly. Most elegies one sees are so stale and derivative, I thought Id try my hand at writing something a bit different. It was only for my own amusement I hadnt intended that anyone else should hear it. Perhaps now that you have heard it, you will let me know of any glaring errors you may have noticed and help me to correct them. Where is the original text? said Dai-yu. I should need to have a careful look at the text first before venturing on any criticism. It was such a long piece, I could barely make out what most of it was about. There were a couple of lines somewhere near the middle that caught my attention The young man in his crimson-curtained bed must seem most cruelly afflicted And the maiden beneath the yellow earth must seem most cruelly ill-fated. The general sentiment is all right, but I thought crimson- 583 curtained bed a trifle shop-worn. I dont see why you used that image when there is a much better one to hand. Oh, whats that? said Bao-yu. Weve all got this rose-coloured haze diaphene in our windows, said Dai-yu. Instead of the young man in his crimson-curtained bed, why not say the young man at his rosy-misted casement? Bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly. Excellent! How clever of you to have thought of it! It only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look. Stupid people like me fail to think of the obvious. Actually though, I havent got that sort of gauze in my windows so though rosy-misted casement is a great improvement, I dont think I had better use it. It would be fine for you to use it, but I think if I did it would be a bit presumptuous. But why? said Dai-yu, smiling. My window is your window. It is unfriendly to be so punctilious. Look at the ancients who used to lend furs and horses and feel no resentment when they came back the worse for wear. And that was to mere acquaintances we two are members of the same family. I agree with you that one ought to share with ones friends, said Bao-yu, and not only furs and horses, but even more precious things if one has them.
I know what, said Bao-yu. Ive got a still better solution. Why dont we just say I by my rosy-misted casement seem most cruelly afflicted And you beneath the yellow earth seem most cruelly ill-fated? Dai-yu momentarily changed colour yet though the words filled her with an almost unbearable feeling of premonitory dread, she masked it with a smile and nodded approvingly at his suggestion. Yes, thats a great improvement. Better not tamper with the words any more or you will spoil them. You ought in any case to be getting back now. Im sure you must have more important things to attend to. When I saw your mother just now, she was briefing someone to tell you that you are to go to your Aunt Xings place first thing tomorrow morning. It seems that your Cousin Yings betrothal has been decided on. I expect they want you there for the ceremony. Whats the hurry? said Bao-yu, a trifle pettishly. Ive not been feeling particularly well lately. I may not be well enough to go there tomorrow. How typical! said Dai-yu. I should try to grow out of these childish ways if I were you. You are getting too old- She broke off in a fit of coughing. Bao-yu at once became concerned about her. Theres a nasty wind here. I dont know why we are standing around in the cold like this. Wed better be getting back now. Theres no sense in making ourselves ill. I ought to be going back now in any case, said Dai-yu. Its time I went to bed. Well see each other again tomorrow. She began to walk away. Bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction. Suddenly it occurred to him that 585 Dai-yu was unaccompanied and he told the little maid to run after her and see her back to her apartment. Back at Green Delights he found some old women with a message from his mother. It was as Dai-yu had said. He was to go over first thing next morning to his Uncle Shes house. The family that Jia She was proposing to marry his daughter into was called Sun. They were a Da-tong family whose menfolk had all, for several generations, been Army officers. A former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the Ning and Rong brothers, so their claim to a special relationship with the Jia family was a strong One. Only one member of the family was at present living in the capital, a young man called Sun Shao-zu who had been given the post of Military Provost in the metropolitan garrison as an hereditary entitlement. He was a tall, powerfully-built, impressive-looking young man he drew a good bow, had a good seat on a horse, and knew how to bear himself well in company and please those whom it was important to please. Still under thirty and with his familys not inconsiderable wealth behind him, he had excellent prospects. Already the War Department had marked him out for promotion. And he was unmarried. From every point of view - the special relationship between their two houses, the Sun familys wealth, and the personality of the young man himself - Jia She regarded this as being the almost perfect match and informed Grandmother Jia of his choice. Grandmother Jia by no means shared his enthusiasm however, after reflecting that the couplings of young people are to a large extent fated and that, as Jia She was after all the girls father, it was not really for her to interfere, she made some neutral response such as I see or Oh, are you? and left it at that. Jia Zheng felt a much more positive antipathy to the match. He detested the Suns. Though the connection between the two families was a long-standing one, it had come about because Sun Shao-zus grandfather, who had been the worst possible sort of social climber, had wormed his way into the patronage of Jia Zhengs grandfather and great-uncle for the 586 sole purpose of concluding some dubious business that he could not have brought off on his own. In Jia Zhengs view they lacked both education and breeding. He spoke to Jia She on two separate occasions advising him very strongly against the match but as Jia She refused to take the slightest bit of notice, there was nothing much he could do. Bao-yu had never met Sun Shao-zu before. Obliged to do so at his uncles place next day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of, he was appalled, in the course of conversation, to discover just how soon the marriage was to be it seemed that Ying-chun would be going to her husbands house before the end of that year. When some time later Lady Ying came over to tell Grandmother Jia that she now wanted to move Ying-chun out of the Garden for good, he became even more depressed.
Surely you must know? Every single thing my daughter-in-law does is aimed at provoking Bao-chai. She wont leave her alone. The other day, when you sent someone round to see me, we were in the middle of one of our scenes! That must have been the day I heard you had a little bit of a liver upset, said Grandmother Jia tactfully. I was going to send someone over to see how you were, but then I heard that you were feeling better so I thought no more about it. You should take my advice, dear, and stop worrying. Theyre a newly married couple and you must give them time to settle down. And youre so lucky to have Chai. She is such a gentle, unflappable girl. She may be young, but my word, she has the aplomb of someone twice her age! When my maid came back and told us what had happened that day and the way she coped with it, we were all singing her praises. Such a wonderful disposition! Shes a girl in a million. When she gets married, if you dont mind my saying so, her mother-in-law will take her to her bosom and the whole household will be devoted to her, I am certain of it. Earlier, Bao-yu had found the general tenor of the conversation rather distasteful, and was just saying something about having to leave when his grandmother embarked upon this eulogy of Bao-chai, and he found himself listening with rapt attention. Whats the use? said Aunt Xue. Whatever her qualities, she is still only a daughter. With a son as hopeless -as Pan, I can have no peace I never stop worrying in case he has gone off to one of his haunts, had too much to drink again and landed himself in another brawl. In fact the only time I ever feel at all reassured is when hes over here with his cousins Zhen and Lian. At this, Bao-yu chirped up Theres really nothing to fear, Auntie. I can vouch for Cousin Pans friends. They are all serious businessmen and far too respectable to get into trouble. In that case, said Aunt Xue with a smile, perhaps I shouldnt worry. Supper was over by now, and Bao-yu excused himself, saying he still had some preparation to do that evening. The maids were serving tea, when Amber came into the room and whispered something in Grandmother Jias ear. She turned to Xi-feng Youd better go quickly, my dear. Its Qiao-jie. Xi-feng had no idea what the matter could be and the others were as puzzled as she was. Patience sent one of the younger maids round with a message for you, Mrs Lian, explained Amber, crossing over to where Xi-feng sat. Miss Qiao-jie does not seem at all well and would you please go over as soon as possible. Youd better go straight away, said Grandmother Jia. You dont have to stand on ceremony for your Aunt Xue. Yes Grannie, said Xi-feng, and she took her leave of Aunt Xue. As she was on her way out she heard Lady Wang say You go ahead. Ill be along shortly. Tell the maids to be quiet and not to make a lot of fuss. Little ones get so easily unsettled. And make sure that kitten and puppy are kept well out of the way. Poor child! I suppose little upsets are to be expected in a family as greatly blessed as ours. Xi-feng promised Lady Wang to carry out her instructions and left with her maid. After her departure, Aunt Xue went on to inquire after Dai-yus health. Miss Lin is all right, replied Grandmother Jia. She just takes everything too seriously. Thats what is undermining her health, if you ask me. She may ie as clever as Bao-chai, but she lacks your daughters easy way with people. Chai is so responsible and considerate. The conversation continued a little longer, and then Aunt Xue said she must be going. Ill leave you in peace now. Id better see how Chai and Caltrop are getting on at home. Ill go along with Aunt Wang and have a look at Qiao-jie on my way. What a good idea, said Grandmother Jia. With your experience you will be able to give them some helpful advice, Im sure. Aunt Xue took her leave and went with Aunt Wang to Xi-fengs apartment. To return to Jia Zheng he had been pleasantly surprised by Bao-yus performance that evening, and mentioned it later in the course of conversation with his literary friends in the outer study. A newcomer among them, an excellent Go-player by the name of Wang Er-tiao also called Go-between Wang, remarked I think we have all noticed a marked progress in Master Bao, sir.
He felt a little self-conscious however, and thought to himself What if someone sees the and makes fun of me He read them through again. Oh who cares! I will put them up. I can read them anyway, to cheer myself up. A final reading made him change his mind yet again, however, and he slipped them between the pages of a bo6k. Im old enough for us to be married now, he mused to himself. But who could have foreseen this family crisis, and who knows when it will ever end? What an ordeal for a gentle girl like Xiu-yan! How lonely and wretched she must feel! At that moment the door was pushed open and Moonbeam came in carrying a round covered-tray and a jug of wine, which she deposited with a simpering smile on the table. He rose and asked her to be seated. Still smiling she said Four plates of sweetmeats and a small jug of wine, with Mrs Pans compliments, Master Ke. Its most kind of her, replied Ke, but surely she could have sent one of the younger maids? She didnt need to bother you, Miss Moonbeam. Oh Master Ke, theres no need to be so polite. Its all in the family after all... Mrs Pan knows what trouble youve been put to on account of Mr Pan, and shes been meaning for a long time to thank you herself but was afraid the others might take it the wrong way. In this household, as I think you know, sir, theres a lot goes on beneath the surface. People are only waiting to pounce on a little thing like a present, and then they start inventing all kinds of stories. Thats why shes been ever so slightly discreet and asked me to come over personally with these few things today when no one was looking... She gave Xue Ke a saucy smile and continued And please, no more of that Miss Moonbeam - it makes me feel most uncomfortable. We are only here to serve, and if we can serve Mr Pan, then why not you as well? Xue Ke was young and had a trusting nature. It was odd that Pans womenfolk should suddenly start treating him like this but Moonbeams explanation was a plausible one, he reflected. You can leave the sweetmeats, he said. "But take the wine back with you. Ive never been much of a drinker. Occasionally if pushed to it I can manage a cup, but usually I dont drink at all. Surely you and Mrs Pan knew that? Ask anything else of me! pleaded Moonbeam. But I wouldnt dare take it back - you know Mrs Pans temper. If I tell her you dont drink, shell never believe me shell say-Ive failed in my duty. Reluctantly Xue Ke allowed her to leave the wine too. Moonbeam began to leave, but on reaching the doorway she took a quick look outside and glanced back at Xue Ke with a smile. Pointing in the direction of Xia Jin-guis apartment she said I think she might even come over herself to thank you for all youve done... Xue Ke was not sure how to take this, and began to feel rather nervous. Please convey my thanks to Mrs Pan will you? The weather is cold, and she must be careful not to catch a chill. Besides she is my cousin s wife and there 5 no need for her to go to such lengths. Moonbeam said nothing but tittered and went on her way. At first Xue Ke had been prepared to accept the offering as a genuine expression of gratitude on Jin-guls part. But now Moonbeams suggestive behaviour had aroused his suspicions, and he began to think there was something fishy going on. But surely Jin-gui would never think of such a thing? he argued with himself. She is my sister-in-law. Perhaps its Moonbeam up to no good. She cant very well act on her own initiative. Maybe she is using Jin-gui as a cover. . . But then shes Pans chamber-wife so thats hardly very... Suddenly it occurred to him Of course! Jin-guis no lady! Sometimes when shes in the mood, she gets herself up like a regular harlot - she obviously fancies herself as some sort of man-killer! Another possibility is that shes fallen out with Bao-qin and this is a plot to disgrace me and drag the family name in the mud... Xue Ke could not help finding all this rather daunting, and was racking his brains for some means of dealing with the situation, when to his great alarm he heard a splutter of laughter outside the window. But to discover who was laughing, you must turn to the next chapter. CHAPTER 91 In the pursuance of lust, Moonbeam evolves an artful strata gem In a flight of Zen, Bao-yu makes an enigmatic confession We saw in our last chapter how Xue Ke was startled from his troubled reflections by a sudden splutter of laughter from outside his window.
What a lot of fuss over a bit of fruit! exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Its really not that important. I take your word for it. At this moment Bao Er came into the room and kotowed to Cousin Zhen. This Bao Er, it may be remembered, was the servant who had in the past been useful to both Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. On this occasion he had come over for the day to assist Cousin Zhen. I beg to be released, sir, he said, and put back on external duties. What is the meaning of this? asked Cousin Zhen, addressing Bao Er and Zhou Rui simultaneously. Whats the point of my being here if no one listens to my opinion? replied Bao Er. Who asked for your opinion? said Cousin Zhen brusquely. Im tired of spying for other people! muttered Bao Er to himself. Sir, put in Zhou Rui promptly, I have been in charge of farm rents and income here for years, and on average I should say around four hundred thousand taels worth passes through my hands each year, and I have never had a word of complaint from the Master or their Ladyships or the young mistresses about anything, let alone such a small matter as this. According to him, we are supposed to have made off with the familys entire property and estates! It looks as if Bao Er has started some sort of quarrel, thought Cousin Zhen to himself. Better get rid of him. Out of my sight! he barked. Then turning from Bao Er to Zhou Rui That is all. Carry on with your work. The two servants left. Not long afterwards Cousin Zhen was resting in the study when he heard the most terrific din break out in the direction of the main gate. He sent a servant to inquire, who came back to report that a fight had started between Bao Er and an adopted son of Zhou Ruis. Who is this adopted son? asked Cousin Zhen. He San is his name, sir, replied the servant. A worthless fellow who spends most of his time drinking and causing trouble. He sometimes comes round here and hangs about in the porters lodge. Apparently he got involved in the argument between Bao Er and Zhou Rui. This is the limit! exclaimed Cousin Zhen. Have Bao Er and this He San character bound immediately! What about Zhou Rui? He disappeared when the fighting started, sir. Find him at once! This is preposterous! Yes, sir! In the midst of this commotion, Jia Lian returned and Cousin Zhen told him what had happened in his absence. What next! cried Lian. He sent an extra servant to help apprehend Zhou Rui, who soon realized that escape was impossible, gave himself up and was led before the masters. Tie him up as well! ordered Cousin Zhen, and Jia Lian added, addressing himself principally to Zhou Rui Mr Zhen settled your petty differences once and for all. Why go out and start fighting all over again? And as if that wasnt bad enough, you have to drag in this brat of yours, He San! And when you should have been bringing them to heel, you disappear and leave them to it! He dealt Zhou Rui a few hefty kicks. Its no good punishing only him, said Cousin Zhen grimly, and ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each and send them packing. This done, he and Jia Lian sat down to discuss family business. In the servants quarters this incident became the subject of many a private exchange of opinions. Some saw it as an attempt on Cousin Zhens part to cover up for incompetence others said he was just inept at handling people while others saw it as yet another instance of his unpleasant character. Wasnt it he who recommended Bao Er to Mr Lian in that sordid business with the You sisters? Whats probably happened is that Bao Ers wife wont oblige Mr Zhen as she did Mr Lian, so now hes taken it out on the husband... There were many differing interpretations. Meanwhile the Jia clan lost no time in turning Jia Zhengs promotion at the Ministry of Works to their financial advantage. Jia Yun was certainly not going to be left out, but went around promising work to contractors and negotiating percentages for himself, and having bought a quantity of fashionable embroideries, made his way to the apartment of his erstwhile patroness. Xi-feng, who had just learnt from one of her maids that Mr Zhen and Mr Lian were in a temper and beating the servants, was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw Jia Lian himself walk in, and was able to hear the full story from him.
We need have no fears, said Jia She, resuming the previous topic of conversation. Nothing can happen to us. Of course not, sir, said Feng, with Her Grace to protect your interests at Court, with such enviable connections and such a host of relations, and with a family that from Lady Jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record... Granted, said Jia Zheng somewhat grimly. But our respectability is more than balanced by our lack of ability and positive achievement. We are living on borrowed time, and one day it will run out. Do lets put an end to this depressing conversation, said Jia She, and have another drink. They did so, and after a few more rounds dinner was served. After dinner, tea was brought in and Fengs page came in and murmured something in his masters ear. Feng took his leave. What was that you said? asked Jia She of the page. Its snowing, sir, and theyve sounded the first evening watch. Jia Zheng sent a servant out who came back to report that the snow was indeed already more than an inch thick on the ground. I hope your two curios are well wrapped? said Jia Zheng. They are, replied Feng. Dont forget, if you change your minds, Im sure we can come to some agreement about the price. Ill bear it in mind, said Jia Zheng. I shall wait to hear from you then. Its cold - please dont bother to see me out. Goodbye. Jia She and Jia Zheng instructed Jia Lian to accompany Feng Zi-ying to the gate. For the sequel, please read the following chapter. CHAPTER 93 A Zhen retainer seeks shelter in the Jia household And shady activities are revealed behind the Iron Threshold When Feng Zi-ying had gone, Jia Zheng sent for one of the men on the gate. I see theres an invitation here from the Earl of Lin-an, he said. Do you know what sort of an occasion it is? I did inquire, sir, replied the servant. Its only the arrival of a new company of actors at the Prince of Nan-ans. They are said to be first-class, and his lordship wants to celebrate by putting on a dramatic entertainment for a couple of days. Just an informal party for friends, nothing requiring a presentation I should say, sir. As the servant was speaking Jia She came over. Will you be going tomorrow? he asked his brother. I really ought to, replied Jia Zheng. The Earl has always been most affable. Another servant came in from the gate and reported to Jia Zheng Theres a clerk from the Ministry, sir will you please go in to the office tomorrow. The President has some important business for you, so could you be there a little earlier than usual. This received a brief acknowledgement. from Jia Zheng. Two family servants came in next, wh6se job it was to collect the land rents from the Rong-guo country estates. They paid their respects, made their kotow and stood humbly to one side. Are you from Hao-family village? asked Jia Zheng. Yes, sir. Jia Zheng did not inquire any further into their business. He and Jia She talked a little longer and then both left for their apartments, Jia She accompanied by servants bearing lanterns. When they had gone, Jia Lian asked the rent-collectors for their report. Weve been as fast as we could with the tenth-month rents, sir, replied one of them. They were due to arrive tomorrow, but we ran into trouble a few miles from town. Our wagons were seized by a patrol and everything was tipped out onto the ground. They didnt let us get a word in. I tried to explain that it was rent-produce for Rong-guo House, not ordinary goods in transit, but they couldnt have cared less. And when I told our wagoner to keep on going, some of the highway-patrol beat him up and impounded two wagons. Ive come on ahead to report, sir. The only thing now is for you to send someone to the local yamen and demand our goods back. And youd be doing everyone a good turn, if you had those hooligans in the highway-patrol brought to order. You may not know it, but the regular goods-wagons have an even worse time with them. They tip out the contents and make off with them, and if the poor old wagoner dares to open his mouth in protest, he has his brains beaten out. What a preposterous state of affairs! exclaimed Jia Lian. He wrote a note at once and handed it to one of his men. Take this to the yamen responsible for impounding the wagons.
Place the Qin on the table before you, and sit with your chest opposite the fifth fret. Raise both hands slowly and gracefully. You are now ready, in body and mind, to begin. You must while playing observe carefully the dynamic markings - piano, forte , allegro, adagio - and maintain a relaxed but serious manner at all times. Goodness me! cried Bao-yu. I was thinking we could do it for fun! If its as complicated as that, Im not sure Id be up to it! While they were talking Nightingale came in, and on seeing Bao-yu in the room, inquired with a smile To what are we to attribute this joyful event, Master Bao? Cousin Dai has just been teaching me about the Qin. Its as though scales had fallen from my eyes! I could go on listening for ever! I didnt mean that, said Nightingale. What I meant was, its so rarely that we see you at all nowadays, I wondered if something out of the ordinary had happened to bring you here today? I suppose it must seem like that, replied Bao-yu. But the only reason Ive not been round more often is that I know Cousin Dai has not been well, and thought it best not to trouble her. And then Ive been having to go to school... Well, interrupted Nightingale, Miss Lin has only just started to feel better, so dont you think you should let her rest now, and not wear her out giving you lessons? Why yes! How thoughtless of me! he exclaimed with a laugh. I was so absorbed in what she was Saying, that it never entered my head she might be tiring herself. I wasnt, said Dai-yu, smiling. Talking about music doesnt tire one, on the contrary, it raises ones spirits. I only wonder if what I was saying wasnt beyond you... It doesnt matter, said Bao-yu. Im sure if we take it slowly Ill be able to understand. He stood up. But seriously, I think I should leave you in peace now. Tomorrow Ill ask Tan and Xi if theyll come over with me. You three can learn together. I think Ill just sit in. .. Why, you lazy thing! laughed Dai-yu. Imagine if we three did learn to play, and you were as ignorant as ever wouldnt we then be casting our She felt she was allowing herself to become too intimate, and suddenly stopped short. Bao-yu only laughed Id be happy just to hear you play. Id do anything for that - even be your swine! Dai-yu blushed, but laughed nonetheless. Nightingale and Snowgoose laughed too. Bao-yu took his leave, and had reached the door, when Ripple appeared, followed by a junior maid bearing a small pot of orchid-plants. Her Ladyship has been given four pots of these orchids, said Ripple, and she thought that, as she was so busy at the palace and wouldnt have time to appreciate them, she would give one to you, Master Bao, and one to you, Miss Lin. Dai-yu looked at the orchids. Among them were some of the double-headed kind, and looking at these, she had a strange sensation that they meant something. Whether it was joy or sorrow that they portended, she could not tell. But it was something of importance. She stood staring at them, lost in thought. Bao-yus mind, by contrast, was still full of vibratos and glissandos, and as he left he said gaily Now that you have these orchids, coz, youll be able to compose your own Lonely Qrchid Pavan. And Im sure it will be just as good as the one Confucius wrote! Dai-yus heart was too troubled to respond to this parting jest. She walked indoors, and staring once more at her orchids, thought to herself Flowers have their spring-time, a time for fresh blossoms and young leaves. I am young, but frail as the willow that dreads the first breath of autumn... If all turns out for the best, I may grow stronger yet. But if not, my fate will be like that of the fallen petals at springs end, driven by the rain and tossed in the wind These sombre reflections brought tears to her eyes. Nightingale was puzzled to see her cry. Just now, she thought to herself, when Master Bao was here, they were both in such high spirits and now look at her! And all shes done is look at those flowers! She was still trying in vain to think of some consolation to offer, when one of Bao-chais serving-women came into the room.
The first Qin Handbook I found only had the names of the Airs, it didnt have the words and music. But now Ive found another with the Airs written out in full. Its so interesting! Of course, I realize that I shall never be able to do justice to the score. To think what the great Master Musicians of the past could do - like Master Kuang, whose playing could summon wind and thunder, dragon and phoenix! And to think that Confucius could tell from his Music Master Xiangs first notes that he was listening to a musical portrait of King Wen! To play a Rhapsody of Hills and Streams and share its inner meaning with a fellow music-lover... Dai-yu fluttered her eyelids and slowly bowed her head. Bao-yu was completely carried away Oh coz! How wonderful it all sounds! But Im afraid I still dont understand these peculiar characters. Please teach me how to read some of them. I dont need to teach you. Its easy. But Im such a fool! Please help me! Take that one there - all I can make 6ut is Hook, with Big on top and Five in the middle. Dai-yu laughed at him. The Big and Nine on top mean you stop the string with the thumb of your left hand at the ninth fret. The Hook and Five mean you hook the middle finger of your right hand slightly and pull the fifth string towards you. So you see, its not what we would call a character, its more a cluster of signs telling you what the next note is and how to play it. Its very easy. Then there are signs for all the graces - the narrow and the wide vibrato, the rising and the falling glissando, the mordent,, the tremulo, the falling glissando with open-string drone... Bao-yu was beside himself with joy. As you understand it so perfectly, coz, why dont we start studying the Qin together? The essence of the Qin, replied Dai-yu, is restraint. It was created in ancient times to help man purify himself and lead a gentle and sober life, to quell all wayward passions and to curb every riotous impulse. If you wish to play, then you must first -2214 seek out a quiet chamber, a studio with distant view, or upper room or some secluded nook mong rocks and trees, on craggy mountain-top, by waters edge... -1344 Let the weather be clear and calm, a gentle breeze, a moonlit night. Light some incense, and sit in silent meditation. Empty the mind of outward thoughts. Poise Breath and Blood in Perfect Harmony. Your Soul may now commune with the Divine, and enter into that mysterious Union with the Way. As the ancients said, true music-lovers have always been few. If there is no one able to share your musics true delight, then sit alone, and -1494 serenade the breeze and moonlight, hymn the ancient pines and weather-worn rocks let wild monkeys and venerable cranes hear your song, rather than the vulgar mob, whose dull ears would only sully the precious virtue of the Qin. So much for the setting. The next two essentials are finger-technique and touch. And before you think of playing, be sure to dress in a suitable style - preferably in a swansdown cape or other antique robe. Assume the dignified manner of the ancients, a manner in keeping with the chosen instrument of the sages. Wash your hands. Light the incense. Sit on the edge of your couch. Place the Qin on the table before you, and sit with your chest opposite the fifth fret. Raise both hands slowly and gracefully. You are now ready, in body and mind, to begin. You must while playing observe carefully the dynamic markings - piano, forte , allegro, adagio - and maintain a relaxed but serious manner at all times. Goodness me! cried Bao-yu. I was thinking we could do it for fun! If its as complicated as that, Im not sure Id be up to it! While they were talking Nightingale came in, and on seeing Bao-yu in the room, inquired with a smile To what are we to attribute this joyful event, Master Bao? Cousin Dai has just been teaching me about the Qin. Its as though scales had fallen from my eyes! I could go on listening for ever! I didnt mean that, said Nightingale. What I meant was, its so rarely that we see you at all nowadays, I wondered if something out of the ordinary had happened to bring you here today? I suppose it must seem like that, replied Bao-yu. But the only reason Ive not been round more often is that I know Cousin Dai has not been well, and thought it best not to trouble her.
Now I understand that look of calm indifference on her face when she was caught during the search of the Garden. What a determined young thing she must have been at heart. I dont really have time to meddle in such things, but your story has touched my heart! Tell her mother that I will speak to Mr Lian and send Brightie to sort the thing out for her. Xi-feng sent the woman on her way and herself departed to join the gathering at Grandmother Jias. -347 One day, Jia Zheng was engrossed in a game of Go with one of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang. It had been quite a level game, and the outcome now hung on a ko that was in progress on one corner of the board. As they were playing, a page from the gate came in to report that Mr Feng had arrived and was waiting outside to see Sir Zheng. See him in, instructed Jia Zheng. The page did as bidden and Feng Zi-ying was shortly to be observed walking in through the inner gateway. Jia Zheng hurried out to receive him and conducted him through to the study. As he sat down, Feng noticed that they were playing Go. Please carry on with your game, he said. I shall be very happy to watch. My poor play is hardly a worthy spectacle for so distinguished an observer, protested Zhan Guang with an obsequious smile. You are too modest, said Feng. Carry on please. What brings you here today? inquired Jia Zheng. Oh, nothing of any importance, replied Feng. Carry on, sir. I shall benefit greatly from watching your play. Jia Zheng turned to his partner. As Feng is an old friend and has not come on any pressing business, we may as well finish our game first. He can sit and watch. Are you playing for stakes? asked Feng. We are, replied Zhan Guang. Then silence! On with the game! I dont think we need be too strict about that, said Jia Zheng. I may be a dozen taels up by the end, but I doubt very much if I shall see the colour of my money. I think friend Zhan will have to stand us a few drinks instead. An excellent idea, said Zhan with a laugh. Are you and friend Zhan on a par, sir? inquired Feng. Jia Zheng laughed. We used to play level, but he always lost, so I gave him a handicap of two. He still loses. And the trouble is, he thinks he can take his moves back all the time, and gets quite upset when I wave the rules at him. Zhan laughed. You exaggerate, Sir Zheng... Well, we shall see... On this note of light-hearted banter, they continued their game. When it was finished and they counted up the pieces, Zhan was seven down. It all depended on that last ko, commented Feng. You gained the advantage, sir, because you were less vulnerable to a ko threat. Jia Zheng turned to Feng. Please forgive us. How are you keeping? It has been a long while since we last met, said Feng. My visit today is partly of a social nature, and partly occasioned by the presence in the capital of a deputy-prefect from Kwangsi province, who is here for an audience with His Majesty and has brought with him four curios, some of them imported, that would make excellent palace-offerings. The first is a folding screen of twenty-four panels, carved of pure blackwood. Though the stone used for the carved inlay - landscapes, figures, buildings, birds and flowers - is not jade, it is a high quality serpentine. Each panel has a palace scene, with fifty or sixty palace-ladies. It is called "Spring Morning in the Han Palace". The features, gestures and costumes are rendered with great clarity. The finish is quite exquisite, the detail and composition of the highest order. It would be perfect for the main hall of Prospect Garden, sir. The second item is a large wall-clock over three feet high. This is a most unusual item. It has a little figure of a boy on the face that indicates the hour with a pointer, and inside it has a little mechanical orchestra. Those two heavier articles I was not able to bring with me. I have however brought the other two, which I think you will find quite fascinating. Feng produced an embroidered casket wrapped in several layers of white damask-silk. Unwrapping it, he raised the lid, removed the protective pad of silk-wool beneath it and displayed its contents. In the top compartment of the casket lay a little glass container with a fitted lid. In this container, on a piece of crimson silk that lined its inner casing of gold, lay a magnificent lustrous pearl, as large as a longan.
But what heinous crime is Skybright supposed to have committed? said Bao-yu. Maybe she isnt, said Aroma. Maybe Her Ladyship just thinks she is too good-looking. She probably thinks that anyone who is so good4ooking must be unreliable. She knows these very beautiful young women are often trouble-makers. Probably she dislikes Skybright just for being beautiful. Its better to be a plain, gawky person like me! Who said that beautiful women are trouble-makers? said Bao-yu. There have always been lots and lots of beautiful women who were nothing of the kind. But never mind all that. What I cant understand is, how did Mother get to hear about all those private jokes of ours? No one outside could have told her. Its very, very strange. -1014 Look how careless you are, said Aroma. Once you get a bit excited you are capable of saying anything, regardless of who else is around. Many and manys the time I have given you a look or made some sign to warn you, but you never notice. Maybe, said Bao-yu, but tell me this. How is it that shed heard something damaging about every single person in this apartment except you and Musk and Ripple? Somewhat taken aback by this question, Aroma hung her head and pondered it for some moments, but she was unable to think of an explanation. She laughed embarrassedly. -1014 I agree, it is rather strange. We three must often have made 539 -1536 careless remarks that could have been used against us. I wonder why Her Ladyship didnt mention any? Perhaps shell come back and deal with us three later. You? said Bao-yu, laughing incredulously. The famous paragon of all the virtues? Theres little danger of her finding fault with you. Or with those other two, whom you trained and moulded in your own Image. Parfumee I can understand -1536 she is young and precocious and inclined to use her intelligence for putting other people down, so its hardly surprising that she should be disliked. Number Fours unpopularity I blame myself for. It dates from that time when you and I had quarrelled about something and I allowed her to wait on me in your place. The others must have resented my giving her special treatment, and that, ultimately, must be the reason for what has happened to her today. But why Skybright? You and she started together with my grandmother when you were little girls. Its true she is a bit better-looking than the rest of you, but she has never taken advantage of that fact no one has ever been made to feel threatened by it. Even her forthrightness - and she could be quite sharp-tongued on occasion - has never, as far as I am aware, given serious offence. I suppose it must be as you say her good looks have been her undoing. He concluded by once more bursting into tears. Mulling over what he had just said, Aroma concluded that it could only mean that he suspected her. There seemed little point in protesting. She sighed. Theres One above who knows the truth of the matter but I dont suppose we shall find out who it was for a while yet. At all events, crying isnt going to help. Much better keep your spirits up and next time Her Old Ladyship is feeling cheerful, explain what has happened and ask to have Skybright back again. You only say that to humour me, said Bao-yu bitterly. According to you I am to wait until Mothers anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable opportunity arises for talking to Grandmother but what makes you think that Skybrights illness will wait that long? Ever since she came into our family as a child she has lived comfortably. She has 540 -1536 never had to experience a single day of real hardship. Sending her to that place now is like taking a potted orchid that has just started putting out its first tender spears of growth and setting it down in a pigsty. Apart from being physically ill, she must be in a terrible state mentally as well. And she has no kind parents to look after her, dont forget only that worthless cousin and his wife. I doubt shell last there a fortnight. I may not even be able to see her again. Curfew for the common people, but the Prefect can light a fire, said Aroma drily. What a fuss youd have made if Id said anything so unlucky! How can you bear to talk so glibly about her dying? It isnt unlucky to talk about what has already been fore-told, said Bao-yu. There was a portent of her coming death last spring. Oh? said Aroma in some surprise. What was that? The crabapple tree in the courtyard here only one half of it budded this year the other side seems to have died.
I think all this worrying is ruining your health. And good health is like the hill in the proverb -1227 Keep the hill green, keep the hill green, And youll never lack fuel for winter again. Besides, everyone here cares for you so. Her Old Ladyship does, Her Ladyship does, everyone does! How could Nightingale know that the mere mention of these homely names, intended to reassure and comfort, was enough to conjure up again the horror of the nightmare? Dai-yu felt her heart thumping, everything went black before her eyes, and she seemed on the point of fainting altogether. Nightingale quickly held out the spittoon while Snowgoose patted her lightly on the back. After a long while she coughed up another mouthful of phlegm. In it was a thick wriggling strand of dark red blood. The two maids were pale with fright. They stood supporting her, one on each side, until finally she slumped back, scarcely conscious. Nightingale, aware of the critical nature of her condition, looked at Snowgoose and made an urgent movement with her lips that clearly meant Go and fetch someone - quickly! Snowgoose was no sooner out of the door than she saw Kingfisher and Ebony coming towards the Naiads House, smiling as they walked along. Isnt Miss Lin up yet? inquired Kingfisher cheerfully. My mistress and Miss Tan-chun are both round at Miss Xi-chuns discussing her painting of the garden. Snowgoose hushed them both with a quick gesture. Whats the matter? they asked in alarm. Snowgoose told them all that had happened, and they shot out their tongues in horror. But thats serious! Why havent you been to tell Her Old Ladyship? What a terrible thing! How could you be so silly! I was on my way when you two arrived, replied Snowgoose. Whos that talking outside? called Nightingale from the bedroom. Miss Lin wants to know. The three of them went in together, to find Dai-yu lying wrapped up in bed. Whats all the excitement about? she asked them. Whos been telling you tales? It was Ebony who replied Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun have just gone over to Miss Xi-chuns to discuss her landscape of the garden, and they sent us here to ask you to join them, Miss Lin. Were sorry to hear that youre not well. Its nothing serious, said Dai-yu. Im just feeling a bit weak, thats all. Ill be up when Ive had a little rest. Will you tell Miss Tan-chun and Miss Xiang-yun that I should like them to come here after lunch, if theyre not too busy? I dont suppose Master Baos been over there, has he? No, Miss, came the reply. Master Bao has been going to school the last few days, continued Ebony, and the Master tests him every day, so he doesnt get a chance to romp around as he used to. Dai-yu was silent and thoughtful. The two maids stood around for a minute or two longer and then discreetly withdrew. At the Lotus Pavilion, Xi-chuns painting of Prospect Garden was being subjected to an aesthetic appraisal by Tan-chun and Xiang-yun. Too much here, not enough there, a little too thin in one place, too crowded in another. They were thinking of adding a poetry inscription, and had sent to ask for Dai-yus advice. They were busily talking when Kingfisher and Ebony came back, looking very flustered. Xiang-yun was the first to question them Why hasnt Miss Lin come with you? She had a bad relapse last night, Miss, replied King-fisher, and was up coughing most of the night. According to Snowgoose the phlegm it her spittoon was flecked with blood. Are you sure? asked Tan-chun, aghast. Quite sure, replied Kingfisher. Weve just been in to see her, Miss, said Ebony. She looks dreadful, and hardly has the strength to speak. If shes as sick as that, shes hardly likely to be able to speak, said Xiang-yun bluntly. What nonsense, Yun! Why if she couldnt speak that would mean she was ....... Tan-chun broke off in mid-sentence. Dai is a clever soul, said Xi-chun. But she does have a tendency to take everything too seriously. If only she could see beyond it all. We must go and see how she is, anyway, said Tanchun. If it is serious, wed better tell Cousin Wan and let Grannie know, so they can send for a doctor and find out what to do.
Bao-yu said nothing and gave an inane grin. They went in and sat down. When Grandmother Jia asked him a question, he could only repeat whatever Aroma said. It soon became clear to them all that so far from being his normal self, he was now little more than a halfwit. The more Grandmother Jia saw, the more it puzzled and distressed her. When I came in, she said, he seemed quite well. But I can see now that he really is seriously ill. He seems to have quite lost his wits. Will someone please tell me what has happened? Lady Wang realized that they could not keep it from her any longer. For Aromas sake, who stood there in mortal terror, she stuck to Bao-yus story and told Grandmother Jia that he had lost his jade at the Earl of Lin-ans party, whispering it all in the old ladys ear, afraid it might come as too great a shock to her. The servants have been told to look everywhere, she added. We have asked several fortune-tellers, and they all say that its in a pawnshop, so it can only be a matter of time before we find it. Grandmother Jia rose to her feet in great agitation, tears streaming down her cheeks. How could he lose such a precious thing? You are not fit to look after him! What about his father? Surely he has not washed his hands of it too? Lady Wang could see that Grandmother Jia was in a rage. She told Aroma and the others to kneel, and herself replied, with contrite face and lowered head I was afraid you would be upset, Mother, and that his father would be angry, so I still have not told him. But cant you see? cried Grandmother Jia. The jade is Bao-yus very life. Losing it is what has made him lose his wits. What are we going to do? People all over town have heard of the jade. If someone picks it up, hes hardly going to hand it in. Send someone at once to his father and ask him to come here. I must speak to him about this. Lady Wang, Aroma and all the others present were terrified of the possible consequences and entreated Grandmother Jia to relent. Imagine how angry Sir Zheng will be, Mother! Think of poor Bao-yu! For his sake, give us one last chance. We will search for all we are worth. Why should you fear his fathers wrath? I shall be here, said the old lady firmly. She told Musk to send someone for Jia Zheng. Minutes later, the message returned that he was out visiting a friend. Well, well go ahead without him, said Grandmother Jia. For the present, none of the servants is to be punished. Those are my instructions, and I shall take full responsibility. Send for Lian and tell him to write out a Notice of Reward, and post copies of it wherever Bao-yu went on the day he lost his jade. It is to say Reward for return of jade, ten thousand taels of silver. Reward for information leading to its recovery, five thousand taels. And there is to be no question of not paying up in full if someone does come forward. This is the only way we shall ever find it. If we rely on our own people, we could go on searching for the rest of our lives. Lady Wang did not dare voice her reservations about this plan of action. Jia Lian was sent for, and told to have the posters made up with all speed. Move Bao-yus things to my apartment, Grandmother Jia ordered one of the servants. I shall Only need Aroma and Ripple to wait on him. The rest can stay here and look after his apartment. Bao-yu remained silent throughout all of this, grinning inanely. Grandmother J ia took him by the hand and led him out, Aroma and the others clustering round to support him as far as the garden gate. When they reached her apartment, Grandmother Jia told Lady Wang to sit down, and herself supervised the putting in order of the inner room. When this was done, she spoke to Lady Wang You know why I have brought him over here, dont you? In the first place, there are so few people living in the garden now, and I cant help feeling theres something odd about the way those crab-trees in his courtyard died so suddenly, and then so suddenly flowered. Before now he could always rely on his jade to keep any evil influences at bay. But now that it is lost, I am afraid the evil can get in more easily. So I thought it best for him to stay here with me. He had better not go out for a few days.
